14-10-2020||News||It’s a pandemic: Go after the virus, not the vulnerable||As the global struggle to contain Covid-19 continues, and pandemic fatigue sets in, some are advocating for a so-called natural “herd immunity” strategy, which they argue can be safely achieved through “focused protection”.This concept entails fully reopening societies, while “shielding” the elderly and people with co-morbidities, in order to achieve herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine within six months. It sounds so simple, but the facts tell us otherwise.First, herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus with the use of a vaccine, not by exposing them to it.For example, herd immunity against measles requires about 95% of people to be vaccinated. Once immunised against measles, they act as a protective buffer preventing the virus from circulating and infecting the remaining 5% of the population who are unvaccinated.We are nowhere close to the levels of immunity required to stop this disease transmitting. We know from sero-epidemiology studies that less than 10% of the global population has shown evidence of infection. That means the vast majority of people are still susceptible to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. To achieve herd immunity for Sars-CoV-2, it is estimated that at least 60-to-70% of the global population – over five billion people – would need to be infected which, in the absence of a vaccine, may take years.Furthermore, as with other coronaviruses, reinfection cannot be ruled out, exposing people to disease again and again. Cases of reinfection have already been reported. Third, letting the virus spread through populations unchecked would have devastating consequences for communities and health systems. Far too many people would develop severe disease and die, hospitals would be overwhelmed with the influx of patients, particularly as flu season takes off in the Northern Hemisphere, and communities would be ravaged by the sheer number of people in need of care. We also have no idea how many people will suffer the debilitating impacts of post-Covid syndrome or “long Covid”, or for how long. Many people describe suffering from months of persistent fatigue, headaches, “brain fog” and trouble breathing. Other serious conditions from being sick with Covid-19 – such as physical and cognitive limitations, psychiatric problems and issues with the lungs, heart and brain – are being reported. Fourth, it is a mistake to believe that the virus only severely impacts older people and those with underlying conditions. Research has shown that mortality increases significantly with age, but many young people with no underlying health conditions have developed severe disease and died. At the peak of Italy’s outbreak, up to 15% of all people in intensive care were under 50. Finally, how would this theoretical “focused protection” play out in the real world? Governments are already encouraged to protect high-risk groups, as part of a raft of public health measures that are only effective when applied together. Choosing a single intervention, with disregard for the realities of local transmission, would be unwise, ineffective and deadly. As the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general has said, it is not a choice between letting the virus run free and shutting down our societies. This virus transmits mainly between close contacts and causes outbreaks that can be controlled by implementing targeted measures. Rather than wasting precious resources discriminating against high-risk groups, we should focus on going after the virus.Through robust testing and contact tracing, we can know precisely where the virus is circulating, and clamp down on it with the tried and tested public health measures we are all now familiar with, including isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts.By tailoring interventions to local contexts and targeting disease clusters, we can avoid punishing national lockdowns that are blind to variations in community transmission.By informing individuals about how they might protect themselves and their loved ones, we can reduce the disease burden.We’ve seen this approach succeed in many countries.It is hard work, but we have new and better tools than we did nine months ago. For example, we have better-trained and equipped health workers in many countries, better diagnostics and treatment options, and digital applications which help with contact tracing and patient information. Public health authorities must dialogue with the communities they serve to understand the barriers and constraints they face and try to resolve them. Governments need to shore up their health systems to enable them to service all health needs, and they must invest in developing the diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines that can help us bring this pandemic to a close. There are currently more than 200 vaccine candidates, with several in the final stage of clinical trials. We could have limited supplies of an efficacious Sars-CoV-2 vaccine available as early as next year. When that happens, we can realistically and safely strive for herd immunity. Until then, we have to outsmart this virus, by understanding where and how it spreads, and not giving it a chance to do so.Dr Soumya Swaminathan is chief scientist, WHOThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-s-a-pandemic-go-after-the-virus-not-the-vulnerable/story-pZ5bQhQXZanb6n3qcG2InM.html
14-10-2020||News||In Pakistan, a new battle takes shape | Analysis||The Pakistan army and the country’s principal opposition parties are on a collision course. Despite the army’s warning not to drag it into politics, these parties have publicly complained about its political role. The Pakistani political class has traditionally accepted the army’s political role as a given and politicians have wanted to secure its support to promote their individual interests. Now, these Opposition parties are asking the generals not to interfere in the country’s politics.The real target of the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM), which is scheduled to hold its first rally on October 16, is not Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan, though his resignation and fresh elections have been sought, but the men in khaki. This also seems to borne out by former PM and the Pakistan Muslim League(N), PML(N), leader Nawaz Sharif’s blistering attack on the army in his address to a multi-party meeting called by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on September 20.Sharif said that Pakistan was controlled by a “state above the state” which did not let any elected Pakistani PM function properly or complete his term. He criticised the manipulation of the 2018 national assembly election to foist a “selected” PM — Khan — on the country. The meeting, which decided to launch the PDM, also expressed great concern at the “establishment” (a euphemism for the army) increasing its “role” in the country’s domestic affairs and, by doing so, threatening the country’s stability and institutions. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also called for a “non-political establishment”.The Pakistan army is a professional fighting force and, at the same time, despite its denials, a political institution. It is the final decision-maker of the country’s security and foreign policies but has always, also, reserved the right to intervene in any other area of governance during civilian rule in the country.Both the army and Khan are taking PDM seriously. This is borne out by Khan alleging that opposition leaders have joined hands to save themselves from corruption charges. He has quickened the pace of investigations against PML(N) and PPP leaders. Nawaz Sharif’s brother, Shahbaz Sharif, the former chief minister of Punjab, has been jailed and former president Asif Ali Zardari has been charged for corruption.More significantly, Khan, while mounting a stout defence of the army and maintaining that the Inter-Services Intelligence is the finest service in the world, has fired the brahmastra against Nawaz Sharif; he has accused the former PM of playing India’s game in maligning the army. There is no more potent charge that can be levelled in Pakistan than colluding with the permanent enemy, India. Nawaz Sharif is in London since last November. He was then in jail but was allowed to go abroad for his medical condition was said to be critical.On its part, the army is letting Khan take the lead in battling PDM but is expectedly refuting charges of interference in governance. While addressing the cadets of the Pakistan Military Academy on October 10, army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa said: “I count it a great honour that we stand before the nation as a trusted and accountable institution”. He also emphasised “Our actions are guided by constitution and the national interest of Pakistan”.This is not the first time in Pakistan’s history that sections of its political class are seeking to take on the army. What is different now is that they are openly calling for it to be an apolitical force, as is traditional in true democracies. This goes against the grain of the army’s entrenched belief that it is the only institution that can uphold the country’s national interest, that all others are ineffective, and the political class is venal and corrupt. This thinking is reinforced by its view that India is a perpetual enemy. The army has ensured that this view of India becomes deeply entrenched among the Pakistani people. Now, even the few Pakistanis who stood for the normalisation of India-Pakistan ties have turned against India because they feel that this country has changed course after the 2019 elections.Will the PDM succeed in consolidating the substantial disillusionment against the Khan government as well as creating a sentiment for the army to confine itself only to its professional duties?The government has failed on different fronts since it assumed office. The economy continues to be in a mess and the macroeconomic targets set by IMF remain unmet. Consequently, the Fund is demanding an end to tax loopholes, increase in electricity rates and greater autonomy for regulators. These are politically almost impossible to accomplish. Pakistan’s foreign policy is under strain too. Its Kashmir policy has not yielded results and the strains with the Arab peninsular states, especially Saudi Arabia, are enormous; Turkey cannot replace the Saudi connection. There is thus material to fan discontent against the Khan government.The same will be difficult to do against the army, despite its support for Khan. Even if there is some discontent because of Bajwa’s extension, the army will close ranks to protect its role in the polity. The India factor will be used to remind the people that it is needed to protect them, especially at this time. The army’s capacity to break Opposition unity should also never be underestimated.The October 16 rally may, therefore, give an indication of both the capability of the opposition and the army’s strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-pakistan-a-new-battle-takes-shape-analysis/story-vPNU2xAA5QoR6966Km1tAL.html

14-10-2020||Chandigarh||MLA writes to Ludhiana DC, MC chief over non-functional street lights||: With residents raising hue and cry over non-functional street lights at Ferozepur Road, Malhar Road and other areas where development works are being taken up by the municipal corporation (MC) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu has written to deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal asking them to resolve the issue. Citing the upcoming festival season, the minister has sought a solution for the problem of non-functional street lights in his constituency (Ludhiana west) in two days. Also, he has sought strict action against officials responsible for the same. In the letter, Ashu has raised objections over removal of street lights from the site where development works are on. Also, he has sought information regarding the department which is responsible for ensuring that street lights are functional at Ferozepur Road and Malhar Road. A large number of street lights on the city’s main roads are lying non-functional. The issue has been raised several times, but both MC and NHAI are passing the buck. The MC has handed over the Ferozepur Road and Bus Stand Road to NHAI as an elevated road is being constructed by NHAI at this road. However, no department is taking the responsibility of repairing the street lights.Ashu said,”A large number of residents are complaining against the non-functional street lights especially at the Malhar road and Ferozepur road. The failure of authorities in repairing the street light might result in accidents. The lights should be repaired immediately and strict action should be taken against officials concerned .” Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said he has written to the MC commissioner Sabharwal and project director of NHAI to resolve the issue at the earliest so that residents should not face inconvenience especially during the festival season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mla-writes-to-ludhiana-dc-mc-chief-over-non-functional-street-lights/story-lXVdazfRhFlDGNbPRlRQyK.html

14-10-2020||Delhi||SC puts Punjab on notice on ex-DGP Saini’s plea for quashing fresh FIR in Multani case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought the Punjab government’s reply on a plea by former director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini, seeking quashing of a fresh FIR lodged against him in the 1991 case of alleged murder of junior engineer Balwant Singh Multani.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah asked the state not to “rush” in the matter and “don’t proceed any further”, while seeking its response within four weeks. The government told the top court that it would make a statement on the next date of hearing. The Punjab and Haryana high court had on September 8 dismissed Saini’s plea for quashing the case or transferring it to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). On September 15, the apex court granted him interim protection from arrest in the fresh FIR. During the hearing on Wednesday, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Saini, said that the “illegal and malicious prosecution” of his client should be stopped as one case after the other is being filed in the matter. He said Saini retired as the Punjab DGP in 2018 and the problem with such cases lay in his having lodged five criminal cases against the present chief minister of the state. “I will show how vindictive the state is in this matter. I am fighting against the state and the chief minister,” Rohatgi said, adding that during Saini’s tenure as the Chandigarh SSP in 1991, there was an attack to kill him. He said following the attack, an FIR was registered and Multani was arrested in December 1991. “It is the case of Multani’s father that his son was tortured by Saini and others and it was the case of the state then that Multani had escaped and was never found,” Rohatgi said. Rohatgi said that Multani was not seen since 1991 and when his father filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court, the state government had said that Multani had escaped from custody. He added that in May this year, an FIR was registered at the instance of Multani’s brother, as his father had died in 2014. He said there cannot be a third FIR in the same incident and even the top court had earlier held that a second FIR cannot be registered. Claiming the Punjab government has no jurisdiction in the case as the alleged torture happened in Chandigarh, which is a Union Territory, Rohatgi said the state cannot add Section 302 (murder) to the FIR without leave of trial court. HC extends interim protection till November 3The Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday extended its September 23 order, wherein the Punjab government was directed to issue a notice of seven days to former DGP Sumedh Singh Saini if the state contemplates to arrest him in a criminal case. The interim protection has been extended up to November 3, the next date of hearing. “The fresh application and the main petition (filed in 2018) will be heard together on the assigned date,” said senior advocate Vinod Ghai, who is representing Saini. The detailed order is awaited. During the hearing on Wednesday, the state government is learnt to have raised issues with regard to “maintainability” of the plea. In October 2018, the high court had denied Saini a blanket bail but asked Punjab to give him one week’s notice in case he is to be arrested in a criminal case pertaining to the period when he served in the vigilance department and other important positions thereafter. The order was extended twice, but after the Covid-19 outbreak, the plea could not be taken up. In September, Saini filed a fresh application seeking modification of the order. The September 23 order covers any FIR registered against Saini for any incident during his entire service period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-puts-punjab-on-notice-on-ex-dgp-saini-s-plea-for-quashing-fresh-fir-in-multani-case/story-tCVlZcxbI1AtbxWNQurz3N.html

At Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), as many as 121 applications were approved for admission in BCom (Hons) and 125 for BA (Hons) in Economics by Wednesday evening. The cut-off for BCom (Honours) is 99.5% and BA (Honours) in Economics is 99% at the college.College principal Simrit Kaur said very few seats will be available in the second list. “We are still processing some applications and students are yet to pay fees to complete the process. We managed to get an adequate number of applications because we had set a realistic cut-off this year,” she said.Suman Sharma, principal of Shri Ram (LSR) College, which announced a 100% cut-off for admissions to Political Science, Psychology, and Economics this year, said they received a “huge response”. “We are still processing the applications and will be able to give the admission data by Friday evening. We are expected to have seats in almost all courses in the second cut-off, except for two courses,” she said. The college received the maximum number applications for Political Science (Hons) and BSc in Mathematics.At Hindu College, more than 1,000 applications were approved by Wednesday evening and around 500 of them paid the fees and completed the process. In Ramjas, as many as 500 applications were approved by the college by 7 pm on Wednesday with the maximum students applying for Political Science (Hons) and BSc in Statistics. College principal Manoj Khanna said, “Of these 500 approved applications, 130 paid the fees to confirm admissions. We still have 300 applications to process. We already have surplus admissions in some courses including some combinations of BA (prog) and History (Hons),” he said. In Hansraj College, 277 admissions were completed in Science courses, and 293 in Commerce and Humanities, collectively, by Wednesday evening. In Miranda House, 666 applications were approved by 5 pm and 324 of them had also paid the fees. Miranda House acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said admissions in Political Science (Hons) under the unreserved category are likely to close in the second list. “At least 60 candidates have already paid fees for admissions in Political Science. The unreserved seats in Geography (Hons) are likely to get filled in the first cut-off. We will have to wait till Friday to get a clear picture,” she said.The rush was equally heavy in off-campus colleges. In Rajdhani College, 377 admissions were approved by 7 pm with unreserved seats in English (Hons) and BSc in Mathematics filled under the first cut-off. In Aurobindo College, 490 candidates have paid the fees to confirm the admissions. Principal Vipin Aggarwal said, “We have already got surplus admissions in BCom (Hons), Political Science (Hons), and some more subjects. We might not have unreserved seats in the second cut-off for many commerce and humanities courses.”Several colleges reported high rejection rates due to the online process. SRCC principal Simrit Kaur said they rejected around 160 applications in the last three days. “Students who are not meeting our cut-offs are also applying on our portal. We have no other option but to reject the applications,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-university-admissions-under-first-cut-off-closed-over-11-000-complete-process-till-wednesday/story-1bNycWxMJ6gGEv2BVY9GCP.html

A senior official in Kejriwal’s office said Rai was relieved of two portfolios in order to help him focus completely on pollution-- a problem that peaks during winter and becomes public health emergency every year. According to an order issued by the government’s general administration department (GAD) on Wednesday, the employment and labour portfolios have been taken from Rai and given to Sisodia. The change was approved by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, the order stated. “Now, Rai will focus on his responsibilities as the environment minister. The coming three months are crucial because of the problem of air pollution in winter, handling which becomes even more important now because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” the official said on condition of anonymity. Rai is now left with three portfolios: environment, forest and wildlife; development department and GAD. Sisodia, on the other hand, will have as many as 10 portfolios -- the highest among the seven ministers of the Delhi cabinet, including Kejriwal.

According to police, the couple had an 10-year-old daughter but wanted a son.“Yatbeer worked as a security guard in sector 75, and was friends with Hasmat, an auto-rickshaw driver. Hasmat said he would give ₹1.5 lakh to Yatbeer if helped him find a male child to adopt,” said a police officer who did not wish to be named.Yatbeer came up with a plan to kidnap his nephew’s son, said police. Before the alleged kidnapping, Yatbeer had also allegedly introduced him to Hasmat. Yatbeer’s nephew family lived in Sarfabad.“On September 11, Yatbeer waited for the boy’s parents to leave for work and then took the boy while he was playing outside his home. He then handed the boy over to Hasmat who took them to his rented accommodation in Greater Noida. The couple then drove to their hometown in Badaun on a motorcycle,” said Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 1.The boy’s father, Virendra, later that day registered a missinger person’s complaint with the police. “I had already gone for work when my elder daughter called me and said that my son was missing. We looked around for him for a while but when we could not find him, I called the police helpline. They also looked but there was no sign of my son after which I filed a complaint with sector 49 police,” said Virendra.“Yatbeer accompanied the family during the entire investigation going as far as to even questioning us about the developments. It was through manual surveillance and call detail records that his role in the kidnapping was found. After he was questioned, the whole incident came to light,” said the DCP.On Wednesday, Yatbeer was arrested from Sarfabad, while Hasnat was nabbed from the Haldoni crossing in Greater Noida. His wife was found at their house in Badaun from where the boy was also rescued.

The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order regarding retrofitting gensets is being openly disregarded by the Haryana government. Year after year, the Haryana government is making excuses to disregard Epca’s directions and refuses to ban gensets,” AAP’s national spokesperson of Raghav Chadha said at a press conference.He said, “The Haryana government’s contempt for the health of Delhi residents and the Epca should be dealt with an iron fist and strong action should be taken against them. Why should Delhi pay for the Haryana government’s negligence? This can’t be excused.”On October 8, the Epca told the Haryana government that the graded action response plan, which prohibits the use of diesel generator sets, will be applicable from October 15. The Haryana government had on Monday written to Epca, saying Gurgaon and Faridabad would face a power crisis if diesel generator sets are banned. The Epca so far has refused to step back on the issue and asserted that the action plan – aimed at preventing winter pollution in Delhi-NCR – will come into force. Vipul Goel, former cabinet minister in the Haryana government, who held the environment portfolio from 2014 to 2019, said, “Firstly, all heavy-duty gensets above 1000KvA are already fitted with emission-control equipment at the time of manufacture. If you want to blame smaller gensets, then Delhi should fix the issue within its boundaries instead of blaming us. Gurugram and Faridabad don’t use half the number of small generators that Delhi does in its markets and residential colonies.” Goel said the Haryana government has every intention to abide by Epca’s orders, and will work proactively to ensure permanent and uninterrupted electricity connections are granted to industries so that their output is not impacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-flouting-epca-diesel-genset-ban-alleges-aap/story-FiEY2frEMhgkhuIpEE0lEL.html

They would then create a fake Aadhar card in the name of the property owner and even fake property documents, and submit these before the court when an accused needed surety,” the police commissioner said.“They charged anywhere between ₹15, 000 to ₹20,000 depending on the case,” added Sameer Verma, ADCP Zone 3.The accused have been identified as Harpal Singh alias Manoj Kumar, a resident of Phullawal village, Rahul Kumar, also from Phullawal, and Navdeep Singh from Guru Nanakpura, Civil Lines, and Harwinder Singh of Talwandi Noawad village.The racket surfaced when police observed that there was a rise in the number of accused jumping bail. Subsequent warrants issued against them revealed that wrong addresses had been furnished to acquire the bail. The matter was brought to the notice of police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, who then directed the local police to probe the matter.

The objective of the award is to encourage RWAs for doing their bit to make the city a cleaner place to live in, officials said. A BIS team had conducted inspection of the waste handling work done by the RWAs and subsequently selected three winners. The Noida authority had in September 2017 signed a memorandum of understanding with BIS that works under the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution. The BIS team assessed and finalized winners for the ‘Solid Waste Management Quality Award 2018-19’ on the basis of their performance in the solid waste treatment category. Sector 34 federation of RWAs secured first place with ₹1.5 lakh prize money, second position (with ₹1 lakh prize money) went to Sector 47 RWA, and third winner Sector 30 RWA got ₹75,000, said the officials. “Our team conducted an inspection, made an assessment and then selected three winners. The objective is to encourage all RWAs and socially active residents so that they work better in waste treatment and make the city cleaner,” said BK Sinha, a scientist and senior official with BIS.The officials said that all three RWAs were making compost out of waste generated at their campus.“We collected all kinds of waste at our community centre, segregating the same and making compost out of it. We did not send any waste to landfill site. And we were using the compost in our parks and green belts in our sector. By doing so, we not only saved money spent on buying compost for green areas, but also made the authority’s work easier that make efforts for waste collection and treatment,” said Dharmendra Sharma, general secretary of Sector 34 federation of RWAs.Sector 34 made compost by putting the food and other waste at pits at the community centre. “But now we have, with the help of the authority, set up a biogas plant that is making compost out of waste and also biogas to be used in our community centre,” said Sharma, who is leading the ‘waste to compost’ project.Officials of the Noida authority could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-rwas-get-central-govt-award-for-handling-solid-waste/story-VqsOhGUo3mtaiHoJCJzg7I.html
14-10-2020||Noida||GB Nagar DM to meet school representatives today over re-opening classes 9 to 12||Allaying fears of parents, the Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate on Wednesday said that no student would be compelled to go to school. The Uttar Pradesh government, following central government guidelines, allowed schools to open from Wednesday for students of classes 9 to 12, almost seven months after they were shut following the coronavirus disease induced lockdown. The re-opening, however, will be subject to safety protocols put in place at schools.District magistrate Suhas LY on Wednesday said that he has scheduled a video conference meeting with school principals and school representatives to discuss the issue on Thursday. “We are creating a standard operating procedure to be followed by all schools and children once the school reopens. The issue will be discussed in detail in the meeting. The students will not be compelled to join the offline classes if they do not want,” he said. Yatendra Kasana, president Gautam Budh Nagar parents’ association, said they were against physical classes. “We have read in news that some developed countries reopened their schools and coronavirus cases started increasing again. They had to shut the schools again. We should not take the decision in a haste as this can put the students at risk,” he said. Kasana said that he conducted a survey of 250 parents and 80% of they were not in favour of sending their children to schools. Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1 in Greater Noida, said that a private school had sent an email to him a few days ago asking if he would sent the children to school. “I replied in the negative. We are not comfortable sending the children to school. The government should wait till vaccine is developed,” he said. “The schools should leave it to the discretion of parents or students whether to attend schools or not. I am uncomfortable sending my kids to school in the present scenario. Attendance should not be made compulsory, “ said Sector 137 resident Gaurav Kumar Seth, whose son and daughter study in Class X. “We have got intimation from school that they will stop online classes from October 19 which is a cause of concern for me,” he said. On September 30, 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs had issued an order to reopen activities in areas outside containment zones. The MHA guideline stated that the state government may take a decision in respect of reopening of schools and coaching institutions after October 15 in a graded manner. It further stated that the students may attend the schools/ institutions only with the written consent of parents and the attendance must not be enforced, and must depend entirely on parents. The Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday announced reopening of schools from October 19 for students of classes 9-12 in two shifts. In the first shift, students of classes 9 and 10 may come to school, while in the second shift, students of Classes 11 and 12 may attend classes. A maximum of 50 per cent students should be called in a day and remaining 50 per cent the following day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-dm-to-meet-school-representatives-today-over-re-opening-classes-9-to-12/story-5EyvRIjN2lALBK0mcWz55I.html
14-10-2020||Noida||Work on loop to connect Yamuna Expressway with Eastern Peripheral Expressway delayed||The work on a cloverleaf interchange loop that, once completed, would have seamlessly connected Yamuna Expressway with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) has been delayed for want of land.The loop is to be built on 57 hectares and the land for the project was to be given by Yamuna Expressway Development Authority (Yeida) and Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL). There has been a delay as the debt-ridden developer company is being taken over by the state owned NBCC Limited following a Supreme Court order. The Yeida was to provide 22 hectares and JIL the remaining land, said officials.The loop is a crucial project as it would also provide direct connectivity from the upcoming Jewar airport to Delhi-NCR via the EPE. In the absence of the loop, the motorists from Noida, Greater Noida and Delhi face inconvenience in reaching Eastern Peripheral Expressway as they have to travel through many congested villages such as Kasna and Ghangola. This loop will immensely benefit motorists and offer smooth ride to thousands of commuters, who use 165km Yamuna Expressway and EPE.The Yeida was scheduled to start work on the loop, to be built at a cost of ₹83.94 crore, by July 2019. The authority, in June 2019, had issued a tender and hired a contractor for the project. It had fixed deadline of 18 months for the project from the day the work starts on the ground. But work did not start at the site as JIL is yet to hand over the land for the project. “Following a Supreme Court order and also an order from the National Company Law Tribunal, the management of Jaypee Infratech Limited is being transferred to NBCC Limited, which will now hand over the land for the project. We hope that it will happen soon so that the work on the loop can start,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida .The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which has built the 135km EPE, could not construct the loop earlier because of land issues. The NHAI will fund the project and Yeida will construct the entry and exit to connect two important expressways. The EPE passes above the 165km Yamuna Expressway, near the Noida International University and Galgotia University campus.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on May 31, 2018, opened the 135km Eastern Peripheral Expressway with an aim to decongest Delhi roads and reduce air pollution caused due to vehicular emissions. The NHAI had constructed the EPE on the periphery of Delhi-NCR. A 22km stretch of the 135km expressway falls in Gautam Budh Nagar, passing through 39 villages in the district. However, for the past one year, commuters have to go through Kasna to reach the EPE and Kasna often witnesses heavy traffic congestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/work-on-loop-to-connect-yamuna-expressway-with-eastern-peripheral-expressway-delayed/story-FEl828jvy2QPG6LktuT9yM.html

14-10-2020||Noida||GBU made affiliate university for non-technical courses in Noida, Ghaziabad||The Uttar Pradesh government has announced that it will make Gautam Buddha University (GBU), an affiliate university for non-technical courses. The move, experts believed, is aimed at trying to contain the workload of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, which affiliates most of colleges in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad. Prof Bhagwati Prakash Sharma, vice chancellor of GBU, said that he had received information that the government had made GBU an affiliate university. “The GBU will affiliate all non-technical programmes at Gautam Budh Nagar-based colleges from the next academic session. Lucknow-based Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University (APJAKTU) will continue to affiliate programmes like B-Tech, MBA, MCA,” he said. The GBU will provide affiliation for programmes in humanities, law, journalism, fine arts, education, social sciences, Buddhism studies. The V-C said that the Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, will continue providing degrees to students who are already enrolled and are pursuing their programme. “The UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has decided to make GBU an affiliate university to promote quality education and streamline administrative works in academics. The chief minister has also decided to make GBU a Centre of Excellence in the field of Buddhism Studies,” office of UP CM tweeted on Tuesday evening. The GBU, came into existence in 2008 and is spread over 455 acres of green campus. The varsity has 4500 students and 500 faculty members, including 250 guest faculties. Noida Authority and Greater Noida Authority have been funding the university since it started operation. V-C Sharma said that the University is trying to become self-funded. “We have stopped taking grants from authorities since April 2019. The new move will further strengthen us to become self supported,” he said. The GBU is yet to figure out the total number of students, programmes and colleges for the affiliation. “In a meeting with government officials two weeks ago, we had proposed for affiliation of GB Nagar based colleges. We have not received any information about offering affiliation to colleges in Ghaziabad or other neighbouring district,” Sharma said. GBU is known for its unique integrated programmes for bachelors and masters degree. Its School of Management offers a dual degree programme BBA-MBA, and also B.Com (hons.), B.Sc. (Hotel Mgmt.), MBA, etc. The School of Information and Communication Technology offers five year integrated programmes in B.Tech-M.Tech; B.Tech; BCA; M.Tech; MCA. Similarly, the School of Engineering offers B.Tech; B.Arch; Dual Degree B.Tech.-M.Tech; M.Tech; M.Arch, etc. The University also has schools of Vocational Studies and Applied Sciences; Humanities and Social Sciences; Buddhist Studies and Civilization; Law, Justice & Governance, etc.Arvind Kumar Singh, director International Affairs, GBU, said that the University has over 100 International students from Vietnam, South Korea, China, Myanmar, Mongolia, Cambodia, Thailand, Yemen, Nepal, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, and Bangladesh. This year the university has completed admissions in most of the courses through online entrance examination. The university is seeking applications till October 31 in courses, where some seats are still vacant. Dr H Chaturvedi, director of Greater Noida-based BIMTECH, said that GBU becoming an affiliating university is a good move. “Due to the upcoming Jewar airport, a number industries will come up and offer job opportunities in the future. GBU should devise a mechanism and run job oriented programmes in its affiliated colleges. There is need to just channelize the existing infrastructure in a suitable way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gbu-made-affiliate-university-for-non-technical-courses-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-zp8WFxTvy2uFyFNyXdJsON.html

Police said that they also scanned dozens of CCTV footage and came across two in which the Panchal was seen entering woman’s house, while the other showed two men carrying a body from the house and putting it in the auto of Younis Khan, while it was still dark. Khan was arrested on Wednesday night from Mohan Nagar.Police said that apart from Khan, Bunty and Kamal, there was another man, yet to be identified, who helped them dump the body at Sahibabad industrial area. “Several teams are working to nab the suspects and they will be arrested soon,” Kumar, added. The initial FIR in the case was lodged for kidnapping but the IPC sections for murder and destruction of evidence were levied after the post mortem on Tuesday revealed that the deceased was strangulated. The police said that they will also levy IPC section 120B (criminal conspiracy). Panchal had a cable manufacturing factory at Rajendra Nagar industrial area and left his office at around 1pm on Monday and went missing thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/extortion-threat-ends-in-owner-s-murder-35-year-old-woman-arrested/story-taDIWwkaCGRvOu82WWKQyH.html

The Ghaziabad district magistrate, Ajay Shankar Pandey, has directed the officials to be regular with checking of such instances and ensure that preventive measures are also taken up. HT had reported on Tuesday about the instance of stubble burning at Kushaliya. The daily had also shared some pictures of the incident with the district administration officials. Following that, the DM sent some officials for verification at the site and found that the instance of stubble burning had actually taken place, officials said. “In connection with the incident, I have suspended a lekhpal on account of lax supervision and also ordered for an FIR against the erring persons. I have also directed the agriculture department officials to be more proactive in approach and remain mobile in areas having farms so that such incidents are not repeated,” Pandey said. “Instead of enforcement, we are focusing more on preventive measures so that such incidents do not take place. I have directed officials for making announcements in villages and also to take up wall paintings so that farm owners keep informed about not to burn stubble. We have also asked officials to collect stubble and sent it to Gaushalas,” he added. According to the officials, the district magistrate sent sub-divisional magistrate to the spot at Kushaliya who found that farm is owned by different set of people while another person was entrusted for cultivation of crop. On the basis of the report received from the SDM, an FIR was filed under IPC sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health), 290 (punishment for public nuisance) and 291 (continuance of nuisance) at Masuri police station. “We have registered the FIR and have also asked our local police post in-charge to remain alert about such incidents so that they are not repeated,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). Pandey said that all the measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which is coming into effect from October 15, will be implemented. “All the respective agencies have been asked to remain alert and take up pollution abatement measures in their respective jurisdictions. The UP Pollution Control Board officials will also keep a check and recommend penalty in case they find erring instances,” the DM said. Meanwhile, according to the Central Pollution Control Board figures on Wednesday, the air quality index in Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida stood at 291, 286 and 273, respectively, all falling under the ‘poor’ category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. “A meeting regarding GRAP was also taken on Wednesday by the divisional commissioner (Meerut) and she has directed all the departments to remain vigilant and ensure that pollution abatement measures are taken up on continuous basis,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/stubble-burning-at-kushaliya-dm-suspends-lekhpal-directs-for-fir/story-5QmAyYKhvRdXK8IksrpP3M.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||Contractors gather in Gurugram over pending payments from MLA’s firm||As many as 15 contractors from different parts of the country gathered in Gurugram on Wednesday and alleged that a construction company, owned by a sitting Haryana legislator from Meham, had duped them of crores of rupees. A police case in this matter was registered in the city last week against member of legislative assembly (MLA) Balraj Kundu for allegedly not paying dues of around Rs 14 crore to a contractor.Gurugram resident Parivartan Singh, who lodged the complaint against the MLA, said that he had taken the sub-contract of road construction in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh from KCC Buildcon, a company owned by Kundu, which had managed to bag the contract in Madhya Pradesh in 2017.“KCC Buildcon subcontracted the work of around Rs 75 crore to my company and I spent around Rs 41 crore on this work but was paid only Rs 28 crore. Despite repeated requests, the remaining payment was not made and after exhausting all options, I terminated the contract but later they agreed to settle the matter. Despite the promises, no payment was made and I had to approach the police in July 2019, but the case was registered only last week,” said Parivartan Singh, owner of Parivartan Buildtech.Sanjay Jain, a contractor who was addressing the media along with Singh and other contractors, said that his construction equipment was hired by KCC through a sister company, but they refused to make payment of Rs 75 lakh despite repeated complaints. “The authorities in MP did not pay heed to our complaints as we are based in NCR. We just want our dues to be paid,” he said.When asked about the allegations, MLA Balraj Kundu, who is the founder and chairman of KCC Buildcon according to the company website, said that the matter was politically motivated. “This is just a political conspiracy,” he said.However, the contractors said that a majority of them were from outside the state and not concerned with politics. “We are businessmen and have no connection with politics. We just want our money back,” said Devender Singh, who hails from Gwalior.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/contractors-gather-in-gurugram-over-pending-payments-from-mla-s-firm/story-xsrmnp0uaFF6rA49A6w4lM.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram condominiums seek exemption from genset ban||Confusion reigned among residents of group housing societies, which depend on diesel gensets for electricity, over a blanket ban on diesel generators imposed by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) from Thursday.Residents said that they have neither received any notice nor direction from government authorities, and were not aware as to how this ban will be enforced. Residents said they are hoping for relief from the EPCA, as given over the last few years.Pradip Rahi, president, Atrium Condominium Welfare Association in Ramprastha City, said that they received a message on Tuesday regarding the ban on gensets from the maintenance agency. However, the residents of the society have opposed it.“The situation is not clear on this ban and it will hamper the lives of residents badly. It was the prerogative of the developer and DHBVN {Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam} to get regular power connection,” he said, adding that they have written to the EPCA on Wednesday, seeking relief in this matter.Pravin Malik, president, Sare Homes residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that officials of the pollution department also remained unclear on the enforcement of the ban on diesel gensets. “We don’t know what we have to do and how the ban will be implemented. The residents want us to reach out to the EPCA,” he said.Officials of the DHBVN, meanwhile, said that the ban on gensets is likely to impact only those condominiums which don’t have a power connection and solely depend on generators for electricity. “The projects where developers have not taken adequate load will also be partially impacted, but these are few. There are only 25 to 26 projects which are likely to get affected due to this ban,” a senior DHBVN official said.The DHBVN has also submitted a status report to the EPCA stating that around 26 projects, which either don’t have regular connections or had lesser-than-required load would be majorly affected by the genset ban. Officials said that there are around 60 more projects that would be partially impacted by the ban as they depend on standby power from generators, but the impact would be minimal, they added.Joginder Hooda, superintending engineer, DHBVN, Gurugram, said that power availability is adequate and field teams have been deployed to correct faults. “We are ready to give connections also, but developers must comply with requirements,” he said, adding that despite being given exemptions last year, developers have not met the conditions so far.The state pollution department, meanwhile, said that no directions regarding any exemption or relief to condominiums has been issued by EPCA and that the ban will be imposed strictly.Kuldeep Singh, the regional officer of HSPCB for Gurugram, said that civic agencies will enforce the ban in their jurisdictions. “The ban on diesel gensets will be imposed in Gurugram as directed by the authority. Civic agencies such as HSVP, MCG, HSIIDC, GMDA and others will be implementing the ban in their jurisdictions,” he said, warning violators of strict action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-condominiums-seek-exemption-from-genset-ban/story-DrGyNTrLsilDkRJ5VHUVcN.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||Grap comes into play, no diesel genset exemption for Gurugram||Measures to curb pollution in the city during winter, under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), will come into force today. In a first, there will be a blanket ban on diesel gensets, said officials, with no exemptions except for essential services detailed by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA).In a letter to the chief secretary, Haryana, on Wednesday, EPCA chairman Bhure Lal mentioned that diesel gensets can only be used in hospitals and nursing homes, for elevators and escalators, by railway, metro, bus and airport services until Grap is in place. “You are requested to issue directions to implementing agencies to ensure enforcement of DG set ban except for above cited reasons... Sincere efforts must be made to ensure that the ban is effective and monitored rigorously.”Several housing complexes and condominiums across Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Panipat and Bahadurgarh districts are reliant on diesel gensets for electricity, in the absence of power connections from the state agency, and also power backup. Besides, industries are also reliant on power backup to ensure continuous production.While neither the Haryana state government nor the district administration of Gurugram issued any order till late Wednesday specifically addressing the ban on diesel gensets, officials of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) said it will most definitely be implemented, with regional officers assigned the responsibility for enforcement. A spokesperson for EPCA said, “We are a regulatory body. We have drawn up the plan and laid out of the mandate, but it is up to the state government to ensure that diesel gensets are not allowed to operate, in addition to other directions given by EPCA. What instrument they choose to use to surveil for violations, and enforce the mandate, is entirely up to them.” Kuldeep SIngh, HSPCB’s regional officer for Gurugram, said, “We have assigned five assistant environmental engineers as team leads, who will conduct site inspections of construction sites, condominiums, commercial complexes and so on, starting this week. If we find any DG set running, we will take appropriate action against the violator.” First drafted in 2016 by EPCA, and then implemented in 2017, the Grap prescribes four sets of measures, depending on the severity of air pollution. Every year on October 15, the measures for ‘poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality come into play. However, due to the inadequacy of the power department’s infrastructure to supply uninterrupted power to satellite towns in the National Capital Region (NCR), EPCA had until last year exempted Gurugram (and other NCR districts) from the ban on diesel gensets. In Delhi, on the other hand, the ban has been implemented every year, with the Delhi Pollution Control Committee taking the reigns on enforcement.However, this year, the order, which followed a meeting of the HSPCB with Bhure Lal, chairman of EPCA, on September 28, mentions clearly that diesel generator use will have to be regulated during winter. The Grap measures will be in force till March 15. S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, said, “As early as two weeks ago, we wrote to the deputy commissioners of these five districts, outlining very clearly the role each department will have to play.” He added, “While our regional officers in each district will be tasked with surveillance and taking punitive action, the power department will have as much of a role in ensuring the ban’s success.”KC Agarwal, chief engineer, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, confirmed this, saying, “We have been instructed by the HSPCB to ensure 24x7 electricity supply across the grid, which we will endeavour to do, particularly as many people will be working from home due to Covid-19. Any household or establishment eligible for a permanent electricity connection will receive one, but enforcing the ban on DG sets directly is not something we have been tasked with.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/grap-comes-into-play-no-diesel-genset-exemption-for-gurugram/story-3lkbG16JPibUS2mOvtoLMM.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||Regular sessions for senior students in government schools to start from today||Regular sessions for students of classes 9 to 12 of government schools will resume from Thursday. As reported by HT on Wednesday, state education minister confirmed that schools will run for three hours, from 9am to noon. Attendance, however, will not be compulsory as students who miss the class catch up through online sessions. School principals on Wednesday said that they have not received any notification from the state regarding the matter but they have been verbally told by the officials of the district education department to run the regular classes. A senior official from the district education department who preferred not to be named, said, “Teachers and principals have been told to follow the guidelines issued by union ministry of home affairs for reopening of schools. For regular classes, teachers have been advised to focus on students who are not actively taking online classes as they lack smartphones or computers.” Officials of the district administration that issues the standard operating procedures for unlocking did not respond on the matter on Wednesday.According to the education department official, once the classes resume, schools will get better idea in setting up their time tables for regular and online classes. “A proper time table will be prepared from tomorrow onwards after we take note of the response. It is likely that not too many children would turn up on the first day, but from Monday onwards, we expect the numbers to increase,” Sunil Kumar, principal of Senior Secondary Government School, Jacobpura. According to him, necessary safety arrangements have been made to prevent students from catching Covid-19 infectionThe official also said that the admission timeline for classes 9 to 12 has also been extended. The date of new admissions in government schools for classes 9 and 11 has been extended up to December 31, while for classes 10 and 12, it has been extended till October 31.Board students can also change their optional subjects till October 30||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/regular-sessions-for-senior-students-in-government-schools-to-start-from-today/story-zrCY0AKWKY422LjKJuSwEI.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||Movie theatres set to open in Gurugram today||Movie theatres in the city will reopen from Thursday, seven months after the government ordered them to shut to contain the spread of Covid-19. Following the issuance of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) by the union ministry of information and broadcasting, multiplexes in the city were seen on Wednesday making arrangements to ensure social distancing.Owners of movie theatres said that ticketing will be made completely paperless and, for the first few weeks, they would screen movies released earlier.On October 1, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri had issued the Unlock 5 guidelines, allowing movie theatres and multiplexes to open with 50% of their seating capacity. As per the guidelines of the union ministry of home affairs, such establishments can open only in areas outside the containment zones. There are 39 movie theatres in the city, including multiplexes and single-screen theatres. Although Khatri did not respond to calls seeking comment on the matter on Wednesday, representatives of cinema halls said that they will be operating as per the government norms, ensuring that physical distancing is maintained — from the ticket collection to entry inside the auditorium. A representative from PVR Cinemas confirmed the multiplex will open in Gurugram on Thursday. The screening of films will, however, start from Friday with Hindi, regional, and English movies released earlier this year.Sanjay Barjatiya, regional head, North India, Miraj Cinema at Metropolis Mall, said that they will be running four shows initially. To avoid overcrowding at the box office, Barjatiya said, “We are opting for paperless ticketing system whereby once the payment has been made at the box office through card, ticket will be sent through an SMS.” PVR Cinemas too in their official statement said that contactless payments through digital wallets will be encouraged. A QR code ticket scanner will be placed at every entrance of a theatre.” Changes have been made inside the auditorium as well. According to the PVR representative,the seating arrangements have been made in such a manner that there will be one seat gap before and after each booking. Couple, family or groups would be seated together with an empty seat on either side of the booking. On the other hand, in the premium auditoriums, no seat will be left vacant since there is already a gap between the recliner seats. Barjatiya, however, said that they will be keeping every alternate seat vacant even if there are couples, families or groups. “We will be practising this seating arrangement for some time. Every alternate seat that will be kept vacant has been clearly market,” he said. Since the guidelines do not allow delivery of food and beverages inside the auditorium, Barjatiya said, “To ensure that there is no overcrowding at the food section, we have placed QR bar codes behind every seat. People will have to scan the code and place their food order, mentioning their seat number. They will have to come outside the auditorium to pick up their order.” Similar practice has been adopted by PVR as well. Barjatiya said that all the staff members of the multiplex have been tested for Covid-19. Besides, floor stickers will be placed to maintain a gap while entering the auditorium, duration of the intermission would also be extended to avoid crowding. Finally after the show is over, people will have to exit in a row-wise manner, maintaining physical distance. Bhanu Pratap Singh, who looks after the management of Raj Cinemas in Sector 14, one of the few single-screen theatres in the city, said, “Footfall will be relatively higher on Friday and the weekend. All arrangements for social distancing have been made. Posters will be pasted to encourage people for wearing mask when they enter the auditorium.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/movie-theatres-set-to-open-in-gurugram-today/story-ztv4rJoQErHLXJgKPKp7jP.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||GMDA preparing a list of vacant plots for converting them into parking spaces||To put an end to parking problems in the city, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has started preparing a list of vacant plots in the city that can be converted into parking lots. Last week, the GMDA directed the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), Public Works Department (PWD), Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), and Haryana Shahri Vikas Prahikaran (HSVP) to start surveying vacant public lands in their respective jurisdictions with the aim of converting them into parking spaces.Parking continues to be a major issue in Gurugram as there are only 44-sanctioned parking lots, in addition to a solitary multi-level facility. As per officials privy to the matter, in the pilot phase, a vacant land near Sadar Bazaar and the Mini Secretariat building is being identified on a priority basis so that it can be converted into a parking space. For the remaining areas, a Geographical Information Survey (GIS) mapping will be carried out to ascertain the total number of available parking spaces. Vinay Pratap Singh, who is the additional chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA and the commissioner of MCG, had passed this direction to the departments concerned.“Parking continues to remain a problem in Gurugram. Therefore to increase available parking spaces, departments have been directed to identify vacant plots and convert them into make-shift parking spaces. This will also prove to be beneficial for the owners of the plots as this will curb the problem of illegal encroachments,” said Singh.He added that once the data on vacant plots from all departments has been consolidated, guidelines on parking fares, basic safety parameters would be decided upon. Further, with the help of GIS mapping, such parking spaces will be linked to GMDA’s OneMap Gurugram portal so that residents can get real-time information on the nearest parking space and the total number of spots available. Coincidentally, the MCG had introduced a similar policy in March 2018 as well. At the behest of the civic body, an aerial survey was carried out by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) that resulted in more than 150 vacant plots being identified across the city. However, no further action was taken by the MCG after the completion of the survey.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said that the GMDA should also think of converting vacant private lands for parking purposes and create a policy in this regard so that the total number of parking spaces can be increased substantially.“It is important to consider private vacant land for parking purposes.GMDA should introduce a policy that can allow change of land use with ease. This way, more parking spaces can be created. Additionally, the authority needs to ensure that there is a clear distinction between normal vacant plots and GMDA-sanctioned plots being used for parking, so as to ensure that residents inadvertently don’t park in the former,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-preparing-a-list-of-vacant-plots-for-converting-them-into-parking-spaces/story-PJa4cmdD1nRSzxnsv5aGKP.html

14-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram sees three consecutive days of ‘poor’ air||With a reading of 279 on the CPCB’s (Central Pollution Control Board) air quality index (AQI), the city saw its third consecutive day of ‘poor’ quality air on Wednesday. This marks the longest spate of unfavourable air quality in Gurugram in at least the last two months, as per the CPCB data. Earlier on Monday, the air quality in Gurugram entered the ‘poor’ category for the first time this season, with an AQI reading of 269. On Tuesday, it jumped to 288. With wind speeds remaining slow on Wednesday (not exceeding more than 10kmph) and with temperature continuing to drop (by half a degree Celsius), officials and experts said that pollutants from local emissions sources are continuing to accumulate in Gurugram’s atmosphere, with little opportunity for dispersal.“As we have clarified earlier this week, the current state of pollution is not due to stubble burning. Rather it is because of human activities within Gurugram itself, which is being exacerbated due to environmental factors, such as the lack of wind, rain and heat. We can hope for some relief if the provisions of the Graded Response Action Plan(Grap) are implemented effectively from Thursday,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB.This view was also supported by the ministry of earth sciences air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, which on Wednesday stated, “Winds are likely to be coming from east direction of Delhi because of which impact of contribution from stubble fires will be minimal.”Experts are of the opinion that the current spate of ‘poor’ air will continue, especially because the wind speeds have not shown any significant increase. “Even though wind speeds did improve to almost 10 kilometers per hour Wednesday in some parts of Delhi-NCR, pollutants were not dispersed. Temperature has continued to fall, and will do so steadily for another few days, resulting in lower ‘mixing heights’ of pollutants,” explained Sachin Panwar, a city-based air independent air-quality scientist.With stagnant wind conditions resulting in less diffusion of pollutants, Panwar said that conditions may, in fact, worsen before the week is over. As per a CPCB forecast, Gurugram is likely to have air quality in the upper end of the ‘poor’ category till at least Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-sees-three-consecutive-days-of-poor-air/story-hILJP6eLpnVDQTh1nrTz2J.html
14-10-2020||Gurugram||New Covid-19 hot spots emerge in Gurugram||Covid-19 cases in the district are now being reported from the new hot spots, according to the data available with the district health department. These new hot spots include areas such as Feroze Gandhi Colony, Manesar, Farrukhnagar and Rajender Park, which, until the last week of September, were not showing peak numbers in terms of active cases. Presently, the district is reporting 260 new Covid -19 cases on a daily average for the last one week. Officials said that a large proportion of the new cases are being from these hot spots, although they refused to share as to what percentage of the new cases is being reported from these new hot spots. Data compiled by the district health department between October 4 and 10 shows that the urban primary health centres (UPHCs) of Feroze Gandhi Colony showed the highest positivity rate of almost 21% in the district, followed by 17% positivity rate in Manesar, 15% in Farrukhnagar, 14% in Patel Nagar and almost 11% in Rajendra Park. Feroze Gandhi Colony, Patel Nagar and Rajendra Park UPHCs mostly cover densely populated areas within Gurugram block, while Farrukhnagar is mostly a rural region. Manesar, on the other hand, is an industrial belt.According to the health officials, the positivity rate is based on the number of samples tested positive for the Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test conducted in the government labs. Notably, the RT-PCR lab in Civil Hospital Sector 10 has been conducting more than 1,000 Covid-19 tests a day. These emerging hotspots have replaced some of the earlier worst-affected areas like Tigra, Chanderlok, Wazirabad, Patel Nagar, and Laxman Vihar, which had the highest number of cases over the last two months. The health officials, however, refused to share their positivity rates but said that in these areas new Covid-19 cases have come down when compared to the new hot spots. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Hot spot mapping varies every week based on which new areas emerge. Since we are in the unlock phase, cases are being reported from all areas. With the help of Aarogya Setu application and contact tracing of suspected cases, hot spots are automatically marked on the GPS systems based on which we hold our testing camps.”According to Yadav, continuous sampling and testing are being conducted in emerging Covid-19 hot spots. This exercise will continue till the positivity rate comes down to at least 7%. At present, the average positivity rate of the district is 7.5%. “The department has been retaining the overall testing in the district to an average of 3,000 per day. It largely includes RT-PCR tests. Due to the intensive sampling in the district and a steady trickle of new Covid-19 cases, between 250-260 on average, have put the Covid-19 trajectory of the district on a plateau at present. The number of active cases is fluctuating between 2,300-2,400, while the hospitalisation is varying between 150-170 patients.” On Wednesday, the district reported 269 new cases of Covid-19. The total count has reached 24,320, of which 2,327 are active cases, while 21,805 have recovered from the illness. The Covid-19 toll stands at 188, with one new death being confirmed on Wednesday. Out of total number of deaths, 136 patients had co-morbidity issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/new-covid-19-hot-spots-emerge-in-gurugram/story-B2s23lTw1bHQlZ3oGvgw9J.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Court grants bail to three more in north-east Delhi riots cases||A Delhi court has granted bail to three men in two separate cases related to the north-east Delhi riots, including a man who was arrested in connection with the alleged vandalism of a temple during the communal violence in February. The riots had left 53 dead and over 400 injured.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, on Tuesday, while granting bail to Gulfam, who stands accused in the temple vandalism case, said besides Gufam’s disclosure statement, there was nothing on record to connect him with the alleged crime. The court granted him bail on a bond of ₹20,000.Gulfam was lodged in Mandoli jail after he was arrested in the other case earlier. He has already been granted bail in that case. The court said there was no CCTV footage available on record to corroborate the prosecution’s case about his involvement in the vandalism.“Besides his own disclosure statement, prima facie, there is nothing on record to connect the applicant (Gulfam) with the commission of crime. Admittedly, the applicant has neither been named in the present FIR nor are there specific allegations against him. There is no CCTV footage available on record to corroborate the prosecution’s case,” the court said, while adding that there is no independent eyewitness corroboration of the incident either.“The applicant cannot be incarcerated for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” Yadav said.The judge later also granted bail to Rashid Saifi and Mohd Shadab in another riots-related case, saying they have not been named in the FIR; nor are there any specific allegations against them.The accused were arrested for allegedly looting, vandalising and torching a shop in Dayalpur area during the riots.Yadav said identification of Saifi and Shadab by beat Constable Gyan Singh was hardly of any consequence as the court was unable to understand why Singh had waited till March 3 to name the accused when he had categorically seen them resorting to looting and vandalism on February 25.“Being a police official, what stopped him from reporting the matter then and there at the police station or to bring the same to the knowledge of higher police officers? This casts a serious doubt on the credibility of this witness,” Yadav said in his order passed on October 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-grants-bail-to-three-more-in-north-east-delhi-riots-cases/story-PneLdfHzDAqxash2sHFKqJ.html
14-10-2020||City||Punjabi song launched to deter farmers from burning stubble||MLA Gill constituency Kuldeep Singh Vaid and Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma have found a novel way for educating farmers about the ill-effects of paddy stubble/straw burning on the environment by releasing a Punjabi song.The song has been penned by Professor Gurbhajan Singh Gill and sung by Fatehgarh Sahib-based singer Ram Singh Albela while the music was given by Raju Dhiman.MLA Vaid and DC also flagged off 11 awareness vans, which will go village to village playing the song to encourage farmers to abstain from burning paddy straw.

They said they would not be able to continue with their academic work if their registration is not allowed.The counsels told the court that on March 19, a notice was issued by JNU asking students to vacate the hostel rooms and now they were not allowed to access hostel rooms to carry out their academic work. They said the university is also asking them to pay hostel and mess fee for the months when the two students were not in residence at the JNU hostel -- i.e, from April to August.The counsels said the decision to charge mess fee is arbitrary in nature and claimed that the act is illegal and contrary to hostel rules.Advocate Monika Arora, representing JNU, said the hostel in question is a working women’s self-financed hostel and the petitioner students are getting HRA (house rent allowance) from the government. She said in case they have financial difficulties and their scholarships have been closed, the authorities will consider any representation made by them as per law. Otherwise, before the monsoon session, they will have to clear the dues, Arora said.During the hearing, the two students, as an interim relief, sought directions to the varsity to allow them to access their allotted rooms and also to allow their registration for the next semester.On this, the high court said the students are free to deposit the entire fee, without prejudice to their rights, and this amount will be subject to the outcome of their petition. It also said the students are free to access the hostel room to remove their belongings, with prior intimation to authorities, in accordance with rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-jnu-delhi-govt-response-on-plea-by-two-students-over-hostel-fee/story-psOFrEvSTDnxIYfpu405AI.html
14-10-2020||City||AAP asks public to support farmers against new agriculture laws||New DelhiHT CorrespondentThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday urged people from all walks of life to support farmers in their agitation against the recently passed agriculture laws. Party spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for passing the three controversial agriculture laws in Parliament and accused them of being anti-farmer.The three laws that have led to widespread protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. All three were cleared in the recently held Monsoon session of Parliament.“New farm laws of the BJP government will finish MSP in the country, now farmers will be forced to sell crops at a cheaper price and face losses. The AAP appeals to people from all walks of life – students, corporate employees, IT professionals, etc., to unite and support the farmers in this protest,” Bhardwaj said at a press conference.In response, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Over last one month, farmers of the country have understood that the new agriculture acts will turn up their fortunes and agriculture income will phenomenally increase but unfortunately few political parties, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), are inciting farmers hoping to better their political fortune...” “Also, regarding MSP, it will be better if Saurabh Bhardwaj asks the AAP-led Delhi government to restore Krishi Status for Delhi farmers along with the AATMA subsidy scheme so that Delhi farmers start getting subsidy benefits that their counterparts in Haryana and UP are enjoying,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-asks-public-to-support-farmers-against-new-agriculture-laws/story-X1xoeStPDIeqGo1XwZ4D5N.html

We asked the government to discuss these issues with farmers but they pushed these bills without any thought,” said Yadav while addressing media persons in Gurugram.He said that he would tour agricultural produce markets or mandis in Tauru, Farruknagar, Pataudi, Ateii, Bhiwani, neighbouring areas and finally, Sirsa, where farmers are holding a permanent protest against these bills.He also said that farmers across the country were against the bills and although the government has said it that would liberate the farm sector, no farmers’ organisation was consulted on this.“The report of Swaminathan Commission has not been implemented and statements issued by the government are just to mislead the farmers,” he said, adding that farmers in Haryana and Punjab will have to fight for their rights as they benefitted largely due to the MSP.A joint association of 140 farmers’ organisations from across the country will continue these protests across the country till these laws are rolled back, he said.Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, refuted these allegations and said that neither MSP system nor mandis were going to be changed in any manner. “The MSP system will continue and there is no change in mandis. The only change is that farmers will have the freedom to sell the produce across the country and will have different options,” said Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/yadav-to-hold-rallies-against-farm-bills-in-south-haryana/story-dCjY0WdRSPXfLdVjv6ZScO.html

14-10-2020||City||Ludhiana: Dog sterilisation drive comes to a halt in absence of doctor, staff||The dog sterlisation drive being carried out at the animal birth control (ABC) centre in the Haibowal dairy complex has come to a halt in the absence of doctors and labourers. As per the information, the work was stopped in September last week, when labourers and the doctor involved in the project denied working on the project citing personal reasons. This is the second time when the project has come to a halt in the last three months. Earlier, the project was stopped in August due to the exodus of labourers amid the Covid-19 lockdown.Requesting anonymity, an MC official said that labourers started returning to their hometown after the lockdown was announced in March, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of dogs sterilised per day also dropped and the project was put to a halt in August. Then, the Hyderabad-based company which is taking up the project in the city, arranged around half a dozen workers to commence the project in September. Only one team was working in the city as before the lockdown, two teams were deputed on the work. Earlier, the civic body used to sterilise over 500 dogs a month, but now only around 500 dogs have been sterilised in six months after the lockdown was announced. It is said that the team left the work after the incident wherein a stray dog, which was discharged from the centre after sterilisation, died in mysterious circumstances. The woman who took the dog to the centre took the matter with the police. Perturbed over the incident, the dog catcher and the staff involved left the work, the official said. Despite repeated attempts, MC joint commissioner Swati Tiwana, who is also the in-charge of the MC health branch, was not available for comment. The project was commenced in 2015 and as per the officials over 42,000 dogs have been sterilised in the city so far.Stray dog menace continues to haunt residentsResidents are a harried lot as stray dog menace continues to haunt them. The municipal corporation has been receiving complaints on a regular basis from different parts of the city. A resident of Dugri, Phase 2, Swaranjit Singh said, “Stray dogs create a lot of nuisance in the area and even attack people. The dogs have scratched the cars of residents and despite numerous complaints submitted with the MC, nothing has been done so far.”In a recent case, the security guards of a housing society at Pakhowal road had beaten a stray dog to death following which the police had booked unidentified persons under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and Section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-dog-sterilisation-drive-comes-to-a-halt-in-absence-of-doctor-staff/story-9ZEpbZM0tGahFdzFaRqIwN.html

We urge people not to give a lift to any suspicious person and alert us immediately. Police have been deployed at all nakas and toll plazas in the district to check vehicles,” he said.A police official, on condition of anonymity, said to arrest the juveniles is an uphill task for the police since they cannot release their pictures or disclose their identity. “Nine of the escaped juveniles were booked for murder and three of them for attempt to murder. We are finding details of their closed ones where they could possibly go,” he added.Earlier, one of the inmates was caught near Chaudhriwas village and the other from Talwandi Rana village, both in Hisar district, while the third juvenile’s arrest location was not shared by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/efforts-on-to-catch-remaining-14-inmates-who-fled-hisar-observation-home/story-fVJrDtrVrq2z3i8fosaxvO.html
14-10-2020||City||Himachal Kisan Sabha observes ‘MSP Day’ to press for various demands||The Himachal Kisan Sabha on Wednesday observed “Minimum Support Price (MSP) Day”, demanding the Centre to implement the recommendations of the National Commission on Farmers (Swaminathan Commission), among other things.The farmers stressed that they should be paid the declared support price for their food grains, appropriate MSP for fruits, flowers, vegetables, milk, honey, wool should be fixed, supplementary industries should be set up for the products made in the state so that additional yields can be processed, proper arrangements should be made for cold stores for perishable fruits and vegetables.State unit president Kuldeep Singh Tanwar said that they are reminding the state and central governments of the promises made to the farmers of Himachal before the 2014 general elections, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured that their debts would be forgiven. As per the recommendations of the Commission, remunerative price of the crop will be given.“The farmers of Himachal were promised that MSP will be given for fruits, vegetables, milk and flowers produced in the state, but these announcements by PM Modi have proven to be blatant lies,” he added.Tanwar alleged that the farmers were being cheated by both the Centre and state government. Despite the MSP of maize has been fixed at ₹1,850 in the state, farmers here are getting only ₹1,100 to ₹1,200 per quintal. Millions of farmers in the state, who are growing around 8 lakh tonnes of maize, are affected, but the government is not worried about it, Tanwar said, adding that on the contrary, the ruling party is engaged in vindicating the recently passed “anti-farmer” bills in Parliament.It should be noted that the MSPs for maize, wheat and paddy have been fixed in the state, but neither the Food Corporation of India (FCI) procures these crops nor does the government. The farmers sell surplus wheat and paddy in the neighbouring state of Punjab or Haryana. The FCI does not buy maize because it is not part of the public distribution system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-kisan-sabha-observes-msp-day-to-press-for-various-demands/story-n8D5H4xcEetgG2wFZ8hGiJ.html

It murdered the human rights of communities like Gujjar-Bakarwals, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Paharis, women, Valmikis and the west Pakistan refugees.”In a video message on the party’s twitter handle, Raina claimed that Gupkar Declaration is nothing but a pro-Pakistan and anti-national agenda. “The people of J&K have nothing to do with it. They have already trashed it,” he said.Raina added that the three leaders were trying to shield themselves to save their skins and hide their sins.“People of J&K want peace, brotherhood and development. Whosoever tries to conspire and pursue Gupkar agenda will not be spared,” he said, adding that Articles 370 and 35-A meted out gross discrimination to west Pak refugees, Gujjars-Bakerwals, SCs/STs, Valmikis, women and nationalist people in J&K.“Articles 370 and 35-A gave birth to separatism and terrorism. It will never come back. It is a history now. These conspirators are again trying to bleed Kashmir, but we won’t allow them to succeed in their sinister designs. We will not allow their Gupkar agenda and won’t let them vitiate the atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir again,” he asserted.Raina said the Gupkar agenda has been coined in Kashmir in an attempt to hoodwink the people and for Farooq and company to save themselves. “But people know that when they were in power, they committed sins with impunity,” he said.“If Farooq and Mehbooba dare bleed Kashmir via their hidden agenda, they will have to face serious ramifications,” he said concluding the two-minute video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gupkar-declaration-farooq-co-will-face-grave-ramifications-if-agenda-bleeds-kashmir-again-j-k-bjp-chief/story-NBOUadlx8ygJ1caUayv8oL.html

It may go up to 50 per cent as the festive days near,” he said.With increasing retail sales, the mall authorities are witnessing higher conversion rate, the percentage of people that walk in and make a purchase, as compared to that of last year.Compared to the pre-puja period in 2019, sales at food courts were up by 25 per cent this year, Bagree said.According to them, festival advances to government employees and puja bonus to many private entities will further boost consumer spending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-malls-focus-on-safety-protocols-to-tackle-increasing-footfalls-ahead-of-durga-puja/story-NMb2UTZatgy7cZNqRHI4MM.html

14-10-2020||Pune||7 months on, general body yet to approve Swargate-Katraj route||Seven months after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) gave its nod to the detailed project report (DPR) for the Swargate to Katraj metro line on March 17, the general body of the civic body has still failed to approve the proposal.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in PMC has not given its nod to the proposal the 5.4km Swargate to Katraj metro corridor. The proposal has not been placed before the general body, which is conducting its meetings online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol accepted that there has been delay in approving the proposal for the Swargate-Katraj route, which will be one of the most crucial routes given the high footfall expectancy on the stretch. “Due to the Covid-19 situation the proposal got delayed. I am assuring everyone that in the next general body meeting, the proposal will be brought up for discussion and with the support of all parties it will get a nod. The general body meetings are held online and there are time limits, so it got a little delayed,” said Mohol. The 5.4 km Swargate-Katraj stretch will most likely to be underground and will cost Rs 4,283 crore. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) elected member Ashwini Kadam from Sahakarnagar, said, “The ruling BJP is busy only in unnecessary purchasing of things and blaming the opposition parties on various issues. If the proposal gets the nod immediately, at least the administrative work can be completed and it can be submitted to the state government.” According to the DPR prepared during last year, the per kilometre cost of the metro line is estimated to be Rs 783.85 crore. There will be four station on the stretch, which is an extension of the Swargate-Nigdi line being developed by the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (Maha-Metro). Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “All parties are of the view that there should be an extension for the metro corridor between Swargate and Katraj.

The mechanic was checking the engine compartment of the bus when he spotted the python rustling in the compartment. Having experienced the fright of his life, he jumped out of the bus and alerted other employees. “The Bus was parked after surrendering documents in the regional transport office to save taxes since March due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Now, such buses have been released to ply again on different routes after the government’s recent permissions for resumption of intra and inter-state bus services. Buses are being checked and maintenance is being carried out. During one such inspection, a python was spotted in the bus here on Tuesday,” said Rakesh Kumar, assistant regional manager, Rudrapur depot.Watch: 10-feet long python rescued by forest dept in Greater NoidaKumar said that Charanjeet, the mechanic, had boarded the bus to check the engine of the bus which was previously being operated on the Tanakpur route before the lockdown was implemented.After he spotted the python and jumped out of the bus, forest officials were called in the workshop to rescue the python. “As soon as we were informed about the python resting inside the engine compartment of the bus, we called forest officials to rescue it. A team immediately arrived at the workshop and captured the python and later released it in the forest,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/8-ft-long-python-found-in-uttarakhand-roadways-bus-gives-mechanic-fright/story-hcwviexMENSLiTTJRCJlfP.html
14-10-2020||City||Pay Rs 16 lakh to families of 4 boys who drowned in illegal quarry: NGT tells Goa govt||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Goa government to compensate the families of four boys who died after they drowned in a quarry pit, ordering the mines department to give the families Rs 16 lakh each with the liberty to recover the amount from those operating the illegal quarries. “The four students succumbed to injuries due to falling in the pit left uncared for, thus, the family members of the deceased are entitled for the payment of compensation of Rs 16 lakh each with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the order. The State of Goa (Department of Mines) is directed to pay the amount of compensation to family members of the deceased,” said the tribunal.“The state of Goa may recover the amount from the polluters on Principle of Polluters Pay. Any amount paid to the family member of the deceased may be deducted from the above amount. The state may recover the total amount from the polluter according to law,” the NGT ruled. The NGT arrived at the compensation amount by calculating the average amount the boys, all 14, would have earned if they were to go on to live healthy lives and work for at least 25 years of their active lives. “At a minimum rate (the Minimum Wages as prescribed by the Government of India is Rs. 433/-) and for easy calculation, we have taken Rs 400 and at the rate of minimum 20 days’ work, the amount of compensation which is to be paid or for which the family members of the deceased are entitled are approximately Rs 16 lakh,” the NGT ruled. “The award of compensation not only compensates an individual, satisfies him personally but helps in curing the social evil. It may result in improving the work culture and help in changing the outlook. When a person or institution is involved in commercial activities then any injury or damage caused by the act of these commercial activities must be compensated,” the NGT said. In September last year, four students went for a swim in the quarry that was filled with rainwater and drowned. The four were part of a group of 40 boarders from a hostel who were taken for a trek at Tuem village in North Goa.Laterite quarries of stone used to build houses are large pits that are filled with water during the rains and end up being traps, not just for unsuspecting humans but also for animals who fall into the pits.“The consumer must not be made to run from pillar to post. Where there has been capacious arbitrary or negligent exercise or non-exercise of power by the authorities or instrumentalities, the forum must be provided in the department itself to hear the grievances and take a decision to redress the public grievance,” the NGT said. Petitioner S M Walawaikar had approached the NGT alleging several quarries were operating illegally in the villages of Ozarim, Mandrem, Tuem, Corgao, Nagzar, Casarvornem and Alorna of Taluka Pernem, praying for directions to forthwith stop the illegal mining and refill all the pits and stone quarries with mud and stones. The mines department admitted that 35 sites in Pernem were operational and that no quarrying permit or quarrying lease has been granted in these cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pay-rs-16-lakh-to-families-of-4-boys-who-drowned-in-illegal-quarry-ngt-tells-goa-govt/story-dfhICZb8kmMI8yCEOfRo1N.html
14-10-2020||Dehradun||Mahakumbh 2021: Coin pickers of Ganga to be deployed as lifeguards||For the first time in its history, Mahakumbh, scheduled earlier next year in Uttarakhand, will utilise the services of coin pickers of Ganga as lifeguards, given their expertise in diving and knowledge of depth at various Ganga ghats. These coin pickers earn their livelihood by collecting coins offered to river Ganga by devotees. They dive into the river, sometimes use a stick, magnets, pieces of glass, hollow plastic boxes and their feet in tracing coins lying on the riverbed. The mela administration has decided to use their services by further training them to assist the mela force in ensuring safety of pilgrims taking a dip in Ganga and rescuing them in case they drown or get washed away. Mela administration officer in charge Deepak Rawat said, “They have a good knowledge of the depth at various ghats and I have seen them picking up coins even when the river is swollen.” Terming it as a unique initiative, Rawat said, “These coin collectors spend a major part of their life on Ganga ghats and are good divers and swimmers. So we thought of taking the help of around 100 of them during the mela and they would be paid for their services.”Also read: In a first, passes to be issued for Mahakumbh in Haridwar next yearSunil Pal, who lost his father at an early age, has been earning his livelihood by picking coins, utensils and leftover clothes and other items from Ganga ghats. “We have been informed by Har-Ki-Pauri police personnel about this idea of involving us as divers during Mahakumbh. We are excited about this proposal as it will give us an identity and provide us an additional employment,” said Sunil Pal. Thirty-four-year-old coin picker Pawan Madhuraj earns anywhere between ₹50-150 per day, depending on the occasion. “Besides coins, we also collect utensils, coconuts, items related to funeral rites and leftover clothes at Ganga ghats. At Har-Ki-Pauri alone, there are about thirty such coin collectors whose livelihood depends on this work,” said Madhuraj, who collects coins at Har-Ki-Pauri. Pradeep Jha, president of Ganga Sabha which manages the affairs of Har-Ki-Pauri, said that apart from Jal police divers, their own Ganga Sevak Dal volunteers are also expert divers who will pitch in with their services during Kumbh and other festive bathes. “The decision of using coin pickers will further strengthen the safety of pilgrims. This is a good decision,” he said Akhada Parishad, the apex body of saints, which fixes dates and related rituals of the fair, has also welcomed the initiative to utilise the skills of coin pickers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/mahakumbh-2021-coin-pickers-of-ganga-to-be-deployed-as-lifeguards/story-jsAfn3hAAXytFnPeOEyE0L.html

He furnished a personal bond of Rs 2 lakh and two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each.The Rajasthan high court has already dismissed the allegation of undervaluation of the disinvestment.Presiding Officer Pooran Kumar Sharma has fixed the next hearing on Thursday.Also Read: Court stays arrest of ex-minister Arun Shourie in hotel sale caseSpeaking to reporters outside the court, Shourie said the CBI has submitted closure reports twice in the disinvestment of Laxmi Vilas Palace. The CBI in its closure report has stated 14 such points, on the basis of which the agency found that there was no merit in the case. Despite the closure report, the CBI court has taken cognizance of the court. “I have written five books on the Supreme Court, but never questioned the motives of the court,” he said.Shourie said that the biggest charge concerns undervaluation and has no logical basis.He said a petitioner, one Ambalal Nayak, had challenged the evaluation process in the high court, but the court had dismissed the charge.When the CBI started an investigation in 2014 on the basis of an anonymous complaint, the price was estimated to be Rs 150 crore and now it is said that assets worth around Rs 250 crore have been undervalued and sold. Shourie, however, said all the allegations are baseless.On September 15, the special CBI court ordered the registration of criminal cases against former Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, chairperson and managing director of Bharat Hotels Limited Jyotsna Suri, former disinvestment secretary Pradip Baijal, then managing director of investment firm Lazard India Limited Ashish Guha and then head of valuation firm Kanti Karamsey Karamsey Vikamsey. The case centres on the sale of the Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur, earlier run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation, to Bharat Hotels Limited in 2002. The CBI filed an FIR in 2014, alleging that the government lost Rs 244 crore in the sale. The special court had issued arrest warrants against the accused persons, which the high court had stayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/laxmi-vilas-disinvestment-case-arun-shourie-appears-before-cbi-court-denies-wrongdoing/story-p72zJZKaPdVDtbNuUVQaCO.html

14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmer leaders walk out of meeting with Union agriculture secretary||Representatives of farmer unions from Punjab walked out of a meeting with Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal at Krishi Bhawan in Delhi on Wednesday, saying they were expecting to meet Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar who could decide on their demands to repeal the three farm laws. With the meeting ending on an inconclusive note, the farmer union leaders said the rail blockade and protests will continue even as they meet in Chandigarh on Thursday to decide on the further course of action. “We accepted the Centre’s invite for talks but were disappointed. Contrary to our suggestion, there was no one at the meeting who could decide on our demands,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, the general secretary of Bharti Kisan Union (Dakounda), a key farm union of Punjab. When Agarwal tried to pacify the seven farmer representatives, asking them to stay for talks, they handed over their memorandum of demands and walked out. “We refused to talk to him (Agarwal) but we gave him the memorandum in which we have demanded that the new laws be repealed. We want the minimum support price (MSP) on all crops to be made a legal right for farmers and open-ended procurement should be guaranteed. The proposed power bill that the Centre plans to adjudicate should also not be introduced as it will further hit farmers,” Patiala said. BID TO DELAY DECISION ON DEMANDS: FARMERS On the “competent authority”, he said: “We were expecting Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar or at least the minister of state to talk to us, but we were made to meet the agriculture secretary. We see this as an attempt to delay decision-making on our demands.” The farm union activists have laid siege to key rail routes in Punjab since September 24, impacting the supply of the essential services such as coal for the state’s thermal power generation units, the movement of foodgrains to consumer states from Punjab’s godowns, and the supply of fertilisers such as di-ammonium phosphate and urea needed for sowing Rabi crops. After the Centre invited the farm unions for talks, 29 farm bodies of the 30 protesting against the farm laws nominated seven spokespersons. ANTI-GOVT SLOGANS RAISED OUTSIDE KRISHI BHAWANOn coming out of Krishi Bhawan, the farm union representatives raised anti-government slogans. They were joined by at least 50 representatives of different farm bodies had gathered outside the meeting venue.Police personnel were deployed outside Krishi Bhawan to avert any untoward incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmer-leaders-walk-out-of-meeting-with-union-agriculture-secretary/story-z4sS4YhQix8HJCfPOFthXN.html

Previously, a young dolphin was found dead near Narora village on October 9. Earlier in January, a dolphin was found dead near Jalapur Jora village Meerut’s Hastinapur area.Also read: Fund-starved zoos to be developed on PPP model The total population of dolphins in Upper Gangetic Basin (176-km stretch of Ganges between Bijnore and Narora barrages) is 41, as per the latest joint survey of WWF India and forest department.State’s chief wildlife warden Sunil Pandey also announced that a committee of senior officials would be set up to investigate frequent death of dolphins. Pandey said forest officials and staff needed to be more vigilant to protect these highly endangered animals, which had been included in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Act.Dr Sandeep Behera, consultant of National Ganga Clean Mission( NGMC), said, “We must put an effective check on the frequent death of dolphins.”He said the stretch of Ganga between Narora and Garhmukteshwar was declared a Ramsar site (wetland site of international importance) because of these dolphins and the community’s participation in their conservation. But, he alleged, officials could not develop a management plan for the site in past 15 years. Important sites are called Ramsar sites because of the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty established in 1971 by Unesco, which came into force in 1975.A senior forest official, who did not wish to be named, said, “Prima facie, illegal fishing in the river seems to be the reason for the death of these two dolphins.”As dolphins are mammals, they need to come out of the water every three to four minutes to breathe. Blind by birth, they differentiate between light and dark by using sonar rays. They detect and escape obstacles inside the water through the rebound rays. However, fisherman use nylon nets and the sonar rays pass through these. As a result, there is no rebound and the dolphins are unable to detect the nets, getting entangled in them and then dying of suffocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/second-dolphin-death-in-5-days-in-up-s-bulandshahr-probe-panel-set-up/story-rQoT9ctoGJikfEaty8UJiJ.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||IMD’s improved air quality models capture air pollution spike in Delhi||The air quality forecast models for Delhi and the rest of India have improved according to India Meteorological Department, which will lead to better forecasts this year and identification of air pollution hot spots.The October 15 forecast for India shows PM 2.5 concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 micrograms per cubic metre. The 24-hour safe standard for PM 2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. When it comes to PM 2.5 concentrations in Delhi, the entire city seems to be impacted by concentrations of over 200 micrograms per cubic metre as per IMD’s ENFUSER model.Also Read: AQI enters red zone, all eyes on farm firesThe air quality forecast model system for integrated modelling of atmospheric composition (SILAM) for India has been improved by implementing global emission inventories for coarse and fine particulate matter at 10 km resolution. “Earlier we had 50 km resolution. Plus, we have also added land cover and land-use data to obtain a better forecast,” explained Vijay Soni, a scientist at the air pollution division of India Meteorological Department (IMD).A very high-resolution city scale model has been operationalised for Delhi to identify air pollution hot spots and street-level pollution. The model utilises air quality observations, road network, building, land use information, high resolution satellite maps, population data etc to generate forecasts. The results are being evaluated to capture pollution hot spots in Delhi, Soni said.Now the air quality warning system will also provide forecasts for Lucknow, Kanpur and Varanasi at 2 km resolution. “For the Delhi model, we are using real time air quality data from ground monitors, traffic congestion data, road network data, etc. to identify hot spots. We will be able to share this information on our bulletins also,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/imd-s-improved-air-quality-models-capture-air-pollution-spike-in-delhi/story-XAnGUXN7NWBEmBH9rpO9IN.html

14-10-2020||Lifestyle||Festive shopping? Log in to see, shop, support #local online||Every year, the festive season begins with much fervour and enthusiasm with shopping plans for first Durga Puja and Navratri, and later Dussehra and Diwali. This year, much has been changed due to Covid-19 pandemic. And to maintain social distancing and follow other necessary precautions, people are preferring to not to step out of their homes unless it’s absolute necessary. But shopping for festivals doesn’t stop, and in such a case online portals have turned out to be the most preferred options. According to a survey by Local Circles, 41% Delhiites are expected to use e-commerce websites as their primary shopping channel. In an extensive study of 30 days, to understand how Indian consumers will spend during the festive season, online v/s offline channels, this survey was conducted at a national level and specifically in 50 top cities of India. “It received over 300,000 responses from consumers across 330 plus districts of India. In the Delhi polls, 19,028 responses were received. 41% chose e-commerce sites and apps while 29% said they will call local retail stores and get things home delivered. Only 16% said they will physically visit malls, markets and local retailers for the festive shopping. Overall, 79% e-commerce shoppers say they will consider buying festive items online supporting local artisan and business (#localforvocal),” says Sachin Taparia, founder of the community social media platform. It’s interesting to note that many, during the time of Covid-19 lockdown, learnt to shop online so that they are self-reliant to buy whatever they need, without taking help from their family. Madhu Bansal, a resident of south Delhi, says, “Before Covid-19, I preferred to shop from my local market, after comparing the prices and different qualities of products available. But, now I’m left with no option... ever since the pandemic hit, my son isn’t letting me go out to shop. He actually gave me a tutorial on how to shop online while checking quality and comparing price range. Now I’ve mastered the art! I’ve been ordering online for a while. In fact, for Navratri, I prepared a list to compare the price range on various websites, and then ordered what I needed. I‘m excited to receive all the items before Navratri begins.” Those buyers who are keen to support #LocalForVocal have decided to pay serious attention to where they are ordering their needs from. “I get confused while making the payments, so my husband asked me to make COD for most of the items, and I find it easy. My focus remains on buying from Indian karigars and companies. It does take some time to read about the company but I don’t mind putting that much of effort to support our economy. I would urge other shoppers also to support small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs,” says Manju Saraf, a resident of Bengali Market. It’s also the season of sales, and some of the e-commerce websites have decided to enable local shops, kiranas and other neighbourhood stores this festive season. Working women, who are tied up due to their busy office schedule and household responsibilities, are elated to know this. “My husband has been telling me about how websites are supporting local kiranas since Modi ji spoke about it,” says Ekadshi Gupta from Gurugram, adding, “We’ve thus been purchasing clothes and most other products online, and ensure that whatever we buy is sourced from Indian craftspersons. Now, as local kirana stores are also becoming part of e-shopping, we can buy groceries from there, too.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/festive-shopping-log-in-to-see-shop-support-local-online/story-VSXff1OcqmUOIK0PrfOcGI.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||Under which provisions private hospitals requisitioned for Covid treatment: HC asks Maharashtra||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Maharashtra government to clarify about the legal provisions under which private hospitals are being used as dedicated coronavirus disease (Covid-19) healthcare facilities.A two-member division bench, comprising Justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala, has also directed the state government to clarify if the latter is willing to appropriately compensate private hospitals following their requisition under Section 65 of the Disaster Management (DM) Act, 2005.Also read: Covid-19 patients are not untouchables, says Bombay HC to hospital for refusing to examine pregnant womanThe bench made the observation while hearing a petition filed by Viveka Super Speciality Hospital and Research Centre, a private healthcare facility, in Nagpur, challenging the validity of two notifications by the state government.The notifications were issued by the state government on April 30 and May 21 following which an order was also put out by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on August 31, directing the petitioner hospital to spare 80℅ of its beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients.Advocates Kartik Shukul and Abhilash Shriwas, who represented the petitioner hospital, submitted that neither the notifications nor the civic order issued under Section 65 of the DM Act, 2005, were in legal conformity.They pleaded that the bid to requisition 80% of the hospital beds was void because of the absence of an order.The bench found merit in the petitioner’s submissions, and asked the divisional revenue commissioner and the NMC commissioner, who were present for the hearing, about the legal provisions under which they had requisitioned private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.However, both the officials were clueless about the court’s query and sought time for a response.“If orders as contemplated under Section 65 of the DM Act, 2005 or under Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, which have not been passed to date, it is not understood as to how and under what authority there can be interference in the management of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals, either by the state government or by the empowered officers under the said Acts,” the court said.It added that if the notifications were issued under these legal provisions, then obligations contained under Section 66 of the DM Act, 2005, regarding the payment of compensation would follow.The bench will hear the petition next on Thursday (October 15).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/under-which-provisions-private-hospitals-requisitioned-for-covid-treatment-hc-asks-maharashtra/story-pvo9wJMfMroJTxPWrIg0rK.html
14-10-2020||Kolkata||Bengal BJP MP urges Amit Shah to seek report on use of chemicals to disperse protestors||Bharatiya Janata Party MP Locket Chatterjee has urged Union home minister Amit Shah to seek a report from the Mamata Banerjee administration in Bengal over the alleged use of “harmful chemicals” to disperse the crowd during a political protest rally on October 8. In her letter, the MP also alleged that such chemical weapons were used in China to gag the Opposition and were new to India. “The people of Bengal will be highly grateful to you if you could kindly seek a report from the state government regarding the use of chemicals in water cannons to disperse the crowd,” Chatterjee wrote to Shah. Also Read: Balwinder Singh a target in TMC’s fight against BJP, says Akal Takht jathedarEarlier too the BJP had alleged the Kolkata Police had sprayed water mixed with chemicals during the Nabanna Cholo rally organised by the party to protest against political killings in the state. The state government, however, refuted such allegations saying that it was coloured water, which is used globally. “No chemical was used in the cannon water; it is wrong information. The intent to use coloured water is to identify a person post-dispersal for further necessary action as per the law if deemed fit and if required,” Alapan Bandopadhyay, chief secretary of the state had told media persons. The letter sent by Chatterjee also states that the police had used bombs, tear gas and lathis to disperse the ‘peaceful crowd’. It also mentions the allegend manhandling of Balwinder Singh. “The chemical that was used by the police as a tool to identify protestors made people sick and breathless. This was a very similar sight to that of China where political opponents are gagged and are stopped by chemical weapons and are not allowed to protest against the atrocities of the ruling regime,” the MP wrote in her letter to the Union home minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-bjp-mp-urges-amit-shah-to-seek-report-on-use-of-chemicals-to-disperse-protestors/story-7w8h0nA7VYDyAwL3HmiuPK.html

However, states such as Telangana and Jharkhand, too, have done a concurrent social audit of some schemes, mainly related to MNREGA but Rajasthan decision for an overall audit to bring transparency in public spending sets a good example. Dey said Rajasthan was a pioneer in conducting social audits and has a directorate which wasn’t working as per the protocol of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) directions. He claimed that Gehlot has now announced provision for a governing council within the directorate.More RTIs disposed of during lockdown, says minister; experts disagree“We hope Rajasthan will once again take the lead in conducting social audits in the country. We hope that all Covid expenditure done anywhere in the country including through the PM Cares fund will be subject to a social audit,” he said.Addressing a national level webinar on the Right to Information Act (RTI), Gehlot said the appointment of chief information commissioner (CIC) and other information commissioners will be done in the next one month in the state.“The entire process of appointing the commissioners and obtaining information through RTI applications will be made online by December 31,” he said.Also Read: Paddy purchase up, other crops sell below MSPSocial activist and RTI proponent, Aruna Roy, suggested for a transparency policy for ensuring accountability in governance. She said that public information portal is an important medium of people’s communication with the government, and to maintain its system, an advisory group or council should be formed at the state level. Dey added that there should be a law for accountability of public servants and pointed out that if Rajasthan implements the law, it would be the first state in the country to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-sets-example-with-social-audit-of-all-covid-19-programmes/story-7XJk48axahuxpIiI5jjCFJ.html
14-10-2020||City||Once forgotten, 1918 Spanish flu memorial gains following amid Covid-19 scare in Goa||Right outside the expansive cemetery at Raia village in South Goa stood a stone structure covered in moss, overgrown weeds and creepers. It was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a wider road as part of highway expansion between Margao and Ponda, two towns in South Goa. Little was known or spoken about the structure but its engraved inscription bore testimony to its true purpose. “E M (Em Memória) das vítimas de gripe de 1918” (In Memory of the Victims of the Flu of 1918) reads its plaque. Until earlier this year, the stone monolith that once had a cross at the top, which had collapsed due to lack of care, was given very little attention. That changed in July-August. As coronavirus (Covid-19) cases emerged in the village, people began flocking to the memorial, turning to it to pray for the survival of near and dear ones.On Sunday, October 11, work on restoration of the cross was completed and it was reconsecrated in a simple ceremony. Ever since, it has seen a steady stream of devotees and visitors who light candles and pray for the recovery of those ailing from Covid-19. “The Regidor (village administrator), Olivo Costa, and village elders got together to built this structure in memory of those who had died,” recalled Margarida Tavora e Costa whose lineage traces back to Olivo Costa. Legend has it that the village of Raia and the neighbouring village of Rachol, which is host to a Portuguese era fort and military garrison, were particularly affected by the Spanish flu of 1918 and as the bodies began filling the cemetery, the villagers had to expand the burial grounds in what would resemble a mass grave. The memorial was built atop the extended burial grounds to remember those who had perished. Locals say 318 people are believed to have died of Spanish flu in and around the village. “If not for the events of this year, who would have thought about this memorial? Even I didn’t know it existed,” Margarida said, adding that she was inspired to take the initiative to restore the memorial with help from her extended family. It is one of the two known memorials dedicated to victims of 1918 Spanish flu that still exist in Goa, the other one being in Salvador do Mundo. Stories surrounding the 1918 epidemic are mainly passed down through oral tradition. Anna Antonetta Fernandes, 88, recalled through her son, Marius Fernandes, the stories that she was told by her mother of the ‘gripe’ that afflicted the land leading to a piling up of bodies in her village that were carried up the hill away from human habitation and buried without any ceremony. In her book about health in colonial Goa, Fatima da Silva Gracias spoke of minimal effort by the government to contain the pandemic. “The first case of influenza in Goa was reported in 1917 in Bardez taluka (North Goa). It coincided with acute shortage of provisions. In Siolim (Bardez), eight to ten persons died daily. The outbreak did not attract any particular attention of the government as cases in the early period were not fatal. Able-bodied workers suffered the most on account of influenza. Pregnant mothers who suffered from influenza either died or miscarried or delivered premature babies,” Gracias said in her book. “The inhabitants of this territory in panic would run away at the mere sight of a dead body being carried away. The Government did not implement immediate measures to control or prevent the spread of the disease,” she wrote. Figures of how many succumbed to the flu across the colony are also hard to come by. The memorials are all that remains of the 1918 pandemic and today, they are relevant again. “I had a vision to restore what was done by our ancestors because of our family memory. During this time of the pandemic, we have to give back and we have to come together,” Margarida said.As to whether the memorial will still be demolished for the highway project, local MLA Aleixo Lourenço said, “There is no question of removing the Cross now, from where it stands. Whoever comes up with these ideas has an evil mind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/once-forgotten-1918-spanish-flu-memorial-gains-following-amid-covid-19-scare-in-goa/story-VobuVy0yfCusX9P4OCFROM.html

After both the parties submitted consent terms agreeing that they will not file any case against each other nor would they seek compensation, the court accepted the same and disposed of the suit against Ghosh. However, Chadha’s suit against film personality Kamaal R Khan and a TV channel will continue as Khan submitted that he would contest it. The court has asked him to file an affidavit and posted the matter for hearing after six weeks. AK Menon, while hearing the suit, was informed by advocate Nitin Satpute who represented actor Payal Ghosh that as per court directions both parties had amicably settled the issue which had arisen out of the comments Ghosh made about Chadha when she accused film director Anurag Kashyap of sexual misconduct.

Advocate Saveena Bedi, representing Chadha, concurred and said that the consent terms were arrived at amicably and were finalised and signed. As per the settlement, both had agreed not to file a case against each other nor seek compensation. Chadha had filed the defamation suit seeking a compensation of Rs 1.1 crore from Ghosh, film personality Kamal Khan and a TV channel for sharing and airing alleged derogatory and defamatory comments made by director Anurag Kashyap about Chadha while allegedly seeking sexual favours from Ghosh. During the initial hearing, the high court had directed both Chadha and Ghosh to settle the matter and issued an injunction against news channels and portals from sharing or airing disputed content till the suit was decided. Advocate Manoj Gadkari, appearing for Khan, informed the court that his client was willing to contest the suit but would refrain from sharing the derogatory posts on social media. Advocate Nikhil Mishra, appearing for the channel, also said that they would contest the suit and argue against the injunction issued by the court. After hearing all sides the court accepted the consent terms between the actors and disposed the suit against Ghosh but said that the suit would continue against Khan and the channel and posted the matter for hearing after six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/payal-ghosh-apologises-to-richa-chadha-bombay-hc-disposes-of-defamation-suit/story-NHL7RoYlvgtwC3Um7IuYTN.html

The siblings who study in a boarding school in Mussoorie have been stranded since the lockdown was imposed late in the month of March. During the Unlock phase, they tried to go to Kathmandu to their parents but were stopped at the Indo-Nepal border at Banbasa in Champawat district since their immigration process was not complete. Himanshu Kafaltia, sub-divisional magistrate of Tanakpur in Champawat district said that the two children have been lodged at a state guest house till their documentation gets complete. “We have written to the MHA seeking permission to open the border and allow them to go to Nepal. The children study in Class 12 and Class 10 in a boarding school in Mussoorie. Till we get a response from the MHA, the district administration is taking care of the children. We have also spoken to the US embassy which is in touch with the Central government,” said the sub-divisional magistrate.

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Religious places, gyms on Maharashtra priority list for unlocking, cinema halls may have to wait||The Maharashtra government is planning to open up more activities and the unlocking will be complete by the end of the November amid pressure from various fronts and sectors, despite the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The places of worship are also expected to be allowed to reopen over the next few weeks. The move is significant in the backdrop of a recent letter war between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, tried to muddy the waters by launching a state-wide protest demanding reopening of temples.Also read: India crosses 7.2 million Covid-19 case mark with 63,509 new infections as cases rise marginally The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (mVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, has extended the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions in the state until October 31.However, it has allowed four lakh restaurants, bars, and eateries to reopen from October 5. It has permitted industries operating in the densely populated Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), a Covid-19 hotspot, to resume their commercial activities from early October.Intercity and long-distance trains within Maharashtra have also been allowed and frequency of the suburban trains within MMR has been increased. At present, the suburban trains, which are considered to be the lifeline of Mumbai, are still catering to frontline essential workers, who are busy battling the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the state government has yet to allow the reopening of schools, colleges and other educational institutions, cinema halls, swimming pools, auditoriums, and assembly halls. Political, social, and cultural gatherings are still out of bounds, as part of the existing restrictions.Maharashtra was among the first states in the country to enforce lockdown restrictions from March 14 ahead of the 68-day nationwide impositions that were imposed 11 days later. State health and family welfare minister Rajesh Tope on Saturday had said that Maharashtra was planning to lift all lockdown restrictions by the end of November. “Barring a few, almost all the activities have been allowed as of now. Some of the activities will be thrown open by the end of October and the remaining by end-November,” he had said.Though the central government has allowed cinema halls to reopen from October 15, the theatres and multiplexes in Maharashtra will still have to wait for some more time. “Our priority is not theatres and multiplexes. Unlike other metropolises and cities, theatres and multiplexes in Mumbai are crowd-pullers and cannot be allowed to reopen immediately. We are thinking of reopening temples and gymnasiums. A decision to this effect is expected to be taken over the next few days,” said an official from Mantralaya, the state secretariat, requesting anonymity.The state authorities are expecting a spike in Covid-19 cases following further easing of lockdown restrictions. “The sequential surge due to these activities is expected by next week. Reviewing the situation on the expected surge, the decision over reopening of religious spaces is expected next week,” the official said.CM Thackeray has announced that schools, colleges and other educational institutions would not be allowed to reopen until Diwali to be celebrated on November 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-religious-places-gyms-on-maharashtra-priority-list-for-unlocking-cinema-halls-may-have-to-wait/story-nUvTKvpjOi8PAK8mi9lbTL.html

The court made the observation while noticing that the Chandrapur-based government medical college had not clinically examined the pregnant woman after she had tested Covid-19 positive.“As we understand, day in and day out Covid-19 patients are being treated in hospitals.

The proposal is among the recommendations made by a five-member committee set up by state director general of police Sanjay Kundu to suggest measures for the tunnel’s security. Headed by inspector general of police, security and intelligence, Daljit Singh Thakur, the committee comprises deputy inspector general of police, central range, Madhusudhan; superintendent of police, Kullu, Gaurav Singh; superintendent of police, Lahaul and Spiti, Rajesh Dharmani; and a representative of the intelligence bureau. The committee submitted its proposals to chief secretary Anil Khachi recently and suggested that the movement of vehicles carrying explosives be barred from plying through the 9.02-km tunnel, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 3. The members of the committee had earlier visited Jawahar Tunnel in Banihal and the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Tunnel at Chenani-Nashri to study the security set-up adopted by the Jammu and Kashmir Police. TWO POLICE STATIONS AT TUNNELThe committee also proposed multipurpose barriers at Solang, 14 km down the South Portal at Dhundhi, and at Teling close to the North Portal in Sissu. It asked the government to make budgetary provisions for two police stations, one at the North Portal that will be supervised by the Lahaul and Spiti SP, and the other at Dhundhi at the South Portal under the jurisdiction of the Kullu police. Both police stations will have 45 personnel each to monitor the security and deal with law and order. They will be provided two police control room (PCR) vans to manage traffic inside the tunnel. STUDIED SAFETY PRACTICES IN TUNNELS ABROADThe five-member team had also studied safety practices followed in tunnels in the Swiss Alps, China, Japan and Pakistan. The Atal Tunnel is 25km from Manali and located at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the North Portal near Teling situated at 3,071 metres. It is a horseshoe-shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres. Built at a cost of Rs 3,300 crore, the tunnel is significant from the defence point of view. The Border Roads Organisation completed work on the tunnel in a decade, overcoming geological challenges that included the difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah fault zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-police-ask-govt-to-bar-entry-of-vehicles-carrying-arms-ammo-explosives-through-atal-tunnel/story-zubw2I0e7fRofBLTZFwOmN.html

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC to scale up testing to 20,000 per day||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to scale up to 20,000 daily Covid-19 tests in Mumbai from the present average of 15,000. The decision was taken in a meeting of municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, deputy municipal commissioners, and assistant commissioners of all 24 wards, on Tuesday. RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests done daily will now be scaled up. A little over two weeks ago, BMC was conducting about 13,000 tests a day, and had scaled up to 15,000 tests. Of those 30-35% are rapid antigen tests, and the remaining are RT-PCR tests. On October 12, BMC conducted 9,133 tests, and on October 11, it conducted 9,265 tests, much lower than the average of the past week at 14,000 daily tests. So far, BMC has conducted 1,271,087 tests, with a positivity rate of 18.5%. It has conducted 98,421 tests per million till date. A senior civic officer said, “All assistant commissioners have been directed to further scale up testing in their respective wards and meet the target everyday. Each officer can pick methods to do so but they have been urged to meet the target. It will mean that we organise more fever camps, ramp up contact tracing efforts, and test all high risk contacts of positive cases.” Since BMC began to scale up testing from up to 10,000 at the end of July to 15,000 in October, the positivity rate has seen only a slight drop, from 20% to 18.5%, a senior civic officer said, “We are getting a decent positivity rate, as the number of cases reported in the city per day has also gone up to over 2,000. Further scaling up of testing will help identify positive cases faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-bmc-to-scale-up-testing-to-20-000-per-day/story-bx6GkLd0R1LVTfvrD2Tj2J.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||In 1st response to same-sex marriage, Centre cites 5,000 yrs of Sanatan Dharma||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the response of the Centre and the Delhi government on pleas by two same-sex couples seeking legal recognition of their marriages, arguing that the lack of formal acceptance of their union under Indian laws was a violation of their constitutional rights.A bench of justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and justice Asha Menon issued notices to the authorities and posted the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2021. The bench also said age-old inhibitions have to be shed when advocate Rajkumar Yadav, one of the counsels for the Centre, submitted that this is a peculiar circumstance and this situation has not been faced in 5,000 years of Sanatan Dharma.Also read: Delhi HC to hear PIL on same-sex marriage“We may shed our inhibition. The laws are gender-neutral. You please try to interpret the law for the citizens of Sanatan Dharma in the country. This is not an adversarial litigation. This is for the right of every citizen of the country,” justice Menon said.Central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said that the issue would require a detailed reply. During the proceedings, the court sought to know from the counsel for the petitioner whether the concept of marriage has been challenged in the plea because the term “marriage” has not been defined. “Please understand that till the concept of marriage is not challenged, it would not be able to move forward in the matter because marriage is not defined. There is otherwise no question on the maintainability of the pleas but in both the Special Marriage Act and Foreign Marriage Act, the term marriage has not been defined,” said the court.Explaining the difference, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the only difference between the SMA and Foreign Marriage Act is that the latter allows foreigners of Indian origin to marry. She said the plea is not on the customary or religious laws. “This is about the civil law, a statute provided by the Indian law for inter-caste, inter-faith, modern couples , same sex couple etc,” she said, adding that many judges have said that sexual orientation cannot be ground for discrimination.The first petition was filed by two mental health professionals -- Kavita Arora, 47, and Ankita Khanna, 36 -- who said they had been living together as a couple for eight years, were in love with each other, but unable to marry as both were women.“The petitioners are like any other couple you might meet, except they are both women,” their petition read.The second petition was filed by two men – Vaibhav Jain, an Indian citizen, and Parag Vijay Mehta, an overseas citizen of India, who got married in the United States in 2017. An Indian consulate refused to register their union this year under the 1969 Foreign Marriage Act.The couple, who were in a relationship since 2012 and were supported by their families and friends, also claimed that during the Covid-19 pandemic, this non-recognition of their marriage prevented them from travelling to India as a married couple.“The petitioners submit that non-recognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfillment of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer) couples,” the petition read.The two women said that issues like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof – things that a married couple takes for granted – were a struggle for them. On September 30, they approached the marriage officer (the sub-divisional magistrate, South East Delhi, Kalkaji) seeking solemnisation of their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.“The marriage officer would have solemnised the marriage of any similarly placed opposite-sex couple. Sexual orientation discrimination is constitutionally prohibited under Article 15, but the petitioners were refused the right to marry a person of their choice on grounds of their sexual orientation alone,” they said.The petitions argued that the non-recognition of marriage between LGBTQ persons violated the fundamental rights of liberty, equality, life and freedom of expression guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court judgment, Navtej Johar vs Union of India, which decriminalised adult, consensual same-sex relations in 2018.The Delhi high court is already hearing a petition filed by defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others. In response to that petition, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said last month that Indian values didn’t recognise same-sex unions.The two petitioners were represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar. Guruswamy and Katju were among the lawyers who convinced the Supreme Court to read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalised homosexuality, in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-seeks-govt-response-on-pleas-of-2-same-sex-couples-for-legal-recognition-of-marriage/story-XSk27xFFj4NoTQ1Mzv5MFK.html

14-10-2020||Education||Covid-19: Calcutta HC rules in favour of guardians, tells 145 schools to slash fees by 20%||The Calcutta high court has slashed fees charged by schools in West Bengal by 20%. This has come as a big relief for guardians who have been demanding a waiver of tuition fees during the Covid-19 pandemic. “There will be no increase in fees during the financial year 2020-21. Beginning April 2020, till the month following the one in which the schools reopen in the physical mode, all 145 schools (party to the petition) will offer a minimum of 20% reduction of fees across the board,” the court said the interim order passed by the court. The order also stated that charges for facilities not availed of will not be permissible. For instance, additional charges for laboratory, craft, sporting facilities or extracurricular activities will not be permissible during the months that the schools have not functioned in the physical mode. Session fees traditionally charged periodically will be permissible, but again, subject to a maximum of 80% of the quantum charged for the corresponding period in the financial year 2019-20. “The United Guardians Association has been demanding this for long. Our stand has been validated. Even though only around 145 schools were party to the petition, there are thousands of private and aided schools in the state. Our protest would continue as we want such waiver to continue for at least two years because the effect of the pandemic will not fade overnight and the economy will take time to recover,” said Supriyo Bhattacharya, secretary of the association which represents guardians of students from 110 schools. The order also stated that there would be no increase in salaries of teachers or of other employees during the financial year 2020 – 21. “This is untenable and the schools would be in a very bad shape. It is indirectly asking the schools to close down,” said Nabarun De, joint secretary of the association of schools for the Indian School Certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/covid-19-relief-for-guardians-as-calcutta-high-court-slashes-school-fees-by-20/story-XaWBjA5jCAdgIxO2d40Z3J.html

14-10-2020||Bhopal||BJP turns Cong leader’s ‘Bhookhe Nange’ jibe at MP CM into #MaibhiShivraj campaign||A Congress leader’s use of an insulting phrase--‘Bhookhe-Nange ghar ka’ meaning from a very impoverished family-- to describe Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s alleged rags to riches story was turned into a political campaign by the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday, with the launch of a #MaibhiShivraj campaign on microblogging website Twitter. The campaign triggered a political debate in the run-up to the state legislative assembly bypolls to be held in 28 assembly constituencies on November 3 and elicited an expression of regret from the Congress leader who had made the remark. The insult was hurled at Chouhan by state Congress’ farmers’ cell president Dinesh Gurjar, while addressing an election meeting in Ashok Nagar area on Sunday.“Respected Kamal Nath is the second biggest industrialist of the country. He is not from a ‘Nange-bhookhe parivar’ like Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The latter used to have 5 acres of land. Now he has thousands of acres of land.” As the video clip went viral on social media, Chouhan responded with a tweet on Tuesday, “Now, Congressmen call me bhookha-nanga. They may stay blessed with their affluence. I am happy to serve people of Madhya Pradesh with seriousness and commitment.” Earlier, talking to journalists, Chouhan said, “Kamal Nath ji, I am bhookha-nanga. That’s why I started giving loan on zero percent interest rate to farmers, made a provision of an addition of Rs 4000 to PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, laptops to students and reintroduced Kanyadan scheme.” Also Read: Overburdened with a loan, farmer dies by suicide in MP’s Bundelkhand“We follow the ideology of our patriarch Pt Deendayal Upadhyay who had said that the service of the poor was the worship of God and that the poor had the first right over natural resources. Kamal Nath ji, you can call me a bhookha-nanga, but I will continue to work for uplifting the poor and for their rights,” Shivraj continued. The campaign on Twitter drew a good response with views expressed for and against Chouhan. Gurjar, however, soon expressed regret at the use of the insulting phrase but at the same time alleged that the phrase was quoted out of the context as part of a conspiracy.Also Read: HC directs MP admin to lodge FIRs against violators of Covid-19 protocol in political meetings“A selective part of my speech was made viral on social media as a part of conspiracy against me and my party. What I meant to say that Chouhan called himself a farmer but the fact remains that he amassed wealth after becoming the chief minister, whereas Kamal Nath ji really served the poor by giving them electricity for Rs 100 per month, waiving loans of farmers, Rs 51,000 grant for marriage of girls from poor families etc when he was the chief minister. However, if any particular phrase in my speech hurt the CM I regret the same.” State Congress spokesperson Durgesh Sharma said, “What Dinesh Gurjar said is being misinterpreted by BJP leaders for their political gains in the bypolls. The entire state has seen a tremendous rise in wealth of the CM in all these years. This found reflection in our farmers’ cell president’s speech.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/bjp-turns-cong-leader-s-bhooke-nange-jibe-at-mp-cm-into-maibhishivraj-campaign/story-toLXat0nLDuAnw2hOKKxcJ.html

It also mandates staggered entry and exits from cinema halls, including during intervals. Also Read: Let cinemas open from Oct 15: Delhi govt to L-GSanitisation of halls after each screening is also mandatory. Seats have to be left vacant for social distancing and marked with fluorescent markers. Crowding in lobbies, common areas, and lifts is barred.

14-10-2020||Kolkata||TMC-BJP war over farm laws triggers poll preparation in Bengal’s agrarian belts||The villages were a bastion of Left parties till a Trinamool Congress (TMC) wave changed the political landscape of West Bengal in 2011.Now, the 40,203 villages in the state have emerged as the priority for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the run-up to the assembly polls due in another six months. Launched on Tuesday, a new three-phase programme will be carried out by the BJP to reach out to the state’s farmers through interactive sessions, where party leaders will listen to their problems and convince them about the benefits of the new farm laws that were recently passed by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre. Also read: Six Union ministers, MPs to lead BJP’s outreach plan in West BengalTMC and Left leaders, who, too, are working on the ground to counter the BJP, feel that the saffron camp wants to make deeper inroads into the villages because they hold the key to get a majority in the 294-member Bengal legislative assembly. In the 2018 panchayat polls, which were marked by violence, the BJP could make dents only in a few rural pockets. However, the equation had changed in last year’s parliamentary elections after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. Each of these seats is made of seven assembly segments. According to the 2011 census, there are 40,203 villages in Bengal, where 68.13 % of the state’s 9.13 crore people lived. Bengal has 909 towns. The state’s current projected population is 10.09 crore. “Till October 15, we will visit farmlands and discuss people’s problems and the new laws. On October 16, meetings will be held in the BJP’s 14,000 shakti kendras (organisational centres) each of which will cover one panchayat samiti area. In the last phase, seminars will be held from October 18 to 20,” Mahadeb Sarkar, president of the state unit of the Kisan Morcha, the BJP’s peasants’ front, told HT. “The strategy for the seminars will be decided by the state leadership in Kolkata on Wednesday,” he added. On Tuesday, Sarkar met farmers in the Lalmath area in Nadia district’s Ranaghat North-West assembly constituency that the TMC had won in 2011 assembly and 2014 parliamentary elections with 54 % of the votes polled. The tables were turned last year and the BJP won the Ranaghat Lok Sabha seat with 53 % of the votes polled, a 35% increase over its last election result. The saffron camp is sensing an opportunity to go for an electoral kill in the assembly polls. “After the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had come to power in 1977, it had promised land ownership to farmers with the slogan ‘langol jar, jomi tar’ (land belongs to those who own the plough). But the farmers suffered because the CPI (M) did not formulate any substantial agricultural policy. The TMC followed suit, although it had won the 2011 polls on the strength of its agitation against acquisition of farmland for industries,” said Sarkar. “In sharp contrast, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took major steps for the benefit of farmers. PM Narendra Modi has taken it forward with the new farm laws and schemes such as Kisan credit card, Kisan Samman Nidhi etc. Farmers have suffered during the TMC regime because of middlemen. The Kisan Morcha is convincing farmers that Modi’s one-nation-one-market policy will transform their lives. The BJP will reap the benefits of our efforts,” said Sarkar. The analysis of last year’s parliamentary election results showed that the biggest contribution to the BJP’s performance came from the vote bank of the CPI (M) and its partners. Out of 40 Left candidates in the race, 39 failed to secure one-sixth of the votes cast in their respective seats. The direct beneficiary was the BJP. CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury had admitted the electoral trend as well. This huge shift in Left votes was seen in agricultural belts as well, including those where the BJP could not win. For example, at the TMC stronghold in Contai in East Midnapore district, two-time TMC Member of Parliament (MP) Sisir Adhikari got 50% of the votes polled, and the BJP’s Debasish Samanta and CPI(M)’s Paritosh Pattanayak had bagged 42% and 5.3% of the votes polled, respectively. In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the CPI (M) had come second after it secured 34.72 % of the votes polled in the Contai parliamentary seat. CPI(M) Politburo member Md Salim has been campaigning in the agrarian belts of South Dinajpur, Malda and other districts against the farm laws and the TMC’s policies since last week. “We have seen a good turnout at our meetings. The BJP and the Kisan Morcha have the advantage of using the network of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Small groups of four–five people are visiting the homes of farmers. However, the poaching won’t help the BJP. The farm laws will become its Achilles heel,” Salim told HT from a village in Malda. “Land is a precious thing. Mamata Banerjee’s campaign against us at Singur (the site of the aborted small car project by the Tata Group) and Nandigram (the site of a proposed chemical hub) helped her win in 2011. But she did nothing for those farmers. No project came up at these places. Land that had helped her win will also lead to her loss. The Left-Congress alliance will be the main contender against the TMC in next year’s assembly polls,” said Salim. The TMC, too, is campaigning against the BJP, especially in the north Bengal districts, where the BJP had won seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats last year. Former CPI(M) Rajya Sabha (RS) member Ritabrata Banerjee, who is now a part of the TMC’s state committee, is campaigning in north Bengal’s Alipurduar district. “The new farm laws have created fear in the agrarian belts. It is no small thing that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which was all along an ally of the BJP, left the NDA. In Bengal, farmers have staged agitation. We are telling them that these laws may lead to a food crisis,” said Banerjee. A formal campaign might not help the BJP win votes in the agrarian belts, said Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay. “Telling people what is good and what is bad does not work in our villages. The BJP, or any party for that matter, has to listen to their grievances and understand their feelings. In both Singur and Nandigram, it was the local population that had started the agitation. They already knew the problem. Mamata Banerjee only took it forward,” said Bandopadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-bjp-war-over-farm-laws-triggers-poll-preparation-in-bengal-s-agrarian-belts/story-FNsjU3crDf5Wdoj2Ay9cPJ.html

14-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Tej Pratap shifts seat to stronghold Hasanpur||Jailed Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son and former health minister Tej Pratap Yadav on Tuesday filed his nomination papers for the Hasanpur assembly seat in Samastipur district, switching his constituency from Mahua in Vaishali district.Tej Pratap was accompanied by his younger brother and leader of the opposition Tejas-hwi Prasad Yadav when he submitted his nomination form. “My elder brother has filed his nomination for the Hasanpur seat as there was a demand {that he do so} from the people of this constituency. He will win with a big margin,” Tejashwi said.He said the perception that his elder brother had changed his constituency for fear of losing Mahua was false. “Tej Pratap, as Mahua MLA, has worked for development of the constituency by bringing in a medical college and also initiating road projects worth ₹900 crore during his tenure. He has changed his seat because people of Hasanpur wanted it,” he said.The leader of the opposition is due to file his nomination form for re-election to the Raghopur seat on Wednesday.Hasanpur, an RJD stronghold, is considered a safe seat for Tej Pratap as it has sizeable number of Yadav and Muslim minority voters as well as the scheduled caste community – the traditional vote base of the RJD.RJD insiders said one important reason why Tej Pratap switched his constituency were based on feedback from the ground that the 32-year-old lawmaker had a low winnability quotient in Mahua as a section of voters, mainly Yadavs, were not happy him.Tej Pratap’s decision to divorce his wife Aishwariya Rai in November 2018 and Rai’s accusation that she was ill-treated has left the party’s core voters unhappy, people familiar with the details said. “There are family reasons behind Tej Pratap’s decision to shift to Hasanpur,” said a senior RJD leader close to the RJD chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-tej-pratap-shifts-seat-to-stronghold-hasanpur/story-1wRLpGXZD0gvGfZn2m5MgK.html
14-10-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: Nitish intensifies attack on Oppn as poll battle heats up||Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday held up Bihar’s record of development during his 15 years in power and took a swipe at the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and its leader Tejashwi Yadav, as he sought another mandate for his coalition government in the three-phase assembly elections.“See our work and see your record in your 15 years of rule. We know how to do work and how to get it done by others. On the other hand, there are people who don’t have any experience...what is needed in Bihar, they have neither any idea nor any experience to perform,” Kumar said in a speech by video link to 24 constituencies that will vote in the first phase on October 28. Tejashwi has promised to create one million jobs in Bihar and qualitatively transform health-care and other social sectors if the RJD’s alliance with the Congress and smaller parties is voted to power — a claim Nitish Kumar ridiculed.“In their 15 years’ rule, 95,734 government jobs were created. And it includes the period when Jharkhand was part of Bihar. From 2005 till date, we have provided 6.8 lakh government jobs,” said the CM , whose Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). “Is there any province in the world which can claim to provide government jobs to all the youth?”A survey conducted in February 2006, after he came to power towards the end of 2005, had shown that only 39 people on average used to visit a primary health centre in Bihar in a month, Nitish Kumar claimed. “The figure now stands at 10,000 visitors per month because of substantive improvements in the health-care system,” he said.The CM claimed credit for opening an engineering college in every Bihar district, connecting villages with concrete roads, bringing them electricity and improving farmers’ incomes.Kumar added that his government had worked for the welfare of all, irrespective of caste and religion.“For us, the service of people is the biggest religion while for others, getting material benefits is the religion,” he said.He reaffirmed that if given another chance, his government would unroll Saat Nischay (seven resolves) Part 2 to develop Bihar further.In Part 1, launched during his 2015-20 term, comprised schemes to ensure basic amenities such as piped drinking water, functional toilets, sewerage and electricity.The second part will focus on enhancing the skills of the young people to brighten their jobs prospects, promoting entrepreneurship among women, and reinforcing irrigation systems and health services, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-nitish-intensifies-attack-on-oppn-as-poll-battle-heats-up/story-J6RRomVCC7xiFFEckawP4O.html

14-10-2020||Chandigarh||With AQI crossing 300, five Haryana cities fare worse than Delhi||The air quality of Faridabad, Charkhi Dadri, Panipat, Kurukshetra, and Jind was worse than the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi on Tuesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. While AQI between 0 to 50 is considered good, 51 to 100 is satisfactory, 101 to 200 moderate, 201 to 300 poor, 301 to 400 very poor and 401 to 500 severe, as per the CPCB norms. On Tuesday evening, the AQI of five cities-- Faridabad, Charkhi Dadari, Panipat, Kurukshetra, and Jind-- crossed 300 points and the air quality was put in the category of “Very Poor.” On the other hand, the average AQI of Delhi was 300 points. However, the CPCB data says, the AQI of certain parts of Delhi such as Rohini, Narela, Dwarka, Kirti Nagar, Wazirpur, and Lajpat Nagar was also categorised as “very poor” with the AQI of these areas going past 300 points. The quality of air in other Haryana cities like Karnal, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Hisar, Sonepat, Gurugram, Bahadurgarh and Manesar was described as “poor” on Tuesday after the AQI crossed 200 points. According to S Narayanan, member secretary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the air quality report of Monday was also poor. “The AQI is going towards poor levels. In Karnal and Kurukshetra, stubble burning seems one of the key reasons, but in Gurugram and Faridabad, there are local factors responsible for the pollution,” Narayanan said, assuring that the state government was taking all necessary steps to improve AQI. The air quality of cities falling under districts, such as Bhiwani and Rohtak, having very small areas under paddy cultivation, was better than the areas under paddy cultivation, clearly pointing that stubble burning was the main cause of pollution here. The analysis of the data points towards a steady surge in farm fires, affecting the quality of air in Haryana cities, especially those under paddy belts of the state. Until Monday evening, 158 new incidents of Active Fire Locations were detected by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) in the state, increasing the total number of farm fires to 1,264 since September 25 when the monitoring began. According to HSPCB data, the per-day average of active fire locations has increased to over 150. Kurukshetra district topped the chart with 260 incidents, followed by Karnal (238), Ambala (172) Kaithal (170), Fatehabad (102), Yamunanagar (92), Jind (90), Sonepat (42), Hisar (41), Sirsa (17) Palwal (16), Panipat (15) and Panchkula 11 till October 12. Apart from farm fires, industrial pollution too is adding to the problem in Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonipat, Karnal, Panipat, and Yamunanagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-aqi-crossing-300-five-haryana-cities-fare-worse-than-delhi/story-bL9Dp1tk5i10rwrKOP7BuL.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Choking NCR districts: Haryana gets into action after EPCA highlights violations leading to pollution||It is learnt that the EPCA chairman Dr Bhure Lal, during a video conference with top-rung bureaucrats on September 28, had presented photographs of violations in Gurugram, Sonepat, Panipat, and Faridabad that were leading to pollution, and stated that he would visit these districts in October to review the situation. This meeting, as per government functionaries, had set the ball rolling after which a number of activities were started under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).Government sources say the state government has given a collective assurance that the deficiencies indicated in the NCR areas will be rectified and the hotspots in other areas of NCR districts of Haryana will also be identified by the district administration to address the issues. Detailed directions were issued to the deputy commissioners (DCs) of NCR districts to tackle pollution issues on priority. The DCs were asked to focus on dust control measures, solid waste management and prevention of bio mass burning, controlling industrial pollution, regulating diesel generators and control of vehicular pollution. According to S Narayanan, member secretary of the HSPCB, a number of activities are being undertaken by the DCs under GRAP. “Construction and demolition activities are one of the primary factors behind air pollution in the NCR districts,” said Narayanan, assuring that every necessary step was being taken to contain air pollution. “But the reports of air quality index are not satisfactory,” he added. In a recent communication to all the DCs of NCR districts, the HSPCB had said that as suggested by the Central Pollution Control Board, the builders may be advised to submit another undertaking that they would cover the construction materials and use the sprinklers and anti-smog guns regularly, failing which their projects will be liable to be stopped. The HSPCB has directed Gurugram and Faridabad districts for special emphasis on ensuring that builders cover the construction project sites and sprinkle water wherever necessary, while asking to act against violators without fail to ensure proper dust management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/choking-ncr-districts-haryana-gets-into-action-after-epca-highlights-violations-leading-to-pollution/story-7TXOJoWg3TQZYqb72556FJ.html
14-10-2020||City||Mumbai power outage: Few areas may see power cuts for 2 more days||Parts of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane are likely to see power cuts for the next 48 hours as repair works on the Kalwa-Talegaon line – one of the four main transmission lines that supply power to Mumbai and its adjoining areas and which tripped on Monday leading to power outage in the city – will take two more days, officials from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said on Tuesday. Millions were inconvenienced on Monday as the outage due to grid failure brought the city to a standstill. While the Kalwa-Talegaon line snapped on Saturday, the Kalwa-Padghe line-1 tripped on Monday morning leading to excess load on the Kalwa-Padghe line-2, which tripped at 9.58am. Electricity supply was restored in the eastern suburbs, Navi Mumbai and Thane only after midnight, while several consumers also complained of repeated power cuts in their locality. CM Uddhav Thackeray ordered a probe into the incident, even as experts stressed the need to augment Mumbai’s power capacity. Officials said the conductor fitted to the Kalwa-Talegaon line on hilly terrains snapped and fell into the valley on October 10. Dinesh Waghmare, managing director, MSEDCL said, “Our team is working there continuously, but intermittent rain is delaying the process.” At midnight, state energy minister Nitin Raut said the staff was working on a war footing to restore power in parts of Mulund, Thane and Navi Mumbai. He had earlier said the areas did not receive power supply as around 500MW of Tata Power plant was not in sync with the system yet. Later he tweeted, “Tata’s generation started and picking up. I am personally monitoring the situation and assure you that it will gain momentum in an hour.” On Tuesday, sources from Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) and Tata Power said there were no major complaints of power cuts. “If one line fails, the rest can take the load. But unfortunately on Monday, there was a cascading effect,” Waghmare said. An official from the Maharashtra State Energy Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) said that works on both the Kalwa-Padghe lines were completed. Dr Ashok Pendse, a noted power expert, said, “It is important to strengthen the transmission system as 40-50% of Mumbai’s power supply is generated outside the city. A 400-KV additional line is also required to meet the increasing need and we need to probe why Tata’s islanding system did not function.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-power-outage-few-areas-may-see-power-cuts-for-2-more-days/story-zTENX60k8wjmPb3OLjZgoK.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers accept Centre’s talks offer, meeting today||Punjab farm bodies and unions protesting the passage of three farm bills in the monsoon session of parliament will meet the secretary, Union ministry of agriculture, at Krishi Bhawan on Wednesday to discuss the issue. As many as 29 of 30 farm bodies protesting since September 24 reached a consensus and nominated seven spokespersons for the talks. The Majha-based Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee decided to stay away from the dialogue claiming it was an attempt to divide farmers because farm unions from other states were not part of the talks. “In the marathon meeting that lasted for about five hours in Chandigarh, all issues were discussed threadbare. We have decided to use the opportunity the best possible way and will press the Centre for repeal of three farm bills passed hurriedly; minimum support price on all crops be made a constitutional right: and assured and open-ended procurement,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakounda. He is one of the seven members who will represent the farmers. “However, our protest will continue. We will not lift the blockade on railway tracks, toll plazas and business establishments,” added Patiala. He said the delegation will also remind the secretary of the NDA government’s promise to implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan commission. However, BKU (Ugrahan-Ekta), the largest farmer body, has decided to remove the blockage on railway tracks after an appeal by the Punjab government to allow movement of good trains so that supply of essential commodities to and from the state isn’t disrupted. Justifying decision for talks with the Centre, Balbir Singh Rajewal, BKU (Rajewal) chief, said that participants in Tuesday’s meeting decided that it is wise to initiate dialogue. “Let us see how our issues are dealt. If talks take place in conducive environment we will move further; otherwise we have the option to stage a walkout,” he added. The farm bodies are scheduled to meet on October 15, after the return of the representatives from Delhi to work out the next course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-accept-centre-s-talks-offer-meeting-today/story-ry9VvHG7kek6ed1pSdVJ0I.html
14-10-2020||City||Power supply in Mumbai Metropolitan Region fully restored, will check if there was sabotage behind outage: Maharashtra minister||Stating that the power supply to Mumbai has been fully restored, Maharashtra energy minister Nitin Raut on Tuesday expressed the possibility of flaws and failures in following protocol at administrative level during Monday’s power outage. Besides the probe into the power failure, the minister said they were checking if there was any sabotage attempt. Excerpts from an interview with HT:Some parts of MMR are still facing power cuts. Why has the government not been able to fully restore power supply? Mumbai’s peak hour requirement is 2700MW, which has been fulfilled now and the electricity supply has fully been restored. A few areas may be still facing outage because of the repair and maintenance works by private companies. Our officers have been constantly monitoring the situation. We restored the electricity in a record time of 3.5 hours, which otherwise would have required 8 hours. There are allegations that administrative negligence and failure to manage the snag led to the power failure… We have been examining various aspects that are expected to be responsible [for the outage]. Prima facie, the protocol for periodic maintenance and preventive measures does not appear to have been followed. Proper monitoring between two lines for load maintenance during the repair [was needed as] maintenance of one line was not done. This resulted in tripping of the second line as due arrangements did not appear to have been taken for the additional load on the second line. It needs to be seen if the snapping of the jumpers and conductors could have been averted by having pre-studied their previous records. Snapping of the conductors in remote parts of Talegaon (on Kalwa-Talegaon line) might have been the result of lack of proper patrolling using drones in these densely forested areas. It also needs to be seen if overload indication before tripping of the second line on Kalwe-Padghe line was received at our control room... Does this mean administrative flaws have been found and caused the outage? I have asked the department to submit me the preliminary report on this. We are expecting it in a day or two, until then I cannot comment if it was negligence. Private companies are also alleging there was no proper communication from the government companies and it led to failure on their side... Yes, there was a communication gap between our entities and private companies. The probe will also check if the protocols while dealing with such a situation were followed. Not only this, I have also asked to check if there was an attempt of sabotage which led to the outage. We will also check if the ongoing power war between private companies had any link with the incident. The islanding system, which has been boasted about in the past, did not work during Monday’s crisis. What is the reason? There were multiple failures in transmission lines resulting in load on lines of Tata Power and Adani Electricity. This was the major reason why the islanding did not work. The Khaparde committee report submitted to the government in June 2011 after a similar power failure in November 2011 had suggested strengthening the transmission system in Mumbai... Augmenting the transmission lines will cost ₹4,000 crore, which will result in burdening consumers to recover it. We do not think it is required at this juncture as we have been able to supply power without any disruption. Secondly, we have also asked the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission for their advice on it. Why was the report not implemented in the past nine years? I have asked the department to make a presentation on the recommendations on the committee report. We will prepare an action taken report which will be implemented in a time-bound manner. Consumers are waiting for government’s decision on exorbitant bills raised during the Covid-19 lockdown. There were reports that the government was mulling 20-30% discount... They are not exorbitant bills. The bills were issued on the average unit load in the absence of actual meter reading due to the lockdown. Disputes related to the reading can be resolved anytime. We haven’t so far decided on the discount on these bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/power-supply-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-fully-restored-will-check-if-there-was-sabotage-behind-outage-maharashtra-minister/story-RsuMYGm3graOGZGebKSJkJ.html

At least 25 people allegedly carrying kisan union flags had attacked Sharma’s car and broke the front and rear windshields, though the BJP’s state chief called it an attack by the Congress government. The police had grabbed the CCTV footage of the incident from Cholang toll plaza which showed some flag-bearing persons charging towards Sharma’s car as it slowed down. However, none of the attackers has been identified so far. Sharma said he was often greeted with slogans by the protesters whenever he passed through the dharna site on his way to Pathankot, but never faced such a violent situation. “I can say this with certainty that assailants could not be farmers. It is the handiwork of Captain Amarinder Singh,” he had told the media after the incident. It is pertinent to mention here that some farmers’ organisations have put up a permanent dharna at the toll plaza for the last several days. The FIR has been registered under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 427 (mischief causing damage), 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) besides various sections of the National Highways Act.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Navjot Mahal said an investigation was going on.Party workers protest outside mini secretariat Meanwhile, BJP workers on Tuesday staged a protest in front of mini secretariat against the attack on party’s state chief.

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police issue show-cause notice to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami||Mumbai Police have sent a show-cause notice to Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, asking him why a chapter proceeding under section 108 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) should not be initiated against him. The three page notice was issued on October 10.Sudhir Jambavdekar, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) (Worli division), who has issued the notice, has asked Goswami to remain present before him on Friday. Jambavdekar, a special executive magistrate, confirmed the development, but refused to further comment.Republic Media Network, in a statement released late on Tuesday night, stated, “In the continuing malicious attempt to muzzle and intimidate Republic Media Network, the Mumbai Police has now issued a show-cause notice against Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami for raising questions in the Palghar lynching case and the shocking mega gathering amidst Covid-19 lockdown in Bandra, Mumbai. The summons as well as the show-cause notice issued to Arnab Goswami reeks of an openly spiteful and deeply motivated witch hunt by the state government of Maharashtra against a free press that holds the political dispensation accountable.” The statement further read, “The agenda of the Mumbai Police is crystal clear, given the fact that their latest show-cause notice stands in complete violation of the orders of the courts of law. It is in the public domain and well-documented thereof that the honourable Supreme Court of India and honourable Bombay high court, both, passed orders on Arnab Goswami’s broadcast of the Palghar and Bandra incident cases. The legal facts must be reiterated so as to serve proof of the motivated agenda by the state machinery against Republic. The specific facts are as follows: The hon’ble Supreme Court in its judgment dated May 19 held that no other complaint can be initiated in respect of the Palghar broadcast of April 21. The Supreme Court in its order had observed “the need to ensure that the criminal process does not assume the character of a vexatious exercise by the institution of multifarious complaints founded on the same cause in multiple states” and extended protection “against any coercive steps arising out of and in relation to the” FIRs till a legal remedy was sought in the Bombay high court. The hon’ble Bombay high court judgment of June 30 suspended all criminal proceedings in respect to the FIRs registered against Arnab Goswami, based on the Palghar and Bandra news reports. The Bombay high court, staying the two FIRs filed by Mumbai Police against Arnab Goswami observed: “We cannot have the spectacle of a Damocles’ sword hanging over the head of a journalist while conducting a public debate. India is now a mature democracy“, and stated that “no coercive steps shall be taken against the petitioner”. Therefore, the summons and show-cause notice issued by the executive magistrate, who is also the assistant commissioner of police, Mumbai (Worli), has no legal basis and is in contempt of court orders.” “Republic Media Network officially states that we will leave no stone unturned to take every legal step available to fight the malicious agenda,” the statement concluded. The notice (of which HT has a copy) refers to the objectionable coverage of two incidents – the lynching of sadhus at Palghar and the gathering of migrants outside Bandra station during lockdown – and stated that Goswani and his channel gave a “communal colour” to the incidents and tried to “incite communal tension between Hindu and Muslims”. The notice further stated that Goswami’s channel “spreads caste and communal tension”, which can “easily be seen from the extremely abusive, communal and hateful comments from the viewers of videos of the shows on YouTube”.Goswami has two first information reports (FIRs) registered against him at NM Joshi Marg and Pydhonie police stations in which similar offences have been mentioned for “inciting hatred and communal tension between two religious groups or communities”.A senior inspector of NM Joshi Marg police station sent a proposal to Jambavdekar, seeking preventive action against Goswami. Acting on the proposal, Jambavdekar initiated the process.Goswami will have to provide satisfactory reasons on why a preventive action should not be taken against him.If the ACP does not find Goswami’s response satisfactory, he can initiate chapter proceedings against the latter and the editor-in-chief would have to sign a legal security bond for good behaviour for a year. In case he violates the bond, he would then have to pay penalty Rs10 lakh. He would also have to pledge that he would not indulge in any act of dissemination of seditious matter. Goswami has to produce a person as ‘security’ who would take responsibility of his behaviour for the period mentioned in the bond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-issue-show-cause-notice-to-republic-tv-editor-in-chief-arnab-goswami/story-jIOfvRCEvVKn1EO1SYRW8I.html

In a statement, Sukhbir called the attack the work of “anti-social forces who wanted to sabotage the ongoing kisan agitation against the agricultural marketing laws”. He said nothing could be achieved by resorting to violent activities. “Those resorting to such attacks can never be well-wishers of the farming community,” he added. The SAD president also asked the Congress government to come down heavily on anti-social forces that were being used to defame the farmers’ cause and not encourage them in any manner whatsoever. “We are very clear that farmers cannot indulge in any such actions and we will oppose any attempt to blame them,” Sukhbir said. Call spl emergency session: SAD to speakerThe SAD’s legislative wing on Tuesday asked Vidhan Sabha speaker Rana KP Singh to call a special emergency session to enact new legislation to make the entire state a “single marketing yard”, annul the amended APMC Act of 2017, and announce that three central agriculture laws will not be implemented in Punjab. In a representation to the speaker, the SAD MLAs led by legislature party leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said the new agriculture laws were an attack on the federal structure and the state assembly should act like a bulwark to ensure the powers of the states were safeguarded. “We cannot stand as mute spectators when the powers of the state are being steadily diluted,” they told the speaker. Claiming that Punjab and Punjabis were facing an existential crisis, the Akali legislators, including Bikram Singh Majithia and Gurpartap Singh Wadala, told the speaker “the time to save the annadaata from utter ruin is now”. They said this could be done by enacting a legislation to safeguard the farmers of Punjab from the ill-effects of the agriculture laws. Govt trying to sabotage farmers’ struggle: AAPThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh of indulging in ‘skullduggery’ by unsuccessfully trying to ‘torpedo’ the farmers’ struggle against the three new laws.In a statement here, AAP MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Budhram said their party would not allow the Congress government to succeed in its ‘evil designs’. “The state government has been repeatedly stating that there was an acute shortage of essential commodities due to the ‘rail roko’, but it should tell us about the steps it took to prevent it because the farm organisations had announced their agitation months ago,” they said.Sandhwan said the chief minister should have taken care of all the essentials well before the farmers’ agitation, and sought his resignation for ‘failing’ to run a government. Videoconference with farmers a sham: Former minister MannDescribing the videoconference between Union ministers and farmers a sham, former Punjab minister and chairman of Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Joginder Singh Mann on Tuesday questioned why didn’t the Union government do this exercise before passing the “anti-farmer” ordinances.In a statement issued here, Mann said this was a futile attempt to mislead the farmers and arhtiyas. “Had the central government been sincere, then it would have passed the ordinance after due consultation with the farmers,” he added.He also slammed the Centre for not releasing the state’s share of GST despite several reminders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sukhbir-slams-attack-on-bjp-state-chief-says-no-place-for-violence-in-democracy/story-ZbkGMBgiWFvLaWT751Ro4N.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Jannayak Janata Party’s Haryana chief Nishan Singh tests positive for Covid-19||A week after Haryana deputy chief minister and Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader Dushyant Chautala tested positive for Covid-19, his party’s state unit chief Nishan Singh on Tuesday announced that he has tested positive for coronavirus infection, too. In a tweet, Nishan Singh urged all those who had come in contact with him over the past few days to get themselves tested. “I will remain in home isolation and can’t meet anyone for the next 14 days,” he said.

14-10-2020||City||Justice eludes us, sacrilege incidents haven’t stopped in Punjab, say Behbal Kalan firing victims’ families||The families of Gurjeet Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who were killed in the police firing at Faridkot district’s Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, say justice has not been delivered to them while the incidents of sacrilege continue to happen unabated in Punjab. Gurjeet, a resident of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan of Niamiwala village in the district, were protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari village two days earlier. Disappointed over delay in the delivery of justice, Krishan Bhagwan’s son Sukhraj Singh said, “Even five years after my father died protesting against the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib, such incidents have not stopped in Punjab. A sacrilege incident happened at Fathegarh Sahib on the same day (October 12) five years after the Bargari sacrilege.” “This is the result of delay in justice as the criminals have no fear of law. Those responsible for my father’s death are roaming freely. Even the policemen booked in the case are out on bail. We will continue to fight until justice is delivered. The probe by the special investigation team (SIT) recently picked some pace, giving us some hope. We are going to hold ‘shaheedi samagam’ at Behbal Kalan on Wednesday in the memory of my father and Gurjeet Singh,” he added. Gurjeet’s father Sadhu Singh said, “The Badals and the Congress are equally responsible as they have failed to provide justice to my son during their tenures. The recent sacrilege incidents have pained us more. ” “The Sikh organisations have done nothing to get justice in the past few years,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/justice-eludes-us-sacrilege-incidents-haven-t-stopped-say-behbal-kalan-firing-victims-families/story-1t8dmbyWk1pGf4jYU4mzWJ.html

14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Bar Council announces association polls on November 6||The Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH) has announced district Bar association polls on November 6. It also set aside the notification for Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association (PHHCBA) polls for October 24 put out by the election committee head, senior advocate KS Sidhu. BCPH chairman Karanjit Singh said the notification was in violation of norms as the elections for district Bars in both the states and Chandigarh and high court Bar have to take place on the same date. Earlier too, the HC Bar body and Bar Council had locked horns over online elections announced by Bar Council for September 30 and October 1. Subsequently, the matter reached the high court and election notification was quashed. Bar Council is a statutory body which regulates entry into legal profession and has nearly 1 lakh members in the two states and Chandigarh. The HC Bar has about 4,000 members practising in the high court. A section of HC Bar lawyers feels that Council has no role to play in the poll process of the high court Bar.

14-10-2020||City||Five years on, probe into police firing at Faridkot’s Behbal Kalan, Kotkapura still a work in progress||The investigation into the October 2015 Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura police firing episodes, which sparked statewide protests, seems to have reached no conclusion so far with the special investigation team (SIT) having filed as many as six chargesheets in the cases. Two Sikh protesters— Gurjeet Singh of Sarawan village and Krishan Bhagwan Singh of Niamiwala village in Faridkot district— were killed during the protest at Behbal Kalan. The SIT recently named the then director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini as accused in both the firing incidents. It has named a total of 11 people, including nine police personnel, as accused, with one of the cops turning approver. What happened on Oct 14, 2015 The police teams opened fire on the people protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura on October 14, 2015. Gurjeet Singh and Krishan Bhagwan Singh, who died in the firing, had joined the villagers holding a demonstration at the Behbal Kalan bus stand against the sacrilege incident at Bargari two days earlier. Also, many people were seriously injured in the firing which started at around 3am at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan around 9:30am. Gurjeet sustained three bullet injuries, including one in the head, while Bhagwan Krishan received four bullets. What triggered the protests A ‘bir’ (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) was stolen from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on June 1, 2015, triggering outrage. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari village. After the sacrilege incident, the residents of the town and nearby villages started protesting at Kotkapura. Soon, Sikh protestors from other districts started gathering at Kotkapura following which additional police force from Moga, Bathinda and Ferozepur districts was sent to Faridkot. Later, a unit led by now suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umaranagal (then Ludhiana police commissioner), who is also an accused on the case. The situation got tense after police attempted to remove the protesters from dharna site at Kotkapura and later at Behbal Kalan, which resulted in the firing. How things panned out Soon after the firing episode, the police lodged two FIRs against the protesters and justified the firing as an act of self-defence. Faced with anger among the Sikhs following the death of two protesters, the then Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government formed an SIT led by then ADGP IPS Sahota to probe the sacrilege and firing incidents. An FIR was lodged against unidentified police personnel in the Behbal Kalan firing on October 21 at the Bajakhana police station. Also, the government formed a commission led by Justice (retd) Zora Singh to probe the sacrilege incidents. Besides, a ‘peoples’ commission’ headed by Justice Markandey Katju (retd) also probed the incidents and blamed the police for an “excessive use of force on innocent people”. The SAD-BJP coalition’s defeat in the 2017 assembly elections was attributed largely to the sacrilege and police firing by political observers as the issues were raked up the opposition. The new Congress government headed by Capt Amarinder Singh formed the Justice (retd) Ranjit Singh commission whose report was tabled in the assembly a year later. A resolution was passed to take back the sacrilege cases from the CBI and a SIT was constituted to probe the police firing incidents. The Ranjit Singh commission indicted the cops in its probe report. An FIR (number 129) was registered at the Kotkapura police station against unidentified police personnel on August 7, 2018, in connection with the Kotkapura incident. Former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal and actor Akshay Kumar appeared before the SIT in November that year. The SIT probe The SIT found that the cops opened fire on the peaceful protesters on Umaranagal’s direction and later conspired to fabricate the evidence to cover up the incidents. So far, the SIT has named Saini, Umaranagal, former Moga SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma and ex-SHO Gurdeep Singh Pandher as accused in both the cases. While former Akali MLA Mantar Singh Brar, then ADCP Paramjit Singh Pannu and SP Baljit Singh are accused in the Kotkapura case, SP Bikramjit Singh, former SHO Amarjit Singh Kular, Pankaj Bansal and Suhail Singh Brar are accused Behbal Kalan firing case. Inspector Pardeep Singh, who was one of the accused, has now turned an approver. What next The SIT is preparing to file a final chargesheet in the police firing cases. A strong legal battle awaits ahead as more than a dozen writ petitions moved by the accused with demands, including that of changing SIT member IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap, are pending in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The cases are at the stage of framing charges in the trial court at Faridkot. The SIT is exploring options to nab Saini, who was named as accused in both cases recently, as he has seven-day notice protection from the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/behbal-kalan-kotkapura-episodes-5-years-on-probe-into-police-firing-still-a-work-in-progress/story-rUW7IvaeqtvDcD7uduM3NI.html
14-10-2020||City||SAD’s Sangrur women wing chief booked for extortion||The president of Shiromani Akali Dal’s (SAD’s) Sangrur women wing (rural), Paramjit Kaur Virk, has been booked on the charges of extortion, Barnala police said on Tuesday, adding that four persons have also been arrested in the case. Virk is currently at large, the police said, though it has been learnt that she has tendered her resignation, claiming that she was being falsely implicated. The district leadership of the SAD, meanwhile, refused to comment on the issue. Those arrested have been identified as Makhan Singh, 44; Gourav Kumar, 24; Paramjit Kaur, 37; and Gurwinder Kaur, 48. Barnala Sadar station house officer (SHO) Baljit Singh said the accused had reportedly called the complainant, a resident of Patiala district, to Handiaya village and “clicked his pictures in a compromising position with a woman”. The Patiala man then submitted a complaint to the Barnala senior superintendent of police (SSP). “The accused also demanded ₹10 lakh from him and took away ₹20,000 from his wallet,” the SHO said. The FIR mentions that the accused had also called the complainant to a party’s meeting on August 25 and threatened to circulate his video. “The accused even made me sign some documents related to my car,” the complainant told the police. The FIR against all the accused has been registered under sections 386 (extortion), 392 (robbery), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Barnala Sadar police station. “Four accused were arrested on Sunday and their police remand has been secured. However, we are conducting raids to arrest Paramjit Kaur Virk,” the SHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-s-sangrur-women-wing-chief-booked-for-extortion/story-NpE3pAllsjyz2FGP227D5M.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||Fatka gangs re-emerge in Mumbai after a lull during lockdown, 3 members held by Wadala GRP||After a lull in criminal activity because of the Covid-19 lockdown, fatka gangs have returned to the Mumbai suburban railway tracks, even before the train services are fully restored. Three members of one such gang known to attack and rob commuters on trains were arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP) at Wadala.The three accused, identified as Mohammed Bilal Shaikh, 25, Allauddin Shaikh, 20, and Tareef Mandal, 27, were arrested after commuter Omkar Prashant Kulkarni immediately informed GRP officers at Reay Road railway station about being hit with a stick, and robbed of his mobile phone. The incident occurred when Kulkarni, a resident of Ambarnath, was travelling with his friend Swapnil Gadak from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to Wadala and was standing on the footboard and talking on his phone. The train was about to reach Reay Road station when Kulkarni was hit on his hand, and his mobile phone fell near the tracks. When the train reached Reay Road station, Kulkarni informed the constables at the platform. “Kulkarni directed them to the spot where he saw one of the accused trying to escape. The constables chased the accused and arrested them,” said Rajendra Pal, senior inspector, Wadala GRP. During questioning of the accused, GRP officers discovered that the three were arrested for a similar crime in 2018, in which a passenger, Ketan Vitthal Vadendra, 38, had lost his life. “The three had been arrested for similar offences in 2016, 2017 and then in 2018 when a commuter died after he fell off the train when he was hit by Mohammed,” added Pal.Mohammed and his accomplices were charged with murder at the time, but they managed to get bail and continued to repeat the same offence. “There seems to be no deterrent. Robbing mobile phones from commuters travelling on crowded trains has become easy money for these gang members, who disappear into slums or thickets along the railway tracks,” said Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fatka-gangs-re-emerge-in-mumbai-after-a-lull-during-lockdown-3-members-held-by-wadala-grp/story-PQLpTJvu3dsWnwoiRziJgN.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: 12.5 lakh faulty RT-PCR test kits in Maharashtra, to be replaced, says Health minister Rajesh Tope||Maharashtra has 12.5 lakh faulty RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) faulty test kits in circulation, said state health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday. Confirming that these kits were purchased by the government from a private company, Tope said tests done using these kits have revealed a lower positivity rate, and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, has pointed out that these kits were faulty. Tope said the government has stopped the supply of these kits with immediate effect and action will be taken against the company. “The only option that remains now is that companies supplying such kits should be blacklisted,” he said, adding that the faulty kits will be replaced by ones supplied by NIV so that testing in the regions where these kits were distributed does not stop. The minister said a team of experts from NIV will also be appointed to verify procurement of kits, to ensure such an incident does not recur. Citing that testing is a crucial aspect in the battle against Covid-19, Tope said any sensitivity of such kits below the positivity rate of 27% will lead to erroneous results. “The state government will exercise full vigilance in this regard,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-5-lakh-faulty-rt-pcr-test-kits-in-maharashtra-to-be-replaced-health-minister-rajesh-tope/story-P3P1lVa3Uh61ACq4zLyjiN.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||Row between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and CM Uddhav Thackeray may not end soon||Although chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s response to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s letter on reopening of places of worship was a bit surprising, it was not unexpected. The tussle between Raj Bhavan and Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has been going on for the past seven months. The letter war between the two people occupying constitutional posts is an outcome of the same.The uneasy relations between governor Koshyari, a former BJP leader and ex-CM of Uttarakhand, started with the formation of the MVA government in November 2019. While the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP were trying to cobble up a coalition, they were shocked when BJP tried to form government with a breakaway faction led by NCP’s Ajit Pawar. The Sena targeted Koshyari for recommending lifting of the President’s Rule in the state and administering oath to Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar as the CM and deputy CM early morning. The experiment failed; the three-party coalition formed the government.The first major friction between the MVA government and governor was witnessed in April, when the latter refused to accept the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to the state legislative Council. Thackeray was facing a constitutional issue as he had to get elected to either of the two houses of legislature within six months of swearing in as the CM. As elections to nine seats of the Council could not be held due to the pandemic, the cabinet recommended Thackeray be nominated to the Council by the governor as one of the 12 members who are nominated to the upper house every six years. The 12 governor-nominated seats are meant for people from different fields such as literature, social service, education, art, etc and these berths are vacant. MVA wanted Koshyari to make an exception due to the unprecedented health crisis. Koshyari refused to accept the cabinet’s recommendation, leading to MVA criticising his intentions. It was only after Thackeray reached out to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, a solution was worked out. The governor wrote to EC and the election for nine seats was announced. The parties reached a consensus on not holding a contest. BJP bagged four seats, NCP-Sena two each, while Congress got one. Thackeray was elected to the council. The camaraderie between Raj Bhavan and Thackeray was short-lived. The past few months saw Koshyari taking a tough stand on issues and differing with the state, sometimes even summoning officials. He refused to accept state’s decision to not hold examinations for final-year students. He met actor Kangana Ranaut who complained to him against Sena-ruled civic body’s move to demolish parts of her office. He also met a retired naval officer who was assaulted by Sena workers for circulating a post against CM on social media.According to Sena leaders, Thackeray chose not to have an issue with the governor all this while. He even tried to mend fences with his aide Milind Narvekar periodically visiting Raj Bhavan. However, Koshyari’s strongly worded letter over reopening of temples and questioning Thackeray’s Hindutva credentials irked him, they say. It is the first time in the tussle that Thackeray retorted with an equally strong language (and his party ensured that the letter was put in the public domain).There was no response from Raj Bhavan on Tuesday. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has backed Thackeray and sought the attention of the PMO to the issue.It is unlikely that the tussle between Raj Bhavan and MVA government and CM Thackeray will end here. In fact, it may become more bitter, as the nominations of 12 members to the Council are pending. “The entire episode is unfortunate. Such a friction between governors and elected governments are now common in some states, but Maharashtra never witnessed something like this. The kind of language should have been avoided. It may be seen as a friction between Delhi and state government,” opined political analyst Hemant Desai. “The sad part is serious problems such as Covid-19 pandemic and state of economy are not getting centre stage amid this noise,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/row-between-maharashtra-governor-bhagat-singh-koshyari-and-cm-uddhav-thackeray-may-not-end-soon/story-RIuPrFopNEGDsobNDqGyKO.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP stages protests seeking reopening of temples in Maharashtra amid Covid-19 outbreak||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Maharashtra staged protests across the state on Tuesday demanding reopening of temples amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.BJP workers gathered in large numbers and staged protests in front of temples in Mumbai and other parts of the state. They also criticised the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government, comprising the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and alleged that the latter could reopen restaurants and bars despite the contagion, but not temples.BJP workers shouted slogans against the state government while flouting the protocol to maintain social distancing that has been enforced because of the viral outbreak.The agitations were reported from some of the prominent temples in the state such as Siddhivinayak temple at Prabhadevi in Mumbai; Sai Baba temple in Shirdi; Tambdi Jogeshwari temple in Pune; and Vitthal Rakhumai Temple in Pandharpur.At the Siddhivinayak temple, the BJP supporters performed a symbolic aarti in front of the shrine. “The state government has reopened restaurants, bars and wine shops but it is not allowing the temples to reopen. They are playing with the sentiments of the devotees,” alleged BJP’s Pravin Darekar, who is also the leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra state legislative council.He blamed the government for non-compliance of social distancing norms, as he alleged that the latter was responsible for inciting the public to take to the streets.At the Tambdi Jogeshwari temple, the BJP made a person dress up as Kumbhakarna, who could be seen sleeping on a road.The BJP likened the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to Kumbhakarna and asked the state authorities to accede to their demand of reopening temples.On Sunday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that the government was cautious in reopening temples because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. He had stated it was the responsibility of the state government to ensure the safety of the public unlike his political rivals.State BJP president Chandrakant Patil warned the state government not to test the patience of the priests, religious sects and devotees by not acceding to their demand to open the temples. He said that the even the Ashadhi wari, one of the major events at Pandharpur, was cancelled view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “When all things are being reopened except temples, then it is injustice on the part of the government,” said Patil who led the agitation at Shirdi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-stages-protests-seeking-reopening-of-temples-in-maharashtra-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-VIv8XEkkK3asfv1XKNgM8L.html

Others mentioned in the application include Munnalal Goel, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from Gwalior East; Satish Singh Sikarwar, Phool Singh Baraiya, Ramniwas Rawat and Sunil Sharma, all Congress candidates in the region. Also read: Foreign secretary Shringla, US deputy secy discuss upcoming 2+2 dialogueThe court said, “In view of the above situation, especially the information received by the reports of amicus curiae and contents of I.A. 6084/20 filed by petitioner, cognizable offence under IPC/Disaster Management Act prima facie appears to have been committed.”The court ordered lodging of FIRs against defaulting persons as per the directive of the court in its interim order dated October 3, 2020 “against all defaulting members of congregation and defaulting functionaries of the Govt/state/political parties on whose behalf, behest and for whom and in whose presence congregations took place violating the Covid-19 protocol”.Referring to the submission made by additional advocate general Ankur Modi, that veracity of the factum regarding the congregations as informed by the petitioner and other sources and the breach of Covid-19 protocol was being verified, the court invoked the apex court’s judgment in Lalita Kumari case and said, “The police cannot go into truthfulness, genuineness or veracity of the information of cognizable offence before registration of FIR. The verification about genuineness, veracity and truthfulness of the information can be gone into only after registration of offence, i.e. during the process of investigation.”The next date of hearing is October 19 by which the compliance reports regarding the interim order are to be filed to the court by the superintendents of police in Gwalior and Datia, as per the order.When contacted, the state’s additional advocate general at Gwalior, Ankur Modi said, “The court directed the administration to act in light of the apex court’s judgment. It didn’t mention any name or names as far as lodging of FIRs is concerned.”State Congress’ spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “The administration in Gwalior-Chambal region already lodged an FIR against state Congress president Kamal Nath showing a biased attitude despite the fact he didn’t violate the Covid-19 protocol. Now, the administration must show courage to lodge FIRs against BJP leaders.”State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Bharatiya Janata Party respects the law and never violates it. Since the direction has been given to the district administration, it should take action in the light of the court’s order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/hc-directs-mp-admin-to-lodge-firs-against-violators-of-covid-19-protocol-in-political-meetings/story-HLVGJKAV0QzOtjhUxppVPM.html

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Capping Covid-19 treatment rates: Maharashtra government to hold discussions with IMA to ‘resolve grievances’ of doctors, hospitals||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday agreed to hold discussions with representatives of the state branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to try to amicably resolve the grievances over capping the rates for treatment of Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients at private hospitals. During the course of the hearing of a petition filed by IMA, the bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice Milind Jadhav opined that an attempt should be made to resolve the issues involved in the petition at a high-level meeting with government officials, considering the fact that the petitioner body represents a large number of doctors. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni assured the court that some senior government officials will sit across the table with IMA representatives and try to resolve the matter amicably. IMA moved the HC through advocate Nahush Shah, challenging three notifications issued by the Maharashtra government on April 30, May 21 and August 31, directing all healthcare providers to provide treatment and procedures Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients at prescribed rates. It has contended that the Maharashtra government’s actions are “excessively harsh and oppressive and are likely to have a chilling effect on the healthcare system of the state.” The petition states that apart from the fact that capping of rates of treatment was beyond the statutory power of the state government, the rates fixed under the notifications that are being challenged are highly arbitrary. “No scientific basis or analysis seems to have been conducted in arriving at these price restrictions and the periodic extension of theses notifications, now till November 30, has placed healthcare providers in a financially precarious position, such that a majority of them have reached a point where it would no longer be financially viable to continue operations,” the petition stated. “The price stipulation to treat Covid-19 patients is highly discounted and does not cover even the cost incurred on treating the patients, making the operation of the hospital illusory beyond a point,” said the petition, while explaining the effect of the May 21 notification. The petition added that the notification not only prescribed cap on 80% of all beds in hospitals and on the rates for procedures and essentials, but sought to regulate the doctors’ fee as well. IMA has, in its petition, also taken strong objection to the fact that while the government chose to provide restrictions on healthcare providers and doctors, it has not taken upon itself to subsidise any part of the input costs the hospitals had to incur, by either providing free PPEs or oxygen supply or the like, or even tax breaks on essential medical equipment. The decisions contained in the notifications was not “well thought out and in fact appears to be a populist appeasement measure taken for oblique motives and without considering the ground realities of the difficulties foisted upon healthcare providers and doctors,” the petition stated. It added that Delhi has also capped prices, but the exercise in the national capital has been conducted in close consultation with hospitals and therefore, the prices fixed there are considerably higher than that those prescribed by the Maharashtra government. Advocate Nahush Shah said the petition is now posted for further hearing on October 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/capping-treatment-rates-maharashtra-government-to-hold-discussions-with-ima-to-amicably-resolve-grievances-of-doctors-hospitals/story-h3Od4jby4tLZSZfAoVva1N.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||After shifting Aarey car shed, Mumbai Metro 3 and 6 to be integrated before Saki Vihar station||Following the state government’s decision to shift the Metro-3 car shed to Kanjurmarg from Aarey Colony, the underground line (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) line will be integrated before the proposed elevated Saki Vihar station of line 6. After this, it will be a common elevated line with six stations till the newly proposed Kanjurmarg depot site. The modification necessitated by the decision to scrap a car shed at Aarey is likely to cost over ₹500 crore more, according to estimates. Significantly, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding the Metro-3 project, stated that it has not received any formal notification about the change in car depot from the state government or the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is executing line 3. On Sunday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that the car shed for Metro-3 will not be constructed in Aarey, but at Kanjurmarg, along with the Metro-6 depot. The state government has already allocated the 45-hectare land to MMRDA. Of this, 25 hectares will be utilised for Metro-3. According to officials, a portion of line 3 is expected to be at-grade after Seepz before it joins Metro-6. The whole cost is expected to increase by around ₹400-525 crore, with ₹400 crore for Metro-3 and another ₹125 crore estimated for Metro-6 work. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), who has been the brain behind the whole plan, said that while the detailed project report (DPR) for Metro-3 will have to be reworked a bit, the difference for Metro-6 will be increased platform size beyond the integration of the two lines to accommodate the line 3 coaches. “It will be an additional cost of ₹125 crore. There will be no changes in the Metro-6 alignment apart from the platform size to accommodate the line 3’s eight-coach trains as the platforms for Metro-6 are designed for six coaches,” Rajeev said. However, the depots at the Kanjurmarg site will be different for both the lines. “While some amenities will be common, the depots will be different,” he said. As the line gets integrated post the Saki Vihar station, the headway between two trains will also be more. Metro-3 was planned as a 33.5-km underground corridor from Colaba-Seepz while Metro-6 is a 14 -km elevated corridor from Lokhandwala till Vikhroli on the eastern express highway. The completely underground line, which was expected to be operational by mid-2021, will now be operational only by 2023-24 as it takes a minimum of two years to construct the depot. On HT’s query regarding the change in car depot site, a JICA representative said, “JICA has not received any formal notification about the matter from MMRC or the state government on the matter and our information is also based on media reports. Hence, we are not in a position to comment on it right away. It would be better to get in touch with MMRC directly to get details. JICA shall be in a position to make a comment when the matter is formally submitted to JICA and we are able to examine it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-shifting-aarey-car-shed-metro-3-and-6-to-be-integrated-before-saki-vihar-station/story-Ri3ZVRFUnYNIZR3cLk1uCN.html

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Governor Koshyari in a letter war over places of worship||Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray engaged in a letter war over the reopening of religious places in the state, as part of the unlocking of Covid-enforced curbs. In the acrimonious exchange of letters, the governor, making a case for reopening places of worship, asked the CM if he had “turned secular”. Thackeray shot back a letter, asking if Koshyari does not believe in “secularism as enshrined in the Constitution”, adding that his Hindutva doesn’t need the governor’s certificate. The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, fears that opening up religious places would lead to crowding and consequently, a spike in Covid-19 cases. Earlier in the week, health minister Rajesh Tope hinted that everything across Maharashtra would open by November-end, albeit in a phased manner. Maharashtra, which is the worst affected state in India, has 1,543,837 Covid-19 cases and 40,701 deaths thus far.Speaking for reopening of religious places that have been shut since the lockdown was put in place in March, the governor, in his letter dated October 12, said, “It is ironic that while on one hand, the state government has permitted the opening of bars, restaurants and beaches, on the other hand, our Gods and Goddesses have been condemned to stay in the lockdown… I wonder if you are receiving any divine premonition to keep postponing the reopening of places of worship time and again or have you suddenly turned ‘secular’ yourselves, the term you hated (sic)?”Thackeray, in an equally strong response on Tuesday, said, ”Why should you have this question? Are you saying that simply opening religious places stands for Hindutva and keeping them shut is secular? Also, don’t you accept that secularism is an important tenet of the Constitution by which you were sworn in as governor?”The CM said the government is actively thinking about demands to open religious places, but their primary duty is the safety of people during the pandemic. “In your letter, you have referred to my Hindutva ideology and that is right, but my Hindutva does not need your certificate,” he said. In a reference to actor Kangana Ranaut’s visit to Raj Bhavan last month, Thackeray added, “My Hindutva does not permit me to welcome home a person, who called my Maharashtra or Mumbai as Pakistan- occupied Kashmir.”Amid the tussle, the opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), launched protests across the state, including Mumbai, Pune and Kolhapur, demanding the opening of temples and other religious places. In Mumbai, an agitation was led by the leader of Opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar and BJP leader Prasad Lad outside Siddhivinayak temple in Prabhadevi, Dadar.State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said the state government can formulate guidelines and open religious places like it has done for other things. “The manner in which the CM has responded to the governor is not correct. The governor has said that all religious places should open. A lot of people want to visit places of worship. He has said that not to teach them Hindutva, but it has to be taught because they have kept Hindutva aside for the sake of power,” Patil said.NCP president Sharad Pawar wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi, expressing pain at the erosion of standard of conduct by the office of the governor. In his two-page letter, Pawar said intemperate language was used in the letter by Koshyari. Pawar also enclosed the copy of the governor’s letter to PM Modi and quoted a few paragraphs from it.While stating that the governor has the right to his opinion and independent view on the matter of opening up of religious places, Pawar said he was “shocked and suprised” at the language of the letter, which was released to the media.“I am sure you too would have noticed the intemperate language that has been used. In the very Preamble of our Constitution the word ‘Secular’ is added that equates and shields all religions and hence the Chair of the Chief Minister must uphold such tenets of the Constitution. Unfortunately Hon. Governors’ letter to the Chief Minister invokes the connotation as if written to the leader of a political party.” He added that he believes in a democracy, free exchange of views between the Hon. Governor and the Hon. Chief Minister must take place, but “tone and tenor used must always be in keeping with the stature of the constitutional post occupied by the individuals.”Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that the chief minister’s response to the governor’s request is “unfortunate”. Fadnavis backed the governor and said that he get representations from all quarters on various issues and points it out to the government. Similarly, he sent a letter with regards to reopen religious places. “I got to know about the CM’s response through media and it is unfortunate. Though it is a three-party government, it is surprising that in the Shiv Sena government, which calls itself a Hindutva party, a party that claims to be fighting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s battle for God, country and principles, there is injustice towards temples,” Fadnavis said in Jalgaon.Meanwhile, Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut lashed out at governor and asked if Koshyari is not secular. Raut said that the CM responded to the letter in “Thackeray-style”. He added that CM’s letter is a “historic document” and a “lesson” on how to respond to an “interfering Raj Bhavan and governor” in a “courteous” manner.Raut said that Koshyari is the constitutional head of the state and his job is to only oversee if the state is functioning as per the constitution or not while leaving the remaining things to the public-appointed government. “How to go about the unlocking of the state, the state government, chief minister and his Cabinet ministers will decide. So nobody should doubt if we are for Hindutva or not.“Uddhav Thackeray is not just the chief minister but also the Shiv Sena chief and more importantly the son of Hinduruday Samrat Shiv Sena pramukh Balasaheb Thackeray, who sparked Hindutva in the country. We do not need lessons on Hindutva and is strong. Our mind and soul are for Hindutva,” Raut told reporters after a meeting with Thackeray at Matoshree on Tuesday.NCP minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, “I have not read what the governor wrote, but being secular is not wrong. Our constitution itself is based on secularism. The Thackeray family is devout and they regularly visit their family deity near Lonavala. The Covid-19 is such that thousands of people would go to religious places and it could be dangerous. Considering this, if the chief minister has decided to go cautiously there is nothing wrong in it.”Congress, the third partner in the MVA government, too, took a dig at Koshyari and questioned if he has written a similar letter to chief minister of Goa, where he is holding an additional charge as Governor.“Koshyari in his letter has hurt the fundamental principles of the Constitution of India by commenting upon secularism. It is not expected from a person who has been sworn in the name of the constitution and who administered an oath to chief minister as per the provisions in the constitution. We have two more questions in this regard. Has honourable Koshyari written a similar letter to Goa chief minister as he is the governor of that state too? Similarly, we would like to know if the President of India endorses the governor’s remarks on secularism?,” Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said,Prakash Ambedkar, chief of Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), took a mellow stance on the issue, stating that he does not agree with the language of the governor’s letter, but stands by the demand made by him. Ambedkar led a protest in Pandharpur in August-end, demanding to open the famous Rukhmai temple there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-governor-koshyari-in-a-letter-war-over-places-of-worship/story-PAHZKj4It1GAn6fZxo7eBO.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees 8,522 Covid-19 cases, tally up to 1,543,837||Keeping with the trend of declining Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks, the state on Tuesday reported 8,522 new infections, below 10,000 for a second day in a row, taking the tally to 1,543,837. The daily count of fatalities, too, decreased to below 200 for a second straight day to 187, taking the toll to 40,701. Mumbai’s number of new infections, too, remained low at 1,325, which is the level it had maintained from June to August, before the September surge. The tally is 232,391 cases. Of the 187 fatalities reported on Tuesday, 38 were from Mumbai, taking the city’s toll to 9,507, 19 from Pune (13 in the city and three each in rural parts and Pimpri-Chinchwad), 19 in Nagpur district and 10 in Navi Mumbai. The case fatality rate (CFR) in the state, however, remained constant at 2.64%The fall in new infections was witnessed across the state. Pune district clocked 1,304 cases (490 in city, 587 in rural parts and 227 in Pimpri-Chinchwad), while Nashik and Nagpur logged 774 and 657 cases. Solapur, Satara and Sangli, the western Maharashtra districts which had been reporting high number of cases for a few weeks, saw 258, 266 and 259 infections respectively.The state, however, has been conducting fewer tests in the past two weeks compared to last month. The daily tests average in 13 days of October fell to 75,138, from the daily average of 88,209 tests in September. In the first two weeks of September (1-15) the state saw 12,70,131 tests at a daily average of 84,675 tests, which went up to daily average of 91,743 tests in the next fortnight between September 16 and 30. The fall in the number of tests comes, surprisingly, when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced to increase the daily testing to 1.5 lakh. During his video conference with prime minister Narendra Modi last month, Thackeray said the state was planning to increase testing by double to take it to 1.5 lakh mark. State health minister Rajesh Tope, on Saturday, directed the district authorities to increase the testing aggressively to contain the transmission.The positivity rate in the state has, however, declined to 16.31% in October after hovering around 20% over the past two months. In the first two weeks of September, the positivity rate was 24.04% which fell to 20.82% in the second fortnight between September 16 and 30. The daily caseload of Covid-19 cases has witnessed a significant fall over the past three weeks. Dr Ravi Wankhedkar, former national president of Indian Medical Association said, “Fall in the positivity rate even after reduction in the tests, is a good sign. But in any case the tests should not be reduced as it may lead to more fatalities when our CFR is already high in the country. More importantly, when we have been lingering under the possible threat of a second wave of the infection, which has been witnessed in many countries across the globe, the authorities should not let their guard down. As a result of restaurants being allowed to open from October 5 and Navratri festival beginning on October 17, we can expect surge in cases 14 days later.” According to officials from the health department, although the positivity rate is falling steadily and would help them to achieve the target of below 10%, the high CFR is a matter of concern for the authorities. An official said that when the other states have been able to bring CFR down in the recent past, it’s hovering at 2.65% for past few weeks. “The high rate of mortality is because of the poor ratio of contact tracing per infection,” he said.64,099 tests were conducted in the state in the last 24 hours at the positivity rate of 13.30%. The recovery rate touched 84.03% after 15,356 infected people were reported to have recovered in 24 hours, taking the tally of recovered patients to 12,97,252. The number of active patients in the state stands at 205,415. Pune has the highest, 40,733, number of active patients, followed by Thane (31,527) and Mumbai (24,019).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-8-522-covid-19-cases-tally-up-to-1-543-837/story-3uErXNraC9YFzFEUWxthlK.html
14-10-2020||Mumbai||India Post Mumbai releases stamped masks to raise Covid-19 awareness||The India Post, Mumbai, on Tuesday released stamped masks to mark National Philately Day and to increase awareness about the need for wearing masks to prevent the transmission and spread Covid-19. The masks are made of cloth and have pictures of stamps imprinted on them. Additionally, a special stamp collector’s pack consisting of exceptional stamps were also released on Tuesday. The initiative is an attempt to make masks attractive and at the same time also drive home the point of the importance of wearing masks in public during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The stamped mask is a brainchild of post master general of India Post, Mumbai, Swati Pandey. “At a time when the country fighting dauntlessly against Covid-19, we should create awareness among people about usage of masks,” said Pandey. Covid-19 is a respiratory illness, and masks help in trapping infected droplets that are released while talking, sneezing and coughing. Four months ago, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made it mandatory for Mumbaiites to don masks while stepping out of their homes and imposed a penalty on those violating the rule. The World Health Organisation has also stated that masks must be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives. Meanwhile, the India Post Mumbai on October 15 also plans to launch ‘Know Your Postman’ initiative on the occasion of Mails Day. “On this day, every postman will be given one virtual identity card that they can provide to their customers, so that they can be contacted immediately whenever needed,” said the statement released on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-post-mumbai-releases-stamped-masks-to-raise-covid-19-awareness/story-VTbRLvBai8y2d5AHdO4I1I.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Schools unlikely to reopen in Chandigarh this month||The Chandigarh administration is unlikely to give the go ahead to open private and government schools in the city this month.“With private schools and parents not in favour of it, it will be difficult to open these educational institutes in October,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. The final decision will be taken by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in the war room meeting, he said.Schools have been shut since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They were opened partially in Chandigarh from October 21 for students of Classes 9 to 12, who required “guidance” from teachers.The Centre, in the Unlock 5 guidelines issued at the beginning of this month, had permitted schools to be reopened from October 15 for academic consultations for students of lower classes as well.On October 8, Badnore had directed education secretary Sarpreet Singh Gill to hold talks with parents over physical attendance of students in schools. The education department then sent forms to each recognised private school in the city to get their response, which came back negative. It is learnt that parents were not on board with this idea, and even schools that had reopened partially last month reported low attendance. In fact, in government schools, attendance was between 1,500 to 2,000 despite getting parents’ consent from around 25,000 students. Meanwhile, online teaching is still going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/schools-unlikely-to-reopen-in-chandigarh-this-month/story-T2b8XQcV4aXxfq0fkJB0BN.html

The case was registered on Monday night after the victim’s medico-legal report (MLR) was submitted by the Jalalabad civil hospital. Gurnam Singh of Muktsar’s Chak Madarsa village was allegedly beaten up by Simranjit Singh, Ramandeep Singh and Jagvir Singh on October 8.His brother Bohar Singh on Tuesday said that Gurnam was coming to meet him at Chak Janisar when he was mistaken for a thief by a group of villagers.“When I called him, an unknown person answered and said the phone was recovered from a thief. I rushed to the spot and saw a mob surrounding my brother, who was forced to drink urine at a dharamshala. I have identified the culprits,” he added.Investigating officer Iqbal Singh of Vairo Ke police station said Gurnam was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday. “In a purported video clip, a youth was seen being beaten up by a group of people. The authenticity of the video is being verified. Gurnam stated that the accused were under influence and he was subjected to the atrocity by a group,” he added.No arrest made so farThe police have so far made no arrests in the case. Denying any delay in registering the FIR, Fazilka SSP Harjeet Singh said the police hadn’t not received any complaint from the victim directly. He said the youth was badly thrashed and there was no evidence to suggest that he was forced to drink urine.“Two days after the incident, Gurnam was taken to a government hospital in Jalalabad by his family members. The hospital authorities forwarded his MLR to the police as the patient had sustained injuries. The police took cognisance of the official communication from the hospital and contacted the victim and his family for further action,” the SSP said.The FIR has been registered under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 365 (abduction), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dalit-youth-thrashed-forced-to-drink-urine-in-fazilka-3-booked/story-Psd7VyxelVqDHhFkvXlCyL.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Gangster Dilpreet Dhahan’s role surfaces in Gurlal Brar’s murder outside Chandigarh mall||Gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, who gained notoriety after taking responsibility for shooting and injuring Punjabi singer Parmish Verma in Mohali in April 2018, is suspected to have arranged shooters and weapons from behind bars to kill his rival Lawrence Bishnoi’s close aide Gurlal Brar, who was shot dead outside a mall in Chandigarh’s Industrial Area in wee hours of Sunday.Dilpreet was arrested in a police encounter in Sector 43 in July 2018 and is presently lodged in Ropar Central Jail.“We have got Dilpreet’s production warrants,” confirmed Chandigarh senior superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh Chahal.According to sources, Dilpreet will be produced in court on October 19, from where Chandigarh Police are likely to take him into custody for interrogation in connection with Brar’s murder. Soon after Brar was gunned down by three motorcycle-borne assailants, slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group had posted on social media, taking responsibility. Brar, 26, a former student leader, had allegedly played key role in killing Bambiha gang’s Lavi Deora at a fair in Kotkapura, Punjab, in 2017. In the post, the Bambiha gang had claimed that Lucky, who is staying aboard, had got Brar killed to avenge Deora’s murder. Lucky’s name had also cropped up when Dilpreet along with Sukhpreet Singh Buddha and two other associates had attacked Parmish Verma in 2018.“Lucky, Dilpreet and Sukhpreet operate as one gang. They had eliminated Brar owing to gang rivalry,” said a senior Chandigarh Police officer, not wishing to be named. Soon after the attack on Verma, singer-actor Gippy Grewal had also lodged an extortion complaint against Dilpreet. Earlier, on April 9, 2017, Dilpreet was caught on camera shooting at a Hoshiarpur sarpanch outside a gurdwara in Sector 38 (West), Chandigarh. 25 men running extortion racket for Bishnoi identified After a Facebook page in Lawrence Bishnoi’s name posted a threat of bloodshed in retaliation to Brar’s killing, Chandigarh Police identified about 25 people running an extortion racket on behalf of the jailed gangster. “We are in the process of taking action against Bishnoi’s men running the racket,” said Chahal. Police are learnt to be in touch with businessmen who received the threats so that complaints can be filed. Currently lodged in a jail in Rajasthan, Bishnoi is in touch with his gang members and is still active on social media. He is named in a number of murder and attempt to murder cases in Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Chandigarh.Tricity coordination meeting today In wake of the recent incidents of gang violence, UT director general of police Sanjay Baniwal has called a meeting of all senior officials of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula on Wednesday.

The university had filed 336 patents in a year, according to the annual rankings for 2018-19 recently released by the office of controller general of patents, designs and trademarks. The university has filed 779 patents so far.CU announced that as per the Intellectual Property India’s annual report, in the overall patent filing category, 27 IITs have collectively filed 557 patents and are leading the table. However, with 336 patents in a year, Chandigarh University, Gharuan, has emerged as the leading stand-alone institution to file highest number of patents, followed by Tata Consultancy Services with 239 applications, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research with 202 applications and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited with 173 applications.CU chancellor Satnam Singh Sandhu said, “Since its inception, Chandigarh University has given research and innovation top priority and to inculcate the spirit of doing research, the university has earmarked an annual budget of ₹6.5 crore.”“The university has set up more than 30 industry-sponsored R&D labs and 14 centres of excellence where experts from industry are directly working with students on real-time projects to develop futuristic products, technologies and services that can help society and mankind,” he added. CU’s dean research, Dr Sanjeet said, “The highest number of patents have been filed in the field of product manufacturing (203), which is followed by information technology (148), domestic category which comprises health and hygiene, human safety, and appliances (113), and automation (85).”“The university had established 50 core research groups consisting of 1,500 students and faculty members who had contributed in filing 336 patents. Continuing its pace and exemplary performance in the field of research and innovation, 443 new patents have been filed till date in 2019-20, thus taking the total number of patent applications filed by the university to 779,” the dean research added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-university-filed-most-patents-in-2018-19-report/story-Da3Bi9WhIT8DoerJSS3XrJ.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Sisodia says Centre, EPCA doing very little to control pollution in north India||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said air pollution across northern India was rising because of stubble burning and accused the Central government of ‘completely failing’ to implement anti-pollution measures in all states concerned, despite getting ample time to do so. Sisodia also criticised the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (Epca), saying it could not get enough out of the neighbouring states to tackle air pollution, which peaks during winter and plunges Delhi into a public health emergency year after year.Both the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the Epca denied Sisodia’s claims. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Sisodia demanded immediate and concrete steps be taken to check pollution in north India.Sisodia’s comments came on a day when Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) settled at 300 on Tuesday, just a point short of slipping into the ‘very poor’ zone -- the worst this season so far. “Smoke from crop burning in the neighbouring states has started showing its effect this time also. The Delhi government has consistently been taking many concrete steps both this year and over the past few years to tackle pollution. But the Central government’s concern about pollution is witnessed only for these three months every year,” Sisodia said.He questioned the role of Epca and asked why it has been “unsuccessful” in controlling from other states.“Like those state governments, Epca also seems to failed in controlling pollution. The Central government will have to take the responsibility for preventing pollution throughout northern India. Due to inactivity of the Centre in cases of stubble pollution, smoke from Punjab or Haryana reach Delhi every year,” he said. Countering Sisodia’s allegations, an official spokesperson of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said, “The central government believes in working to end pollution and has taken various anti-air pollution initiatives in the last six years. To control stubble burning, machines for stubble cutting worth Rs 1,400 crore have been provided to Punjab and Haryana farmers, which has resulted in a reduction of about 15% and 20% pollution from stubble burning in these states, respectively.”Bhure Lal, Epca chairperson, responded by saying that the monitoring body has been in touch with the state governments of Punjab and Haryana for nearly a month, ever since the first signs of farm fires were spotted through satellite imagery. “We have been in touch with the governments of Punjab and Haryana and have been taking regular updates of the work that they are doing to keep a check on the stubble burning instances,” Lal said. The deputy chief minister reiterated that the issue was ‘affecting crores of citizens living in North India’. “The Central government cannot keep sitting idle throughout the year and engage in tokenism when pollution levels increase,” Sisodia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-says-centre-epca-doing-very-little-to-control-pollution-in-north-india/story-pIeECu6tHmpsuoj33wwl2H.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Dust bowls drown Delhi in pollution haze||On a day Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) plunged to 300, just one point short of slipping into the ‘very poor’ category, major construction sites were spotted flouting pollution-control norms, enveloping the surrounding areas in clouds of dust, Hindustan Times found during a spot check. Despite directions issued by Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai to agencies and private individuals carrying out construction and demolition activities to follow guidelines or face action, work continued in blatant disregard of the rules and the dust generated, HT found during a visit to major construction sites across the city. On Tuesday, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 300, in the poor category, according to Central Pollution Control Board’s evening bulletin. Data shows the prominent pollution on Tuesday was PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), which is primarily dust. Data from the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), showed that the average PM 10 levels in Delhi touched 239ug/m3. In India, the acceptable mark of PM 10 levels is 100ug/m3. The rules mandate covering of the construction site with nets and 10-metre-thick metal sheets to stop the dust from spreading to neighbouring areas, covering of the construction material in transit and regular sprinkling of water at the spot and on the roads outside.At Mathura Road, where the public works department (PWD) is building a tunnel road to ease traffic, metal barricades placed to separate the worksite were unevenly placed and were not enough to hold the loose dust and construction material from blowing all over the area. The constant movement of fast-moving vehicles on Mathura Road led to a cloud of dust, making matters worse. “From a few metres away, you can see the difference in the air around this area. It is hazy and dust keeps flying around. You cannot keep your window pulled down because of the dust,” said 38-year-old Meera Mehta, who commutes on Mathura Road every day. The reporter noticed that while the main construction site was covered, the peripheries had mounds of loose soil, concrete waste and debris, which had become a cause of pollution. The nearby Ashram intersection -- one of the busiest roads in the city, where the PWD is constructing the 750-metre underpass that connects the Nizamuddin Railway Bridge -- was no different. The site was covered with metal barricades but the loose soil that was piled up was flying around, becoming a bane for commuters. While parts of the construction site were covered with green sheets, they were barely enough to cover the excavated soil. There were no signs of water sprinklers anywhere at the site. “We have directed all our contractors to ensure that all dust-control measures ordered by the environment ministry are followed. Water is being sprinkled regularly to ensure the dust does not fly around. Since we have a few sites where construction work is going on in full swing, there might have been some slip-ups. But if there are any lapses at any site, we will rectify that,” said a senior PWD official, on the condition of anonymity. At Bhairon Marg near Pragati Maidan, where India Trade Promotion Organisation’s (ITPO) building is being constructed, all dust-control rules went for a toss, with parts of the site along the main road left uncovered and dust flying around. As the excavator dug through the ground, forming knolls of soil, only a torn piece of a green cloth was seen—which lay as an ornamental piece on the side. Most construction sections adjoining Bhairon Marg were not covered with metal barricades. The construction agency, NBCC (India) Limited, did not respond to HT’s queries on the measures being taken by them to abide by the Delhi government orders. Rai said the government will take action if rules are violated. “We are going to be very strict in ensuring that dust-control measures are followed at all construction sites, government or private. If we find that the listed norms are not being followed at any site, we will take stringent action and work will be stopped,” Rai said. Over the last four days, Rai has been inspecting major construction sites as part of the government’s efforts to check dust pollution. During these inspections, big agencies such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have been slapped with hefty fines. An analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based think tank, showed that road dust was the second-largest source of air pollution in Delhi (18-38%), while construction contributed towards 8% of the city’s pollution load. However, experts said these two were not mutually exclusive. Siddhartha Gauda, a Bengaluru-based air quality researcher, said uncovered roadside construction activity becomes a primary reason for increased dust or PM 10 levels in an area. “Cement, concrete particles and loose soil not only remain suspended in the air but when they slip onto kerb sides and onto the roads, the movement of vehicles keeps them suspended in the air. Vehicular movement keeps breaking this dust into smaller and more fine particles,” Gauda said. While these big sites are in the government’s radar, in many parts of the city, small-scale, private construction activities are also contributing to localised pollution. In parts of Laxmi Nagar, New Ashok Nagar and Seelampur, local residents and business owners were seen constructing houses or repairing shops. “For over three months, labourers could not be found and now many people are constructing houses or building additional floors or repairing shops. In these narrow roads, how do you expect us to put on metal sheets or cover construction material with nets?” said Sardar Harinder Singh, a shop owner in east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dust-bowls-drown-delhi-in-pollution-haze/story-xYkYyRqRxmZWsdVGBz4dxJ.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||In pandemic-hit Delhi, people opt for doorstep delivery of govt services||Over a month after the Delhi government resumed doorstep delivery of services, it has received 11,612 requests and over 93,321 calls at its centralised number, 1076, till October 8, shows official data.According to Delhi government officials, bulk of the requests are related to the revenue department. Transport and Delhi Jal Board are the other two departments which have received most requests. The doorstep delivery service, which was launched in September 2018, was closed for over five months due to the nationwide lockdown was announced due to the Coronavirus pandemic. With admissions going on in schools and colleges, the district magistrates’ offices were getting a lot of requests from people to get income, caste, domicile etc certificates. People had to queue up outside the DM offices to get the certificates in June and July. However, they can now get them delivered to their houses. Of the 11,612 service requests, 10,873 were for the revenue department which provides 15 services, including certificates for income, caste (SC/ST/OBC), domicile, dead and birth orders, etc. As per the data provided by the Delhi government, the revenue department has disposed of nearly 80% of the requests (8,618) by September 23.The transport department, which provides 19 services under the scheme, has received the second highest number of requests. Of the 377 requests received, 127 have been disposed of. The DJB, which has four services under the scheme, has disposed of 118 out of 171 requests till September 23.An official said, the remaining are under process—under the service level agreement, a service request has to be processed within 14 days from the date of booking.Transport and revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, who is also head of administrative reforms department that manages the doorstep deliver service, said, “People have been waiting for doorstep delivery of services to resume, especially in the wake of Covid, and we have tried to scale up our services since resumption on September 1.”He added, “Our call centres have been functional as soon as they were allowed to resume as per Unlock guidelines of the government, and we had ensured disposal of all pending applications before we resumed services. With Covid-specific standard operating procedures in place, I am sure this will revolutionise the way in which public services are delivered in our country and play a key role in reducing spread of the viral disease in government offices.”While the government is getting a lot of calls, officials say, not all calls turn into service requests. “It is because many are queries and the appointment is not booked until unless we ensure the applicant has all the documents available. Moreover, no bookings are being taken for containment zones. On an average, we get 350 service requests daily,” said an official, aware of the development.While the service is gradually picking up, the biggest challenge before the government is to deliver at a time when the number of cases are on a rise and there are over 2,700 containment zones.The frequently changing containment zone list is adding to the difficulty in providing the service. Explaining the problem, an official said, a person might not be in a hot spot when the service request is booked. But when the mobile Sahayaks, roped in by the government to provide the service at the doorsteps, visit them, it is possible that by then the area would have been declared a containment zone. A senior official with the administrative reforms department said, “Our mobile sahayaks call the person before paying a visit. If the person’s house is in a containment zone on the day of the visit, then we postpone the service. We can’t provide services in containment zones. The service request will be processed after 15 days or when the area is out of the containment list. The call centre is updated with information about the containment zone.”For its ambitious project, the Delhi government had outsourced the work field work to VFS Global, which had hired mobile sahayaks, for hassle-free doorstep delivery of service. “The well-being and health and safety of the mobile sahayaks and citizens remain the focal point of our safety measures, which include: no appointments being taken in containment areas, wearing of adequate protective gear, such as masks, gloves and usage of sanitisers by all team members, following of physical distancing norms, and mandatory downloading of the Aarogya Setu application by all team members to assist them in tracking of safety norms in different areas,” VFS Global said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-pandemic-hit-delhi-people-opt-for-doorstep-delivery-of-govt-services/story-FCrXLM6XWFndCsvbdImfLN.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||North corp fined ₹20 lakh for flouting dust-control norms at Bhalswa landfill||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai Tuesday issued directions to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for imposing a fine of ₹20 lakh on the North Delhi Municipal Corporation for violating dust control norms at the Bhalswa landfill site. After a visit to the landfill on Tuesday, Rai said the north corporation was found flouting dust pollution norms at the site. “I have asked the DPCC to impose a fine of ₹20 lakh on the north corporation. The municipal corporation has been directed to immediately increase the number of tankers used for sprinkling water to prevent dust from flying in the landfill area,” he said. Rai added, “We have issued guidelines for all government and private agencies to take anti-dust pollution measures. We have directed everyone to follow these directives. Action will be taken against anyone not doing so.” Rai in a press conference on Tuesday had released five measures that all government and private agencies will need to follow to control dust at construction sites. The steps included installing wind shields and barriers on the periphery of the construction/demolition site, covering debris with tarpaulin, using a green net to prevent dust from flying, regular water sprinkling, and covering of trucks carrying construction material. The minister also said the government has started “micro monitoring” of all 13 pollution hot spots in the national capital and will soon deploy environment marshals to check for violations. He said all construction and demolition sites, irrespective of size, will have to compulsorily take the five steps to check pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-corp-fined-20-lakh-for-flouting-dust-control-norms-at-bhalswa-landfill/story-5sNcDINyKqFHaXMhiM3MSM.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Somnath Bharti acquitted in 2014 case of assault on African woman||A Delhi court on Tuesday acquitted former Delhi law minister Somnath Bharti of charges of leading a mob that assaulted an African woman in south Delhi in 2014.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) Harvinder Singh passed the judgment in the case related to an alleged assault on a citizen of Democratic Republic of Congo, who was then studying at Amity University, Noida. According to the police, on September 26, 2014, the woman was assaulted by a mob allegedly led by the AAP MLA.“Vide separate judgment directly dictated and pronounced in the open court, accused namely Somnath Bharti stands acquitted for offences punishable under section 323 IPC read with section 149 IPC, section 147 and section 109 IPC,” the court said in a short two-page order.Bharti did not respond to repeated calls and texts. However, advocate Mohammad Irshad, counsel for Bharti, said that his client has been acquitted by the court after the witnesses and the complainant were untraceable and did not come to the court. A detailed copy of the judgment is yet to be uploaded on the official website of the Delhi courts.Police lodged a first information report (FIR) on January 19 against unknown accused on the court’s direction and booked them for various charges dealing with wrongful confinement, criminal intimidation and act intended to insult the modesty of a woman. On Sep 29, 2014, a charge sheet was filed by the police against Bharti and 17 others for molestation and creating a ruckus on January 16 midnight when a mob allegedly ‘raided’ a house in south Delhi, police said on Wednesday.The 18 accused were formally charged under 16 sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 153-A (promoting enmity between classes), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (outraging modesty of women), 509 (uttering any word or making any gesture intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 147 (rioting).Police, in an over 100-page charge sheet, had cited around 40 prosecution witnesses, including nine African women.The court had asked the police on September 10 to file the final status report on the investigation.

14-10-2020||Delhi||To speed up rejuvenation of water bodies, DJB comes out with SOPs, three-pronged strategy||To speed up work on the rejuvenation of water bodies in the national capital, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has recently come up with a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a three-pronged strategy. As part of the new rules, a few such projects will be clubbed together before tenders are floated, and each project will be divided into three phases -- garbage removal and excavation of the waterbody; arrangement of water from a nearby sewage treatment plant; and landscaping of surroundings.Delhi Jal Board vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said, “The ‘revival of water bodies’ project is one that is close to my heart. Tenders have been floated for 59 water bodies and work has been awarded for 46 water bodies. The work at 10 sites -- Ibrahimpur, Karala, Daulatpur, Neelwal, Hiranki, Sirsapur, Mungeshpur, Bindapur, Nangli Poona and Tikri Kalan -- is likely to be completed soon. Wastewater being discharged into these water bodies shall be treated through sustainable wetlands, enabling a green process of wastewater purification and a step towards enhancement of local microclimate and biodiversity. For transparent execution of the rejuvenation work on the remaining water bodies, SOPs have been finalised, which will ensure uniformity in procedures that are being adopted at present.”The DJB has recently completed rejuvenation work at a waterbody in west Delhi’s Rajokri. A senior DJB official, on condition of anonymity, said the board has approved the SOPs to speed up the work on pending projects. The protocols (mentioned above) are part of the new SOPs that were finalised on September 13, according to a document seen by HT.The DJB has to rejuvenate more than 200 water bodies in the city – most of them are lakes and ponds – and it has already initiated work on 155 water bodies, said a senior government official, not wishing to be named.The official further said these SOPs will apply to 72 of the 155 projects. For the remaining 83 projects, consultation contracts have been awarded to CSIR-NEERI and the consultants have prepared project reports on 71 projects in hand. Work order has also been issued for 46 projects, the official quoted above said.These projects include the water bodies in Ibrahimpur, Karala, Daulatpur, Neelwal, Hiranki, Sirsapur, Mungeshpur, Bindapur, Nangli Poona and Tikri Kalan, the official said. These villages are located in the west, south-west north-west peripheries of the capital city. “Water bodies should be clubbed into packages of 30 to 50 (in) each package and bids should be floated in parallel to expedite the process,” said the document.The clubbing of projects is a strategy earlier used by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for several projects such as the construction of classrooms across schools and the setting up of mohalla clinics (primary health care centres).According to the SOPs, all water bodies should have three phases of development. The first phase includes removal of garbage, fencing of site and excavation of the waterbody up to the desired depth. The second includes the arrangement of water source for rejuvenation from the nearest sewage treatment plant or the setting up of an on-site plant for directly treating wastewater. The third phase includes landscaping of water bodies to create a public space. While environmentalists have welcomed the move, they said treated water from STPs shouldn’t be used to revive water bodies. Diwan Singh, a Delhi-based environmentalist who has been working for the revival of water bodies, said, “It is good that they have come out with SOPs. But instead of STP water, they should use water from stormwater drains to recharge the water bodies. By using the water from STPs, we are just polluting the groundwater, as the STP water is not 100% clean. Wherever treated water has been used in water bodies, that area has ended up stinking,” Singh said.Experts also stress on the need to have biological communities in the waterbody to ensure it is sustainable. CR Babu, professor emeritus at Delhi University’s School for Environment Studies, said, “The aim should not just to rejuvenate the waterbody, but to ensure that it is self sustainable. For that, the waterbody should have biological communities, which can survive only in fresh water. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) in treated water is very high. If STP water is used, then authorities will have to pump the treated water again and again to maintain the required BOD level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-speed-up-rejuvenation-of-water-bodies-djb-comes-out-with-sops-three-pronged-strategy/story-jR4akc5HEdjmexhtBglOuJ.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Hindu Rao Hospital de-notified as Covid-19 facility, docs from two more hospitals to go on strike||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital, where resident doctors are currently agitating over unpaid salaries, was on Tuesday removed from the list of designated Covid-19 facilities in the national capital, the Delhi government said. Hindu Rao is one of the five hospitals run by the north corporation and the only one to treat Covid-19 patients.The other four hospitals are Rajan Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, Maharshi Valmiki Infectious Disease hospital, Kasturba Hospital, and Giridhari Lal hospital.The resident doctors association (RDA) of Hindu Rao Sunday went on an indefinite strike after the civic body failed to clear the salary dues. Abhimanyu Sardana, president of RDA, Hindu Rao Hospital, said doctors are continuing with their strike. “From Wednesday, resident doctors of Kasturba Hospital and Rajan Babu Institute will also join the strike,” he said. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the RDA of Kasturba Hospital said doctors have not received salaries since July. “We would like to inform you that we will be on strike for the next seven days, from October 14 to 20, or till our salaries are paid. After October 20, all resident doctors will give in their resignations en masse,” read the statement.In an order issued by principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt on Tuesday, the government said Hindu Rao Hospital was declared a designated Covid-19 facility on June 14 in view of the surge in cases back then.“A request has been received from the commissioner, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, for converting Hindu Rao Hospital to a non-Covid hospital. The matter has been examined and in view of the low average bed occupancy of the hospital and the request received from the North DMC, the hospital is being removed from the list of designated Covid-19 hospitals with immediate effect,” read the order.The Delhi government, on Saturday, ordered the shifting of Covid-19 patients from Hindu Rao to its own health facilities. Seventeen patients were shifted Lok Nayak Hospital and three to Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, while those in the intensive care unit of Hindu Rao Hospital continued to remain there.Civic officials said the out-patient department (OPD) of the 900-bed hospital reopened to non-Covid patients from Tuesday. “The Delhi government agreed to our demand of de-linking Hindu Rao Hospital. Since the order, already 137 non-Covid patients were attended to at the hospital’s OPD. As for salaries, we are trying to disburse the funds by next week. But, the order will be from bottom to top, which means that the lower rung staff will be paid dues before the doctors,” said Jai Prakash, mayor of North corporation. AAP DEMANDS SPECIAL SESSION Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and civic bodies in-charge Durgesh Pathak Tuesday demanded that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled civic bodies call a special session and pass a proposal to hand over both Hindu Rao and Kasturba Gandhi hospitals to the Delhi government. “The BJP should immediately call a session of the MCD and pass the matter in the house and in the standing committee by which these hospitals can be handed over to the Delhi government under the AAP. The AAP will run these hospitals within the available budget and develop these hospitals like the way we have developed the health infrastructure in Delhi,” he said. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, who is also a councillor in the North corporation, said, “The corporations are facing a financial problem and are unable to pay salaries as the Delhi government is not releasing funds. The government has further reduced our funds by nearly 58% on account of the pandemic. Even the Delhi government is unable to pay salaries to its own guest teachers, professors, doctors and so on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hindu-rao-hospital-de-notified-as-covid-19-facility-docs-from-two-more-hospitals-to-go-on-strike/story-H3ohaMHQGjcfJqZz9VvQaJ.html

It was estimated to cost Rs 58,000. Samples have been sent to a laboratory in Karnal for analysis.The raid was conducted at 6 am on Tuesday following the tip off that cottage cheese was being sold from a rented room in Barwala.Panchkula food safety officer, Dr Gaurav Sharma, said he could not comment on the quality of the product till lab reports were received, which, he said, “have been sought in two days.” Dr Sharma said product was being manufactured in Narwana and t brought to Barwala in a car. The sellers “had taken a room on rent where they used to store the paneer to supply to villages close by at cheap rates.” In fact, the low price, Rs 160 to Rs 180, per kg, almost 50% less than market rates, had first raised suspicions, he added.Later it was found that the sellers also did not have a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India license, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/324-kg-cottage-cheese-worth-rs-58-000-seized/story-VMaIiLP6QYQKMBWF6lUZpI.html

Kejriwal, who was launching the first batch of the bio-decomposer solution developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which promises to turn crop residue into manure without having to burn the stubble, said that while farmers of neighbouring states and people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, “governments have shut their eyes”. “State governments should stop blaming each other. We have to work together to find a solution to the issue. All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now,” Kejriwal said at the Hiranki village in Narela, where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday. Kejriwal said that if the Delhi government can make efforts to prevent stubble burning, so can other state governments. “When the process was in its initial phase, I made attempts to contact the Central government and if they wanted, they could have worked with us to address the issue,” he said. “We got to know about the technology developed by the Pusa Institute in September, and so did they. We have to work together with sincerity,” he said. The bio-decomposer developed by Pusa Institute was sprayed free of cost in around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown. “While the farmers of neighbouring states and the people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes. I hope that they take concrete steps so that the entire north India gets rid of high levels of air pollution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-launches-bio-decomposer-solution-says-states-must-work-together-against-pollution/story-f3IM0hEnyTJIJBz8psKRjM.html

According to DU admission rules, students are required to submit certificates issued on or after March 31 in the year of admission. This year, however, owing to the Covid-enforced lockdown many students could not get new certificates issued.In an email sent to all colleges on Tuesday, the DU admission branch said it was brought to their notice that the nodal officers in some colleges were insisting on the latest EWS/OBC certificate. The admission branch has directed the colleges to allow students to take admissions by submitting the self-attested copy of the acknowledgement slip and undertaking of ensuring the production of the certificate within the stipulated period mentioned in the undertaking.In the undertaking, students have been asked to provide details of their application for the new certificate. “I undertake that, my admission against reserved seat is subject to the submission of valid OBC (Non-Creamy Layer Validity) / EWS Income and Asset Certificate authentication for the the assessment year 2019-20 within the given time limit of 14 days from the date of admission subject to the last day of the admission,” it reads.In case the students fail to submit the required certificate/documents within the given time limit, they will not be able to claim admission against the reserved seat. “I also state that I am aware of the fact that my admission is subject to the validation of my original certificates, otherwise my admission is liable to be cancelled,” the undertaking added.Students have welcomed the decision. Hritik, a resident of Dwarka who is seeking admission in BA (Hons) in Sanskrit, said he could not apply for a new OBC certificate issued earlier due to the prevailing situation. “Last month, I visited the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) office and was told to apply online. My certificate is yet to be issued. I am glad that the university has given us some more time to get a new certificate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-gives-students-14-days-to-submit-fresh-obc-certificate/story-1u8zCutvWVoSm2fKMIJjgK.html
14-10-2020||Education||Admissions pick up on Day 2 in DU, over 6700 manage to complete process||Undergraduate admissions picked up pace across Delhi University (DU) colleges on Tuesday, with around 7,640 applications being approved and 6,790 students managing to complete all required formalities. The university has switched to a completely online admission process this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.According to the data provided by the university, as many as 49,712 students had applied for the 70,000 undergraduate seats across 61 colleges (excluding St Stephen’s and Jesus and Mary) by 8pm on Tuesday. Of them, 7,640 applications were approved by the colleges. Of these, at least 6,790 students completed the admission process by paying their fees.The admission process went slow on the first day on Monday, the first day of admissions for the new session, when only 920 students managed to complete formalities under the first cut-off list. The admission process under the first cut-off will conclude by 5pm on Wednesday, with the second cut-off set to be released on or before October 19.Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College, which has announced a 100% cut-off for three subjects — Political Science, Psychology, and Economics this year — had received over 300 applications for all courses on offer by Tuesday evening. College principal Suman Sharma said, “We are still in the process of approving these applications. We got the maximum applications for Political Science (Hons) followed by BSc in Mathematics.”When asked if the three subjects having 100% cut-offs are likely to be available in the second list, she said, “We are expecting to have seats in all the three courses in the second list. We never wanted to fill the seats with 100% scorers only.”At Hindu College, more than 321 students had paid their fees and completed the admission process till Tuesday evening. In Ramjas, as many as 300 applications had been approved by the college by 7pm on Tuesday, with the maximum students applying for Political Science (Hons) and BSc in Statistics. College principal Manoj Khanna said, “We have 75 seats in Political Science and as of now 100 applications have been approved by the college. It seems the course won’t be available in the second list.”In Hansraj College, 103 admissions were done in Science courses, 225 in Commerce and Humanities, collectively, by Tuesday evening. In Rajdhani College, 230 admissions were approved by 6pm, with the maximum of them being for BSc (Hons) in Mathematics. Meanwhile, several colleges said that problems of slow Internet connectivity and an elaborate online screening process – which involves checking the mark sheets and other documents, including caste certificates – continued to eat up into a lot of their time on the second day of admissions as well.An official of a North Campus college, on condition of anonymity, said, “The entire process is taking a lot of time since we have to cite reasons for any application that we reject. Students with cut-offs much lesser than ours have been applying and we have to reject them. To open the form, extract the email id, and then write a response takes a minute at least. Classes are also going on, so the staff is busy with that as well. Hence, the entire process has slowed down.”Miranda House acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said, “Though nodal officers have been burdened with a lot of work, the least we can do for students scoring 95-96% is tell them why they are not getting admission. Earlier, they used to come to college and a lot of physical counselling went into it. Parents and students need some sort of response if their applications are not cleared.” Till Tuesday evening, the college had approved around 340 applications, out of which 142 students had paid the fees. Officials said the college is likely to close admissions for BA (Honours) in Political Science for the second cut-off list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admissions-pick-up-on-day-2-in-du-over-6700-manage-to-complete-process/story-hI3dUZuUnsO7KDh3SYYiVM.html

The two girls died during treatment at different hospitals on Tuesday, while the boy and their uncle are critical. The police are yet to identify the vehicle.According to the police, just short of midnight, they got a call about the incident that took place at about 11.45 pm near Gurudwara Nanak Piao in Model Town on GT Road. A police team reached the spot found that one Jaspal Singh, a resident of Burari, was out with his wife, his family friend Milap Singh, 35, and Milap’s three children in his car. “Jaspal Singh stopped at a CNG pump on GT Road to refuel his car when Milap and the three children stepped out. Soon as they were crossing the road, a speeding four-wheeler knocked them and fled the spot,” said a police officer who wished not to be named.The officer said the family then called the police control room. While Jaspal Singh and his wife took Gaurav (5) and Ishika (7) to a nearby hospital, from where they were later referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre, a PCR van rushed Milap Singh and Bhoomi (4) to the Trauma Centre at Civil Lines. They were sent to Safdarjung Hospital later.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said Ishika and Bhoomi died during treatment. Milap Singh and Gaurav are still under treatment and are critically injured.The DCP said a case of rash driving and causing death due to negligence has been registered. “Initial probe has suggested the vehicle was a car. We are checking CCTV footage to identify the vehicle. A crime and forensics team was sent to the accident spot for an inspection,” she said.Jaspal works as a driver while Milap is a gas station attendant.The two girls who died had celebrated their birthday on September 23. Ravi Singh, a relative of Jaspal Singh, said both the girls had their birthday in the same week and celebrated the day together. “Their father used to work at a call centre but was currently working on and off due to health reasons for the past few months. Milap Singh is like a family friend to Jaspal and he was taking the kids along, probably for an outing. We got a call about the hospital late night,” Ravi Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisters-dead-brother-injured-in-hit-and-run-on-gt-road-in-northwest-delhi/story-JS7mLks3JFhzN3hBPGHISM.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP lock horns on health trade licences in Delhi||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCD) continued to issue and renew health trade licences of restaurants, despite being asked by the centre not to do so, as they are ‘deep in corruption’, a claim the BJP denied.Durgesh Pathak, AAP’s in-charge of MCD affairs, on Tuesday quoted a letter, purportedly written by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), a statutory body under the Union health ministry, to the commissioners of the three MCDs, directing them to stop issuing health trade licences as that has been taken care of by the central authority.“It is a direction from the central government. But the BJP-led MCDs are so deep into corruption that they are violating central government guidelines. Health trade licence is a scam that exceeds Rs 350 crore every year. No license is issued or renewed without a bribe. Money is distributed among BJP leaders. That is why the BJP is violating the central guidelines and continues to issue and renew health trade licences to restaurant owners,” Pathak said.Last week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had directed the MCDs to do away with health trade licences. Replying to the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We fail to understand the anxiety of the Aam Aadmi Party over MCD-issued health licences for restaurants even as their own government issues half-a-dozen licences to the same restaurants, including excise, and that involves extreme corruption.” “Health licences are annually issued and for the current year, they were issued much before the September letter of FSSAI. Health licence involves many aspects of public health while the FSSAI letter takes note of just one, that is food quality. Hygiene and seating in restaurants are other aspects covered by health licence and MCDs are examining all angles. They will take a decision on the issue before next renewal due in April 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-lock-horns-on-health-trade-licences-in-delhi/story-vNFXgpXLqQLGJkqW9Te4HI.html

The high court bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan was hearing a plea seeking the removal of encroachments from a municipal park in Block P-4, Sultanpuri. Petitioner Dilshad Siddique, through his advocate Javed Ahmad, told the court that the authorities have failed to act against the illegal encroachments upon the children park’s and the adjacent public road despite repeated complaints.The bench warned officials of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation of strict action and said they cannot shy away from regular duties -- the park has to be cleaned on a regular basis and not just “once in a blue moon”.“Let a park remain a park, it cannot be made into a parking. We will take strict action against your officials,” the bench told the north civic body counsel, while directing that immediate steps be taken to remove the encroachments from the park. Siddique had contended that the fundamental rights of people, particularly of children, are being infringed upon on account of “illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional action of the respondents ( municipal corporation)”.“Helpless children have been deprived of their fundamental rights to use the public park for recreation. Even the public at large is facing difficulties and harassment as the public road leading to Nangloi remains blocked or extremely congested due to unauthorised or illegal parking of vehicles coming to the fish market (sic),” the plea read.Appearing for the north corporation, advocate Mansi Gupta, told the court that action has been taken and the encroachments had been removed once previously. However, the court said that clearing encroachments and keeping an area free of encroachments is not a single-day affair; rather, it was a continuous one.“ The officer should know what work has to be done to keep it safe. It is not a single-day affair but rather a continuous effort,” the bench said.According to Siddique, on August 21, he had sent a complaint to the station house officer of Sultanpuri and the deputy commissioner of North corporation, communicating that illegal and parking of vehicles in the park was depriving the public of conveniences.He said he again sent a representation on August 31 apprising the respondents of the situation, the plea said.When still no action was taken, Siddique moved the Delhi court with the present plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/public-park-not-meant-for-vehicle-parking-says-hc-while-ordering-restoration-of-sultanpuri-park/story-p8Ia5W6bOdAqiRerBvBOxL.html

The New Delhi district has launched a “maskfie” (taking a selfie while wearing a mask) contest, wherein the winner would be featured on LED billboards maintained by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC).“More and more people have started stepping out from this week due to the Navratri, which begins from Saturday (October 17). So, this contest is a way to intrigue people and then seek their participation and cooperation. A contestant just has post a selfie wearing a mask and an awareness message on Twitter. Every week, one winner will be featured on the hoardings of the New Delhi district as ‘#YouMascot’,” said Piyush Rohankar, nodal officer for Covid-19, New Delhi district.Interested residents can post the selfie on Twitter with hashtags #MaskfieContest #MaskfieOfTheWeek #DelhiFightsCorona #WearAMask or #MaskItUp, Rohankar said.District magistrate (south-west) Rahul Singh said his office has roped in Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar, who is from Baprola village in the same district, to persuade people to wear masks while stepping out.“We have also roped in renowned Punjabi singer Jasbir Jassi of the ‘Dil Le Gayee’ fame to spread awareness. Wrestler Kumar is a household name in the south-west district and people look up to him, Our aim is to tell people that unlocking activities does not mean the end of the pandemic. Wearing masks, maintaining a physical distance and hand hygiene are mandatory at all times, even during festivities,” Singh asserted. The district administration has also started a series of “Ram Lila street plays” through which the characters of Ram and Laxman narrate stories of Covid warriors and also impart messages to ensure basic awareness of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Almost all 11 districts of Delhi are also taking the help of religious leaders and organisations in their communications campaign. “School teachers are now making students take a pledge to follow Covid rules before the start of each online class. Religious and spiritual leaders from organisations such as ISKON, Radha Saomi Satsang, various temples, gurdwaras and mosques are also imparting Covid awareness before and after every prayer session,” said a senior official in north-west district, which also has the highest number of Covid-19 cases --2,989 active cases-- in the city. The south-east district, led by district magistrate Harleen Kaur, has been regularly carrying out foot marches with messages such as “Ghar se nikalte samay SMS ka dhyan rakhe - Sanitiser, Mask, Social distancing” painted on placards and banners. The intensive awareness campaign comes after the Centre, on October 1, asked the Delhi government to prepare and launch a mega Covid-19 awareness drive ahead of the festive season when a number of large gatherings take place across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ram-laxman-talking-about-covid-warriors-selfies-with-masks-districts-resort-to-novel-ways-to-keep-virus-at-bay/story-1kds90IxEw47jzSIxxe8sK.html
14-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi police to keep watch on social distancing, masks in popular markets during festive season||Ahead of the festival season, Delhi Police have identified at least 300 markets where there could be a heavy footfall in the coming weeks, and have planned to deploy special teams to ensure people follow social distancing rules and wear masks in contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Senior Delhi Police officers said their teams that are presently issuing fines to people on the road for not wearing masks or violating social distancing norms, will soon be posted in markets with high footfall such as Lajpat Nagar, Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar and Karol Bagh. Loudspeakers at the markets, presently used to make security-related announcements and caution people about unidentified objects, will be used to disseminate information about masks. Many markets in Delhi have active containment zones, where it is important to ensure all shoppers wear masks. Chandni Chowk in central Delhi has at least 13 containment zones, and Karol Bagh, also a popular market, which sees large crowds during festivals, has at least 26 active containment zones. Containment zones are sealed areas where the free movement of individuals is prohibited to contain the spread of the infection. All residents are put under strict surveillance and are periodically screened.A police officer from south Delhi, who did not wish to be named, said, “We will make the announcements real-time. At many markets such as Sarojini Nagar and Lajpat Nagar, we have watchtowers from where we spotted suspicious people. This year the towers will be used to check social distancing norms and crowds outside and inside shops. Issuing fines will be the last alternative. We will speak to the shoppers after watching their movement from our control room through CCTV cameras.”A report prepared by the National Control for Disease Control (NCDC) has cautioned that there could be at least 15,000 Covid-19 cases per day in the upcoming winters and festivals. The report has been drafted by NCDC under the supervision of Dr VK Paul, Chairman of NITI Aayog Member (Health).

The city on Tuesday recorded 3,036 new cases, with a positivity rate of 5.52%, and 45 deaths.Delhi police officers said the strict checks on the use of masks on the streets is working well because people are now wary about the Rs 500 fine. Police have to date (until Tuesday afternoon 4 pm), fined 386,188 persons and collected a total of Rs 19,30,94,000(19.30 crore) for not wearing masks.“We have been taking several steps such as making announcements for wearing masks, follow social distancing, and washing hands regularly. These are being done through police vehicles and public address systems that are in place at crowded places such as markets. Our police staff present in such places apprise people about the three precautionary measures to fight coronavirus (Covid-19). For the violators ,we are issuing challans. For the needy, police is distributing masks,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal.Health experts have said wearing masks and washing hands, when out in public, is the main precaution against the coronavirus disease . Police said apart from penalising those who do not wear masks, their teams will fine shopkeepers who are callous about social distancing norms.“The fine for the first time is Rs 500. If the shopkeepers do not ensure social distancing, the fine is twice the amount. A case can be registered under the Indian Penal Code section if they continue to violate the norms. We will keep making announcements and request both shoppers and shopkeepers. It requires cooperation from their end mainly,” another police officer said.Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of the Lajpat Nagar market welfare association, said they are in touch with the local police. “We have meetings regularly. We will follow all guidelines put in place by the government. We are working with police and will give them recordings that have to be played through the public address system. The PA system is monitored by the police. We will ensure there is no crowding in the market. Every shop has to have a thermal scanner and sanitising station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-to-keep-watch-on-social-distancing-masks-in-popular-markets-during-festive-season/story-vTEbDBT0isQr21J19KG2bM.html

We had set up cameras in a chamber to release mosquitoes. The mosquitoes avoid sitting on the cloth that was mosquito repellent. Similarly, we had given bed sheets and pillow covers made of the special cloth material to students and received encouraging results,” said Bains.Later, PAU made tops and wristbands for sportspersons and thereafter, shirts were made for the security staff to check the effectiveness of cloth material in outdoor conditions.He said that initially, they began with the trials of three plants having mosquito repellent properties including rosemary, citronella and eucalyptus. However, eucalyptus was found to be the most effective plant.“We had to be cautious about the right amount of mixture of oil in the fabric to avoid it becoming poisonous,” said Bains. Sumeet Grewal, scientist, department of apparel and textile science, said that the mosquito repellent properties will remain on the fabric till 15 washes.The fabric is ready for commercial use. The university has signed a memorandum of understanding with a Haryana-based company that will use the technology for commercial purposes.Bains said besides the department of community science, Sumeet Grewal and Devinder Kochar, professor of the department of zoology were involved in developing the technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-dengue-cases-pau-develops-anti-mosquito-fabric/story-zFyKFN1mJfz83QEIpkWLNK.html

Such infections are more common in toenails than fingernails, said Dr Sunil Gupta, professor and head of the dermatology department at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). According to Dr Gupta, a fungal nail infection is not usually painful unless it becomes severe. According to Dr Sukhjot Kaur, associate professor (dermatology), a severe case of nail fungus can be painful and may cause permanent damage to the nails. It may lead to other serious infections that spread beyond one’s feet if they have a suppressed immune system due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. People with diabetes have reduced blood circulation and nerve supply, so such patients are also at greater risk of a bacterial skin infection called cellulitis. “See a doctor if you have diabetes and think you’re developing nail fungus,” said Dr Gupta. Dr Jaspriya Sandhu, assistant professor of dermatology, said precautions for keeping the infection at bay included keeping hands and feet clean and dry, and clipping fingernails and toenails short.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/keep-hands-feet-clean-to-keep-fungal-nail-infections-at-bay-experts/story-FKrjuoBXE773QksyigwTMK.html

According to the association, a second-round must be conducted for students who are now eligible according to the new norms of state government and for those who didn’t appear for the exam earlier due to the Covid-19 fear. The association has written a letter to the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The association in its letters have referred to the recent order by the Supreme Court to conduct another round of NEET exam for those students who have missed it due to Covid pandemic. Last week, the state higher and technical education department reduced the cut-off percentage by 5 per cent for Class 12 scores through a government resolution. This will benefit aspirants in admission, and also students who have not applied earlier due to fewer marks can appear for the CET exams again. Along with engineering, the cut-off for admissions to undergraduate courses in Pharmacy, Hotel Management and Catering Technologies, Law, Fine Arts, and Design were also reduced by 5 per cent in the higher secondary exams. “When the Class 12 results were declared, a large number of students didn’t apply due to fewer marks. After the new notifications were issued by the state government, many students want admission but they have not appeared for the CET exams. Another important issue was about safety, as most of the CET exam centres were in cities, the students from rural areas were unable to appear for the exam. This number is also, huge which is from the rural area and want to give the CET exam for admission to various courses,” said Ramdas Zol, president of the association. “So, our demand to the state government is to conduct another round of CET exam in the state so that thousands of students can benefit from it. Also, the educational institutes where every year seats remain vacant can now get admissions for this year. Everyone has suffered due to the Covid-19 pandemic and by taking the second round of CET exam can benefit all. It has already happened in NEET exams, as Supreme court has given one more chance to students to appear for the exam. Then why can’t it happen for our state CET exams.” he added. Army organises Combined Entrance Exam (CEE) The Army Recruiting Office, Pune has organised a Combined Entrance Examination (CEE) for the post of a soldier (general duty, tradesman and technical) on November 1, 2020. There are 2,262 candidates from five districts (Pune, Osmanabad, Latur, Beed and Ahmednagar) who will appear for the examination.

Post unlock also there was not much rise in the number of sales leading to registration of vehicle in all sectors like motorcycles, cars, autorickshaws or commercial goods vehicles. “As Covid has impacted all sectors and sales of various goods, it has also hampered vehicle sale. In the last six months, there is very less number of vehicles registered at Pune RTO. We can understand it is due to Covid crisis, but we hope to see a rise in sale during the forthcoming festival season of Navratri and Diwali,” said Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-rto-revenue-takes-a-hit-as-vehicle-registrations-dip/story-X66dm9ttwfS1BsfMg2QS6K.html

Citing caveats on the order, Kumar clarified that no children below the age of 10, or senior citizens above the age of 65, will be allowed to participate. Also, the ability of the sport to ensure a minimum level of social distancing will be the rule of law in terms of it being permissible. Kumar said, “Outdoor games like cricket and kho-kho, and indoor games like badminton and tennis will be allowed, where social distancing can be maintained. This permission is only for practice and organisations cannot hold any sports events.” Swimming pools and gymnasiums will continue to remain closed. The PMC order states that only players deemed necessary should be allowed to play, to ensure there is no rush at any given time.Sports complex authorities are to conduct thermal scanning of players and employees, and keep a record of players for the purpose of contact tracing, if needed.Kumar said, “While practising indoors, windows and doors should kept open to avoid the use of air conditioning. The equipment used should be sanitised repeatedly.”If players have any symptoms like a cough or are running temperature, they should not be allowed to participate. Mohan Jadhav, cricket coach, Vengsarkar Cricket Academy, said, “It is good news of resuming sports activities. We have put in place our SOPs at our academy.”.Tejal Hasabnis, India A player, said, “To get the permission was very crucial for players who were doing skill practice at homes. Now they can hone their talent on the ground.”Ranjeet Natu, honorary secretary, Poona District Metropolitan Badminton Association, said, “Modern Sports Complex will be functioning from Thursday and all nine courts will be open for practice. We will have SOPs and onus is on players to follow norms.”Purva Barve, Pune shuttler, said, “I am happy with the news. While I was regular in fitness workout at home, I was missing courts. My coach Nikhil Kanetkar gave me timely pep talks and helped me whenever I was tense.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cricket-kho-kho-badminton-get-green-light-to-resume-practice-no-events-allowed/story-lvPIKy32pnbw1DsO69lDZL.html
14-10-2020||Pune||Modi cautions Maharashtra of rising Covid cases, asks people to follow norms||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday cautioned Maharashtra of Covid pandemic saying the people in the state should be extra cautious of the spread of virus given that the state has highest number of cases across the country. Modi after releasing the autobiography of late former Union minister Balasaheb Vikhe Patil via video conferencing, said the Covid-19 threat still persists and people should not show laxity towards the virus. The prime minister also urged residents to observe social distancing norms and maintain personal hygiene till a vaccine is available saying the concern is more in Maharashtra, which has reported the highest number of virus cases in India. “I request people of Maharashtra that there should be no lax attitude towards wearing face masks, washing hands regularly, maintaining cleanliness and observing physical distance norms,” said Modi. “We have to always remember that there should be no laxity till there is a vaccine. We will definitely win this battle,” he added. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis were also present during the virtual programme. As on Monday, Maharashtra has seen total 1,535,315 Covid cases across state with 40,514 deaths. As the government has unlocked most sectors, people are stepping out on roads in large numbers. Taking cognisance of laxity by people in following the Covid protocol, Thackeray in his address to people of state on Sunday said that there is a need for everyone to wear mask and adhere to norms. During his webcast, Thackeray said Covid is a “foreign guest not leaving the state despite best efforts”, and added that it is spreading from cities to rural areas. He said 70 to 80 per cent of Covid patients are asymptomatic, and termed face mask as the self-defence or the “black belt” in the fight against the viral infection till a vaccine comes up. “I don’t want to impose strict laws or penalty against violators of the Covid protocols. The war against the pandemic will be won by people’s whole-hearted participation. You have to decide whether you want to wear mask, follow physical distancing or be in lockdown. Whatever is started shouldn’t be closed down again,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modi-cautions-maharashtra-of-rising-covid-cases-asks-people-to-follow-norms/story-fMTchxpSgeKtEMYGckoUjN.html
14-10-2020||Chandigarh||Three of the 17 Hisar juvenile undertrials who fled observation homes found, efforts on to catch rest||A day after 17 juvenile undertrials, including eight booked for murder, escaped from an observation home in Hisar after attacking three guards, police rounded up three of them on Tuesday. One of the inmates was caught near Chaudhriwas village and the other from Talwandi Rana village, both in Hisar district, while the third juvenile’s arrest location was not shared by the police.“Efforts are on to catch the rest. The inmates had fled at 6.40pm on Monday after thrashing three security guards with rods. The incident took place when the inmates were brought to the compound for dinner. They thrashed the guards for 10 minutes before snatching the keys of the main gate and fleeing into the adjoining forest,” a police official said.Police forms 15 teams to catch the inmates Hisar superintendent of police Balwan Singh Rana said 15 teams have been formed to look for them. Police in other districts have been alerted. “I urge people not to give a lift to any suspicious person and alert us. Police have been deployed at all nakas and toll plazas in the district to check vehicles,” he said. Hisar observation home houses 97 inmatesA senior official of the observation home said there were 97 inmates in the home when the incident took place. “Six guards were on duty at the time. Three of them were injured and have been hospitalised in Hisar,” he said.Nine of the juveniles who escaped face charges of murder, while three are booked for attempt to murder, two under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, two face loot and robbery offence while one was booked for rioting in Jhajjar.“Eight of them belong to Jhajjar district, two each from Rohtak, Hisar and Delhi and one each from Bhiwani, Dadri and Karnal. Eight of the inmates were uncooperative and rowdy,” the official said. In January 2017, six juveniles had escaped from the home when an employee was opening barracks to provide water campers to inmates after dinner.Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni visited the observation home along with other administrative and senior police officials. Soni said a three-member team, led by additional deputy commissioner Aneesh Yadav, has been formed to investigate the case.“This team will probe how the juveniles managed to flee the home amid tight security. Teams have been formed to arrest the inmates at the earliest,” the DC added.HSCPCR commission chairperson Bainda inspects home Haryana state commission for protection of child rights (HSCPCR) chairperson Jyoti Bainda on Tuesday inspected the home. She said the actual reasons behind the incident will be known after a thorough probe.“The details of each and every juvenile will be checked. We will check the roster system of the observation home. Strict action will be taken if negligence is found on the part of security,” she added.An earlier inspection was deferred due to Covid-19 as some inmates had contracted the infection. In March, the observation home had 126 inmates and some of them were given bail after they tested positive for Covid -19, a source from the home said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-of-the-17-hisar-juvenile-undertrials-who-fled-observation-homes-found-efforts-on-to-catch-rest/story-5sqraEUL8Q53wqzaj0zLcK.html
14-10-2020||World||Covid-19: Will vaccines be equally effective for older people?||With several vaccine candidates undergoing various stages of human trials in the world, the efficacy of the vaccines among older people is now being questioned and discussed. While most of the trials by major pharma giants include older participants, the tilt is mostly towards young participants. Also, many older participants are at the risk of getting excluded from the trial because of other ailments.Moderna has reported that in its first phase trial, the vaccine candidate produced same results in younger and older population. China’s Sinovac, too, said its vaccines are working with same efficacy in older population as well. But the Pfizer vaccine was reported to have worked doubly better in younger population, indicating that one vaccine may not solve the Covid-19 crisis for all. According to researchers, anti-ageing supplements which reverses the ageing process and thereby improves immunity can be a solution to this problem. “The most exciting and potentially impactful technologies to treat Covid-19 are those that activate the body’s defences against ageing. It may even be possible to reset the age of cells and tissues so currently high-risk individuals can respond to viral infections as though they were young,” a Harvard paper has claimed. In a young person, immune cells recognise the SARS-CoV-2 virus when it first enters the upper respiratory tract. “For the immune system to effectively suppress, then eliminate SARS-CoV-2, it must perform four main tasks: (1) recognize, (2) alert, (3) destroy and (4) clear. Each of these mechanisms are known to be dysfunctional and increasingly heterogeneous in the elderly, but which aspect is most relevant to COVID-19 progression is not known,” the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-will-vaccines-be-equally-effective-for-older-people/story-Bqg7toyZ9AmOdThknnNkDP.html
14-10-2020||World||Greta Thunberg urges EU to do ‘as much as possible’ on climate||Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg on Wednesday urged EU leaders to “do as much as possible” to step up the bloc’s ambitions to reduce carbon output at this week’s summit.“Of course none of what has been proposed or pushed is in line with the science, but we are still demanding them to do as much as possible... to commit to what they had promised to do” in the 2015 Paris Agreement, Thunberg told AFP in an interview.Leaders must agree by the end of this year on their 2030 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the European Commission has proposed a goal of slashing them 55 percent compared with 1990 levels -- up from 40 percent under earlier plans.The ultimate aim under Brussels’ timetable would be carbon neutrality by 2050.Now heads of government will have their say, and must hammer out an option palatable to a European Parliament that has already criticised the Commission’s plan as not ambitious enough.On Wednesday, 11 member states including France, Spain and the Netherlands backed reductions of “at least 55 percent” by 2030.But many countries in the EU’s east, notably coal-intensive heavyweight Poland, are reluctant.Climate charities have warned that reductions of 55 or even 60 percent in EU greenhouse output would fall short of what’s needed to keep global warming below the two-degrees-Celsius ceiling agreed in Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-urges-eu-to-do-as-much-as-possible-on-climate/story-nS2B9oMRvp86IfDUaonejJ.html
14-10-2020||World||Federal crackdown aims to curb violent crime spike in New York City||The top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn announced Wednesday that he would put a new priority on firearms and drug cases, seeking stiffer penalties than are being doled out at the state level.Acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme said he was taking action to address a sharp rise in gun violence in New York City. He attributed the uptick to a “permissiveness” that has taken hold amid the coronavirus pandemic and the civil unrest that followed the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd.The initiative, which will involve more than a dozen federal prosecutors, is aimed at repairing the “protective fabric of our community,” DuCharme said, and making use of tougher federal sentences for criminals caught carrying illegal guns.“The city is not as safe as it once was, and it certainly doesn’t feel as safe,” DuCharme said. “When the threat was al-Qaida and ISIS, that’s where we went, and now the threat is essentially an environment that has permitted — and even encouraged in some instances — people to engage in sometimes seemingly random acts of lethal violence.”DuCharme, who was sworn into office in July, said a team of senior prosecutors in his office agreed “to take a pause on” other cases to help support the office’s expanded violent crime efforts.The characterization of New York as substantially less safe than it used echoes rhetoric President Donald Trump has employed recently on the campaign trail.It has been met with loud denials from many New York City Democrats, who note that overall crime rates in the city have actually dropped slightly during the pandemic, led by substantial reductions in the number of robberies, rapes, grand larcenies and serious assaults.The number of shootings, though, has increased dramatically, with the number of people hit by bullets nearly double what it was through the same point last year. Through Oct. 11, there have been 354 killings in the city — 90 more than there were at the same time last year, according to police.That would put the city on track to have its highest number of homicides since 2011, after several years of record lows, but would still leave New York as one of the safest big cities in the US. David Patton, Executive Director of the Federal Defenders of New York, criticized DuCharme’s initiative as “misguided,” saying that federal prosecutions of firearms offences often involve simple possession of a weapon found in a person’s home rather than the use of a gun to harm someone.“Researchers have shown that these prosecutions do not in fact reduce violent crime. They only exacerbate racial disparities and promote mass incarceration,” he said. “It might make for a good sound bite to bring a case from state court to federal court and add years to a person’s prison sentence, but it only contributes to over-incarceration and racial inequality.”The crackdown comes amid a broader push by Attorney General William Barr to bring federal charges in protest-related violence whenever they can, as in the case of two young Brooklyn attorneys accused of torching an empty NYPD vehicle during a demonstration this summer.In New York, some law enforcement figures have sharply criticized the state’s recent bail reform law, which eliminated cash bail and pretrial detention for most non-violent felonies. DuCharme said that has led to many more defendants in state firearms cases being released from custody following their arrest, compared to before the law changed.“It should be more stressful in New York City to be an armed, violent criminal offender than to be a member of the public,” DuCharme said. “For some reason, that balance has been tilted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-crackdown-aims-to-curb-violent-crime-spike-in-new-york-city/story-zmLEbG1iNYLOFlHgeVAWdN.html
14-10-2020||World||Trump, Biden to hold separate town hall meetings on Thursday||US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who are chasing each other with rallies and events in key battleground states in the final weeks of campaigning, will hold duelling town hall events on Thursday when they were scheduled to meet for their second debate, which got cancelled.The two events will be aired live at the same time, though from different locations. Both are being held in key battleground states: Trump will be in Miami, Florida for his town hall hosted by NBC News, according to a Wednesday announcement by the network, and Biden will be in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with ABC News.Trump and Biden were scheduled to meet on Thursday for their second presidential debate, which was to be an in-person town hall but had been turned virtual after the president tested positive for Covid-19. It was cancelled eventually, after Trump pulled out saying he did not want to debate Biden on a computer.The two nominees will take questions from members of the audience at their separate town halls, as they would have, but won’t have the chance, naturally, to attack each other in person.Trump trails Biden by a wide margin in national polls (by 9.8 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls and by 10.5 points in the FiveThirtyEight average) and in battleground states.With just three weeks to go for elections to close on November 3, the president is making his case with increasing desperation, seeking to reach voters beyond his base, whose solid support for him will not be enough.“Suburban women, will you please like me?” Trump appealed to a key constituency at a rally Tuesday in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a state that is being called a “tipping point” in the 2020 race for the White House. “I saved your damn neighbourhood, okay?” he added referring to an Obama-era anti-segregation rule he rescinded. Biden, the Democratic nominee, was in Pembroke, Florida, where he sought to peel away older white American supporters of Trump. “You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it because to Donald Trump, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re ‘virtually nobody’.”“That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you.”Eight out of 10 Covid-19 deaths reported in the US have been in adults aged 65 years and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Biden has made Trump’s handling of Covid-19, that has killed more than 215,000 Americans and infected nearly 8 million, as the key election issue. On Tuesday, he made his case to the most vulnerable. Older white voters have been a key support block for Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-to-hold-separate-town-hall-meetings-on-thursday/story-N9qJjM7M382P4ZuXAcqYLI.html
14-10-2020||World||More Indian-Americans likely to turn out for voting just because of Kamala Harris, reveals survey||Will Joe Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as his vice presidential nominee impact Indian-Americans? A survey conducted by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in collaboration with YouGov has revealed that at least 45 per cent of Indian-Americans feel that they are more likely to vote because of Indian-origin Kamala Harris. Interestingly, another 40 per cent said that Kamala Harris’ selection does not make any difference. Only 10 per cent, however, said they are unlikely to vote because of Kamala Harris. “In all, the Harris pick does seem to have galvanized a large section of the Indian American community with respect to turning out to vote,” the survey said.“49 percent of respondents indicated that Harris’s nomination made them more enthusiastic about Biden’s candidacy while just 15 percent reported that it made them less enthusiastic,” it said. But why Harris makes Indian-Americans enthusiastic about Biden? Is it only because of her origin?Yes, for at least 26 per cent respondents. About 19 per cent respondents see Harris as a moderate voice, 16 per cent would rally behind Harris because she is a woman.The analysis has based on a nationally representative online survey of 936 Indian American citizens conducted between September 1 and September 20, 2020.“Even though Indian Americans comprise slightly more than 1 percent of the total U.S. population—and less than 1 percent of all registered voters — both major parties are leaving no stone unturned in reaching out to this community,” the study said.Other findings of the surveyIndian Americans remain solidly with the Democratic Party: Despite Trump-Modi ties, there is scant evidence that Democratic voters are defecting toward Trump and the Republican Party. Seventy-two percent of registered Indian American voters plan to vote for Biden and 22 percent intend to vote for Trump in the 2020 November election.India-US relationship not a key factor: Economy and healthcare are the two most important issues influencing the vote choice of Indian Americans.Polarised views: Indian-American voters hold “markedly negative views of the opposing party and divergent positions on several contentious policy issues—from immigration to law enforcement.”Republican Party unwelcoming: “Indian Americans refrain from identifying with the Republican Party due, in part, to a perception that the party is intolerant of minorities and overly influenced by Christian evangelicalism,” the survey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/us-presidential-election/more-indian-americans-likely-to-turn-out-for-voting-just-because-of-kamala-harris-reveals-survey/story-btBYCkplCxMKckbqaeMkcJ.html

Covid-19 reinfection — second infection after getting fully recovered — has surfaced as a new phenomena as a few sporadic cases have been reported across the world. This is the first death caused by the same, reports claimed.The woman, as reports said, was also being treated for a rare type of white blood cell and cancer and hence her immunity was compromised. The second case occurred two days after her chemotherapy. Also Read: Covid-19 reinfection: Nevada man experienced severe symptoms during second bout of illnessWhen she tested Covid-19 positive for the first time, she had severe fever and cough and was hospitalised for a few days. Then she tested negative twice. But after 59 days, she showed the symptoms again and tested positive. Two weeks later, she died.Medical fraternity is divided over Covid-19 reinfection as studies are being conducted to find out whether these are reinfections or a case of prolonged shedding. It is possible to test negative and then again positive, but not all such cases are Covid-19 reinfections. But in this particular case, researchers found that the strain of the second-time infection was not the same with the first one, hence indicating reinfection. In Nevada, a Covid-19 reinfection case has been documented in a 25-year-old man and the second infection has been said to be worse that the first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-reinfection-death-89-year-old-dutch-woman-dies-in-netherlands-two-days-after-chemotherapy/story-jYCxR7UvapaSXt0OzYUTIL.html

Instead, they will be simultaneously, but separately, talking to voters in TV studios -- NBC for Trump and ABC for Biden.Trump will be in Miami, the network said, while Biden, who had already booked his appearance last week, will be in Philadelphia.Their scheduled debate had also been designed as a town hall where the two candidates would have fielded questions from voters, but this was upended after Trump contracted the coronavirus.Debate organizers said they wanted to switch the format to a virtual appearance, for safety reasons, and Trump refused, forcing cancellation of the event.NBC News said Wednesday it had received a statement from the clinical director at the National Institutes of Health and lead infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci that they had “a high degree of confidence” that Trump is now “not shedding infectious virus.”Trump and the NBC host will be socially distanced at the outdoor venue and the audience will wear safety masks, NBC said.Biden has been frequently testing for coronavirus and reporting negative results since Trump’s illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-to-hold-rival-tv-town-halls-instead-of-debate/story-lGMdfejCyvFOEBY9PFlvKN.html
14-10-2020||World||Pressure on UK PM Johnson to impose second national lockdown||The opposition Labour and experts on Wednesday called for another UK-wide lockdown following advice that the new three-tier alert system announced by the government may not effectively suppress the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases.Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted the calls after Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded the second lockdown. Expert advice by the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had favoured a short ‘circuit-breaker’ as early as September 21.As the new three-tier system of alerts and curbs came into effect in England on Wednesday, Northern Ireland announced partial lockdown that includes closure of schools and business establishment for a month.Calling for the second lockdown, Starmer said: “We’re at a decisive moment in the fight against coronavirus. The figures are stark and I’m afraid they’re all heading in the wrong direction. The number of Covid cases has quadrupled in the last three weeks.”“Cases may be doubling as quickly as every 7-8 days. There are now more people in hospital with Covid than on 23 March when we went into national lockdown. And while the number of cases is rising more sharply in some areas it is increasing across all regions of the UK and in all age groups.”“If we don’t (have another lockdown), we could sleep-walk into a long and bleak winter. The choice is now for the Prime Minister to make. I urge him to do so”, he added.Johnson responded at Prime Minister’s Question Time in the House of Commons that he did not rule out taking further measures but said the new system with more say to local leaders will be effective in suppressing the virus, which is at different levels in different parts of the UK.As of Tuesday evening, the UK had recorded 17,234 cases – more than three times the day-peaks of April and May – and 143 deaths. Overall, the UK has recorded 57,690 deaths and 634,920 cases, according to figures based on hospitals and care-homes.The UK’s first national lockdown for three weeks was announced on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-on-uk-pm-johnson-to-impose-second-national-lockdown/story-fQnpZc9gaNDh9FcsWxXH0J.html
14-10-2020||World||France appoints first envoy for Indo-Pacific, to focus on cooperation with India||In a sign of France’s greater focus on the Indian Ocean and the increasingly assertive behaviour of China across the region, President Emmanuel Macron has appointed the country’s first ambassador for the Indo-Pacific. Christophe Penot, one of France’s most senior diplomats who till recently was the envoy to Australia, will take over the new position from October 15, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. “Penot was appointed directly by President Macron. In his new capacity, he’ll pay special attention to cooperation with India as a foremost strategic partner in the region and with a view to implement the 2018 joint vision on the Indo-Pacific adopted by President Macron and Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi,” one of the people cited above said. Also Read: Russia threatens to halt dialogue with EU amid Navalny spatThe move, the people said, also reflects the priority given to the Indo-Pacific in France’s diplomacy and the need for a comprehensive approach to the region. Penot will be based in Paris and is expected to travel widely across the Indo-Pacific to coordinate with France’s partners and to forge new initiatives such as the trilateral dialogue launched with India and Australia last month to enhance cooperation and strengthen multilateralism. Beyond China’s aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific, there are other reasons for France’s focus on the region – the presence of 1.5 million French citizens on island territories, and the fact that 93% its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of more than 11 million sq km, the second largest in the world, is in the Indo-Pacific. France also has 8,000 soldiers stationed in the region. France, which signed a defence logistics support agreement with India in 2018, also has plans for more joint patrols and operations with India’s military in the Indian Ocean to protect the interests of both countries and ensure a rules-based order. These activities would have assumed a greater dimension this year if it hadn’t been for the Covid-19 pandemic, the people said. Also Read: China and Russia win seats on UN rights council, Saudis loseFrench officials also believe China’s presence at a string of civilian and military facilities, including Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Gwadar in Pakistan and Djibouti, has security implications for the Indian Ocean. Both Macron and French defence minister Florence Parly have spoken of “Indo-Pacific axis with France, India and Australia as its backbone”. France’s Indo-Pacific policy notes the region is at the heart of its efforts to ensure a stable, multi-polar order based on rule of law and free movement. France also envisages a strong involvement in settling regional crises, ensuring the safety of shipping routes and in fighting terrorism and radicalisation. Last month, Germany became the second major European Union power after France to adopt an Indo-Pacific policy, saying strategic competition for influence was increasing in the region that is “becoming the key to shaping the international order in the 21st century”. Unveiling the policy, German foreign minister Heiko Maas said: “We want to help shape [the international order of tomorrow] so that it is based on rules and international cooperation, not on the law of the strong.” Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said the move to appoint the envoy for the Indo-Pacific was in line with what France had been doing for the past two years to forge closer cooperation in the Indian Ocean, primarily with an eye on the island territories of Reunion and Mayotte. “Among the Europeans, the French were the first to come to the conclusion that they need to be part of the Indo-Pacific. It is clear to the Europeans that real global politics will unfold in the Indian Ocean and this is part of efforts to stay relevant in the region,” he said. “But a key issue will be their approach to China as the Europeans are expected to play a calibrated role as they aren’t coming to the Indo-Pacific solely because they want to side with democratic powers. However, this is a welcome development for India, which needs to coordinate its positions and perspectives on developments in the Indo-Pacific with European powers, especially France and Germany,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-appoints-first-envoy-for-indo-pacific-to-focus-on-cooperation-with-india/story-DQC7xgAfYujyN5fMHRJUJM.html
14-10-2020||World||Pakistan PM’s aide faces criticism for linking India to 2014 Peshawar school attack||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s adviser on national security has faced criticism within his country for claiming that India was linked to the 2014 terrorist assault on an army school in Peshawar, an attack for which the Taliban claimed responsibilty. Moeed Yusuf, special assistant to Khan on national security and strategic policy planning, made the claim during an interview with journalist Karan Thapar for the news portal The Wire. He alleged the mastermind of the assault from Jalalabad in Afghanistan was in touch with “handlers” at the Indian consulate in the same city as the attack was underway. Also read: PPP leader says Pak generals never accepted Constitution, asks govt to improve relations with IndiaYusuf also alleged that Indian intelligence had spent $1 million for the merger of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) with four other militant groups and that India was funnelling money to Baloch activists through think tanks in Afghanistan. However, he offered no evidence to back these claims. Yusuf contended in a tweet that he had “exposed previously unrevealed information about regular Indian state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan”. There was no response from Indian officials to Yusuf’s remarks. The Pakistani premier’s aide received praise for the interview but there was considerable criticism for his remarks related to the 2014 attack on the Army Public School (APS) in Peshawar, which resulted in the death of 149 people, including more than 130 children, and forced the former government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif to draw up a National Action Plan to counter terror groups. TTP, whose leader Mullah Fazlullah said it was in retaliation for Pakistan’s military operations in North Waziristan, claimed responsibility for it. Fazlullah, who was killed in a US drone strike in Afghanistan in 2018, had said in a video message at the time: ““We selected the army’s school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females…we want them to feel the same pain.” Former senator Farhatullah Babar, a senior leader of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) tweeted that Yusuf “saying that APS mastermind was in touch with an Indian consulate during attack is a tall claim”. “Proof must be placed before world and Pakistani people. [Yusuf] must not be seen parroting intel narrative without proof. @YusufMoeed credibility at stake,” Babar added. Civil society activist Marvi Sirmed, in a tweet, noted that Yusuf had said he has undeniable solid evidence about the school attack, including “verified tapes of 8 phone calls”, and questioned “why this was hidden from the people of Pakistan for so long?” Several social media users from Peshawar, where the school attack continues to be an emotional issue, were critical of the claim that India was somehow linked to the terrorist incident. They pointed out that they had been told by authorities for years that the Taliban and a former spokesman for the group, Ehsanullah Ehsan, were behind the school attack. They also noted that several local militants were sentenced to death by military courts for the attack. In August 2015, then Pakistan Army chief Raheel Sharif had confirmed the death sentence given by military courts to seven members of TTP and Toheed-wal-Jihad group for supporting and collecting funds for the school attack. In February 2015, the Pakistan Army’s media arm had announced the arrest of TTP member Taj Mohammad, whom it described as one of the “main executors” of the school attack. The convicted attackers were later hanged in November 2015 and April 2017. Yusuf had also contended in the interview that India has sent messages with “a desire for conversation” but refused to give details. He also set conditions for a dialogue with India, including release of political prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir, making Kashmiris a party to talks, and ending restrictions in the region. Indian officials have not responded to these remarks either. People familiar with developments in Islamabad said Yusuf’s move to do an interview with an Indian media outlet came after a go-ahead from the Pakistani military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-s-aide-faces-criticism-for-linking-india-to-2014-peshawar-school-attack/story-RPqBzraKo8ivzWXhJokhTI.html
14-10-2020||World||UK PM Johnson not heading for a full national lockdown yet, says minister||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not yet heading towards a full national lockdown in England despite calls from the opposition leader for a “circuit breaker” lockdown, Work and Pensions Minister Thérèse Coffey said on Wednesday.“I do not believe that the prime minister wants to set off on a national lockdown, but as ever he is advised by scientists - he takes that decision,” Coffey told Sky.Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer called on Tuesday for a two to three week “circuit breaker” lockdown to save lives. Starmer said Johnson’s attempt to tackle the virus wasn’t working.Asked if England was heading for a national lockdown in the next two weeks, Coffey said: “I don’t believe that is the case but as I say this will continue to be a decision that the prime minister will lead on.”Coffey said the three-tier system of lockdowns announced on Monday should be given a chance to work.But government scientific advisers said in a paper due to be published on Wednesday that a two-week full lockdown from October 24 could reduce deaths for the rest of the year from about 19,900 to 12,100, The Times reported.The paper by Graham Medley, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, says that “the optimal time for a break is always now; there are no good epidemiological reasons to delay the break.”If daily deaths reach more than 200, a circuit breaker could reduce the toll for the rest of the year from 80,000 to less than 40,000, The Times said.

14-10-2020||World||One American, two Russians blast off to International Space Station||A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying a U.S. astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Wednesday and successfully reached orbit, live footage broadcast by Russia’s space agency Roscosmos showed. The crew members travelling to the International Space Station (ISS) are Kate Rubins, a NASA microbiologist who in 2016 became the first person to sequence DNA in space, and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov.Watch: Spacecraft launch with NASA, Russia astronauts ahead of 20-year milestoneThe mission is the last scheduled Russian flight carrying a U.S. crew member.Since the space shuttle program ended in 2011, NASA has relied on Russia to ferry its astronauts to the space station, an orbiting laboratory 250 miles above Earth that has housed international crews of astronauts continuously for nearly 20 years.The U.S. space agency in 2014 contracted Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Boeing Co to build competing space capsules in an effort to reclaim NASA’s launch independence.The $8 billion program enabled SpaceX’s first manned trip to the space station in May, marking the first from home soil in nearly a decade.NASA has purchased additional crew seats from Russia as its public-private crew program faced delays, with Rubins’ mission being the most recent.The U.S. is scheduled to begin operational missions on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule.“We have an incredible partnership,” Rubins said in an interview from Russia’s Star City before her flight. “We’ll continue to train crews over here and we’re going to have cosmonauts come to the Johnson Space Center and train.”NASA and Roscosmos have committed to continue the flight-sharing partnership and are in talks to fly Russian astronauts on U.S. vehicles and to fly U.S. astronauts on Russian rockets when needed, a spokesperson for Roscosmos told Reuters.“Of course, mutual flights are of interest for ISS reliability and continuous operations,” the spokesperson said. “This approach (mixed crew flights) will ensure delivery of the crew to the station, should a problem with the partner spacecraft occur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-american-two-russians-blast-off-to-international-space-station/story-xmP6g2VboI8s7aNYbXgTkN.html
14-10-2020||World||Anchorage mayor resigns after allegations to texting sexual messages to underage girl surfaces||Anchorage Mayor Ethan Berkowitz, one of Alaska’s most prominent Democrats, resigned on Tuesday, days after he was accused of texting sexual messages to an underage girl and a local television anchor. Berkowitz, a former state lawmaker elected as Anchorage mayor in 2015, has denied texting the underage girl but acknowledged having a “consensual, inappropriate messaging relationship” with FOX/ABC journalist Maria Athens. “My resignation results from unacceptable personal conduct that has compromised my ability to perform my duties with the focus and trust that is required,” the mayor said in written statement announcing his resignation.“I know that my conduct has done great injury to my family, my staff, to Municipal employees, and to the people of our community, and for that, I am deeply sorry,” Berkowitz said.The unfolding scandal surrounding Berkowitz began when Athens accused Berkowitz, 58, of sending sexual messages and images to at least one underage girl. Athens, 41, included a photo that she said showed was Berkowitz’s bare back, with part of his buttocks exposed.Athens never broadcast her story; she was arrested Friday after getting into an altercation outside of her place of work. Berkowitz on Friday denied the accusations of sending sexual messages to minors, calling Athens “unwell.” On Monday, he admitted that he and Athens had a “major lapse in judgment” years earlier and had engaged in a “consensual, inappropriate messaging relationship.” Berkowitz’s last day in office will be Oct. 23, according to the resignation message. According to municipal rules, the chairman of the Anchorage Assembly will take over as interim mayor until a new mayor is chosen in the city’s regularly scheduled election next April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anchorage-mayor-resigns-after-allegations-to-texting-sexual-messages-to-underage-girl-surfaces/story-ZypPxX7JDubfH4orpqF9gN.html

14-10-2020||World||Justin Trudeau throws darts at Prez Xi to mark 50 years of ties with China||Led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties with China by castigating Beijing for its practice of “coercive diplomacy”.During a press interaction, Trudeau said Canada will “remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China’s approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens alongside other citizens of other countries around the world is not viewed as a successful tactic by them.” According to local media reports, Trudeau also expressed concern over the protection of human rights in Hong Kong as well that of the Uighur minority in China. Two Canadians, including a former diplomat, remain in prison in China—a retaliatory measure after a senior executive of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei was detained in Vancouver in late 2018 and faces trial and possible extradition to the US in a case related to bank fraud.Trudeau’s words were echoed by Canadian foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne. In a statement issued by Global Affairs Canada, he said, “It is unacceptable that any citizen be arbitrarily detained. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor must be brought home. This is something for which all Canadians stand united. The use of coercive diplomacy causes Canada to re-examine its approach, with a focus on multilateral cooperation.”As Canada is framing a new Indo-Pacific policy in light of its deteriorating relations with China, Champagne also said that as a “Pacific nation”, its future ties it to “peace, stability and prosperity in the region.” He also said that “Canada will work with partners to hold the Chinese government accountable to its international obligations” and that the “common future of Canada and China depends on the rule of law, respect for rights and freedoms and for people in all their diversity.”These statements come amid a chorus of criticism directed at China from the Canadian leadership. At a recent European think tank event, defence minister Harjit Sajjan had remarked on how NATO needs to monitor Chinese activity, particularly in the South China Sea and called it out for practising “hostage diplomacy.” Earlier this month, Canada’s ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae said the two Canadians detained by China were “living in terrible conditions”, adding, “This is something which we shall never forget.”Only recently was Canada’s ambassador in China allowed a virtual consular access to the two men, the first time such permission was granted by Beijing since January this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-accuses-china-of-coercive-diplomacy-on-50th-year-of-ties/story-bWDtZUANCrTI3XqYqe1TPL.html
14-10-2020||World||Indian Americans solidly with Biden, new poll shows||A new opinion poll has projected that 72% of Indian American respondents will vote for Democrat Joe Biden in the ongoing 2020 presidential election and found that Republican President Donald Trump’s support in the community, at 22%, had not grown as significantly as suggested by a separate poll earlier.The 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS) was conducted among 936 Indian American citizens between September 1 and September 20, by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins University and Princeton in partnership with YouGov, a research and analysis firm.It showed Indian-Americans ranked ties between India and the United States as the 11th of 12 factors influencing their voting decision, ahead only of sexism. This would call into question a narrative forwarded by Trump supporters and other Republicans that Indian Americans were gravitating towards the president because of his silence on the change in the status of Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act, which has been criticised by Biden.The poll found that 48% of Indian Americans approved of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s job performance, while 32% disapproved and 20% had no opinion. Republicans in the community had a more favourable view of the prime minister and most Indians said Democrats do a better job of managing US-Indian relations than Republicans, 39% to 18% (22% said they found no difference).Another significant finding is that the selection of Indian-descent senator Kamala Harris as Biden’s running mate will not change voting preferences, but her selection had mobilised Indian Americans to vote. “The big takeaway from these numbers is that there is scant evidence in the survey for the widespread defection of Democratic voters toward Trump,” said the report released on Wednesday. “There is little evidence of a significant evolution in partisan allegiances since 2016. The vast majority (91%) of Indian Americans who voted for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016 plan to support Biden in 2020.”The survey found that 72% of registered Indian American voters planned to vote for Biden, compared to 22% for Trump. Biden’s support was seen to have slipped in an earlier poll — the 2020 Asian American Voter Survey (AAVS) — to 65% from 77% who had said they had voted for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, in 2016.Trump’s support in the AAVS, at the same time, had grown from 16% Indian Americans who said they had voted for him in 2016 to 28% who said they will vote for him in 2020, triggering talk of a significant shift in the community towards the president, setting off alarm bells in the Biden campaign and the Democratic party, which had long enjoyed the solid support of India-descent Americans.Milan Vaishnav, one of the authors of the IAAS report who had also moderated the launch of the AAVS findings in September, said changes in Biden and Trump’s support could be the result of the difference in the timing of the two polls — the earlier poll was conducted between July and September the new one in September. “It’s possible that people’s views changed as the campaign progressed. A lot happened this summer,” he added. But he also went on to point to the difference in the sample size of the two polls — the earlier poll was conducted among 260 registered Indian American voters, compared to the nearly 1,000 in the new poll, which had an impact on the margin of error: +/- 6% to IAAS’s 3.2%.The IAAS found Indian Americans “solidly” with the Democratic party, as had the AAVS, reflecting an unchanging landscape. Their findings tracked closely — 56% of the respondents in the new poll self-identified themselves as Democrats, 15% as Republicans and 22% as Independents; corresponding numbers for the earlier poll were 54%, 16% and 24%.Indian Americans, a tiny but prosperous community of 4.16 million people (2.62 million US citizens) are getting unprecedented attention in US elections this time. Their 1.9 million (1.8 million, according to AAVS) registered voters could play a key role in deciding the outcome in battleground states that tend to be won or lost by wafer-thin margins.Both campaigns have wooed the community. Biden rolled out an expansive agenda that promises fixes for immigration problems such as Green Card waiting lines and social issues such as hate crimes; and better India-US ties under a Biden presidency.The Trump campaign and Republicans have sought to build on the president’s relationship with the prime minister and the two public events they addressed jointly in Houston and Ahmedabad to reach into the Indian American community for support, and the president’s silence on Kashmir and the CAA.Neeraj Antani, a Republican member of the Ohio state legislature, had said, referring to the AAVS report, that Trump’s support among Indian Americans was growing because of president’s outreach to the community, his visit to India in February and for “standing with the Prime Minister and neutrality on issues like CA (Citizenship Act) and the abrogation of (Article) 370, as opposed to Vice President Biden’s opposition to those issues.”IAAS found that Indian Americans did not rank India-US relations as a factor important enough to have a bearing on their voting decision; they placed it behind economy, healthcare, racism, taxes, corruption, immigration, environment, income inequality, terrorism and education, and just ahead of sexism. India-US relations was cited among the top three issues by only 4% of the respondents. The earlier poll had found a similar lack of enthusiasm for bilateral relations as an electoral factor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-solidly-with-biden-new-poll-shows/story-lFE3pnBgW4eQXEe2aSWTYN.html
14-10-2020||World||Xi ask young HongKongers to move to China in a bid to dismantle pro-democracy demands||President Xi Jinping called for new measures to encourage young people from Hong Kong to move to China, part of measures to integrate the semi-autonomous territory with the mainland following student-led protests last year.The push is aimed at “deepening integration” between young people in Hong Kong, Macau and Guangdong province to “increase their sense of belonging to the motherland,” the Chinese president said in a Wednesday speech in Shenzhen marking the 40th anniversary of the technology hub becoming a special economic zone.China should “fully utilize the important platform of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau cooperation to attract more young people from Hong Kong and Macau to study, work and live in the mainland,” he said.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam was in the audience for the speech in neighboring Shenzhen, whose skyline is visible in parts of the Asian financial center. She canceled her annual policy address scheduled for Wednesday to attend the event, and now plans to give it late next month or earlier after consulting with officials in Beijing.Business groups have expressed concern about Hong Kong’s autonomy from the mainland in the wake of sweeping new national security legislation imposed by Xi in June. The law, meant to subdue protests that turned violent last year, came as the city looks to revive an economy battered by unrest and the pandemic.Shenzhen is a cornerstone of Xi’s Greater Bay Area, which aims to knit together mainland cities with Hong Kong and Macau to establish a regional powerhouse rivaling Silicon Valley. Xi’s address encouraged further overall cooperation with China.“We should also continue to encourage and guide our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese to play their important roles in investment, entrepreneurship and two-way openness so that they can make new contributions to the development of the special economic zones,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-wants-young-hongkongers-to-move-to-china-deeping-integration-xi-s-trick-to-lure-pro-democratic-hong-kong-youth-towards-china/story-bDZduH2M4B8gmQfzS2YsNL.html
14-10-2020||World||Trump says he feels like ‘Superman’ after coronavirus treatment||US President Donald Trump has said that he felt like a “Superman” after his experimental Covid-19 treatment and boasted about his new immunity to the disease which has claimed the lives of 216,000 Americans.Trump, who tested positive for Covid-19 on October 1 and was admitted to a military hospital. for three nights and four days, declared himself cured after he was treated with an experimental antibody drug cocktail. White House doctors have now cleared him for holding election rallies. Holding his second rally since contracting coronavirus, Trump told a crowd of his supporters packed onto an airport tarmac in Johnstown, Pennsylvania that he felt like “Superman” after the treatment. Trump was briefly forced to pause his re-election campaign after he tested positive for Covid-19 and he returned to the campaign trail from the battleground State of Florida on Monday. Addressing his supporters in Pennsylvania, another battleground State, Trump, 74, thanked the doctors that treated him. “All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don’t know what it was, antibodies, antibodies. I don’t know. I took it, I said I felt like superman,” Trump said. “Then I said, let me at ‘em. Nah, and I could’ve been here four or five days ago. It’s great, we have great doctors. I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, and--great doctors,” he said. Trump said, that “one great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100 per cent you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with like 14 of them. Where are you from? I’m from this one. Where are you from? I’m from Johns Hopkins, I’m from Walter Reed. But what great, talented people. They did a great job.” Boasting about his new immunity to the disease, Trump said he can kiss everyone in the audience. “And now I’m immune they tell me. I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy--man and woman. Man and woman. Look at that guy how handsome he is. I’ll kiss him. Not with a lot of enjoyment but that’s okay,” the president joked. Trump also did an informal poll of the crowd and asked his supporters who has had the virus. “A lot of people, a lot of people,” Trump said, and added those people are now “immune.” Trump said he could have stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. “I could have done that. But I’m the president of the US. I can’t do that. I gotta get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it’s risky to do that. But you have to do what you have to do. I’m the president. I can’t sit in the basement and say let’s wait this thing out. I’m not gonna do that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-feels-like-superman-after-coronavirus-treatment/story-D5KpIXOw1xlM4LP1MeH8yI.html
14-10-2020||World||China accuses Taiwan of ‘infiltrating and damaging’ nation||China has opened a new front in its pressure campaign against Taiwan with a series of spying allegations and confessions aired on state television, denounced on the democratic island as entrapment and another reason for people to fear visiting China.China views Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has stepped up a campaign to assert its claim, including sending fighter jets near the island.Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island will not provoke but will defend itself.Starting on Sunday evening, .Chinese state television has been showing what it says are detained Taiwanese spies who have been operating in China, and confessing to their crimesChina, under its Thunder-2020 campaign, has cracked hundreds of cases orchestrated by Taiwan’s intelligence forces to “infiltrate and damage” and set up a network of spies, state television said.The Global Times, a widely read Chinese tabloid run by the Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, said on Wednesday the revelations were a warning to “Taiwan separatist forces”.Taiwan says China is framing and entrapping people, and that putting people on television to confess crimes before going to trial is a serious breach of proper legal process, something rights groups have long criticised Beijing for doing.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said China was spreading slander and “creating terror”.Asked about Taiwan’s spying in China - both sides have long accused each other of running espionage networks - Su said Taiwan did not do that anymore and did not need to.“China is an authoritarian country, and always does this kind of infiltration and damage, so it thinks others do it too. They don’t know that Taiwan has been democratic and open for ages.”Taiwan has taken particular umbrage at what it says are obvious inaccuracies in some of China’s accusations, including that one of the accused spies previously worked for a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Cho Jung-tai. Cho says he did not know the man.It has not been possible to reach any of the suspected spies for comment, and unclear if they have been permitted legal representation.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.Wang Ting-yu, a senior DPP lawmaker who sits on parliament’s foreign affairs and defence committee, said the cases should serve as a warning to Taiwanese wishing to visit China.“Think of the risks ... any Taiwanese person, no matter their political positions of beliefs or party background, is simply a tool.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-taiwan-of-infiltrating-and-damaging-nation/story-hupBncKVFqbRDba8zfinSM.html
14-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court says Trump administration can end census field operations early||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration can end census field operations early, in a blow to efforts to make sure minorities and hard-to-enumerate communities are properly counted in the crucial once-a-decade tally.The decision was not a total loss for plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s decision to end the count early. They managed to get nearly two extra weeks of counting people as the case made its way through the courts.However, the ruling increased the chances of the Trump administration retaining control of the process that decides how many congressional seats each state gets — and by extension how much voting power each state has.The Supreme Court justices’ ruling came as the nation’s largest association of statisticians, and even the U.S. Census Bureau’s own census takers and partners, have been raising questions about the quality of the data being gathered — numbers that are used to determine how much federal funding and how many congressional seats are allotted to states.After the Supreme Court’s decision, the Census Bureau said field operations would end on Thursday.At issue was a request by the Trump administration that the Supreme Court suspend a lower court’s order extending the 2020 census through the end of October following delays caused by the pandemic. The Trump administration argued that the head count needed to end immediately to give the bureau time to meet a year-end deadline. Congress requires the bureau to turn in by Dec. 31 the figures used to decide the states’ congressional seats — a process known as apportionment.By sticking to the deadline, the Trump administration would end up controlling the numbers used for the apportionment, no matter who wins next month’s presidential election.In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court’s decision “regrettable and disappointing,” and said the administration’s actions “threaten to politically and financially exclude many in America’s most vulnerable communities from our democracy.”Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the high court’s decision, saying “respondents will suffer substantial injury if the Bureau is permitted to sacrifice accuracy for expediency.”The Supreme Court ruling came in response to a lawsuit by a coalition of local governments and civil rights groups, arguing that minorities and others in hard-to-count communities would be missed if the census ended early. They said the schedule was cut short to accommodate a July order from President Donald Trump that would exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the numbers used for apportionment.Opponents of the order said it followed the strategy of the late Republican redistricting guru, Thomas Hofeller, who had advocated using voting-age citizens instead of the total population when it came to drawing legislative seats since that would favor Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.Last month, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California sided with the plaintiffs and issued an injunction suspending a Sept. 30 deadline for finishing the 2020 census and a Dec. 31 deadline for submitting the apportionment numbers. That caused the deadlines to revert back to a previous Census Bureau plan that had field operations ending Oct. 31 and the reporting of apportionment figures at the end of April 2021.When the Census Bureau, and the Commerce Department, which oversees the statistical agency, picked an Oct. 5 end date, Koh struck that down too, accusing officials of “lurching from one hasty, unexplained plan to the next ... and undermining the credibility of the Census Bureau and the 2020 Census.”An appellate court panel upheld Koh’s order allowing the census to continue through October but struck down the part that suspended the Dec. 31 deadline for turning in apportionment numbers. The panel of three appellate judges said that just because the year-end deadline is impossible to meet doesn’t mean the court should require the Census Bureau to miss it.The plaintiffs said the ruling against them was not a total loss, as millions more people were counted during the extra two weeks.“Every day has mattered, and the Supreme Court’s order staying the preliminary injunction does not erase the tremendous progress that has been made as a result of the district court’s rulings,” said Melissa Sherry, one of the attorneys for the coalition.Besides deciding how many congressional seats each state gets, the census helps determine how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed each year.San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said that his city lost $200 million in federal funding over the decade following the 2010 census, and he feared it would lose more this time around. The California city was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.“A census count delayed is justice denied,” Liccardo said.With plans for the count hampered by the pandemic, the Census Bureau in April had proposed extending the deadline for finishing the count from the end of July to the end of October, and pushing the apportionment deadline from Dec. 31 to next April. The proposal to extend the apportionment deadline passed the Democratic-controlled House, but the Republican-controlled Senate didn’t take up the request. Then, in late July and early August, bureau officials shortened the count schedule by a month so that it would finish at the end of September.The Senate Republicans’ inaction coincided with Trump’s order directing the Census Bureau to have the apportionment count exclude people who are in the country illegally. The order was later ruled unlawful by a panel of three district judges in New York, but the Trump administration appealed that case to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court decision comes as a report by the the American Statistical Association has found that a shortened schedule, dropped quality control procedures, pending lawsuits and the outside politicization of some parts of the 2020 census have raised questions about the quality of the nation’s head count that need to be answered if the final numbers are going to be trusted.The Census Bureau says it has counted 99.9% of households nationwide, though some regions of the country such as parts of Mississippi and hurricane-battered Louisiana fall well below that.As the Census Bureau winds down field operations over the next several days, there will be a push to get communities in those two states counted, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the litigants in the lawsuit.“That said, the Supreme Court’s order will result in irreversible damage to the 2020 Census,” Clarke said.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at https://twitter.com/MikeSchneiderAP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-says-trump-administration-can-end-census-field-operations-early/story-rRTEFZmb0XrEsjIeYvULVM.html
14-10-2020||World||US Supreme Court nominee Barrett says she is ‘not on a mission’ to destroy Obamacare||President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, said on Tuesday she gave no commitments to the White House on how she would rule on Obamacare or election-related cases and declined to say if she believed landmark rulings legalizing abortion and gay marriage were properly decided.During 11 hours of questioning on the second day of her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Barrett opted not to say whether she would step aside from taking part in a major Obamacare case to be argued on Nov. 10 or in any disputes arising from the Nov. 3 election - as Democrats have requested. The marathon session gave the conservative US appellate judge a chance to respond to Democrats who oppose her because they fear she will cast a decisive vote in striking down the 2010 healthcare law formally called the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett cites ‘Ginsburg rule’ that Ginsburg didn’t follow“I am not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act,” Barrett said. “I’m just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law.”While Democrats were persistent in their questioning, the hearing retained a respectful tone and Barrett remained even-tempered while nimbly sidestepping questions on her views on abortion, LGBT rights, gun control and voting rights. In the Obamacare case, Trump and Republican-led states are seeking to invalidate the law. Barrett said the case centered on a different legal issue from two previous Supreme Court rulings that upheld Obamacare that she has criticized. Senator Kamala Harris, who is Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s running mate, was not satisfied with Barrett’s answers, saying Americans were fearful that Obamacare would be overturned in the middle of a deadly pandemic.“Republicans are scrambling to confirm this nominee as fast as possible because they need one more Trump judge on the bench before Nov. 10 to win and strike down the entire Affordable Care Act,” said Harris, a Judiciary Committee member. Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett bats away tough Democratic confirmation probingThe law, signed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, has enabled millions of Americans to obtain medical coverage.Trump has asked the Senate, controlled by his fellow Republicans, to confirm Barrett before Election Day. Trump has said he expects the Supreme Court to decide the election’s outcome as he faces Biden. Barrett said no one at the White House sought a commitment from her on how she would rule on that or any other issue. In declining to commit to stepping aside on politically charged cases in light of her nomination so near an election and comments made by Trump on the issues, Barrett said she would follow rules giving justices the final say on recusal amid questions about impartiality.Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority, making Barrett’s confirmation a virtual certainty. If confirmed, Barrett, 48, would give conservatives a 6-3 Supreme Court majority. She is Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee.The hearing resumes at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Wednesday.ABORTION RULINGAbortion rights advocates fear Barrett would vote to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Asked about the ruling, Barrett said she would consider the usual factors on whether to overturn a precedent.But Barrett indicated Roe v. Wade was not a “super-precedent” that could never potentially be overturned.“I’m answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates Roe does not fall in that category. Scholars across the spectrum say that doesn’t mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively it does mean it is not a case that everyone has accepted,” Barrett said.Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panel’s top Democrat, asked Barrett whether she agreed with her mentor, the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned. After Barrett sidestepped, Feinstein told her that “it’s distressing not to get a straight answer.”Barrett, a devout Catholic and a favorite of religious conservatives, said she could set aside her religious beliefs in making judicial decisions. She would not say whether she agreed with Scalia that the 2015 Supreme Court Obergefell v. Hodges ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide was wrongly decided. She said she would not discriminate on the basis of “sexual preference,” prompting Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono to chastise her for using an “offensive and outdated term.”Barrett also declined to comment specifically on whether presidents should commit to a peaceful transfer of power if they lose an election. Trump created a furor in September when he refused to make that commitment. “To the extent that this is a political controversy right now, as a judge I want to stay out of it and don’t want to express a view,” Barrett told Democratic Senator Cory Booker. Prompted by Booker again to comment, she said: “One of the beauties of America from the beginning of the republic is that we have had peaceful transfers of power.”Asked about George Floyd, a Black man killed by Minneapolis police in May in an incident that triggered widespread protests, Barrett called the issue “very, very personal for my family” because among her seven children, two - adopted from Haiti - are Black. Barrett said she and one of her daughters, Vivian, cried together after seeing the video.Trump nominated Barrett to a lifetime post on the court on Sept. 26 to succeed the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The four-day hearing is a key step before a full Senate vote due by the end of October on Barrett’s confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-nominee-barrett-says-she-is-not-on-a-mission-to-destroy-obamacare/story-hYoqZ6tQ7pawKRxPXEVESL.html
14-10-2020||World||Northern Ireland govt says set to impose tougher Covid-19 curbs, says first minister Arlene Foster||Northern Ireland’s devolved government is set to impose tougher Covid-19 restrictions, First Minister Arlene Foster said after a rapid spread of cases led to the cancellation of elective surgeries across Belfast on Tuesday.The British-run region has become one of Europe’s biggest Covid-19 hotbeds in recent weeks. Its health minister described the situation as getting more grave by the hour last Friday and said further constraints were likely. However, the mandatory power-sharing government led by rivals Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have disagreed in public on how strict any new measures should be and ministers were still meeting late on Tuesday to finalise the response.The measures will be announced in the regional parliament at 0930 GMT on Wednesday, a statement on the parliament’s website said.“Whatever we put in place will only be for a limited period of time so that we can find our way out of the restrictions that have to be put in place,” Foster of the DUP said in a video posted on her Facebook page.Foster said it was critical that “long term” school closures were avoided. Local media reported that a two-week closure of schools was being considered in what may amount to the toughest constraints anywhere in the United Kingdom. Restrictions in Northern Ireland are currently not as severe as many areas elsewhere in the UK or across the open border in Ireland.The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust announced earlier that it was cancelling elective surgeries in the capital for the rest of the week due to a rise in Covid-19 admissionsThe city’s main Covid-19 facility, the Mater Hospital, was caring for 10 ventilated patients on Tuesday, one less than capacity, the Trust said, adding that more will likely require critical care in the coming days.Northern Ireland’s health department reported 863 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and seven more deaths, bringing its cumulative seven-day rate of infections per 100,000 people to 334.1.

14-10-2020||World||US Election 2020: China will own United States if ‘sleepy guy’ Biden is elected, says Trump||During his rally at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, US President Donald Trump hit out at Joe Biden alleging that his Democratic Party opponent would, if elected lift tariffs imposed on China.(Follow all US Election 2020 updates here)“I took the toughest-ever action to confront China’s rampant threat on American jobs -- we charged them so much that we gave that money to our farmers because our farmers were targetted. We got it (back) from China; USD 28 Billion, we have a lot leftover,” Trump said at the rally at the John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport.“This election is a simple choice,” said the US President. “If Biden wins, China wins. All these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins, and America wins. Very simple,” he told his supporters at the crucial battleground state.Trump further said that earlier on Tuesday, he had signed an order for the crackdown of Chinese counter-fitters and merchants “who sell their fake products” across the US. The President went on the rampage against the former Vice President terming him as “the sleepy guy” who “surrenders” and that is the reason why China wants Biden to win as he “would send the jobs” to Beijing.“Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China-- he has already said that he is going to take the tariffs off China. The one constant in Biden’s platform is that he surrenders. That’s why China and the far left are desperate for a Biden to win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position.”Pennsylvania is his second campaign trip since he was hospitalised with COVID-19 earlier this month. At the airport, Trump emerged from the Air Force One without a face mask and shook hands with supporters as he made his way to the podium.He also reiterated what he said in Florida on Monday about being “immune” from the virus and also threw masks at the audience. Trump was also seen dancing to the Village People’s “YMCA.”Trump is set to hold rallies in Iowa, Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida this week.The US Presidential Elections are set to take place on November 3, this year.

WATCH | Trump or Biden: Amid India-China faceoff, who’s better for Delhi’s cause?Also Read: The increasing value of Quad | HT EditorialThey discussed bilateral cooperation on trade, including the development of common standards, a framework for investments, and building supply chains; apart from steps to help the Indian subcontinent respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, and plans to distribute a vaccine when it is ready.The people cited above said that Shringla also briefed his US counterpart on Bangladesh, and told him about the need for Washington to engage with the Muslim-majority country, which is rising economically under the current leadership. Former US secretaries of state John Kerry and Hilary Clinton had shown their intention to visit Dhaka, but did not make the trip. For long, India has encouraged the US to engage with Bangladesh as under the leadership of Hasina, saying the country has taken a sharp turn away from a more radical approach under Khaleda Zia. Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisExperts point out that the unstated backdrop to this is also that China has made huge inroads into Bangladesh, with the latter buying more than 80% of its military hardware from Beijing, including artillery guns and ammunition. While India had offered $500 million as credit to Dhaka to buy military hardware during the then defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s visit in 2018, the defence cooperation between the two neighbours is still work in progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-resets-ties-with-bangladesh-to-seek-india-s-view-on-neighbourhood/story-7hgRwD4IUvKHvzBt3rKyiJ.html
14-10-2020||World||Bangladesh president signs ordinance on capital punishment in rape cases||Bangladesh President Md Abdul Hamid on Tuesday signed an ordinance approving the death penalty for rapists, amid nationwide protests after a series of recent sexual assaults in the country.“The President assented the Cabinet decision and issued an ordinance on Women and Children Repression Prevention Act,” a presidential palace spokesman told PTI. On Monday, the Cabinet approved an increase in the maximum punishment in rape cases to death from life imprisonment.The Law Ministry in a statement said that from now on the “death penalty” instead of “lifetime rigorous imprisonment” would be the maximum punishment for rape. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said that the government has introduced capital punishment in rape cases in an effort to prevent the “brutality” of rapists.“A man when he is a rapist turns into an animal. They become so brutal; that is why women suffer so much these days. Hence we amended the law,” she said while speaking at an event here on Tuesday.“Besides the life-term imprisonment, we have elevated the maximum punishment for rape to death and approved it in the cabinet. As the parliament is not in session right now, we’re issuing an ordinance,” she said.Bangladesh was rocked over the weekend by an unprecedented level of protest after footage of a brutal gang assault on a woman went viral on social media. Demonstrators carried signs reading “Hang the rapists” and “No mercy to rapists”.The changes to the law were demanded by thousands of demonstrators across the Muslim-majority nation calling for more stringent punishments for the perpetrators of sexual assaults.Police arrested eight suspects after the video of the assault went viral more than a month after the attack occurred at the victim’s home in Noakhali.In a separate case, another woman was allegedly gang-raped last week in a hostel in the northern district of Sylhet, leading to the arrest of several members of the student wing of the ruling party. Protesters in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere have demanded stiffer punishments for rape, faster trials for rapists and an end to what they see as a culture of impunity.According to rights group Ain O Salish Kendra or ASK, at least 889 women have been raped in Bangladesh between January and August 2020. Rights activists believe the numbers are much higher because many of the victims do not complain to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-president-signs-ordinance-on-capital-punishment-in-rape-cases/story-5aTqXVyAGqMGJQuUfznTfO.html
14-10-2020||World||PPP leader says Pak generals never accepted Constitution, asks govt to improve relations with India||The “creeping coup” in Pakistan is a result of the powerful military trying to safeguard its economic interests which might not be protected in a federal and democratic system, the spokesperson of an opposition party has said while calling for changing the basis of the country’s relations with India. Addressing the fifth annual conference of South Asians Against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH), Pakistan People’s Party spokesman and former Senator Farhatullah Babar said Pakistan’s parliament was unable to hold the military accountable. “In their hearts, Pakistan’s generals do not accept the country’s Constitution. That is why they have built a national narrative that is against democratic values and puts the army above all institutions,” he said at the event from Pakistan through a video conference. Babar called for changing the basis of Pakistan’s relations with India, which he said had been predicated on the resolution of the Kashmir issue as Pakistan wants it. “If China and India can have trade relations despite their conflicts, why can’t Pakistan?” He asked, hinting that good relations with India would help advance democratic norms and civilian supremacy in Pakistan. He said the “creeping coup” in Pakistan was the result of the powerful military trying to safeguard its economic interests which might not be protected in a federal and democratic system. Speaking at the virtual event from Islamabad, the former Senator said that the protests against the army that started in Pashtun tribal regions have now reached Punjab, the heartland of the Pakistan Army. He said the young people are discovering that “the emperor has no clothes”, according to a statement issued by SAATH. Babar lamented that Pakistan’s parliament was unable to hold the military accountable and was deprived of the most elementary information about the military’s spending and other matters. “The hybrid regime is fighting a hybrid war against the people of Pakistan by curbs on media and freedom of expression,” he added. In his remarks, Babbar expressed hope that the exiled members of SAATH, a grouping of prodemocracy Pakistanis co-founded by former Pakistan ambassador the U, Husain Haqqani and US-based columnist, Dr. Mohammad Taqi, could speak out about matters that can no longer be raised in Pakistan’s repressed media. Mohsin Dawar, a member of the National Assembly from Waziristan and a leading figure in Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), said that the regime was trying to bring the Taliban back to power and to break the bond between the Pashtuns on both sides of the Durand Line. Dawar also expressed concern over Pakistan’s survivability, asserting that the people of Pakistan seem fed up with the army’s dominance and intrusion in all spheres of life. “If the political leaders fail, the people will definitely stand up against the dictatorship,” he observed. Former parliamentarian Bushra Gohar said that young Pakistanis, lawyers, and women have started challenging the status quo in Pakistan and the “repressive” regime cannot prevail forever. Gohar questioned “secret talks between Pakistan’s military leaders and US Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad over the future of Afghanistan, which have serious implications for Pakistan’s Pashtuns. She called for demilitarisation of the Pashtun region. Resolutions passed by participants also condemned enforced disappearances and erosion of freedom of expression. Most speakers also criticised Pakistan’s major political parties for compromising often with the military, instead of ensuring civilian supremacy under the Constitution. Haqqani and Taqi welcomed the recent formation of the Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance of opposition political parties, and expressed hope that “they would resist the Pakistani establishment’s totalitarian project and not just bargain for a share in power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/creeping-coup-ppp-leader-says-pak-generals-never-accepted-constitution-asks-govt-to-improve-relations-with-india/story-bB4L5dca2kZPs4fZOPh9YL.html
14-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett bats away tough Democratic confirmation probing||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett batted away Democrats’ skeptical questions Tuesday on abortion, health care and a possible disputed-election fight over transferring presidential power, insisting in a long and lively confirmation hearing she would bring no personal agenda to the court but decide cases “as they come.”The 48-year-old appellate court judge declared her conservative views with often colloquial language, but refused many specifics. She declined to say whether she would recuse herself from any election-related cases involving President Donald Trump, who nominated her to fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and is pressing to have her confirmed before the the Nov. 3 election.Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett cites ‘Ginsburg rule’ that Ginsburg didn’t follow“Judges can’t just wake up one day and say I have an agenda — I like guns, I hate guns, I like abortion, I hate abortion — and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee during its second day of hearings.“It’s not the law of Amy,” she said. “It’s the law of the American people.”Barrett returned to a Capitol Hill mostly locked down with COVID-19 protocols, the mood quickly shifting to a more confrontational tone from opening day. She was grilled by Democrats strongly opposed to Trump’s nominee yet unable to stop her. Excited by the prospect of a judge aligned with the late Antonin Scalia, Trump’s Republican allies are rushing ahead to install a 6-3 conservative court majority for years to come.The president seemed pleased with her performance. “I think Amy’s doing incredibly well,” he said at the White House departing for a campaign rally.Trump has said he wants a justice seated for any disputes arising from his heated election with Democrat Joe Biden, but Barret testified she has not spoken to Trump or his team about election cases. Pressed by panel Democrats, she skipped past questions about ensuring the date of the election or preventing voter intimidation, both set in federal law, and the peaceful transfer of presidential power. She declined to commit to recusing herself from any post-election cases without first consulting the other justices.“I can’t offer an opinion on recusal without short-circuiting that entire process,” she said.A frustrated Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the panel, all but implored the nominee to be more specific about how she would handle landmark abortion cases, including Roe v. Wade and the follow-up Pennsylvania case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which confirmed it in large part.Also Read: Courts ‘should not try’ to make policy: Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to senators“It’s distressing not to get a good answer,” Feinstein told the judge.Barrett was unmoved. “I don’t have an agenda to try to overrule Casey,” she said. “I have an agenda to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come.”She later declined to characterize the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion as a “super-precedent” that must not be overturned.Democrats had no such reticence.Let’s not make any mistake about it,” said California Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, appearing remotely due to COVID concerns as the hearing pushed into the evening.Allowing Trump to fill the seat with Barrett “poses a threat to safe and legal abortion in our country,” Harris said.The committee chairman, Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, opened the day-long session under coronavirus protocols that kept it off limits to in-person attendance by members of the public.Republicans have been focused on defending Barrett and her Catholic faith against possible criticism concerning issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage, and Graham asked if she would be able to shelve her personal beliefs to adhere to law.“I have done that,” she said. “I will do that still.”He said, “I will do everything I can to make sure that you have a seat at the table. And that table is the Supreme Court.”The Senate, led by Trump’s Republican allies, is pushing Barrett’s nomination to a quick vote before Nov. 3, and ahead of the latest challenge to the “Obamacare” Affordable Care Act, which the Supreme Court is to hear a week after the election. Democrats warn that she would be a vote to undo the law and strip health coverage from millions of Americans.“I’m not hostile to the ACA,” Barrett told the senators. She distanced herself from her past writings perceived as critical of the Obama-era health care law, saying those pieces were not addressing specific aspects of the law as she would if confirmed to the court. “I’m not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act.”She appeared stumped when Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., tried to put her on the spot about several details of the health care law’s effects. She could not recite specifics, including that 23 million people are covered by the law or that more than 2 million young people are on their parents’ health insurance.The Indiana judge, accompanied by her family, described herself as taking a conservative, originalist approach to the Constitution. A former law professor, she told the senators that while she admires Scalia, her conservative mentor for whom she once clerked, she would bring her own approach.“You would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett,” she declared.Senators probed her views on gun ownership, gay marriage and racial equity, at one point drawing an emotional response from the mother of seven, whose children include two adopted from Haiti, as she described watching the video of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.“Racism persists,” she said, adding that Floyd’s death had a “very personal” effect on her family and that she and her children wept over it. But she told Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that “making broader diagnoses about the problem of racism is kind of beyond what I’m capable of doing as a judge.”Republicans were thrilled when she held up a blank notebook, apparently showing she had been fielding questions without aid.Also Read: Amy Coney Barrett vows to interpret laws ‘as they are written’Overall, Barrett’s conservative views are at odds with the late Ginsburg, the liberal icon.While Ginsburg testified at her 1993 confirmation hearing that the decision to have a child is one a woman “must make for herself,” Barrett says as a judge she must reserve opinions, despite having made her anti-abortion views known before joining the bench.“You would be the polar opposite of Justice Ginsburg,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.Barring a dramatic development, Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm Barrett to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court, and they spent their time portraying her as a thoughtful judge with impeccable credentials. She would be Trump’s third justice.Underscoring the Republicans’ confidence, Graham set an initial committee vote on the nomination for Thursday, the last day of hearings, which would allow final approval by the full Senate by the end of the month.Protesters rallied outside the Senate building, unable to come inside the hearing room.Other issues aside, Democrats are outraged that Republicans are moving so quickly, having refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nominee after Scalia’s death in February 2016, well before that year’s election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-bats-away-tough-democratic-confirmation-probing/story-F6cCkniZuhkuUodmKdn1IJ.html
14-10-2020||World||US elections 2020: Republicans weaponize Russia probe to hurt Biden-Harris’ chances||In 2016, Donald Trump’s campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate suspected of ties to Russian intelligence. Another Trump associate sought inside information about Democratic emails stolen by Kremlin operatives. The candidate himself invited Russia to hunt for his opponent’s emails, then tried to stifle investigators once he entered the White House.These were among the findings of the special counsel investigation of ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign. It produced a trove of damaging, or at least embarrassing, information about Trump. Yet in the 2020 campaign, Democrats are largely ignoring the Russia probe. It’s Republicans who are making it a top campaign issue.Trump and his supporters have cast the investigation as a witch hunt. It’s a refrain in Trump tweets and speeches and on conservative media. In the run-up to the election, Trump-appointed officials are ordering the declassification of documents that Trump hopes will boost his campaign.While some of the revelations from the steady drip of newly declassified documents are serious, they do not undercut the reasons the Russia probe was launched or its principal findings. An inspector general and a bipartisan Senate panel have both concluded that the probe was valid.A look at the Russia probe:Why was the investigation launched?The FBI opened “Crossfire Hurricane” on July 31, 2016, after learning a Trump campaign aide may have had advance knowledge that Russian intelligence operatives had stolen Democratic emails.A diplomat revealed that the aide, George Papadopoulos, had boasted to him that he had heard Russia had damaging information on Democrat Hillary Clinton that it could release to harm her campaign.That May 2016 conversation triggered alarms within the FBI since the Russian hacking operation, which resulted in the public disclosure of thousands of hacked emails, was not yet public knowledge.What did the investigation find?The investigation was taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller, whose team documented substantial contacts between Trump associates and Russia.That included a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer that Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took with the expectation of receiving dirt on Clinton, and a campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who shared internal polling data with a contact whom a Senate Intelligence committee report characterized as a Russian intelligence officer.A separate Justice Department inspector general report found the investigation was opened for a valid reason and did not find evidence of partisan bias. The Senate committee’s report found Manafort’s Russian contacts posed a “grave” counterintelligence risk.Was Trump vindicated?He was not criminally charged, but he wasn’t vindicated.It is true Mueller said his investigation did not find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump, or his associates, and Russia to sway the election. But the investigation also described broad Russian interference as well as a campaign that was eager to receive the help and expected to benefit from it.Mueller also investigated multiple episodes in which he found Trump tried to exert control over the investigation, including by firing his FBI director, but Mueller did not push forward with obstruction of justice charges, citing Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president.What are the criticisms of the investigation?Most focus on one strand: the FBI’s suspicion that former campaign adviser Carter Page was a Russian agent. Page has denied that and was not charged with any wrongdoing.The inspector general identified major errors and omissions in applications the FBI submitted to a secretive court for permission to eavesdrop on Page. For instance, the FBI failed to update the court as it received new information that undercut its original premise about Page. It also highlighted how the warrant applications relied in part on Democratic-funded research conducted by former British spy Christopher Steele.The problems are significant because they suggest the FBI misused intrusive surveillance powers or withheld information from the court. The FBI was alerted that Russian disinformation could have made its way into the dossier of research, and a key source for Steele was himself once investigated by the FBI for possible connections to Russian intelligence, newly declassified documents show.Multiple former FBI and Justice Department officials have said they would not have certified the applications had they know then what they know now. FBI Director Chris Wray has issued more than 40 corrective steps to prevent the problems from recurring.But the Page aspect of the probe accounted for only a fraction of it, and the dossier — though the target of much derision — had nothing to do with the decision to open the investigation. The Page problems don’t relate to the criminal convictions that Mueller’s team produced against six Trump associates, or the 25 Russians indicted on charges related to election interference.How are Republicans weaponizing it?In an extraordinary mix of politics in America’s national security apparatus, Trump has demanded that intelligence and Justice Department officials act to discredit the Russia investigation before the Nov. 3 election. To a large extent, they’ve complied.Much of the declassified material involves Page and the dossier. But they’ve also released information that, while creating buzz in conservative media, offer scant evidence of wrongdoing.Officials declassified the names of Obama administration officials who had requested the “unmasking” of an American — in this case, former national security adviser Michael Flynn — who surveillance revealed had interacted with Russia’s ambassador, but who wasn’t identified by name in intelligence reports. While Trump cast the unmasking as sinister, it’s a routine action and proper procedures were followed.The Washington Post reported Tuesday that a probe commissioned by Barr and focused on the “unmasking” question had concluded without criminal charges or any findings of substantive wrongdoing.Separately, some Republican senators are seeking an inspector general investigation after records showed multiple members of Mueller’s team had forgotten their work phone passcodes or entered the wrong ones too often, causing data to be lost. One of the prosecutors, Andrew Weissmann, has said in media interviews that the issue is overblown since the information was backed up.More recently, the national intelligence director, John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, declassified what he said was Russian intelligence analysis even though he acknowledged the information might not be accurate.Meanwhile, Attorney General William Barr has appointed a prosecutor to investigate the origins of the Russia probe. That prosecutor, US Attorney John Durham of Connecticut, has secured a guilty plea from a former FBI lawyer for altering an email related to Page’s surveillance.Trump has demanded big-name indictments and called for the probe to be completed by Election Day. But it’s not clear when Durham will finish his work or what it will reveal.How is the Russia probe figuring in the presidential campaign?Even before it was released, the Mueller report was seen as potentially devastating to Trump, with its details about campaign ties to Russia and the president’s efforts to hinder the probe. Yet Democrats have hardly mentioned it. Leading in the polls, Democratic nominee Joe Biden has focused instead on Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the divisiveness of his presidency, issues that may be more likely to resonate with voters.Meanwhile, attacking the Russia probe is a core part of Trump’s campaign. Trump and his supporters have often mischaracterized the investigation, with Trump falsely claiming that President Barack Obama spied on his campaign. Vice President Mike Pence falsely suggested at a debate last week that the investigation had vindicated Trump.Those attacks on the Russia probe may not win over many undecided voters. But they could energize Trump’s base at a time when the campaign needs a strong turnout in crucial battleground states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-republicans-weaponize-russia-probe-to-hurt-biden-harris-chances/story-v1jUig7gvuLPEAdH152aUM.html
14-10-2020||World||Wildfire threat intensifying across California, say officials||Hot, dry conditions and intense winds across California are threatening to reinvigorate what has already been the worst fire season in state history, officials warned on Tuesday.Gusty winds in California’s north and extreme heat in its south are creating conditions that could fan wildfires that began earlier in the summer as well as spark new ones, leading state and federal authorities to urge residents to prepare.Also Read: Trump visits California, Biden talks climate change as wildfires take campaign focusThe National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for a wide swath of Southern California as temperatures topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). The agency asked residents to exercise caution with any fire sources.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said strong winds and low humidity could ramp up blazes in Northern California starting Wednesday.“While good progress has been made on a number of fires, this could hamper containment efforts,” Daniel Berlant, Cal Fire assistant deputy director, said on Twitter on Tuesday. “It means if a new fire breaks out, that that fire is going to be able to burn very rapidly.”Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which provides power to much of California, said Monday it was considering proactively shutting off power as soon as Wednesday to as many as 50,000 state residents to mitigate fire risk.Also Read: Search crews scour charred Oregon landscape, residents return to rubble as wildfires burnThis year, wildfires have burned over 4 million acres in California - twice the total of 2018 which had been the highest on record. Five of the six largest fires in state history were in 2020. Thirty-one people have died, and over 9,200 structures have been destroyed.Fall has tended to be California’s peak wildfire season, but state officials say the season is growing longer each year.Experts say droughts and climate change from fossil fuels have made poorly managed forests much more flammable, leading to extreme fire activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wildfire-threat-intensifying-across-california-say-officials/story-helXZ8qIQdhUyGCr8PvcOM.html
14-10-2020||World||US justice department sues author of ‘Melania and me’||The US Justice Department filed suit Tuesday against a former aide to Melania Trump over her tell-all book on the US first lady.The department said that Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who published the book “Melania and Me” last month, had committed not to disclose information about President Donald Trump’s wife that was gleaned from her position as a White House volunteer.While Wolkoff, who worked on an unpaid basis for Melania during 2017-2018, was not a federal employee, the suit says she nevertheless signed an federally enforceable “contract” called a gratuitous services agreement.In that agreement, she was “specifically prohibited from publishing, reproducing or otherwise divulging any such information to any unauthorized person or entity in whole or in part.”She also was forbidden from profiting on what she learned in the White House, without the approval of White House lawyers, the suit said.“Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship With the First Lady,” purported to lift the veil off the 50-year-old ex-model of Slovenian origin who became the third wife of the real estate billionaire turned president.It portrays a much more active and decisive Melania than generally understood, and depicted her as a bitter rival of Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, labelling her and her husband Jared Kushner as “snakes.”Wolkoff fell out with the Trumps over a scandal related to millions of dollars that went unaccounted for in the president’s inauguration in January 2017, which she helped organize.Earlier this year the attorney general of Washington sued Trump’s inaugural committee and the president’s Trump Organization business, alleging the Trump’s profited heavily on the events.Communications and records from Wolkoff are cited as evidence that contributed to the suit.The lawsuit says Wolkoff was not free from her obligations to submit the book to Melania Trump and White House lawyers after she stopped working there.While the Justice Department warned Wolkoff and her publisher Simon & Schuster in July of the possible violation of her agreement, it did not take action until after the book was published.The lawsuit seeks to seize all of Wolkoff’s profits from the book.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-sues-author-of-melania-and-me/story-1q06TArJzoJStBndUHD3wK.html
14-10-2020||World||Supreme Court halts 2020 census for now||The US Supreme Court on Tuesday has, for now, stopped the once-a-decade head count of every US resident from continuing through the end of October.President Donald Trump’s administration had asked the nation’s high court to suspend a district court’s order permitting the 2020 census to continue through the end of the month. The Trump administration argued that the head count needed to end immediately so the US Census Bureau had enough time to crunch the numbers before a congressionally mandated year-end deadline for turning in figures used for deciding how many congressional seats each state gets.A coalition of local governments and civil rights groups had sued the Trump administration, arguing that minorities and others in hard-to-count communities would be missed if the count ended early. They said the census schedule was cut short to accommodate a July order from Trump that would exclude people in the country illegally from the numbers used to decide how many congressional seats each state gets.The US Census Bureau says it has counted 99.9% of the households in the US during the 2020 census, but the nation’s largest statistical association, and even the bureau’s own census takers and partners, are raising questions about the quality of the data gathered for the nation’s once-a-decade head count.A shortened schedule, dropped quality control procedures, pending lawsuits and the outside politicization of some parts of the 2020 census have raised questions about the quality of the nation’s head count that need to be answered if the final numbers are going to be trusted, according to a report released Tuesday by the American Statistical Association.The report was written by a task force made up of three former Census Bureau directors, a former deputy director, a former chief scientist and a former chief demographer at the bureau, among others.“It’s not enough to complete an enumeration. It’s also important to count everyone in doing so,” said John Thompson, a former Census Bureau director who was on the task force.The Census Bureau has cited the high completion rate in its court battle against a coalition of local governments and civil rights groups that sued the statistical agency and the Commerce Department to stop the head count from ending Sept. 30.The coalition argued that ending the count early would cause minority communities to be overlooked, but the Trump administration said it needed to end the count to meet a Dec. 31 deadline for turning in numbers that decide how many congressional seat each state gets. US District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the census can continue through Oct. 31, but the Trump administration has appealed to the US Supreme Court.Among the concerns highlighted in the report by the statisticians are the reliance on people other than those living in the household, such as a neighbor or landlord, in answering questions about the household; college students who left campuses and college towns during the pandemic; and the elimination of quality control checks that would catch computer errors.The report recommends that outside experts should be given access to the data to help analyze its quality before numbers are turned in for divvying up congressional seats. It also says that federal law governing the census should be evaluated to determine whether changes are needed to protect the independence and integrity of the Census Bureau and the once-a-decade head count.Concerns about the quality of the data also have been raised by census takers and partners in the field.Sheila Valenzuela, census director for the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, said in court papers that she had been given misleading information from the Census Bureau’s Tucson office for weeks about how many households had been counted in her community. Last week, she was told that more than 101% of her community had been counted. Doubting that figure, she contacted the manager of the Tucson office, who revised the completion rate to 88%.The information she has been getting about her community’s response rates has been “unclear and conflicting,” she said.Census field supervisor Daniel Bachmann emailed Koh last weekend that his team of census takers in Ohio hadn’t been given work since the start of the month and he was directed to lay off census takers without giving a reason.“I also suspect that the 2020 count is going to be neither accurate nor complete,” Bachmann wrote.Besides deciding how many congressional seats each state gets, the census determines how $1.5 trillion in federal spending is distributed each year.Some indicators that will determine the quality of the census is the percentage of cases counted through proxies, or people other than those living in a household, as well as the rate of cases where administrative records are used to get information about households. The census questionnaire asks about a household members’ race, Hispanic origin, sex and the relationship of the people living in the home.The best quality answers come from people who have answered the questionnaire themselves either online, by mail or by phone since they are most knowledgeable about their household. Next-best is information coming from census takers who directly interview the occupants of the home during the door-knocking phase. Census takers turn to neighbors or landlords or administrative records for information only after they’ve failed to reach members of a household.During the door-knocking phase of the 2020 census, almost 24% of responses have been from interviews with neighbors or landlords or someone other than a person living in the household. That’s about the same rate as a decade ago during the last decennial census, Al Fontenot, an associate director at the Census Bureau, said in court papers.This is the first decennial census in which administrative records, such as IRS, Social Security and Medicare documents, are being used in large numbers to help fill in information gaps.Answers about households have come from administrative records in 13.9% of the homes during the door-knocking phase, Fontenot said.That’s only slightly higher than what the bureau projected before the start of the 2020 census. But Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who specialized in census issues, worries that the reliance on administrative records will miss hard-to-count populations that are lacking records, such as undocumented residents and people experiencing housing insecurity.“It signals a worrisome indicator of data quality and accuracy,” Lowenthal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-halts-2020-census-for-now/story-pOrBi4MfVfU5w1ytob49QI.html
14-10-2020||World||Amy Coney Barrett cites ‘Ginsburg rule’ that Ginsburg didn’t follow||Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett invoked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at her Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday in refusing to discuss her view of gay rights and the Constitution.“Justice Ginsburg with her characteristic pithiness used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing. No hints, no previews, no forecasts. That had been the practice of nominees before her. But everybody calls it the Ginsburg rule because she stated it so concisely,” Barrett said of the woman whose seat she would take if confirmed.It’s become a standard response by Republican high court nominees to recite Ginsburg’s words from her own confirmation hearing.Ginsburg, who died last month, did utter those words 27 years ago, saying “A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.”But she also said much more on a range of hotly debated issues, including abortion, that went well beyond the rule that bears her name.Here’s Ginsburg on abortion in 1993, shortly before the Senate voted 96-3 to confirm her: “The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.”Barrett, who has signed ads opposing abortion and belonged to Notre Dame University’s Faculty for Life, has refused to answer senators’ questions on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that declared a woman’s right to an abortion.Barrett’s nomination is on a fast track since her nomination by President Donald Trump just over two weeks ago. Trump and Senate Republicans have said they want her on the court before Election Day, Nov. 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amy-coney-barrett-cites-ginsburg-rule-that-ginsburg-didn-t-follow/story-vRZAu8NNaamfWfDyO8hFBJ.html
14-10-2020||World||Donald Trump lawyers ask Supreme Court to halt tax record turnover||President Donald Trump on Tuesday asked the Supreme Court to put on hold an appeals court ruling that Trump’s accountant must immediately turn over tax records to a New York state prosecutor, setting up a decision from the high court that could come before Election Day.The court could allow the immediate enforcement of a subpoena issued by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. or block it temporarily. Even if the court rules against Trump, however, the records would normally not be made public but turned over to Vance’s office.This is the second time the records issue has reached the high court. The court previously prevented the records from being turned over while the case proceeded.The justices in July rejected Trump’s argument that he is effectively immune from investigation while he holds office. Trump’s two Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, joined that decision.But the high court returned the Vance case and another, similar case involving records sought by Congress to lower courts to allow Trump’s attorneys to make additional arguments.In August, a district court judge rejected Trump’s attorneys’ renewed efforts to block Vance’s access to the records. And last week, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed, saying the records should be turned over. But the rulings have been on hold while the president’s attorneys appeal.Vance is seeking more than eight years of the Republican president’s personal and corporate tax records as part of an investigation his office is conducting. Part of that probe involves an investigation related to payoffs to two women — porn actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal — to keep them quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about alleged extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-lawyers-ask-supreme-court-to-halt-tax-record-turnover/story-RsgJOwWNOIXgknWzS00H3N.html
14-10-2020||World||Mark Zuckerberg donates $100 million more to help election offices||Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, on Tuesday donated an additional $100 million to helping local election offices prepare for November even as some conservatives are stepping up their efforts to stop the funds from being used.The contribution brings the total funding for the election from Zuckerberg and Chan to $400 million — the same amount that Congress allocated in March to help fund election offices as they dealt with the difficulties of adapting to new voting behavior during the coronavirus pandemic. Election experts had estimated it could cost $4 billion to make all the changes, but Senate Republicans never acted on a relief bill from the Democratic-controlled House that included $3.6 billion to help voting officials.Zuckerberg and Chan stepped into the gap initially in September, with a $300 million donation. That came after other donors had already been contributing to the nonprofit that is receiving most of the Facebook founder’s contributions, the Chicago-based Center for Technology and Civic Life.“We’ve seen massive interest in the Covid-19 Response Grant program over the last month from over 2,100 election officials who are seeking funding to ensure safe, health election options for voters in every corner of the country,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, executive director of the Center for Technology and Civic Life.The money will pay for protective equipment to prevent spread of the coronavirus at polling sites, drive-thru voting locations, equipment to process mail ballots and more.The CTCL is respected by election administrators in both parties. But it was founded by former staffers of a Democratic technology firm, and late last week Louisiana’s Republican Attorney General, Jeff Landry, moved to block 26 offices in his state from taking $7.8 million in funds. Landry is also working on rewriting state law to bar such arrangements in the future.A Republican legal group late last week also announced it has filed lawsuits in nine swing states, including Iowa and Pennsylvania, against the donations.Phill Kline of the Thomas More Society’s Amistad Project in a statement last week announcing the litigation called the donations “an insidious, coordinated, and stealth campaign to manipulate this year’s elections.”Zuckerberg, in a post on Facebook, acknowledged the controversy. “Since our initial donation, there have been multiple lawsuits filed in an attempt to block these funds from being used, based on claims that the organizations receiving donations have a partisan agenda,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That’s false. These funds will serve communities throughout the country -- urban, rural and suburban – and are being allocated by non-partisan organizations.”Zuckerberg added that most election offices that applied have fewer than 25,000 registered voters in their jurisdictions. Some conservatives have criticized CTCL for donating to election offices in large Democratic-leaning cities in swing states. In a widely circulated video from President Donald Trump’s campaign, a campaign worker being expelled from an election office in Philadelphia — the recipient of an $8 million CTCL election grant — asks if it’s not a public place “because it’s being funded by the nonprofit?”Zuckerberg added: “I agree with those who say that government should have provided these funds, not private citizens. I hope that for future elections the government provides adequate funding. But absent that funding, I think it’s critical that this urgent need is met.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-donates-100-million-more-to-help-election-offices/story-bDZLfUi6kpJPMUFnBpMsNI.html
14-10-2020||World||Indie bookstores launch anti-Amazon ‘Boxed Out’ campaign||With many independent bookstore owners facing the most dire financial crisis in their lifetimes, the American Booksellers Association has teamed with an award-winning advertising agency known for “culture hacking” to dramatize the threats of the pandemic and the growing dominance of Amazon.com.On Tuesday, the trade group launched the “Boxed Out” campaign, for which a handful of bookstores around the country will have windows boarded up and boxes piled up out front that resemble Amazon delivery containers, with one label reading “Don’t Accept Amazon’s Brave New World.” The beginning of what the booksellers association hopes will be a conversation in stores and online, “Boxed Out” was designed by DCX Growth Accelerator, a Brooklyn-based firm which attracted national attention in 2018 when it set up a fake “Palessi” luxury shoe store and stocked it with items from the Payless discount chain.“Boxed Out” coincides with Amazon Prime Day, when the online giant offers special deals to its members.“We’re hoping that people will understand the juxtaposition and support their local stores,” says booksellers association CEO Allison Hill.Independent booksellers had enjoyed a resurgence over the past decade after being devastated in the 20 previous years by the rise of the superstore chains Barnes & Noble and Borders, and then the emergence of Amazon. ABA membership, once more than 5,000, was down to just 1,401 in 2009 during the height of the Great Recession and was apparently set to keep declining as e-books began to catch on.But the digital revolution stalled, Borders went out of business and Barnes & Noble retreated after a long era of expansion. In 2019, the last time the ABA released yearly numbers, membership was up to 1,887, with some sellers even opening additional outlets. Hill’s predecessor, Oren Teicher, who retired at the end of 2019, received an honorary National Book Award earlier that year for his success in “working to strengthen and expand independent bookstores nationwide.”But the pandemic could wipe out all the gains since 2009. An ABA survey from this summer found that some 20 percent of members could go out of business, meaning hundreds of stores face closure, especially as government aid runs out. Meanwhile, the number of new independent stores opening has dropped sharply, according to the ABA, just 30 this year compared to 104 in 2019.While the overall market for books has been surprisingly solid in 2020, Amazon.com has apparently fared best as the public increasingly makes purchases online. According to a report issued last week by the antitrust subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, “Amazon accounts for over half of all print book sales and over 80% of e-book sales” in the US market.Greenlight Bookstore in Brooklyn is among the participating stores in “Boxed Out.” Co-owner Jessica Stockton-Bagnulo says that sales have fallen this year by double digits after a decade of “steady growth.” Her store has risen from its “deepest trough” earlier this year, and has rehired some laid off workers, but Stockton-Bagnulo says Greenlight’s position is still “precarious.”“If shoppers could shift more of their purchasing away from Amazon to local businesses like ours ... it could make all the difference in allowing us to survive and thrive for years to come. We hope Boxed Out will have that effect,” she said.Hill said she and the booksellers association had been looking for a way to draw attention to what indies were going through and met with several agencies before deciding on DCX. Not all of DCX projects have had long-term impact. Payless, for instance, continued to struggle after the Palessi campaign, filed for bankruptcy in 2019 and closed all of its U.S. stores.Hill said she was more impressed by a campaign from 2015 on behalf of Jesse’s bodega in Brooklyn, near the headquarters of DCX. Owner Jesse Itayim faced eviction after the landlord sought a 250 percent rent hike, so DCX devised an “Artisanal Landlord Price Hike Sale” that featured exorbitant costs for such rebranded items as “Grass Fed Himalayan Tuna Salad.”Jesse’s held on another year before shutting down.“I just liked how they did it with a sense of humor,” Hill says of DCX. “I think things are different now and that we’re at the beginning of a sea change. I think people realize how fragile we are because of the pandemic, and my hope of this campaign is that it’s the beginning of a conversation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indie-bookstores-launch-anti-amazon-boxed-out-campaign/story-JIyUNL9S0wQQJ6dAMqOUSJ.html
14-10-2020||World||Russia threatens to halt dialogue with EU amid Navalny spat||Russia’s foreign minister warned Tuesday that Moscow could freeze its contacts with the European Union in response to its sanctions over the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny — an unprecedented threat that reflects a bitter Russia-EU strain.The tough statement from Sergey Lavrov comes a day after the EU foreign ministers agreed to impose sanctions on Russian officials and organizations blamed for Navalny’s poisoning with a Soviet-era nerve agent.“We probably simply have to temporarily stop talking to those people in the West who are responsible for foreign policy and don’t understand the need for mutually respectful dialogue,” Lavrov said at a foreign policy conference attended by experts in Moscow.He specifically pointed at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s recent statements ruling out a partnership with Russia, saying that scenario will play out if that’s what the EU wants.“Russia wants to understand whether it’s possible to do any business with the EU in the current conditions,” Lavrov added.At Monday’s meeting in Luxembourg, France and Germany urged their EU partners to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement and ban them from traveling in Europe under sanctions to combat the use and spread of chemical weapons.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell provided no details about who might face sanctions or when the measures might come into force, but said that technical work on preparing the action will now proceed.Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator and the most visible opponent of President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on Aug. 20 during a domestic flight in Russia. He was flown to Germany for treatment two days later and is still recovering there.Last week, tests conducted at labs designated by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed that the poison used on Navalny was a Novichok nerve agent. Navalny asserted that his poisoning only could have been ordered by spymasters who wouldn’t have made such decisions without Putin’s involvementThe Kremlin has rejected Navalny’s accusations as “absolutely groundless and unacceptable.”The Kremlin also reiterated that before Navalny’s transfer to Charite Hospital in Berlin, Russian labs and a hospital in the Siberian city of Omsk found no sign of a poisoning. Moscow has called for Germany and the OPCW to provide its evidence, and bristled at Western leaders’ insistence that Russia answer questions about what happened to the politician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-threatens-to-halt-dialogue-with-eu-amid-navalny-spat/story-vrAbtuISnlFjEdNIL9R3SK.html
14-10-2020||World||China and Russia win seats on UN rights council, Saudis lose||China, Russia and Cuba won seats on the UN’s premiere human rights body Tuesday despite opposition from activist groups over their abysmal human rights records, but another target, Saudi Arabia, lost.Russia and Cuba were running unopposed, but China and Saudi Arabia were in a five-way race in the only contested race for seats on the Human Rights Council.In that race, Pakistan received 169 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Nepal 150, China 139 and Saudi Arabia just 90 votes.Despite announced reform plans by Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch and others strongly opposed its candidacy saying the Middle East nation continues to target human rights defenders, dissidents and women’s rights activists and has demonstrated little accountability for past abuses, including the killing of Washington Post columnist and Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two years ago.Under the Human Rights Council’s rules, seats are allocated to regions to ensure geographical representation.Except for the Asia-Pacific contest, the election of 15 members to the 47-member Human Rights Council was all but decided in advance because all the other regional groups had uncontested slates.Four countries won four Africa seats: Ivory Coast, Malawi, Gabon and Senegal. Russia and Ukraine won the two East European seats. In the Latin American and Caribbean group, Mexico, Cuba and Bolivia won the three open seats. And Britain and France won the two seats for the Western European and others group.“We need for states to have a choice,” said Louis Charbonneau, the U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “They don’t want competition. ... Essentially these are backroom deals that are worked out among the regional groups.”“When states don’t have a choice, the worst candidates easily find their way on to the council,” he said at a briefing last week. “This is an unfortunate political reality, but we keep hammering the message that we need competition and a real election, not a fake election.”Last week, a coalition of human rights groups from Europe, the United States and Canada called on U.N. member states to oppose the election of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Pakistan and Uzbekistan, saying their human rights records make them “unqualified.”“Electing these dictatorships as U.N. judges on human rights is like making a gang of arsonists into the fire brigade,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch.The Geneva-based rights organization published a 30-page joint report with the Human Rights Foundation and the Raoul Wallenberg Center for Human Rights evaluating candidates for council seats. The report lists Bolivia, Ivory Coast, Nepal, Malawi, Mexico, Senegal and Ukraine as having “questionable” credentials due to problematic human rights and U.N. voting records that need improvement. It gave “qualified” ratings only to the United Kingdom and France.Human Rights Watch pointed to an unprecedented call by 50 U.N. experts on June 26 for “decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China,” warning about its mass rights violations in Hong Kong and Tibet and against ethnic Uighurs in the Chinese province of Xinjiang as well as attacks on rights defenders, journalists, lawyers and government critics. Their call was echoed by over 400 civil society groups from more than 60 countries.The rights group said Russia’s military operations with the Syrian government “have deliberately or indiscriminately killed civilians and destroyed hospitals and other protected civilian infrastructure in violation of international humanitarian law,” and noted Russia’s veto of U.N. Security Council resolutions on Syria, including blocking Damascus’ referral to the International Criminal Court.The Geneva-based Human Rights Council can spotlight abuses and has special monitors watching certain countries and issues. It also periodically reviews human rights in every U.N. member country.Created in 2006 to replace a commission discredited because of some members’ poor rights records, the new council soon came to face similar criticism.The United States announced its withdrawal from the council in June 2018 partly because it considered the body a forum for hypocrisy about human rights, though also because Washington says the council is anti-Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-russia-win-seats-on-un-rights-council-saudis-lose/story-XH0BU0IHrCCiJXZ0q6ZVCN.html
14-10-2020||India||Accused in alleged acid attack on 3 UP sisters in Gonda arrested||A 19-year-old who is suspected to have thrown an acid-like caustic fluid on three Dalit sisters, aged 8, 12, and 17, in Gonda district early on Tuesday, was arrested after being shot in the right leg during an exchange of fire with the police on Tuesday midnight, the police said on Wednesday morning.The arrest of Ashish Chaurasiya alias Chottu led to a protest against the police action by local traders and residents of Paska town area. They blamed the police for framing Chaurasiya in the case and injuring him in a ‘fake encounter’ due to pressure from senior officers to solve the case.Chaurasiya’s mother Laxmi Chaurasiya demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the case.The suspect was arrested a few hours after chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked for tough action against those responsible for the act.Gonda additional superintendent of police (ASP) Mahendra Kumar rejected the allegations and claimed two of the three girls had told the police that they had seen Chaurasiya escaping from the house after throwing the acid-like liquid on them. He said the two girls even told the police that the suspect was wearing a green shirt at the time of the incident.The ASP said the suspect had confessed to committing the crime during interrogation and his call detail records showed that he made 281 calls to the elder sister in a week. He said the calls were made even at odd hours and the suspect had become desperate after coming to know that her marriage had been fixed.Kumar said the suspect had been ‘troubling’ the eldest sister for quite some time and forcing her to talk to him. The suspect lived near the girls’ house in Paska town, he alleged.Police exchanged fire with the suspect near Baikunth Nath College on the Colonelganj-Hujurpur road when he was returning to Gonda from his sister’s place in Bahraich. He said the suspect’s motorcycle skidded when he tried to flee after spotting the police team.The accused opened fire on the police team, following which the police fired back, the ASP claimed. He said the police team recovered a country-made firearm and cartridges from the suspect’s possession. The suspect suffered a bullet wound in the right leg, he said.During the day, hundreds of traders and locals gathered in protest at the Paska town market, which has around 50 shops. A Paska resident and local leader Azad Singh said the traders kept the market closed, demanding an unbiased investigation in the case.Earlier on Tuesday, the suspect had allegedly attacked the three sisters with an acid-like caustic fluid.The eldest sister suffered major injuries with 30% burns on her face, eyes and chest, while the other two sustained minor injuries with 5% and 7% burns on their arms, respectively.The sisters were attacked when they were sleeping in a room on the second floor of the house. The attacker is believed to have climbed up the two floors to throw the chemical at them from the open window.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-in-alleged-acid-attack-on-3-up-sisters-in-gonda-arrested/story-BaT3fAEocEAp9wBkEdJrPI.html

A decision which was not welcomed by many.Calls to boycott the company over the advertisement took over social media with some accusing the brand of promoting “Love Jihad”.The ad, which was put up with the tagline: “A beautiful confluence of two different religions, traditions and cultures”, was taken down minutes after it went live. The brand even withdrew the advertisement from television channels after outrage. In a statement on Tuesday, Tanishq said it withdrew the ad due to “hurt sentiments, and the well-being of our employees, partners and store staff”.Several people criticised the jewelry brand’s withdrawal of advertisement, saying that the company was succumbing to extremists. “Its capitulation points to the pervasive atmosphere of fear and intimidation that some have unleashed in the country,” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said.Now India’s top advertising bodies, The Advertising Club has come out in support of the brand and said that the advertisement does not break any “ethical standards, is not derogatory to any person, organisation or religion and done not hurt any national sentiment.”“Such baseless and irrelevant attack on creative expression is extremely concerning and we together stand by the team of Tanishq and against such aggression,” it said in a statement on Wednesday.“After review by our internal team consisting of multi-sectoral experts, we have come to a clear consensus that the advertisement breaks no ethical standards, is not derogatory to any person, organisaton or religion and done not hurt any national sentiment,” the statement read.“In continuance with its tradition, the Advertising Club upholds the primacy of creative freedom as a fundamental right of the Marketing and Advertising-fraternity and hence disapprove of the approach to stymie that freedom,” it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baseless-irrelevant-attack-on-creative-expression-india-s-top-ad-bodies-support-tanishq/story-rF8ehFA8BtPdquSeA6BGjM.html

14-10-2020||India||10,000 ineligible names to be deleted from final NRC list in Assam||Around 10,000 names will be deleted from the final NRC in Assam as many “ineligible persons” and their descendants were included in the list, according to a directive issued by its state coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma and officials in the know of the decision.Sarma wrote to all the Deputy Commissioners and District Registrar of Citizen Registration (DRCR) on Tuesday, directing them to issue speaking orders for the deletion of such names.“...as per the reports received from your end through Webform, some names of ineligible persons belonging to the categories of DF (declared foreigners)/DV (‘D’ voters)/PFT (pending in Foreigners Tribunals) along with their descendants have found entry to the NRC,” he said.Sarma directed the district officials to issue orders for deletion of such names from the NRC as per Clause 4(6) of the Schedule under the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 after “specifically ascertaining the identity of the person”.Explaining the rule and some other relevant clauses, Sarma pointed out that the authorities concerned can verify and include or exclude any name at any time before the publication of the final NRC.Though the final National Register of Citizens for Assam was made public in August last year, it is yet to be notified by the Registrar General of India, leaving the historic and controversial document without any official validity.“You are, therefore, requested to submit the list of such persons who are not eligible for having their names in the NRC along with speaking order justifying reasons for each cases for necessary action for deletion of such names,” Sarma said in the letter.A software application for submission of the reviewed results of such persons along with mechanism for uploading of the scanned freshly written speaking orders will be rolled out shortly, he added.“The verification would mandatorily require the correct identity of the person so that no ambiguity arises in future as far as identification of the person is concerned,” the letter to the districts said.Though the letter did not mention how many people will be excluded, persons in the know of the development said that around 10,000 people have been identified whose names were “wrongly included” in the final NRC and will now be excluded.“This is a mix of all communities. The figure looks a bit big because it includes the descendants of the persons from the three categories mentioned in the letter,” a source said.The final NRC was released on August 31 last year, excluding the names of 19,06,657 persons. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.After the publication of the final NRC, almost all stakeholders and political parties criticised it as a faulty document, alleging exclusion of indigenous people and the inclusion of illegal immigrants.On August 31 this year, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said in the Assembly that the Assam government had submitted an affidavit in the Supreme Court for re-verification of 20 per cent names in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10 per cent in the rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-000-ineligible-names-to-be-deleted-from-final-nrc-list-in-assam/story-Vi4mVs00TlgL3lsJ3bXW6N.html

14-10-2020||India||Tripura BJP MLAs meet JP Nadda, play down reports of revolt against CM Biplab Deb||A delegation of BJP MLAs from Tripura camping in New Delhi for some days, met the party’s national president JP Nadda on Tuesday amid reports of a brewing rebellion in the state against chief minister Biplab Deb.The delegation of four MLAs said they discussed the political and party organizational affairs of the state and played down reports of a campaign against the chief minister. “We have informed our top leader about the political and our party’s organizational affairs. We are not here to complain against anyone,” BJP legislator Ramprasad Paul who was present at the meeting told a local TV channel of Tripura. He said that though there are about 11 legislators had come to Delhi, only four of them went to meet Nadda due to Covid-19 situation. Paul could not be reached over phone for further details of the meeting.Earlier, a BJP legislator fuelled speculation of a revolt against chief minister Deb by saying that despite MLAs backing the party’s ideology, neither the government nor the party was moving in the right direction.“All the pre-poll promises, mentioned in the party’s Vision Document, were made to be fulfilled. These should be reflected in action, but we are far from reality. We want to highlight to the top leaders about all what is happening in the state,” said the legislator over the phone on Sunday.Although he did not specifically say that the group of legislators wants Deb to be removed from the chief minister’s post, he underlined that he should be friendlier with party legislators.“We will highlight the developments in Tripura. The rest will be decided by the top leaders if they want to intervene in this issue,” the legislator said.The BJP has 36 MLAs in the 60-memer Assembly in Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-bjp-mlas-meet-jp-nadda-play-down-reports-of-revolt-against-cm-biplab-deb/story-Z95OjVJPqsOGkgwaSpNUXK.html
14-10-2020||India||At event to commemorate Indian doctor, China envoy prods New Delhi for talks||India and China should manage and resolve their differences through dialogue and consultation and not allow them to become disputes, Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong has said against the backdrop of the stalemate in disengagement of troops along the Line of Actual Control. Without directly referring to the military standoff in the Ladakh sector of the LAC that has entered its sixth month, the envoy said it was “normal” for two major neighbours such as India and China to have differences. The common interests of the two sides “far outweigh the frictions and differences”, he added. Sun made the remarks during his speech at an online symposium organised on Tuesday by the Chinese embassy to mark the 110th birth anniversary of Dwarkanath Kotnis, an Indian doctor revered by the Chinese people for his services during the Sino-Japanese war of 1938. Kotnis died in China in 1942. The text of the envoy’s speech was released by the embassy on Wednesday. “Recently, the bilateral relations have encountered some difficulties and challenges. As two major neighbouring countries, it is normal to have differences. We need to put differences in an appropriate place in bilateral relations, properly manage and resolve them through dialogue and consultation and not allow differences to become disputes,” Sun said in his speech. “The common interests of the two countries far outweigh the frictions and differences. I believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, we have the wisdom and ability to overcome difficulties and bring bilateral relations back on track to forge ahead,” he added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese envoy’s comments. Despite the seventh round of talks between senior military commanders on Monday, India and China have been unable to push forward the disengagement and de-escalation process in Ladakh, where both sides have arrayed tens of thousands of troops that have dug in for the winter. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in a clash in June, which also resulted in unspecified Chinese casualties. Troops from both sides have also fired warning shots, the first time guns have been used along the LAC since 1975. The Chinese envoy said the two countries were now facing the common task of achieving economic and social development and “need to enhance mutual trust and strengthen cooperation more than ever to write a new chapter in China-India friendship”. All countries are also facing severe challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and as the only two major developing countries with a population of more than one billion each, China and India need to strengthen cooperation and “tide over current difficulties together”, Sun said. “In the past few months, we have witnessed the exchanges of diagnosis and treatment experience between Chinese and Indian medical institutions, the donation of medical supplies by companies and friendly organisations, and videos recorded by young people and film stars of the two countries to cheer each other on. The spirit of Dr Kotnis has been carried forward by concrete actions and been given a new connotation of the times,” he said. India has demanded the restoration of the status quo that existed along the LAC in April and accused Chinese troops of hampering Indian patrols and violating the LAC. The Chinese side has responded by saying that building of infrastructure along the LAC and troop deployments by India were the main causes for the tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-event-to-commemorate-indian-doctor-china-envoy-prods-new-delhi-for-talks/story-9ly3Y9Y3fvNtPFr3wqeC7N.html

14-10-2020||India||Bengal governor calls Balwinder Singh victim of human rights violation||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said Wednesday evening that Balwidner Singh, the Sikh man whose turban fell off when he was arrested for carrying a pistol at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) agitation in Howrah on October 8, is a victim of human rights violation. Balwinder Singh’s wife Karamjit Kaur and son Harshveer Singh flew down to Kolkata with Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa. They met the governor at Raj Bhawan and appealed for help after meeting police officials in Howrah. Balwinder Singh is now in the custody of the Howrah district police and facing charges under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Indian Arms Act. He was charged with carrying a pistol the licence for which is invalid in West Bengal. The state BJP leadership earlier said that he works for a private security agency and was deployed to provide security to one of its leaders. “Karamjit Kaur wife & son Harshveer #balwindersingh alongwith delegation @mssirsa called on me. It was a difficult moment for me to face his Wife and Son pleading for justice. I earnestly appeal @MamataOfficial to undo injustice #Balvindrasingh . @WBPolice @HomeBengal justice,” tweeted Dhankhar. “On issues of violation of human rights State must be with victim rather than with perpetrators. Time @MamataOfficial to rise to occasion to undo injustice @WBPolice @HomeBengal & take immediate remedial steps #Balvindersingh. Sensitive stance would be wholesome for society,” he wrote. Kaur said, “My husband comes from a family of soldiers who served the country. I appeal to the people of West Bengal, who are our friends, and chief minister Mamata Banerjee to do justice and release my husband,” Sirsa, who is a Shiromani Akali Dal leader, has challenged the allegation that Balwinder’s arms licence is not valid in West Bengal. On Wednesday he submitted Singh’s flight documents to the governor and said Singh carried the firearm from Delhi to Kolkata with valid documents and an ‘all-India’ licence. “How can a man who served the army and fought in the Kargil War be treated like a terrorist? He has been charged under 15 sections,” said Sirsa. Taking on the chief minister, the governor on Wednesday released a letter he wrote to her on October 11 after talking to her over the phone. The letter said that he wanted to talk about Balwinder Singh, the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manish Shukla on October 4 and other issues related to law and order in the state but the chief minister accused him of being partisan. “Surely Chief Minister and her colleagues, in government and party, calling the Governor an agent of a particular party (and what not), as is the case, is not only derogatory for the office of the Governor, but quite self-demeaning, stooping too low to be completely avoidable. So is the accusatory tone towards the Governor,” said the letter. “On October 8, all witnessed extensive breaches of basic and affirmed rights of the people. Enormity of violations generated wide spread consternation, reaction and wrath in the public when state apparatus unleashed virtual reign of terror with barbaric insensitivity. What happened graduate to the worst crimes in a civilised society governed by the Rule of Law. What happened to a Sikh has sent shock waves beyond the State. As per details in public domain, he was insultingly beaten, dragged and his turban disrespectfully treated in full public view by unstoppable police personnel,” Dhankhar wrote in the letter. Reacting to this, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “The BJP moves on its own strength. It does not need any support from the Raj Bhawan or any political party.” “The Mamata Banerjee government should apologize for hurting the sentiments of the Sikh community,” said GhoshTMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “Sikhs and Bengalis have always lived in harmony like brothers. No Sikh organisation in Bengal has raised this issue because everyone knows that it is an isolated incident and the turban came off during scuffling. The police have already explained that. Left with no other issue, the BJP is trying to use it to gain some political mileage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-calls-balwinder-singh-victim-of-human-rights-violation/story-xFJj3q8gPIrj0JS3qW3o7M.html

Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh said one person in the case has been arrested. Hunt for his accomplice is on, said police.“We have launched a manhunt for the other accused. A team has been constituted to nab the second accused,” said Singh.Police said a minor girl from Jagatsinghpur district, a Std IX student, had come to stay with her elder sister and brother-in-law in Professorpada area of Cuttack city about three weeks ago unable to bear the torture of his father. However, her brother-in-law did not want to keep her in his home for long and asked her to go back to Jagatsinghpur, said police.Slamming the government, opposition BJP on Wednesday launched a scathing attack, asking how can the ruling BJD claim support of women voters when they are not safe. “Crime against women is on the rise in the state. The Class-IX girl student who was gang-raped for 22 days is from Tirtol, how will the government face the people during the forthcoming bypoll? How come the police were unaware of the incident? What was the police doing,” asked state BJP leader Lekhashree Samantsinghar.“State Women Commission chief speaks up when it suits BJD’s political purpose. Similarly, the women and child development minister, home minister and chief minister who make tall claims about women safety are completely silent,” she added.On September 20, while waiting for a bus at OMP square in Cuttack, a youth named Santosh Behera approached her and promised to bring her to Badambadi bus stand by giving false assurances, said police. As it was getting dark, the police added, the girl was anxious to return to Jagatsinghpur but Behera instead took her to a farmhouse of his friend Raka near Gatiroutpatna on the pretext of taking her home.“The youth along with his associate Raka sexually abused the girl at the farm for 22 days. They also recorded the video of the incident and threatened to kill her or post the video on social media if she attempted to escape or dared to report the matter,” said a police official of Chauliaganj police station. A case under sections 376 D( gang rape), 376 A (causing death to victim) and section 34 (common intention) of the IPC and section 6 of Pocso Act have been lodged against the accused at Chauliaganj police station.Police accidentally rescued her on October 12 evening after receiving a tip-off about a sex racket in the area when they found her in the farmhouse. The girl was then handed to the District Childline for counselling.“The mental and physical condition of the victim is not good. She is very much scared. In her statement before the District Child Protection Officer, she has narrated about her ordeal. We have contacted the Childline in Jagatsinghpur district for informing her family there. We are also trying to contact her elder sister in Cuttack,” said coordinator of Cuttack childline Narayan Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-year-old-raped-by-2-for-over-20-days-in-odisha-s-cuttack-police/story-LIMdERB2fpKZ3eoL2y1o9K.html

14-10-2020||India||‘Common man’s Diwali in your hands’: SC’s nudge to Centre on loan relief||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that the Government should implement “at the earliest” the waiver on compounded interest on loans of up to Rs 2 crore under the RBI moratorium scheme as the borrower cannot be expected to keep waiting for a month, adding that the common man’s Diwali is in the government’s hands.“The Common man’s Diwali is in your hands,” the top court told the Centre.The Centre had stated in an affidavit last Saturday that the government may require time till November 15 to come out with a formal scheme announcing the waiver on compound interest.Taking strong objection to such tactics by the Centre, the three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said, “What you have decided must percolate down to the beneficiaries. You announced a waiver on compounded interest on October 2 but no direction has been issued to the banks. Despite your decision, the common man is worried about being charged interest on interest by banks. Why should it take you so long to work out modalities, you seem to be simply delaying the whole thing.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre, informed the court that the waiver on compounded interest has been issued on loans up to Rs 2 crore for eight categories of beneficiaries. These include loans given to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), personal loans offered on account of housing, education, consumer durables, auto, consumption, personal loan to professionals, and credit card dues.Mehta said, “When the Centre has stated in the affidavit that the decision will be implemented, it will be done. The outer limit is November 15 but we intend to do it much before that. We have taken the decision seeing the plight of the common man. We do not stand to gain anyway by delaying it any further.”The bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah, replied, “There is difference in ‘will be implemented’ and ‘being implemented’. Once you have taken a decision it must be implemented at the earliest. We do not agree that such a long time is needed for such a small decision.”“The modalities to be followed by the lending institutions will be formulated in a scheme which will be a part of an Office Memorandum (O.M). Considering the complexities of different categories of borrowers and their different terms and conditions, such a scheme will be issued by way of an Office Memorandum on or before November 15.” the Centre said last week. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for the Indian Banks Association (IBA), a consortium of over 200 banks, assured the court that whatever the Centre has decided will be implemented.“The numbers are large of the eight categories of beneficiaries who will benefit from the scheme. Our problem is we cannot do anything without a circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),” he said. The bench wondered why the modalities were not worked out before the Centre made the announcement of the waiver before the court. “The lending institutions will be required to take suitable steps for implementing the decision of waiver of interest on interest [compounded interest] in the respective accounts of the eligible borrowers within one month from the aforesaid O.M, subsequent to which the lending institution will approach the Central Government for reimbursement,” said the governmentThe court posted the matter to November 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/common-man-s-diwali-in-your-hands-sc-s-nudge-to-centre-on-loan-relief/story-1ntdJZjOGmAFOocVxeB7dP.html

Seeing no response from Kumar, Sarvanan ‘presumed’ that his brother who had been ailing was dead and asked a funeral service company to supply a freezer box and called several relatives to inform them about last rites planned for the next day.However, when employees of the funeral service company came to collect back the freezer on Tuesday before the funeral, they saw that Kumar’s hands were moving and raised an alarm. But Sarvanan claimed that this was due to ‘fits’ that his brother had and said the movement must have been due to the ‘soul not having left the body.’After the police were informed, they immediately shifted Kumar to the nearby government hospital where he is said to be recovering. A Sooramangalam police station official claimed that ‘it looks like it has not been done deliberately and the 70-year-old younger brother Sarvanan also does not seem to have all his wits about him.”The police have registered a case under IPC section 287 (conduct endangering human life) and sec 336 (endangering personal safety of others) and are investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/74-year-old-man-presumed-dead-and-kept-in-freezer-rescued-a-day-later-in-tamil-nadu/story-B7KMhskyEWBrfpPB3OLKsI.html

14-10-2020||India||India, Pakistan in war of words over Kashmir, terror at Commonwealth meet||India on Wednesday criticised Pakistan for raising issues such as Kashmir at the virtual Commonwealth foreign ministers’ meeting, saying it is a “globally acknowledged promoter of state-sponsored terrorism” that masquerades as a victim of the menace. The remarks were part of a statement delivered by Vikas Swarup, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, who participated in the meeting on behalf of external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Both countries didn’t name each other in their respective statements though it was clear who they were referring to. Pakistan raised the issue of India’s alleged sponsorship of terror activities aimed against Islamabad, and described Jammu and Kashmir as a “disputed territory”. Swarup said it was unfortunate that the Commonwealth meeting was “misused by one of our South Asian member states to pursue its own bigoted, ill-conceived, narrow and unilateral agenda on a multilateral platform”. He added, “When we heard them rant about a South Asian state, we were left wondering why it was describing itself? And not surprisingly it came from a globally acknowledged promoter of state-sponsored terrorism masquerading as an alleged victim of the same.” In his speech, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said, “While the world remains preoccupied with pandemic, a state in South Asia is targeting its religious minority groups in order to foment division and hatred… It has transgressed rights and freedoms of millions and fanned hyper nationalism to engineer illegal demographic change in a disputed territory and sowed racial tensions.” Swarup accused Pakistan of bringing “genocide to South Asia 39 years back, when it killed its own people”, and said: “This is also the same country that has the dubious distinction of becoming synonymous with the phrase ‘epicentre of terrorism’ and hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations.” Swarup said the “only dispute left” in Kashmir, which Pakistan described as a “disputed territory”, is “its own illegal occupation of certain parts, which sooner or later, it would have to vacate”. “For such a country to hypocritically preach about religious minority groups elsewhere, while trampling upon the rights of its own indigenous minorities, was indeed most regrettable, and a blatant misuse of this august platform,” he added. Swarup also spoke of India’s role in helping other countries counter the Covid-19 pandemic, saying: “As we move towards development of a Covid-19 vaccine, India (which accounts for 60% of global vaccine production) has already committed its vaccine production and delivery capacity to help the world in fighting this crisis.” In keeping with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2018, India has opened a “Commonwealth Sub Window” of $50 Million to provide grants to member states for projects related to SDG implementation and climate change. In its first year of existence, this fund has approved 11 projects in nine Commonwealth countries, including the development of a climate early warning system in seven Pacific Island countries. India has also more than doubled its support to the Commonwealth Small States Offices Program in New York, from $100,000 to $250,000, and Geneva, from $80,000 to $150,000, to support the engagement of small island developing states with global bodies such as the UN and WTO, Swarup said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pakistan-in-war-of-words-over-kashmir-terror-at-commonwealth-meet/story-JTsItaGdpAJIhv36G6hCzI.html

Not fair on the Centre’s part to take a month to implement the decision,” the bench said, to which Mehta responded by saying that it will take some time to implement the decision and sought one month’s time for the same.“Please, see the plight of common people, when you have already decided to help. Diwali is now in your hands. Common man’s Diwali is in government’s hand,” the bench observed while denying the request and asked the Centre to bring something concrete.The matter was slated to come up for further hearing before the bench on November 2.One of the petitioners in the case, lawyer Vishal Tiwari submitted before the apex court that the banks are acting on their own discretion and added that they do not care for any orders or instructions and that there should be some interim orders.Tiwari said he has filed written submissions in the matter and said the court should consider that, along with the consolidated affidavit filed by the Reserve Bank of India on October 9.The RBI had submitted that extending the loan moratorium, which was announced to cope with the economic fallout of Covid-19, by another six months can impact the credit behaviour of borrowers and increase the risks of delinquencies post resumption of scheduled payments.The top court was hearing two petitions -- Gajender Sharma and Vishal Tiwari -- seeking an extension of the moratorium period on repayment of loans and to waive off the interest on the repayment of the loan amount keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-something-concrete-common-man-s-diwali-in-govt-s-hand-supreme-court-on-loan-relief/story-lg1doI4naTgOb2QaxbnS3I.html

14-10-2020||India||Indian Army chief General Naravane to visit Nepal in November||Indian Army chief General MM Naravane is set to travel to Nepal next month, the first high-level visit between the two countries since a border row hit ties earlier this year. Nepal’s defence ministry announced on Wednesday that Naravane will visit in November. “The visit was approved by the government of Nepal on February 3, 2020 but was postponed due to [the Covid-19] lockdown in both the countries,” it said in a statement. In keeping with a long-standing convention between the armies of the two countries, Nepal’s President Vidya Devi Bhandari will “confer the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army to General Naravane in an investiture ceremony during this visit”, the statement said. Though the statement didn’t give the dates for the trip, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian Army chief is expected to be in Nepal during November 3-5. India and Nepal have traditionally had strong defence and security ties, with regular exchanges and training programmes. Nearly 30,000 Gurkhas serve in seven regiments of the Indian Army. Naravane’s visit will provide an opportunity for the two sides to push defence and security cooperation after bilateral relations were affected by a border row that erupted in May. At the time, Nepal objected to the opening of a new road to Lipulekh region on the border with Tibet by India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh. Nepal then issued a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory, exacerbating the row. Soon after the row began, Naravane said Nepal’s protest against the border road was at the behest of “someone else” – a veiled reference to China. The comments irked the Nepalese leadership, and defence minister Ishwar Pokhrel had said they “hurt the sentiments of the Nepali Gurkha army personnel who lay down their lives to protect India”. India rejected Nepal’s claims on Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura and said the matter should be addressed through dialogue. However, talks are yet to be scheduled between the two sides. In August, the two sides held a meeting of their oversight mechanism that oversees India-funded development projects and agreed to speed up work on bilateral projects, including infrastructure schemes and cross-border rail links. This was seen as the first effort by the two countries to set their relations back on an even keel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-chief-general-naravane-to-visit-nepal-in-november/story-luEndRskSk29QQAQkJnwoM.html

He said he was fully cooperating with the investigation. The officer claimed that agencies were under pressure to arrest him to satisfy some vested interests. The plea will be taken up on Thursday. There are reports the ED will file a case against him for money laundering. During investigation it found that he had made several foreign trips and in some of them official permission was not sought. He was reportedly also aware of the questionable integrity of Swapna Suresh but went out of the way to help her.The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of gold was seized from a consignment for the UAE consulate. P Sarith Kumar, a former employee of the consulate who came to receive it, was arrested by the Customs department. Two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and Sandip Nair were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later. Sivasankar was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced.

About 29 organisations representing farmers boycotted the meeting, saying there was no minister present to hear their concerns. They protested outside Krishi Bhavan and tore copies of new farm laws. When asked about this, Javadekar said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar have already held one round of discussion with farmer organisations on this issue. “If someone wants more (discussion), we are always open (to) meet everyone. But Tomarji has an engagement today, therefore he has gone. When he will get free, he is meeting all. There is no problem in this,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Javadekar told the media after the Cabinet meeting. It may be noted that farmers in Punjab and Haryana and other states are protesting against new farm laws which they feel will lead to procurement in the hands of corporates and the end of minimum support price (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-always-open-for-discussion-with-farmers-on-new-farm-laws-prakash-javadekar/story-XlMTml50bDvlw7d32L37aI.html

UPPCB uses this data to keep an eye on stubble burning and alert respective district administrations.The FIRMS showed active fires concentrated in Punjab and Haryana and dispersed fires in west UP district of Bulandshahr, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Bijnor, Saharanpur, Etawah and Firozabad etc in the past 24 hours.VK Singh, chief engineer at UPPCB said, “The satellite data is shared with the respective district administrations to alert them about the incidents of stubble burning. It also helps us in keeping a better vigil.” The board is working in tandem with district authorities to prevent stubble burning. The officials reach out to farmers to dissuade them from burning their stubble and also impose fine or lodge FIR in case of non-compliance. Almost 50 farmers have been slapped with a total Rs 1.28 lakh fine in the past four days in nine districts of the state.At least a dozen FIRs have also been registered against farmers for burning stubble.While the government officials assert that they are doing everything to prevent stubble burning, farmer groups believe that the efforts are not practical enough. “The government wants us to remove the stubble instead of burning it. Doing this is not economically viable so we are forced to burn it,” said Deepak Rana, a farmer of Khutar in Shahjahanpur.Meanwhile the effect of stubble burning is reflected in the worsening air quality in the region. On Tuesday, more than 14 districts of west UP recorded an average AQI (Air quality index) of more than 200 which is considered poor and has serious impact on health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fines-firs-fail-to-check-stubble-burning-in-west-up-as-aqi-plunges/story-5l9ux9cFTgL4oahQjnMXZN.html

The government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to provide complete security to the victim’s family and witnesses to ensure free and fair investigation,” the affidavit said.Further, personal security gunners have been provided for the security of the victim’s father, mother, brothers, sister-in-law and grandmother, it added.“The entire security staff deployed at the village has been strictly instructed to ensure that there is no intrusion into the privacy of the victim’s family and witnesses and that they are free to move and meet people they want,” it was submitted.The affidavit also stated that the victim’s brother had informed the additional superintendent of police that they have engaged two lawyers on behalf of their family as private advocates in the matter.The affidavit was filed pursuant to an order passed by the Supreme Court on October 6, seeking details of the security being provided by the state government to the victim’s family and witnesses.The order was passed by the apex court on a plea by a social activist, Satyama Dubey and two lawyers, Vishal Thakre and Rudra Pratap Yadav, alleging failure on the part of Uttar Pradesh authorities in dealing with the matter and seeking a CBI probe into the incident in which a 19-year old Dalit woman from Hathras was gang-raped and murdered allegedly by so called upper caste men on September 14.The victim had breathed her last on September 29. The manner in which her body was cremated by the state authorities in the dead of the night against the wishes of the family had led to outrage across the country.The UP government has maintained that it was forced to do so in order to avert an extraordinary law and order problem posed by protesters and political parties.The state in an earlier affidavit filed on October 5 had stated that it is in agreement with the prayer for a CBI probe but said that such a probe should be monitored by the top court. The CBI is currently probing the matter. In its affidavit on Wednesday, the UP government requested that a direction be issued to the CBI to submit fortnightly status reports on the investigation to the state government which can then be filed by DGP of UP before the Supreme Court.Meanwhile, an intervention application was file before the Supreme Court by an NGO, Munnokka Samudaya Samrakshana Munnani (Forward Community Welfare Front) based out of Kerala praying that guidelines be issued to ensure that when such crimes are reported, it should be first ascertained whether or not such crime is indeed the outcome of caste-based discrimination before portraying it as one.“It becomes imperative that the random use of caste in the reporting of crimes even when the caste of the involved parties is of no relevance, only helps to vilify and malign entire sections of people leaving them with no legal remedy and needs to be checked,” the application said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ensure-security-of-hathras-family-witnesses-up-to-supreme-court/story-fMhdGRRTDyPqkhIvKJzJtL.html

It has even surpassed Maharashtra as far as daily cases are concerned. Recently, the Tripura High Court has cited the example of Kerala’s Onam festival and asked the authorities to be cautious ahead of festivities in October. Karnataka is also considering Onam an example of what not to do in Dasara.The first confirmed Covid-19 case in India was reported in Kerala on January 30. It took 203 days to breach the 50,000-mark in total Covid cases as the state managed to rein in the spread of the infection with stringent surveillance. However, the next 50,000 was reached within the next 23 days. And on October 13, Kerala’s Covid-19 tally crossed the three lakh-markThe ongoing spike started in September. While in early September, the state was reporting a spike of near 2, 000 cases, last week Kerala reported a single-day spike of 11,755 cases.What happened in last one month?Onam: Onam was celebrated from the last week of August to September first week. Though social distancing norms were in place and people were asked to celebrate Onam in their houses, over 100 per cent jump in daily cases were reported after Onam.Massive political protests: The state saw several political protests in August and September. For example, three young political leaders who led protests against minister KT Jaleel in September tested positive. The minister has been accused of distributing Quran brought in diplomatic baggage from the UAE and seeking aid from the Consulate during Ramadan.Unlock: Like the rest of the country, Kerala has relaxed many restrictions adhering to the protocols of unlocking. The state is now open to tourists as well. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja earlier said the situation in the state is not grim as the mortality rate is low. “The ultimate aim is to reduce the mortality rate. We could contain cases when there was lockdown. But now measures are eased. We can’t blame the government for easing restrictions because people need to work and earn or else they will starve to death.

14-10-2020||India||Farm leaders walk out of talks called by Centre, demand minister’s presence||A delegation of protesting farmers’ leaders from Punjab invited for talks by Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal walked out of the meeting, demanding the presence of farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar, according to an umbrella platform representing them. The Union government had invited at least 31 farmers’ organisations and their leaders from Punjab for talks in the national capital, the second attempt in a month to reach out to farmers protesting a set of laws enacted by Parliament to liberalise agricultural markets. Watch: Farmers walk out of Centre’s meeting over absence of minister “The meeting was an effort to try and create a false impression that the central government is engaging with farmers, when in fact it is going all out to roll out and enforce the black anti-farmer laws,” the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said in a statement. The farmers’ delegation demanded the presence of agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and tore up copies of the laws. “First, the government should be ready to review and if necessary, repeal the three laws. Second, the government should be ready to consider legislating the minimum support price as a legal right and deal with input cost, food security and other issues,” the AIKSCC statement said. Avik Saha, convenor of the AIKSCC, said the meeting with the agriculture secretary “did not meet any of these criteria” as the secretary could not repeal, amend or enact new laws. “Rather his job is to implement the laws made by the government so he is the wrong person for the right discussion,” Saha said. A one-line statement released by the ministry on the meeting said the farmers’ delegation presented a memorandum to agriculture secretary addressed to the Union agriculture minister. The memorandum demanded repeal of the recent laws enacted to deregulate farm markets. Farmers have blocked roads and railway tracks since September 24 in a protest against legislations they fear could pave the way for the government to stop buying cereals at guaranteed prices (minimum support prices or MSP), leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private players. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defending the laws, has called the new measures “historic”. He has publicly said that while the laws give farmers options to sell their produce to private buyers, the government would continue to purchase staples such as rice and wheat at MSPs. The laws seek to end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees or APMCs by opening up to private competition. These assurances have done little to satisfy millions of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and western parts of Uttar Pradesh. Big farmer groups, who usually produce substantial surpluses, fear deregulation will leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. The reforms are a crucial test for the Narendra Modi government’s ability to push through structural reforms in the country’s antiquated agriculture sector, which supports nearly half of all Indians, while mollifying especially large farmers in the food bowl states, who are an influential voting bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leaders-walk-out-of-talks-called-by-centre-demand-minister-s-presence/story-HKQqu3pghXbWhqF0BkUXUO.html

Her husband Arjun Rao, a retired IAS officer, said she had been suffering from a neurological problem for a long time. She was admitted to the hospital a few days ago, when her condition worsened. She breathed her last at around 1.30 am. Born in 1956 at Anakapalle in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam district, Shobha Naidu had been one of the prominent exponents of Kuchipudi dance in the country. A disciple of Kuchipudi maestro Vempati Chinna Satyam, she had started giving stage performance at a very young age. Naidu toured across the country and abroad to stage Kuchipudi dance programmes. Particularly, she mastered the programme – Bhama Kalapam, wherein she used to play the role of Satyabhama, wife of Lord Krishna. She also choreographed several dance dramas. She extensively toured the US, UK, Dubai, Turley, Hongkong, Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba to give stage performances of Kuchipudi dance. Naidu was awarded the civilian honour of Padma Shri in 2001. She also won several other awards like Nritya Choodamani and Sangeet Natak Akademi award. She also served as the principal of the 40-year-old Kuchipudi Art Academy, Hyderabad and trained more than 1,500 students from India and abroad. Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao expressed shock over the demise of Shobha Naidu. He said she was an outstanding exponent of the Kuchipudi dance form and conveyed his condolences to members of the bereaved family. Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and leader of opposition N Chandrababu Naidu also condoled the death of Shobha Naidu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/padma-shri-awardee-and-renowned-kuchipudi-exponent-shobha-naidu-passes-away-at-64/story-xCv9j5HNAWFpDxnjjxrwpO.html

She has kindly accepted Farooq Sb’s invitation to join a meeting of the GupkarDeclaration signatories’ tomorrow afternoon (Thursday),” Omar tweeted.“Today our visit was without any political motive and we wanted to know her well being... In the meeting tomorrow, the present political situation will be reviewed and what will be the future agenda of the Gupkar Declaration signatories in one view, that will also be discussed,” Omar told reporters outside Mufti’s residence. Gupkar Declaration is a joint effort of all the regional mainstream political parties – the National Conference, the Peoples Democratic Party, the Peoples Conference, the Awami National Conference and the CPI (M) - of Jammu and Kashmir to fight for the special status of the erstwhile state.After the meet, Mehbooba Mufti was hopeful that together they could change things.“It was nice of you & Farooq sahab to come home. It gave me courage listening to him. I am sure together we all can change things for the better,” Mufti responded to Omar Abdullah.Later in the day, Peoples’ Conference chairman Sajad Lone called on the PDP chief.Mufti has already sent a terse message to Delhi just an hour after her release. Mufti said that people will have to continue struggling for the resolution of Kashmir issue and whatever was snatched by Delhi on August 5 will have to be taken back.“I have become free today after more than a year. During this time the black decision of August 5, 2019, black day, would always pain my heart and soul. And I realise that the people of J&K would have the same feeling. Nobody among us can forget the day’s robbery and humiliation,” she said in the 1.23 min audio.“Now we all will have to reiterate that whatever Delhi Darbar, unconstitutionally and undemocratically, snatched away from us will have to be taken back,” she said. On August 4, 2019, a day before the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 by the central government and the detention of all the political leaders, a group of prominent politicians of J&K met in Srinagar at Gupkar and issued a joint statement vowing to defend the “identity, autonomy and special status of Jammu & Kashmir against all attacks and onslaughts whatsoever”. The statement has since then come to be known as the Gupkar Declaration.A year after the development on August 22, 2020, the six political parties of the erstwhile state again issued a statement and announced to carry forward the Gupkar Declaration.It was the first such joint statement signed by mainstream parties after the revocation of Article 370 and splitting the region into two union territories which hinted at launching a joint struggle for restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.“We all reiterate that we are bound, wholly, by the contents of the Gupkar declaration and will unwaveringly adhere to it. We are committed to strive for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, the Constitution of J&K and the restoration of the State and any division of the State is unacceptable to us. We unanimously reiterate that there can be ‘nothing about us without us’,” the joint statement had said.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained hours before the central government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two union territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one.Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, the two other former chief ministers, were released on March 13 and March 24, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nice-of-you-to-come-home-mehbooba-mufti-to-farooq-omar-abdullah/story-rYSEa9klyXYzX7TcdRA9VJ.html

The jail guards, who noticed him hanging, alerted the higher officials of the prisons department. “We brought him down and immediately shifted him to the state-run Osmania Hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” a senior jail official, who refused to be quoted, said. The Dabeerpura police booked a case of suspicious death and are investigating the matter. On August 14, the revenue official working at Keesara block in Medchal-Malkajgiri district was caught red-handed by the ACB allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 1.10 crore in cash from a property dealer for settling a dispute pertaining to 19.39 acres of agricultural land at Rampally Dayara village. The ACB sleuths formally arrested him the following day along with three others, including a real estate broker and the property dealer. The authorities also recovered unaccounted cash of Rs 28 lakh, besides Rs 8 lakh accounted for cash and gold ornaments weighing 1.5 kg, from his residence. According to the ACB authorities, it was the largest amount of cash ever seized by the ACB from any official in the state till date. They also confiscated several land documents from the possession of the revenue official. He was later remanded to judicial custody. Subsequently, the police interrogated him twice in connection with the alleged bribe. Earlier in June, the husband of a woman tehsildar also died by suicide weeks after she was arrested by the ACB in a graft case.

14-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Govt to import 1 lakh liquid oxygen to meet any shortage during winters||The Union Health Ministry has initiated the process of importing liquid oxygen as part of its preparedness to meet any unforeseen shortage during the winters when the country may witness an increase in Covid-19 cases leading to a rise in demand for oxygen. HLL Lifecare Limited, a public sector undertaking, has floated a global tender on Wednesday on behalf of the Health Ministry for procuring one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen. The oxygen is being procured for various central and state government hospitals. The entire exercise of importing and then distributing the medical oxygen is estimated to cost Rs 600-700 crore, official sources said. As on Tuesday, around 3.97 per cent of the Covid-19 patients were on oxygen support, 2.46 per cent were in ICU beds which are again with oxygen support and 0.40 pc on ventilator support. In March, before the country went into a lockdown, the country had a manufacturing capacity of around 6,400 metric tonne of oxygen per day, of which around 1,000 metric tonne was being used for medical purposes daily while the rest was utilised by industries, sources said. “Industries have opened up following unlock procedures and as on September 30, the country’s daily capacity of oxygen production is around 7,000 metric tonne, of which around 3,094 metric tonne is being used for both COVID and non-Covid patients and is just enough to meet the demands,” a source said. “So this one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen which is being planned to be procured from foreign countries would create a one month buffer in case demand rises further during the winter season,” the source explained. The issue was discussed at a meeting held by the Cabinet Secretary on October 10, following which it was decided to import liquid oxygen. Even though India is witnessing a declining trend in daily new Covid-19 cases, experts fear that the upcoming festive season and following winter months may see a spike in coronavirus infections. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has urged people to observe Covid-19-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, maintaining respiratory etiquette and staying away from congregations, citing the possibility of increased novel coronavirus transmission during winters. “These viruses are known to thrive better in the cold weather and low humidity conditions. In view of these, it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see increased rates of transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Indian context too,” he said. In September, when cases were increasing, the Health Ministry had repeatedly advised states to ensure adequate oxygen availability in all healthcare facilities and unrestricted intra as well as inter-state movement of oxygen. States were also asked to ensure facility wise/hospital wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning for timely replenishment so that there are no stockouts. India’s Covid-19 caseload rose to 72,39,389 on Wednesday, while the death toll due to the disease was 1,10,586.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-govt-to-import-1-lakh-liquid-oxygen-to-meet-any-shortage-during-winters/story-hVl1CxkTT51ajw0euMYG4M.html

This would require Pakistan to pull the plug on the terrorist training camps that operate across the border and crack down on the hundreds of terrorists operating from its territory.A senior official said any effort to suggest that India is ready to hold dialogue with Pakistan before it delivers on its obligation to create a conducive environment is not just “mischievous but also a pipe dream”.Also Read: Pakistan’s 39-yr-old NSA a key player in army’s Gilgit move that suits ChinaIt is as outrageous as his effort in the same interview to link India to the 2014 terrorist assault on an army school in Peshawar, the official added. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, backed by Pak’s deep state, had claimed responsibility for the attack that killed over 130 children.In an interview, Moeed W Yusuf, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Planning, had indicated that Pakistan was lukewarm to India’s overtures and wanted India to first fulfil four conditions including rolling back the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and release of political prisoners in the Kashmir valley, a term that Islamabad often uses to include terrorists as well.Pakistan watchers said that Moeed Yusuf’s claims appear to be aimed at obfuscation of the facts on ground.Also Read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his hands | AnalysisIn New Delhi, the 39-year-old adviser to Imran Khan - he also doubles as Pakistan’s national security adviser - is seen to be playing China’s game on the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the occupied Northern Areas. Pakistan has incorporated the disputed region as one of Pakistan’s five provinces at China’s behest. China has poured millions of dollars into this region for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to build an alternative supply route to the choked Malacca Strait, the shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.A Pakistan watcher said Yusuf is believed to have worked closely with the Pakistan army and the Inter-Services Intelligence long before he was handpicked by Imran Khan to be his adviser. Yusuf was earlier at the US Institute of Peace where he had cultivated an image of being an advocate of Indo-Pak peace and resolution of the Kashmir issue and entrenched himself in the establishment in Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-a-2-word-rebuttal-to-imran-khan-s-nsa-claim-says-it-is-fiction/story-lKIaPsMznr9u1xwD8yqKOP.html

A few states resumed classes from September 21, as advised by the Centre earlier.Here’s everything you need to knowWhere schools are reopening from October 15Punjab: The Punjab government has decided to reopen schools and coaching institutions from October 15 in a graded manner. Students of only classes 9-12 are permitted to attend schools with parental consent and without making attendance compulsoryGurugram: Physical classroom sessions for students of classes 9 to 12 of government schools will resume from October 15. Regular classes will be conducted for three hours, from 9am to noon. Consent letter is not required since classes will be held regularly. Haryana partially reopened schools on September 21. Colleges and universities were reopened from September 26.Where schools are reopening from October 19Uttar Pradesh government has decided to reopen schools from the beginning of the next week — October 19. Schools in Noida, Ghaziabad are also likely to open from October 19.Why most of the states are not reopening schools nowDelhi, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala are some of the states that are not opening schools now. There is no proved correlation between reopening of schools and a spike in Covid-19 cases. However, several teachers and students have reportedly been found Covid-19 positive in states where schools reopened. After Assam reopened all educational institutions, a number of teachers and non-teaching staff of Dimoria college in Kamrup district were tested positive. Karnataka has declared a midterm holiday from October 12 to 30 suspending even online classes. “I’ve learnt through the media that many teachers are contracting Covid-19 infection.

14-10-2020||India||5 arrested for alleged gang rape of 14-year-old girl in Jharkhand’s Gumla district||A fifth standard student was allegedly kidnapped gang raped on Saturday by five persons, including three minors who also thrashed and threatened the girl’s family in a village in Jharkhand’s Gumla district, around 150 km from capital Ranchi, police said on Wednesday. The police arrested all the five accused on Monday. Two were sent to jail while two sent to a remand home. “One person, who was injured in a clash between victim and families of the accused, was sent to hospital for treatment,” said officer in-charge of Chainpur police station Sudama Ram said. The main accused in the crime, Iliyas Minz is also an accused in a murder case and is currently out of jail on bail, police said. Ram said the medical test of the 14-year-old survivor has been conducted but the result is still awaited. “The girl’s statement under Section 164 of the CrPC will be recorded today. She would also be presented before the child welfare committee today,” he said. The police officer said the family alleged that the girl was kidnapped by five village youths on Saturday evening and they raped her in turn. “The accused threatened the girl with dire consequences if she opened her mouth before anyone. The girl returned home on Sunday. When her mother repeatedly asked her where she had been the whole night, she narrated her woes,” Ram said. The survivor’s family approached the Panchayat and a meeting was called to take a decision. “When accused came to know about the proposed meeting, they barged into our house and thrashed us. My wife and 24-year-old elder son were injured badly. The accused were also planning to set our house on fire,” the 50-year-old father of the survivor said. On Monday, two brothers and an uncle of the survivor went to the accused and thrashed two of them badly with sharp weapons, police said. “The three persons have also been sent to jail on charges of violating laws,” Ram said. He said police were not informed about the crime till Monday. “The report came to us on Monday night when tension grew between the accused and victim’s families,” he said. Since the survivor’s village is affected by Maoists, police reached the spot after taking all precautions. “All the accused were arrested on Monday night and they were sent to jail and remand home on Tuesday,” he said. The police are camping in the village to prevent any untoward incident. The girl’s father said they were living in fear. “The incident has shocked my daughter. We are contemplating to send her to any NGO for counseling. We are in fear that villagers might humiliate us over the incident,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-arrested-for-alleged-gang-rape-of-14-year-old-girl-in-jharkhand-s-gumla-district/story-bYmi5Lu5eC19ZuV6rMmM2O.html

Party chairman Jose K Mani also announced his resignation from the Rajya Sabha. He had won the seat with the support of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) two years ago. The party is severing its ties with the UDF after 38 years. But the UDF has asked the party to quit Kottayam Lok Sabha seat and two MLA seats which it won with the help of the opposition alliance. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan welcomed the new ally and said it will strengthen secular and democratic forces in the state. “It shows the Left is right in Kerala,” he said. The entry of the Kerala Congress, a predominantly Christian party will help the LDF in the central Travancore area that is considered a UDF bastion, political observers said. “We have been suffering in the UDF camp for some time. Congress leaders repeatedly ill-treated us and openly supported our archrival P J Joseph who used all opportunities to discredit our party. Our entry into the LDF is without any condition,” said Jose K Mani in Kottayam while announcing the decision. The Mani faction has a single Lok Saha MP – Thomas Chazhikadan from Kottayam while Jose K Mani was a Rajya Sabha MP . It also has two legislators in the Kerala assembly. The Kerala Congress (Mani) split into two after the death of its founder K M Mani in 2019 but both groups remained in the UDF camp.The party split last year after KM Mani’s son Jose K Mani became the chairman of the party ignoring senior leader P J Joseph’s claim to the post. But the Congress brokered peace between two factions for some time. At one point when Mani was alive he was ready to cross over to the LDF camp but it was thwarted by the CPI, second big partner in the LDF. The BJP which is desperate to get a foothold in Kerala, also tried to woo Jose K Mani but he finally chose the LDF. There are reports that one of the party legislators will be given a cabinet berth in the Vijayan cabinet. “It is a political betrayal. The party will have to quit all seats it won with UDF support. Left hounded K M Mani when he was alive and now his son is taking the party to that camp,” said UDF convenor M M Hassan. He said it would not affect the opposition alliance. His rival P J Joseph, a former minister, said Jose K Mani’s exit was on the cards and it will only strengthen the UDF. Most of the popular leaders of the party are still with the Joseph camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-is-right-says-chief-minister-vijayan-after-kerala-congress-mani-ditches-udf-to-join-ldf/story-x9rsq0xK6aKDvaGOqMbIFK.html
14-10-2020||India||Covid-19: 77% new cases in last 24 hours reported from these 10 states||Kerala had surpassed Maharashtra in the number of daily Covid-19 infections last week. The streak remains unbroken as health ministry data reveals Kerala tops the list of 10 states/Union Territories that are reporting maximum number of cases. The first confirmed Covid-19 case in India was reported in Kerala on January 30. Subsequently, the state managed to rein in the spread of the infection with stringent surveillance. However, for the past few weeks, Kerala numbers have again become a cause of worry. Also Read: Overconfidence, low testing rate to blame for Covid-19 spike in Kerala, say expertsIn the last 24 hours, Kerala reported 8,764 new infections; Maharashtra reported 8,522 new cases. Close to them is Karnataka with 8,191 cases. Health ministry data has revealed that 77 per cent of the new cases being reported in the last 24 hours are concentrated in only 10 states and Union territories. Apart from Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, the list includes Tamil Nadu (4,666), Andhra Pradesh (4,622), West Bengal (3,631), Delhi (3,036), Uttar Pradesh (2,957), Chhattisgarh (2,619) and Odisha (2,275). However, as far as fatalities are concerned, Kerala is better placed than the rest. Out of 730 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, Kerala reported only 21, while the number in Maharashtra is 187, in Karnataka 87, West Bengal 62, Tamil Nadu 57 and Delhi 45.Last week, Kerala reported 11,755 cases — the highest ever single-day spike. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja earlier said the situation in the state is not grim as the mortality rate is low. “The ultimate aim is to reduce the mortality rate. We could contain cases when there was lockdown. But now measures are eased. We can’t blame the government for easing restrictions because people need to work and earn or else they will starve to death. But people need to follow all precautions,” the minister said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-77-new-cases-in-last-24-hours-reported-from-these-10-states/story-3KeNdXGh5OJwaiuNChHZsK.html

This indicates that the rate of spread of infection is being effectively contained. Twenty states and UTs have a positivity rate less than the national average. The cumulative positivity rate is 8.04 per cent and is on a continuous decline,” the ministry said.India has been registering more new recoveries than the new cases consistently in the recent days.  As a result, the active cases are steadily declining and stand at 8,26,876 as on date and comprise only 11.42% of the total caseload of the country, the ministry highlighted.The health ministry said higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes/facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases, adding that these measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate.A total of 74,632 Covid-19 cases have recovered and discharged in a span of 24 hours whereas 63,509 new infections were reported during the same period, according to Union health ministry dashboard.  “Higher number of recoveries has aided the national Recovery Rate to further improve to 87.05%. The total recoveries have surged to 63,01,927 and exceed active cases of Covid-19 by 54,75,051.  Also, 79 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs --- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Delhi,” the ministry said.Maharashtra continues to contribute the maximum with more than 15,000 single day recoveries.The ministry said that 77% of the 63,509 new infections registered in a span of 24 hours are from 10 states and UTs --Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnatala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.Kerala with 8,764 new cases has outnumbered Maharashtra (8,522) with the highest number of new reported cases.Top three contributing states, Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, reported more than 8,000 cases followed by Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, both contributing more than 4,000 cases each.Also, 730 case Covid-19 fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours. Of these, nearly 80 per cent are concentrated in ten states and Union Territories.“More than 25% of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (187 deaths).  India has demonstrated an exponential increase in the number of Covid-19 cumulative tests since January 2020.  The country’s testing capacities have multiplied manifold with more than 1900 labs across the country and with collaborative efforts of the Centre and state and UT governments. More than 15 lakh samples can be tested every day,” the ministry said.Progressive expansion in testing infrastructure has played a crucial role in the steep rise of testing numbers, it added.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-tests-in-india-cross-9-crore-health-ministry/story-VRce3sK9xoD1yQFaaqy1gP.html

14-10-2020||India||Israel aligned with PM Modi’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, ‘Make in India’ vision: Israeli envoy||Hailing the selection by the Indian government of an Israeli firm for electronics manufacturing in India, Israeli Ambassador Ron Malka has said the development signifies his country’s alignment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ vision. The Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology (MeitY) has approved 16 eligible applicants under the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI). The PLI for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing extends an incentive of 4 per cent to 6 per cent on incremental sales (over the base year) of goods under target segments that are manufactured in India to eligible companies, for a period of five years subsequent to the base year (FY2019-20). Welcoming the development, Malka tweeted, “Delighted that NeoLync, an Israeli company is a part of UTL-NeoLync that was selected by the Indian government for electronics manufacturing in India, an important addition to the list of  Israeli companies already actively participating in @PMOIndia’s Make In India, export and Atmanirbhar Bharat vision.” Speaking to PTI about the selection of the firm, which has 49 per cent Israeli stake, said this shows how much his country is aligned with the Indian vision not only on the government to government basis but also business to business. It also aligns with the vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ because this will make India and Israel self-reliant in these areas of communication and advanced communication, he said. “Israel and India don’t compete with each other, they complete each other,” he said. Under the mobile phone (domestic companies) segment, Indian companies including Lava, Bhagwati (Micromax), Padget Electronics, UTL Neolyncs and Optiemus Electronics are approved by MeitY. These companies are expected to expand their manufacturing operations in a significant manner and grow into national champion companies in mobile phone production, a ministry statement had said. Six companies are approved under the Specified Electronic Components Segment and they are AT&S, Ascent Circuits, Visicon, Walsin, Sahasra, and Neolync, it said. Over the next 5 years, the approved companies under the PLI Scheme are expected to lead to total production worth more than Rs 10.5 lakh crore and it would entail exports worth an estimated amount of Rs 6.5 lakh crore. The companies approved under the scheme will bring additional investment in electronics manufacturing to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore, while they will generate more than two lakh direct employment opportunities in the next 5 years along with the creation of additional indirect employment of nearly 3 times the direct employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-aligned-with-pm-modi-s-aatmanirbhar-bharat-make-in-india-vision-israeli-envoy/story-9jBVH9NB3y2jKlppjOlgnM.html

It also directed that teachers and staff of the schools be paid 50% of their salaries.Alleging that issuance of such an order to collect school fees from students’ of private schools for the lockdown period is illogical, Pebam said, “We have made our stand very firm that during this lockdown period, the salary of private schools teachers should be managed by the school committee and government.”He also claimed that earlier the government had asked the private schools to submit the detailed fee structures. “But so far 50% of private schools have failed to do so.” The AMSU claims there are 1,200 private schools in the state.“We want the Manipur government to accept the conditions put forward by the AMSU in the interest of the public and students community in particular,” he said. “We also want private school teachers who are always deprived of their rights to come out and demand their genuine rights from the school authorities.”On the report of collecting monthly fees by some private schools, the AMSU leader appealed to them not to collect the fees until an amicable solution is found about the issue involving all stakeholders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-students-body-asks-private-schools-not-to-collect-30-fees-for-lockdown-period/story-9STYgu3Riok6WUDeJ3ZIrK.html

14-10-2020||India||Glenmark introduces cheaper drug for lung fibrosis in India||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, a research-led, global integrated drug company, has launched Nindanib, a medicine for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), which causes scarring of lungs, in India, the company announced on Wednesday.PF is also one of the long-term complications that patients, who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19), are likely to suffer from, according to doctors. It is a respiratory health condition that leads to thickening and scarring of lungs. It causes an acute difficulty in breathing and also reduces a patient’s longevity up to five years after the diagnosis. Also Read: Covid-19: ICMR studying reinfections; identifies 3 cases“Glenmark is a leader in the area of respiratory condition. It has been among the first to launch the branded generic version at an affordable cost for the treatment of PF in India. This will provide patients a far more cost-effective treatment option. It will also enable doctors to treat a wider patient population in the country,” said the company in a statement.“…priced at Rs 4,500 (for 100 milligrams) and Rs 5,400 (150 mg) per month is available at 5% of the cost, as compared to the innovator brand in India,” it added.Nintedanib is approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for the treatment of Idiopathic (unknown cause) PF (IPF). IPF is a progressive disease, which gets worse over time. Patients suffering from IPF need to start their treatment at the earliest and persist with it in a bid to arrest the disease progression. A lower monthly cost is the key to ensure patients adhere to prescribed lines of treatment over a long term.IPF affects around 120 Indians per million population, and patients suffering from the health condition are at a higher risk developing severe respiratory conditions, if they afflicted with SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, the company said.Nintedanib has been studied extensively in various controlled clinical trials that have established its efficacy and safety profile. In a recently published INBUILD trial, Nintedanib showed significantly lower annual rate of decline in FVC (forced vital capacity) – a measure of the condition of lungs – among patients suffering from progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases.Two clinical trials are being rolled out to study the efficacy and safety of Nintedanib to treat Covid-19 patients, who are suffering from IPF and are moderately to critically ill.The average survival rate of IPF patients is poor and up to 30% live at least five years after diagnosis. In India, IPF typically affects men above the age of 65, and most live up to five years, if the disease is left untreated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glenmark-introduces-cheaper-drug-for-lung-fibrosis-in-india/story-VxEgkjZLXCXStkBsVlDKbM.html

Rudram-1 is an anti-radiation missile that can detect enemy radars and specifically target them which helps in breaking down the first wave of resistance and creating space for more damage.Also Read: India test-fires 10 missiles in 35 days. It is not a coincidenceAlong with Rudram, the DRDO has also tested extended-range BrahMos missile, supersonic missile-assisted release of torpedo anti-submarine warfare, hypersonic nuclear-capable Shaurya and hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV).These missile tests come at a time when India is engaged in a bitter row with China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The DRDO chief said that the organisation can now accommodate the needs of the armed forces. He said, “We are now able to develop any type of missile system that the armed forces want.”The assurance made by the DRDO chief also reflects that the defence sector is also focussing on developing indigenous weapons systems giving the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) drive a push.Reddy also pointed out that the missiles are a part of DRDO’s effort to develop modern weapons for the armed forces when they are engaged in a conflict with China. He said, “DRDO has been working on many weapon systems. Even during the Covid-19 period, scientists have been continuously working on that. All have matured and hence whenever a system is ready, we are going further developmental trials.”He further added, “The maturity level of many technologies is such that we had very successful flights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-chief-says-india-can-have-complete-missile-system-in-4-5-years/story-rbH4aZJyKZw0vSgQ40n3OP.html

There was extremely heavy rain in parts of Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday.Hyderabad recorded 192 mm rain on Tuesday which is the highest ever October rain recorded in over 100 years. The all-time record for Hyderabad in October was 117.1 mm on October 6, 1903, according to IMD.Also Read: Heavy rains lash Hyderabad, waterlogging and traffic jams reported in many areasOn Wednesday, M Mohapatra, IMD director general, said the depression is weakening. “We are expecting it to move further west north-westwards and weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area during the next 24 hours. But it will eventually immerse into eastern parts of Arabian Sea off Maharashtra coast around morning of October 16,” he said, adding that the system is likely to gain energy from the sea and there is possibility of further intensification into a depression in the next 24 hours.“We are expecting extremely heavy rainfall especially over Maharashtra today [Wednesday] including Madhya Maharashtra, Goa, Konkan and coastal Karnataka,” he added. IMD has warned of inundation in low-lying areas, traffic disruption and landslides in the ghat areas of Konkan and Karnataka.Wind speed will increase over eastern Arabian Sea from October 16 onwards, so fishermen have been advised against venturing into north-eastern Arabian Sea.The withdrawal line of monsoon continues to pass through Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vallabh, Vidyanagar, Porbandar. It will resume withdrawal only after the low-pressure systems have subsided and rains stop scientists said.Normally monsoon withdraws from the country by October 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extremely-heavy-rain-landslide-warning-for-parts-of-india-s-west-coast/story-7gWSesY9xCOozT6AOT7QFI.html

14-10-2020||India||More RTIs disposed of during lockdown, says minister; experts disagree||Right to Information (RTI) cases recorded a higher disposal rate between March and September this year, while the country was in lockdown, than the corresponding period last year, said Union minister of state, personnel, public grievances, pensions Jitendra Singh on Tuesday.Singh shared this during a press briefing on the completion of 15 years of the RTI Act, which came into force on October 12, 2005. “Between March and September 2019, 76.49% of RTI cases were disposed of. During the same period this year, the disposal rate went up to as much as 93.98 %. Last year, out of 11,716 registered cases, 8,962 were disposed of. This year, 8,015 cases were disposed of out of the total of 8,528,” said Singh. Also read: Key posts vacant as RTI law completes 15 years“The Central Information Commission (CIC) has worked assiduously even during the lockdown period and despite the challenges of the pandemic, higher disposal of cases became possible due to extensive use of e-office and latest use of technological tools for facilitating the hearings in the commission,” he added. Singh’s comments come in wake of criticism by RTI activists who allege that the government is trying to curb transparency.The CIC hasn’t had a chief ever since Bimal Julka retired two months ago. This is the fifth time the commission has been headless since 2014, experts said.Meanwhile, experts did not quite agree with the government figures. “First of all, the Press Information Bureau release has disclosed percentages, not dates,” said Venkatesh Nayak from the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), an organisation working towards greater transparency in governance. “Moreover, an RTI filed with the Central government doesn’t give month-wise data. I myself have had authorities saying that they just can’t respond to the queries or they have to be transferred to appellate authorities. First they delay, then decline,” he added. According to transparency activist Lokesh Batra, on the website of Central Information Commission, over 22,000 cases were registered last year. “State Information Commissions have not even been functioning,” he said. “They did try their best, whether they did better, the data will tell. CIC started virtual hearings in lockdown period. Bimal Julka did make an effort. To me, the point is, that during lockdown disposing of more is a good initiative. But as an activist, I also got stuck during the lockdown and couldn’t find certain case files.” On August 18, HT had reported that the working of the state information commissions (SICs) dropped from 80% in June to 44% in July, a survey by the CHRI has found. The survey was conducted by contacting each of 28 SICs across the country and tracking their websites. The first survey (in April) had found that none of the SICs was working, but during the second survey (in May) 12 SICs had opened their offices. However, only eight were conducting hearings. According to its third rapid telephonic survey, the SICs that had started attending to litigants in June had stopped by July. Out of the 29 information commissions, nearly 80% (23 ) had resumed hearings during Unlock1.0 starting on June 1. The CIC began functioning in mid-April. The survey also found that the SICs of Bihar, Goa, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh continue to function without a chief information commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-rtis-disposed-of-during-lockdown-says-minister-critics-disagree/story-vslZWrKjNLylTXyaDDCowM.html

The laws are gender-neutral. Please try to interpret the law for the citizens of Sanatan Dharma in the country. This is not an adversarial litigation. This is for the right of every citizen of the country,” Justice Menon said.The couples’ petitions argued that the non-recognition of marriage between LGBTQ persons violated the fundamental rights of liberty, equality, life and freedom of expression guaranteed to them by the Supreme Court.The Delhi high court is already hearing a petition filed by defence analyst Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others. “Our culture and law doesn’t recognise the concept of same-sex marriages,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had responded to that petition last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-high-court-issues-notice-to-centre-and-delhi-government-on-a-plea-by-two-same-sex-couples-seeking-to-legalise-their-marriage/story-1gTAXXK1ycCNXi60qmah2H.html

So far, three such cases have been reported; two from Mumbai and one from Ahmedabad. There are various cut-off days that are being referred to for reinfection. Though the public is going by up to 110 days, we are taking 100 as the cut-off period because the antibodies last until then,” said Dr Bhargava. Also read: Nevada man experienced severe symptoms during second bout of illnessA recent study, which is published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases, has found that reinfection could occur in Covid-19 patients, and the symptoms would likely to be more severe following the relapse of the viral infection. “The World Health Organisation (WHO) has documented about two dozen cases of Covid-19 reinfection. We have established telephonic contact with the three cases of reinfection as part of our study. They are being looked into,” he added. On Sunday, Union minister for health and family welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan had also said that the ICMR had set up a committee of experts to study reported cases of reinfection among Covid-19 patients. “The ICMR has commissioned a study to look into the cases of reinfection in the country. However, their results are still awaited,” the minister had said while responding to queries from the public on social media as part of the fifth episode of his Sunday Samvaad programme. Dr Bhargava said though SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, was found to be mutating, the changes were negligible.“They will have no impact on the effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine that is under various stages of development in several countries around the world. Major changes, which will have a bearing on vaccine efficacy, take up to 15 years and are called antigenic shifts. A minor antigenic drift is being reported,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-icmr-studying-reinfections-identifies-3-cases/story-hdFhBbPgGPeHc55TjWIuUP.html

They could’ve been given buffalo meat instead of beef but we don’t have many buffaloes in Assam. We float tenders to get beef, buffalo meat, mutton, pork.”The minister said that he understood the need for increasing the cattle population, but highlighted that the wildlife population also needs to be healthy. “Their demand is fair up to an extent, that our cattle population should increase. But if we’ve to keep our wildlife alive and healthy, we’ll have to provide them food as per their diet chart,” said Suklabaidya.BJP leader from Assam Satya Ranjan Borah had held a demonstration outside the Assam state zoo demanding that the practise of feeding animals inside the zoo be stopped. According to PTI, they had also stopped a van carrying beef from entering the zoo during their demonstration on Monday.He also warned the zoo authorities and the government of Assam that if they do not comply with the demand they have to “face consequences”.Suklabaidya asked people to not create an uproar over the issue.

14-10-2020||India||India demolishes China’s new excuse for Ladakh stand-off in 3 points||India has rejected Chinese contention that its border infrastructure upgrade along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) is the crux of on-going military tensions, saying the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has already built and continues to construct roads and communication network on its side of the border.“First, the bridges inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday are away from the LAC and would facilitate civilian movement and access apart from military logistics. Second, China has never raised the issue of India’s infra upgrade at the on-going military-diplomatic talks. Third, what about the road, bridges, optical fibres, solar-heated huts and missile deployments of the PLA close to the LAC. India is only building infra on its side of the LAC and for that we do not need Chinese permission,” said a senior official.Also Read: India building border infra, deploying military root cause of tension: ChinaAccording to military commanders, the PLA has drawn optical fibre for secure communication at contested Gogra-Hot Springs, used heavy-lift cranes to drop solar heated containers as accommodation for forward troops on north bank of Pangong Tso and have built a hospital in the depth area to cater to high-altitude sickness and medical problems associated with rarefied atmosphere. Also Watch | Ladakh: China provokes day after LAC meet as India exposes Pak joint ‘mission’However, according to China watchers, the reason why PLA is concerned about Indian infrastructure upgrade in Ladakh is that it could pose a military threat to the multi-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, to Pakistan that passes via Khunjerab Pass and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. It is understood that the Chinese have conveyed their concerns over CPEC to its all-weather ally Pakistan as India has very strongly objected to Beijing exploiting the ecologically sensitive Gilgit-Baltistan area and PoK.Also Read: China doubled its air bases, air defences and heliports near LAC in three yearsThe increased Indian military capacity and capability on the LAC also prevents the PLA from nibbling into East Ladakh in pursuance of its maximalist 1959 cartographical claim line.The fact is that in 1976, the China Study Group headed by the then Cabinet Secretary had defined 65 patrolling points as limits for Indian Army on the Ladakh LAC. As these patrolling points were well within Indian perception of LAC, the PLA through tremendous border upgrades tried to turn these limits as Indian border. This was pointed out to the UPA regime by former foreign secretary Shyam Saran when, as the National Security Advisory Board chairman, he advocated that Indian troops must patrol up to at least the limits defined by CSG.Over the years, China has pressurised India not only on the border but has also been condescending enough to ask New Delhi to maintain its non-aligned position and not get close to the United States. Beijing, on its part, believes that it belongs to a different league and has blocked India from becoming a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), UN Security Council and even helped Pakistan to unsuccessfully try to get Indian engineers involved in Afghan reconstruction as global terrorists under 1267 UNSC resolution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-scoffs-at-china-s-new-excuse-for-ladakh-stand-off-cites-3-reasons/story-nxF7hqdlgxZ6xmwEknJJHL.html
14-10-2020||India||Lake sediment study gives clues to glacier health and Indus valley civilisation||The westerlies play a bigger role than the Indian monsoon in controlling rain, snow and glacier health in the Western Himalayas, a new study has found.A team of scientists from the School of Environmental Sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have analysed lake sediments from Chandratal lake in Himachal Pradesh to understand what has been determining glacial retreat, or in some cases glacial advance, in the western Himalayas.The results, published in Nature journal last month, indicate that summer monsoon dominated precipitation 21% of the time, whereas the mid-latitude westerlies dominated precipitation 79% of the time and hence have been the main source of moisture during the last 1,100 years.Also Read: AQI enters red zone, all eyes on farm firesGlaciers are vulnerable to the impact of climate change, which can lead to several changes in water availability in the region. Understanding past moisture source for rain and snowfall over the Himalayan glaciers can also help understand how climate change will impact them in the future, authors of the study said.Normally, studies on a glacier’s life cycle are conducted based on ice cores. “Obtaining ice core from the region is difficult and where it has been obtained it hasn’t given much information. So we have retrieved sediments from Chandratal to understand what may have happened. We know now that the monsoon impact has weakened and it’s not bringing as much rain in the northwestern region as it used to be . Climate change has also impacted the westerlies or western disturbances with more cases of extremely heavy rain or snow being recorded. Such changes will impact moisture availability and hence could affect the glacier dynamics and its retreat ,” explained AL Ramanathan, professor, JNU.India Meteorological Department (IMD) defines western disturbances as a cyclonic circulation/trough in the mid and lower tropospheric levels or as a low-pressure area which occurs in middle latitude westerlies and originates over the Mediterranean Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea and moves eastwards across north India.Also Read: Climate change spurs doubling of disasters since 2000: UNA ministry of earth sciences (MoES) report released last year titled Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region suggested that there is a significant rising trend in western disturbances and rain extremes. But rain extremes don’t necessarily mean availability of more water or ice, Ramanathan said, as they are not evenly distributed.Ramanathan said the sediment core records from Chandratal are a very useful tool for archaeologists and paleoclimatologists who are studying the fall of the Harappan civilisation. Some scientists believe that the Harappan civilisation fell due to drying of rivers. “Reconstruction of the dynamics of moisture source changes during the Holocene is of great importance to get an insight into societal development (e.g Indus civilisation) and future climate changes,” he added.“We haven’t conducted any studies on moisture sources but there is a general understanding that the westerlies could have more influence and this study quantifies that. It is difficult to say how the changing pattern of western disturbances will impact glacier health because there may not be a change in precipitation but timing of snowfall or rain is most important. If that changes we can see greater retreat of glaciers,” said Anil Kulkarni, Distinguished Scientist, Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lake-sediment-study-gives-clues-to-glacier-health-and-indus-valley-civilisation/story-B1VPPQy3SXuxEESHsZoBlL.html

14-10-2020||India||Ayush ministry launches raw drug repository for medicinal plant cultivation||Ayush (Ayurveda Yoga and Naturopathy Unani Sidda Homoeopathy) minister Shripad Yesso Naik has inaugurated the Regional Raw Drug Repository (RRDR) for Ayush systems of medicine at the National Institute of Siddha in Tamil Nadu.According to ministry officials, the repository will play an important role in medicinal plant cultivation. As a step in this direction, the ministry of Ayush, through the National Medicinal Plants Board, initiated the establishment of the National Raw Drug Repository and Regional Raw Drug repositories. NMPB has identified National Institute of Siddha as the lead Institute with the Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Chennai, and the Siddha Central Research Institute, Chennai, as collaborating institutes. Also Read: Government body claims cow dung chip reduces radiation from mobile handsetsThis RRDR would play a role in collection, documentation, and authentication of raw drugs collected from the agro-climatic region, that is, the Southern Plateau Region, according to a statement from the Ayush ministry.“We in India are fortunate to have systems of medicine which date back more than 3,000 years and have deep-rooted societal acceptance. Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and systems of medicine are accessible to a large segment of our population, including those living in remote and interior areas. Medicinal plants form the major resource base of our indigenous health care traditions. Their relevance has grown substantially in the current pandemic scenario, thanks to their disease preventive effects,” the Ayush ministry statement read.“Though most of our raw drugs are commonly available, there is a lack of scientific documentation which makes research on these medicines very difficult. This also reduces the chances of commercial exploitation of these medicines. Easy availability of authentic scientific date of the raw drugs will promote the research on the medicines belonging to Ayush system which will lead to further propagation of these systems,” the statement further read.The country has more than 9,000 manufacturing units for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy medicine.Also Read: ‘Ayurveda has holistic approach’: Harsh Vardhan on Ayush-based Covid-19 treatmentHowever, the quality of medicines produced by these units critically depends upon the manufacturing process followed as well as the quality of raw material. The government has made it mandatory for all manufacturing units to adhere to the Good Manufacturing Practices as notified under Schedule T of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940.However, since over 90% of the formulations under these systems of medicine are plant-based, it is critical to ensure the sustained availability of quality raw material.“This RRDR will not only act as collection centre of raw drugs available and used in the southern region but also as an accredited reference library for the authentication of raw drugs and establish standard protocols and keys for authentication of raw drug used in the herbal industries,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayush-ministry-launches-raw-drug-repository-for-quality-medicinal-plant-cultivation/story-j2jy3sGM6P5q0lmhg4V2BJ.html

During my time in detention, the black decision of the black day in August 2019 continued to attack my heart,” Mufti said in the audio clip posted with a black plaque.“I feel this must have been the condition of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. None of us can forget the insult of that day. Now we will have to decide that whatever the Delhi Durbar took away from us through illegal means on August 5 last year, we will have to get it back,” she further said in the clip.“We will have to continue our struggle for the Kashmir issue for which thousands of our people have laid their lives. I know the way ahead is not easy, but our resolve will help us tread the path,” Mufti added. After being released from fourteen long months of illegal detention, a small message for my people. pic.twitter.com/gIfrf82ThwShe was put under detention on August 5 last year along with National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and other leaders following the abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. While Abdullah was released in March this year, Mufti continued to be under detention after Public Safety Act (PSA) was extended.She was finally released on Tuesday after the administration revoked the PSA charges against her.The PDP chief’s release comes ahead of the expiry of the deadline set by Supreme Court, which had been approached by her daughter Iltija Mufti with a habeas corpus petition challenging her “illegal” detention.

She was rushed to a hospital in Aligarh, but shifted to Delhi for want of better medical care.The woman succumbed to her injuries in hospital days later.The incident triggered protests across the country, and the Allahabad high court had taken suo motu cognizance of it. It held a hearing on Monday where it lashed out at the police and district administration for cremating the woman’s body at night.The court said that the act was an “infringement” of her human rights, adding that the victim was at least entitled to decent cremation in accordance with her religious customs and rituals which essentially are to be performed by her family.The state government, meanwhile, recommended the probe to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The request was accepted by the Union home ministry and CBI took over the investigation.On Tuesday, a team of the agency visited the spot in Hathras where the victim of the alleged gang-rape was cremated on September 30. Samples were collected from the spot as a part of the agency’s ongoing investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-year-old-allegedly-raped-in-hathras-month-after-gang-rape-of-dalit-woman/story-9ffdbZv6MkBCdnHBNoVIcP.html
14-10-2020||India||Why Assam is shutting down madrassas, Sanskrit schools||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Assam and state education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that a notification regarding shutting down of all state-run madrassas will be issued in November. Around 100 Sanskrit tols will also be shut down in the state, he added.“All State-run madrassas will be converted into regular schools or in certain cases teachers will be transferred to state-run schools and madrassas will be shut down. A notification will be released in November,” he said.Madrassas are educational institutions where the Quran and the Islamic sacred law is taught along with mathematics, grammar, poetry and history. According to a report published on the academic and research website The Conversation, the Indian government reports that 4 percent of Muslim students attend madrassas in the country full-time.In BJP-led Assam government’s bid not to spend money on religious institutions, it has taken the decision to convert madrassas into regular schools or transfer their teachers to other schools and shut them down.“In my opinion, teaching of Quran can’t happen at the cost of government money. If we have to do so then we should also teach both the Bible and Bhagavad Gita. So, we want to bring uniformity and stop this practice,” the minister told news agency ANI.There are 614 recognised madrassas in Assam, according to State Madrassa Education Board (SMEB). As many as 400 out of these are high madrassas,112 are junior high madrassas and the remaining 102 are senior madrassas, the SMEB website said.Out of total recognized madrassas, 57 are for girls, 3 are for boys and 554 are co-educational.Seventeen madrassas are running under Urdu medium, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-assam-is-shutting-down-madrassas-sanskrit-schools/story-fln6pZWuRcea4Bm5uCVALJ.html
14-10-2020||India||Law student goes back on rape charge against Chinmayanand in court||The woman law student who had accused former Union minister Chinmayanand of sexually exploiting her disowned statement before a special MP-MLA court in Lucknow on Tuesday.The LLM student categorically denied that she had levelled any allegation against the former Union minister as the prosecution had charged.Angered at this, the prosecution immediately moved an application under Section 340 of the CrPC, seeking action against her for perjury.Judge P K Rai directed his office to register the application and asked the prosecution to furnish a copy of the application to the victim and the accused.The court fixed October 15 for hearing on the application.The Allahabad High Court in February this year granted bail to Chinmayanand, whose trust runs the Shahjahanpur law college where the woman studied.He was lodged in the jail following a case filed against him by the law student and was arrested in September last year.The case was registered under Section 376-C of the IPC, an offence pertaining to the abuse of one’s position by a person in authority to “induce or seduce” a woman under his charge to have “sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape”.Chinmayanand (72) also faced charges under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 354-D (stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/student-goes-back-on-rape-charge-in-court/story-JQAdFGdUHqQqWfgknWZ37J.html
14-10-2020||India||India, China agree to continue talks to resolve border tension||India and China have agreed to continue their dialogue to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for early disengagement in the eastern Ladakh theatre, the two sides said in a joint press statement on Tuesday, a day after the seventh round of talks between senior military commanders at Chushul.The two sides said they had a better understanding of each other’s position in the sensitive sector after the latest round of talks, even as the border row is in its sixth month and efforts to disengage and de-escalate have made no breakthrough. The talks on Monday lasted more than 12 hours.“The two sides had a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the western Sector of India-China border areas. They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,” said the statement.India and China have deployed more than 50,000 soldiers each along with advanced weapons and systems in the eastern Ladakh theatre. Even as talks at military and diplomatic levels are on, the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army have made preparations for a long haul in the sector.The statement said both sides “agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels” to resolve the border row.“Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas,” the statement added.Monday’s talks took place weeks after China hardened its position and asserted that it recognises the 1959 LAC, which has never been accepted by India. China’s hardened stance has dimmed hopes for an early resolution of the border row.This was the last round of military talks to be led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, who on Tuesday handed over the charge of the Leh-based 14 Corps to Lieutenant General PGK Menon. In his farewell message, Singh conveyed his gratitude and appreciation to all ranks of the ‘Fire & Fury Corps’ for their professionalism and steadfast dedication in the most hostile terrain, weather and altitude challenges faced by any army in the world, an army spokesperson said.Menon asked the men under his command to discharge their duties with the same commitment and zeal, and always be prepared to deal with any threat to national security, the spokesperson said.The sixth round of military talks was held on September 21 when Indian negotiators firmly demanded comprehensive disengagement in all friction areas and restoration of status quo ante of early April as the only approach towards de-escalation. On the other hand, China asked India to withdraw its soldiers from strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso to reduce friction.Former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd) said India was negotiating with the Chinese from a position of strength after occupying heights of operational importance on the southern bank of Pangong Tso and there was no need to hurry things up. “It’s a game of patience now. With the heights under our control, we have greater leverage to resolve the row in a way that is advantageous for us,” Bhatia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-agree-to-continue-talks-to-resolve-border-tension/story-XfmUqDSjT0cCWE4VCisdSN.html
14-10-2020||India||Tanishq drops ad after online trolling||Titan Limited-owned jewellery brand Tanishq removed its new campaign ‘Ekatvam’ (Oneness) from all media platforms, a day after being viciously trolled on Twitter for “glorifying” love jihad. The 45-second ad featured a Muslim family celebrating a baby shower ceremony for pregnant daughter-in-law.In a statement, the company said: “This film has stimulated divergent & severe reactions, contrary to its very objective. We’re deeply saddened with inadvertent stirring of emotions & withdraw this film keeping in mind hurt sentiments & well being of our employees.”Those who slammed the ad released on 9 October said it glorified love jihad, a term coined by Hindu extremist groups to refer to an alleged campaign by Muslims to convert Hindu girls in the guise of love.The brand was also criticised for promoting fake secular sentiment while hurting the feelings of a particular religious community.People tweeted with the hashtag #BoycottTanishq calling for a ban on the advertisement and a boycott of the jewellery brand.A section of Twitter users also supported Tanishq, lauding its effort to highlight the beauty of interfaith marriages and upholding the true idea of India. Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted that “If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world -- India?” From attacking stereotypes to celebrating the spirit of emancipated young Indian woman, Tanishq advertising has always been progressive and bold. Advertising experts believe the new campaign is line with the brand’s core method of communicating with consumers.The ad has depicted a confluence of two religions using a family ‘godh bharai’ or baby shower as a backdrop, according to Sambit Mohanty, creative head (south), McCann Worldgroup India. The adverse reaction is unwarranted as the ad does not show anything harmful or insidious, he said.“Rather, it portrays a picture of harmony, love and genuine affection, which is the idea of India. That said, religion is an extremely touchy topic these days and brands usually stay away from such narratives. Though it isn’t wrong, it’s very bold of Tanishq to have tried something like this.”There is not one thing that is wrong in the campaign, said Naresh Gupta, co-founder and chief strategy officer, Bang In The Middle. The whole play of relationship is perfectly well-crafted. “It’s sad that Tanishq bowed down to a few trolls and bigots. For me, it’s one of the best ads of 2020,” he noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tanishq-drops-ad-after-online-trolling/story-tWaPU97mi79lWfl3XjZ85O.html

Citing a 2016 SC case, Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay versus Union of India and another, which pertained to the creation of special courts to fast track cases against MPs and MLAs, the ACMM said special courts including his own were designated for trial of cases against MP/MLAs. “As the pre-sent matter is not filed against MP/MLA, hence, cannot be tried by this court and needs to be transferred to the Competent Court of Jurisdiction,” it said.Directing that the complete file of the Akbar versus Ramani case be sent to the principal district and sessions judge, the ACMM said that “further appropriate orders” could be expected on Wednesday. Akbar filed a defamation suit in 2018 after Ramani made an allegation of sexual misconduct against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mj-akbar-versus-priya-ramani-case-shifted-to-district-and-sessions-court/story-9mKB0GTI2xuGzP3PGfRcaL.html
14-10-2020||India||Paddy purchase up, other crops sell below MSP||The government has bought over 4 million tonnes of paddy from nearly 350,000 farmers, who have been paid minimum support price (MSP) of ₹8,032 crore until October 11 since procurement of crops began on September 24. The quantity procured so far is 33% higher than the corresponding period last year, according to data cited by the farm ministry.While the procurement of the kharif (monsoon crop) staple is continuing robustly, farmers in Punjab and Haryana continue to protest against a set of laws enacted by Parliament to deregulate agricultural markets, which they fear will weaken the MSP system, whereby farm produce is bought by the government at assured prices.The Centre would also procure pulses, oilseeds and copra at MSP beyond the quantity approved so far from any state where the market rate falls below MSP under its price support scheme, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on Monday.Despite this, several summer-sown crops, such as soybean and maize, are selling below minimum prices set by the government because the government procures too little of non-cereals.The government “continues to procure kharif 2020-21 crops at its MSP from farmers as per its existing MSP schemes” and procurement is “going on smoothly”, the farm ministry statement said, pointing to the higher procurement trend.Until October 11, the government through its food agencies has additionally procured 606.56 tonnes of two pulses — moong and urad — with an MSP value of ₹4.36 croreThe government has also approved requests from 10 states to procure 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds. These states are Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.The government has also sanctioned procurement of 100,000 tonnes of copra, a perennial crop, from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.Crops such as soybean, ragi, maize and cotton, are selling up to 30% below MSPs, data from Agmarknet, the agriculture ministry’s portal that tracks prices in mandis or wholesale markets, shows.Poor returns from crops have been a lingering problem for farmers, especially during episodes of gluts, such as now. MSPs, which are fixed at 50% over cost for nearly two dozen crops, don’t necessarily lead to higher farm incomes as the government’s procurement at MSP rates is largely restricted to wheat and rice. For most other crops, farmers are mostly price takers, meaning they are forced to accept whatever the markets dictate.“Nudging the private sector towards triggering a market-clearing price that is closer or equal to MSP will depend on the extent of government’s procurement,” economist Abhijit Sen said.For commodities such as pulses and oilseeds, the government’s procurement is insufficient to improve market rates. For instance, the nearly 3.7 million tonnes of pulses and oilseeds they government has approved for procurement at MSP is less than 15% of the total production -- too small a quantity to make a difference in prices offered by private entities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-purchase-up-other-crops-sell-below-msp/story-N8TGqQ0DmXiyAWZhPDj7vN.html

Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog chairman Vallabhbhai Kathiria showcased the chip while launching “Kamdhenu Deepawali Abhiyan”, a campaign to promote cow dung products.“Cow dung is anti-radiation. If you bring this home and place it in (on) your phone, it (the phone) will become radiation-free,” Kathiria said, showcasing the product at a press conference on Monday.The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog is a body under the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, set up by the Narendra Modi government for “conservation, protection and development of cows and their progeny”, according to its website. Kathiria said the chips are not certified by any scientific body but have been tested in laboratories. “You can test its effectiveness in any laboratory and even in colleges,” he said. Over 500 ‘gaushalas’, or cow shelters, are making these chips, he said.Scientists say that rigorous scientific tests, including peer review, would be necessary to demonstrate qualities like radiation absorption capacity of cow-dung. “I don’t know anything about this, but any claim needs to pass rigourous scientific tests based on facts, whether it is a cow-dung chip or a corona vaccine,” said Samir Brahmachari, a biophysicist and former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.The cow is revered by many Hindus, and some believe its by-products, such as urine, promotes health and well-being. Some uses of cow dung have been scientifically proven.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-body-says-cow-dung-can-curb-radiation/story-9ct9gwY6jNv6k4jCd4fVVO.html

Results are expected by November or early December,” said Paul.The Union government, meanwhile, is making arrangements for procurement, storage and distribution of the vaccine, as and when it is ready for use.“We have a main expert committee for vaccines, and there are also multiple sub-committees that have been formed to look at various aspects and stages of vaccine procurement and distribution. They are currently into mapping cold storage facilities both in the government and private sector,” said Rajesh Bhushan, health secretary, Government of India.While three vaccine candidates are in advance stages of testing in India, according to the department of biotechnology and department of science and technology, at least 30 vaccine candidates have been supported by the government that are currently in different stages of development.Responding to a question on extending financial support to vaccine manufacturers, Bhushan said through the department of biotechnology, the government is providing direct financial assistance to designated vaccine manufacturers to assist in research and development activities, which currently include pre-clinical trials, and in the future, may be extended for clinical trials also.Experts, however, stressed that social factors such as hand hygiene and wearing masks will remain crucial even if a vaccine is mass produced.“While it is good to have a vaccine but we must realise that no vaccine has 100% efficacy, especially the ones meant to prevent from respiratory illnesses. The flu vaccine that is available currently is also has the efficacy of about 50%, which is why it is important to observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour such as wearing a mask, maintaining hand hygiene and observing physical distancing,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-phase-2-vaccine-trial-results-by-early-nov/story-1kHNln1z8yJ6wDgtXdP0zK.html

The stall is protected from the sun by an awning of canvas, the surface of which is speckled with shadows of tree leaves. Parvati shows the sight through the phone screen that connects her to this reporter via WhatsApp video.Everyday Parvati gets up at 5am. “So does my husband,” she notes. They live nearby, in what she calls a jhuggi. “We built it together... it has a roof of cement and walls of brick.” It is a single room dwelling. “We have a TV, a cooler, but we don’t have a bed... we spend money wisely.” At night the couple sleeps on a dhurrie they spread out on the floor. “Sometimes, during the rains, snakes enter.”Parvati is not scared of them; her village in West Bengal’s Murshidabad is thickly green and snakes are common there. Her husband grew up in the same village “and I remember we used to play together as children... but our marriage was arranged by our parents.”The couple raised their four daughters in Gurugram. Since the time the last of them left the nest, Parvati does all the cooking by herself. “While I prepare lunch in the morning, my husband goes out to get chai and fen from a stall… That’s our breakfast.”They open their stall at 8am. Parvati sits by the counter, often listening to songs on the radio, “or I think of my daughters... they all are married and live with their families in Bengal.”Parvati and her husband set aside ₹40,000 for visiting their daughters last April. “We hadn’t met the girls for more than a year... but coronavirus arrived, trains stopped running and we finished half of that amount during the lockdown, while out of business.” The other crisis that followed was the loss of the mobile phone “without which it was impossible to talk to children.” They had to spend another ₹5,000 on getting a new phone.The tea stall reopened after the lockdown and “we manage to save about ₹300 everyday.”They shut down the stall by 5pm. At home, while her husband watches serials on TV, Parvati cooks dinner. “We are Bengalis, we daily eat fish and rice (she laughs), except for Tuesday when we have only (vegetarian) subzi.”Lights are switched off by 10pm. “I’ve grown old, but I continue to have dreams,” confesses Parvati. “I want my husband to remain healthy and I want to visit our daughters as soon as coronavirus gets over and all trains start to run.”She now poses for a portrait, with her husband holding the mobile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-dreams-of-a-tea-stall-lady/story-zdCm8OXA0CN66AnhLJcvGJ.html
14-10-2020||India||Hathras case: Not satisfied with govt version on cremation, says high court||Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to forcibly cremate a Dalit gang rape victim in the middle of the night was a violation of human rights and reasons given by the Hathras district administration to deny her family a chance to conduct her last rites were not satisfactory, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has said.The observation was part of an order — made public on Tuesday — by the division bench of justices Pankaj Mithal and Rajan Roy who recorded statements of the victim’s family and government officials on Monday. In the order, the judges said district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar could not satisfy them about the observance of last rites. The 19-year-old Dalit woman was cremated against her family’s wishes at 2.30am on September 30. “We do not at this stage find any good reason on behalf of the administration (Hathras) as to why they could not hand over the body to the family members for some time, say for even half an hour, to enable them to perform their rituals at home and thereafter to cremate it either in the night or next day,” said the court. The judges said they will focus on two things: Possible violation of rights of the victim and her family, and larger issues involved in the context of such rights. “This action of the state authorities, though in the name of law and order situation, is prima facie an infringement upon the human rights of the victim and her family,” the court observed. The court also found the decision to cremate the victim was taken at the local level.Human rights In the order, the court focused on the rights of last rites and traditional rituals accorded to the kin of the deceased. “Sensitivities of the people, which the Constitution recognizes as fundamental rights such as a right to decent burial/cremation as per traditions and customs followed by the family, have to be respected,” said the court. ‘Ganga jal’ In court, the mother of the victim broke down while saying she was not allowed to see her daughter’s face. The victim’s brother and aunt said the authorities acted in a high-handed manner. Laxkar said an effort was made to give the incident a political colour and the cremation was done at night for law-and-order considerations. He claimed the victim’s father consented to the cremation and it was done with full honour. “A proper pyre was laid. In the cremation, the kerosene was not used and probably, the cans which may be appearing in some of the videos were those carrying Ganges Water (Ganga Jal),” he told the court, as per the order.Rape chargeThe court also took up the controversy surrounding the gang rape of the victim. Additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar and others had cited the forensic report — which found no presence of semen — to deny that the victim was raped.The court asked Kumar if it was proper for anyone not directly connected with the investigation to comment on any evidence relating to the offence. “We also asked him as to whether he was aware of the amendments in law relating to definition of rape w.e.f 2013 and that mere absence of semen during forensic examination, though a factor for consideration, would not by itself be conclusive as to whether rape had been committed or not, if there are other admissible evidence. He said that he was aware of the same,” the order said.Transfer of officialsAwanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), told the court that the state made no effort to hush the incident up and was willing to cooperate. But the court took note of suspension of Vikrant Vir, who was Hathras superintendent of police. The judges asked Awasthi why only Vir was suspended while the district magistrate — who ordered the cremation — was allowed to continue. “He could not give any satisfactory reply in this regard, as to why the two officers had been treated differently. We then asked him as to whether, it is proper and/or fair to allow the district magistrate to continue at Hathras in the facts of the present case specially as the investigation and these proceedings relating to the very incident in which he had a role to play, are pending. Sri Awasthi stated that the Government will look into this aspect of the matter and take a decision,” the order read.The court has summoned Vir for the next hearing.Interim order In its order, the court directed the following: ask Awasthi to come out with a draft policy so that proper guidelines may be laid to avoid incidents of this kind in future, ensure the safety and security of the victim’s kin, inquiry or investigation be kept confidential, bar any officer not directly connected with the investigation from making any statement in public, and request the media and political parties to not disturb social harmony or infringe upon the rights of the victim’s family and that of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-not-satisfied-with-govt-version-on-cremation-says-high-court/story-ZcqLGecc4rX2L9PPeQpMLN.html
14-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Johnson & Johnson has paused the trial of its vaccine candidate for the coronavirus after an unexplained illness in one of the participants, although it wasn’t immediately clear whether the person was part of the test (or experimental group) which receives the shot, or the control group which doesn’t (people in this group usually receive a placebo).The news was broken by Stat News, which also broke the news of the pause in the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine trial back in September.What now?The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent panel comprising at least three external experts who have no financial links with either the study or the company conducting it — it is considered good practice to, apart from medical experts, have someone who specialises in the ethics of medical trials, and a person who understands data, as part of this board — will now have to look at the case, and decide what to do next. In any trial, the DSMB is responsible for the safety of participants.Stat News, citing J&J, made the distinction between a pause and a hold. “J&J emphasised... the difference between a study pause and a clinical hold, which is a formal regulatory action that can last much longer. The vaccine study is not currently under a clinical hold. J&J said that while it normally communicates clinical holds to the public, it does not usually inform the public of study pauses.”The AstraZeneca study restarted a few days after it was paused.Such pauses, and even holds, are common in the vaccine development process. But this isn’t just any ordinary vaccine. It is a vaccine for the coronavirus disease, which has infected 38 million and killed almost 1.1 million people around the world since the beginning of the year. There are 8.35 million active cases of Covid-19 as this column is being written, and at the current fatality rate of closed cases, at least 300,000 of them can be expected to succumb to the viral disease. All of this has made the process of finding a vaccine for Covid-19 a very public one, with unprecedented attention being paid to every small development. Most newsrooms, including Hindustan Times, have a vaccine tracker (both – a piece of content, and a very real person keeping an eye on all vaccines). HT’s for instance, shows that there are 29 vaccine candidates in early or Phase 1 trials, another 14 in Phase 2 trials, and 11 in large Phase 3 trials. It also shows that five have been approved for emergency, limited, or early use. The J&J vaccine was in a Phase 3 trial involving 60,000 participants.Interestingly, most companies, including J&J, have released to the public extensive details of their clinical testing protocol — another unprecedented move in the history of vaccine development. J&J is also one of nine companies whose CEOs have signed a pledge to ensure they will “uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals” — a promise that came amidst fears that the political establishment in several countries could arm-twist companies into rushing vaccines into the market or for regulatory approval before their safety was established beyond doubt (and in vaccines, safety is even more important than efficacy).J&J was matter-of-fact about the pause, as it should be. “Adverse effects — illnesses, accidents, etc — even those that are serious, are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” it said in a statement. It is likely that the company will release more information about the patient’s illness over the next few days.J&J’s is a so-called vector vaccine, which means it uses a viral vector — in its case a modified virus that causes cold — to carry genetic material from Sars-CoV-2 into the human body so as to engineer an immune response. The company’s vaccine candidate seemed to have an edge over others — the viral vector being used is the same used in the company’s already approved Ebola vaccine — and also came with some advantages over the others: it needs refrigeration, not freezing; and it is a single-shot vaccine unlike many of the other candidates which are double shots.Still, the pause is a good sign — it means that due process is being followed. As it should be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-FohVo4BTe9faOWAmL5jXaJ.html
14-10-2020||India||Mehbooba Mufti released after 14 months in detention||Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti was released on Tuesday, more than 14 months after being detained along with several other top leaders of the state hours ahead of the Centre’s move to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in 2019.Mufti, who became the first woman chief minister of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2016, was detained along with other former CMs Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah and other regional leaders as the Centre moved to bifurcate the state into two Union Territories and effectively scrap Article 370 on August 5.“After more than a year of detention, our party president Mehbooba Mufti released today,” said Najmu Saqib, PDP spokesperson. J&K government spokesperson Rohit Kansal earlier announced the decision about the release on Twitter. Mufti’s party said that she was likely to address a press conference on Friday. The deputy commissioner ordered that Public Safety Act charges against her be revoked with immediate effect. Her detention period was extended for a period of three months on July 31 this year.The former CM was first detained from her official residence and lodged at Cheshmashahi huts. She was moved to a government building close to the MLA hostel, where other detainees were held, in November. In April this year, she was shifted to her official residence at Fairview on Gupkar Road.Mufti’s release came two weeks after the Supreme Court asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration if the former chief minister’s detention under PSA can be extended beyond a year and, if so, “how long do you propose to extend it?” The bench fixed the next date of hearing on Thursday. Iltija Mufti, Mehbooba Mufti’s daughter who has been handling her mother’s Twitter handle since the detention, expressed her gratitude to those who supported her. “As Ms Mufti’s illegal detention finally comes to an end, Id like to thank everybody who supported me in these tough times. I owe a debt of gratitude to you all. This is Iltija signing off. May allah protect you,” she wrote.Iltija Mufti moved the Supreme Court in September, seeking to modify her petition challenging her mother’s continued detention under the Public Safety Act (PSA from February 5 and two subsequent extensions).Mufti was initially put under preventive detention under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and then just before her detention was to expire in February 2020, the government invoked the Public Safety Act on February 5. This law empowers authorities to hold any person from three months to two years without any trial.The administration extended her detention by three months on July 31, 2020, even as it released People’s Conference chief Sajjad Gani Lone.Nearly all of Kashmir’s mainstream political leaders were detained hours before the central government nullified Article 370 of the Constitution, which accorded special status to the region, and bifurcated the state into two Union Territories – Jammu and Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without one.Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, two other former chief ministers, were released on March 13 and March 24, 2020 respectively after their detentions. Mufti’s released on Tuesday was widely welcomed.“I’m pleased to hear that MehboobaMufti Sahiba has been released after more than a year in detention. Her continued detention was a travesty & was against the basic tenets of democracy. Welcome out Mehbooba,” NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said on Twitter.Peoples’ Conference chairman Sajad Lone said: “MehboobaMufti has apparently been released. Great news. She has been through a very tough time. Wishing her all the best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-released-after-14-months-in-detention/story-Ht1GSTCOnlUQ7EGy7CBX2L.html
14-10-2020||India||AQI enters red zone, all eyes on farm fires||Delhi residents woke up to a hazy Tuesday morning as the air quality index (AQI) slipped to “very poor” for the first time this season amid increased farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and local factors such as low wind speed and accumulating pollutants, sparking widespread calls for pre-emptive measures against a crisis that has become routine as winter approaches.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) recordings, Delhi’s average 24-hour air quality index (AQI) at 4pm settled at 300 — in the “poor” zone. However, until 2pm, the hourly AQI average was well above 300. An AQI between 0 and 50 is classified “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. Nasa’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana. Experts said relief is not on the horizon and the situation will likely become worse in the coming days.“In Delhi, the development of strong surface level inversion and sudden local calm surface wind conditions led to a low ventilation coefficient and accumulation of pollutants near the surface… AQI is likely in the very poor to poor category for the next two days. An increase in stubble burning fires observed yesterday around Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions with SAFAR synergized fire count estimated as 675 on 12th October but, the transport wind direction is not favourable and hence only marginal stubble contribution in PM2.5 is expected,” the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said. This means that the wind speeds were not strong enough to facilitate the dispersion of pollution particles accumulated near the surface, leading to a spike in levels. On Tuesday, the prominent pollutant in most of the monitoring stations in Delhi was PM10 (particulate matter with diameter lower than 10 micrometres), which is primarily dust.At 7am, Delhi’s hourly average AQI was 298, and it progressively slipped to reach 306 at 10am and then deteriorated further to reach 318 by noon. At 5pm, several stations such as Shadipur, ITO, Mathura Road, Pusa, Nehru Nagar, Dwarka Sector-8, Ashok Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Rohini, Mundka and Bawana continued to remain in the red zone. The average PM10 level rose from 252ug/m3 at 7am to 300ug/m3 at 1pm, before it finally started reducing marginally to reach 293.2ug/m3 at 5pm.As pollution levels rose, both the chief minister and deputy chief minister spoke up about the issue of stubble burning, which has been a political flashpoint between Delhi and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana.CM Arvind Kejriwal said state governments should stop blaming each other and work together to find a solution to the issue of stubble burning. He said that while farmers of neighbouring states and people of Delhi were bearing the brunt of stubble burning, “governments have shut their eyes”. “State governments should stop blaming each other. We have to work together to find a solution to the issue… All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now,” he told reporters in Hiranki village in Narela, where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday. The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and, therefore, can result in the reduction of stubble burning.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, meanwhile, appealed to the Centre to play a “crucial role” in controlling pollution in north India and curb stubble burning.The period between mid-October and Diwali is considered critical in the battle against air pollution because while smoke from farm fires in nearby states drifts into the National Capital Region, the use of firecrackers on the day of the festival exacerbates the micropollutants. The air also becomes still and heavy with the weather turning cold, creating a toxic mix in an environment already polluted by emissions from vehicles, road and construction dust, and industrial emissions.Pollution levels usually remain in the severe category in this period, with the AQI varying between 300 and 500. The level of PM2.5 and PM10 particles reaches at least five to six times above the safe limits of 60μg/m3 and 100μg/m3. PM2.5 are ultrafine particles which stick deep inside the lungs and take the heaviest toll on human health.“Pollution, especially the smoke from stubble burning, is not Delhi’s problem alone. It is an issue that is affecting entire north India. We (Delhi government) have been working throughout the year to control pollution levels in Delhi but unfortunately, the central government did not do anything to resolve the issue of farm fires. They sat idly for the entire year,” Sisodia said. “We say it again and again that it is not just Delhi which is affected by pollution but whole of north India,” he said. “Pollution plus corona has become lethal for people. Pollution, especially that related to stubble burning, is not an issue for Delhi alone, it is for entire north India,” Sisodia said.He also took a dig at the pollution monitoring body, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, or Epca, accusing them of not overseeing the coordinating among other states to control the farm fires.Following Sisodia’s remark, a spokesperson of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said: “Central government believes in working to end pollution. The central government has taken various anti-air pollution initiatives in the last six years. To control stubble burning, machines for stubble cutting worth ₹1,400 crore has been provided to Punjab and Haryana farmers, which has resulted in a reduction of about 15% and 20% pollution from stubble burning, respectively.” Bhure Lal, Epca chairperson, said that the monitoring body has been in touch with the state governments of Punjab and Haryana for nearly a month since the first signs of early burnings were spotted through satellite imagery. A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that Delhi on Tuesday received easterly winds with a speed of 6-8kmph. “Around afternoon, for some time, the wind speed improved a little because of which the air quality managed to remain in the poor zone and not slip to the very poor zone. The situation will be similar on Wednesday and Thursday; there is no significant improvement. From October 16, we are expecting that the air quality will start improving,” the scientist said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) at the Centre for Science and Environment, said that this is the third year of Delhi with the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which states clearly the role of all agencies when the pollution levels start deteriorating. “The action taken by the agencies round the year will now determine the winter pollution levels. The action taken now is only going to be like firefighting. The emergency action at this time of the year will not give us very visible results. Delhi has done quite a lot but a lot more needs to be done,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aqi-enters-red-zone-all-eyes-on-farm-fires/story-Bq7zpyORHUvA80qKCuoRhK.html
14-10-2020||India||Door still open for states, says govt on GST dues row||The Union government is willing to engage with dissenting states that have not accepted either of the options offered to make up for the gap in GST compensation, a top finance ministry functionary said on a day the Centre permitted 20 states to borrow ₹68,825 crore from the market to bridge the shortfall, and the finance ministers of some of the dissenting states indicated that they would go to the Supreme Court or demand an independent dispute resolution mechanism.The finance ministry functionary, who asked not to be named, added that while the government will discuss any workable proposal the nine states bring at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council with an open mind, it cannot stop 22 other states from borrowing from the market against their future compensation cess dues. Maharashtra has already secured the Union finance ministry’s approval for a loan of ₹15,394 crore. Thus far, including Maharashtra, 20 states have been granted clearance to borrow, an official statement said. Two more of the dissenting states have also indicated their willingness to borrow, a finance ministry official with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity. But Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said the Centre cannot postpone the payment of compensation indefinitely, and should take the loan to pay the states, as per its statutory obligation. The minister said he is in touch with his counterparts and they can move the Supreme Court if the Centre forces states to borrow from a special window facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The controversy surrounds a GST compensation shortfall of ₹2.35 lakh crore. In August, the Centre gave two options to the states — borrow ₹97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the central bank or ₹2.35 lakh from the market. It also proposed extending the compensation cess on luxury and sin goods to repay the borrowing. At a subsequent meeting of the GST Council, the amount in the first option was raised to ₹1.1 lakh crore. The states have enough headroom to borrow, the finance ministry official said: “Only five months are left [in the financial year], but none of them have crossed even the 3% [of gross state domestic product (GSDP)] limit despite the fact that they can borrow up to 5% of their [GSDP]. Their borrowing is fully protected as both principal and interests are repaid through compensation cess that will continue till their debt obligations are fully met.” Thus far, the 20 states that have chosen Option 1 are: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.A minister from one of the dissenting states said on condition of anonymity that a consensus would be “ideal”. “The FM [Nirmala Sitharaman] is also willing to discuss the matter, which is the best way as legal option is not always prudent.” The Union finance minister is the chairperson of the apex federal body, GST Council. Finance ministers of states are its members and conventionally they strive to take decisions on the basis of a consensus. Jharkhnad finance minister Rameshwar Oran, too, said he was hopeful of consensus emerging in the GST Council on the issue. Isaac was more critical, though: “What it (the Centre) is doing is nothing but betrayal. If payment of compensation is delayed further we will take legal recourse after talking to other states.” Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao said it was unfortunate that “for the first time, the Centre has taken a unilateral decision without considering the views of states”. “We lodged our serious protest with finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman,” Rao said. “Whether we should take to legal recourse or there is any other option to get more funds from the Centre would be decided after the high-level meeting with the chief minister.” Chhattisgarh finance minister TS Singh Deo said it is sad that the Centre wants to abandon the states during this stressful economic time by not taking up the responsibility of taking the loan which is fully protected by the extended GST cess collected beyond June 2022. Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that he suggested setting up a group of ministers to resolve the dispute between the states and the Centre arising out of recommendation of the GST council, but there was no response to his suggestion. “We are close to causing irreparable damage to One-Nation-One-Tax concept that is the soul of the (GST) law,” he added. Delhi deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said the central government owes ₹16,000 crore as GST compensation to the Delhi government and has not paid this money leading to the government struggling to pay salaries even to our teachers and doctors. “The central government should be largehearted and help us. But, is only giving excuses and finding ways to stop allocation of funds to Delhi.” West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who has been the biggest critic of the Centre’s two options, said the Centre should respect cooperative federalism using its “brute” majority and said all options are available to them, including taking legal recourse. On Tuesday, Mitra briefed chief minister Mamata Banerjee about the meeting and the Trinamool Congress, in a statement, said the CM will take decision on next course of action.Pratik Jain, partner and leader, Indirect Tax, at PwC India, said: “It’s clear that Centre now wants to focus on option 1 only and nudge the remaining States to take a view in the matter. One would hope that GST council will resolve the issue with consensus over the next few days, though possibility of this going to court cannot be ruled out.” Sunil Kumar, DGM at tax consultancy firm Taxmann, said: “As consensus has not been achieved on the issue, the go-ahead given to 20 States to borrow money under option 1 may impact persuasively on the future functioning of the GST Council.”(State bureaus and PTI contributed to this report)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/door-still-open-for-states-says-govt-on-gst-dues-row/story-zBcQhBeqd6LWilKptLXDBJ.html
14-10-2020||India||60 per cent of rural India can’t afford nutritious diets||The cost of a recommended diet (CoRD) in India in 2011 (the most recent year for which expenditure and consumption data is available) was ₹45.1 and ₹51.3 for women and men, according to a paper published this month in the Food Policy journal — numbers that, according to the paper’s authors, Kalyani Raghunathan, an economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and others were almost 1.6 times the commonly used World Bank poverty line of $1.9 a day in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms.Worse still, according to the paper, in real terms, CoRD increased more than 3.5 times for both men and women between 2001 and 2011. To be sure, real earnings increased at a faster pace, especially for men, during this period.The paper highlights an important fact: freedom from poverty, even food security — the way in which it is defined by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) — do not guarantee nutrition security. As a result, while India achieved a rapid reduction in poverty in the 2000s, a majority of its rural population was unable to afford nutritional diets and nutritional poverty was significantly higher in India than what is captured by commonly used poverty measures.Also read: To get health right, India must focus on nutritionFor its calculation of a nutritionally adequate diet in rural India, the paper used the definition used by the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN).Nutrition insecurity significantly higher than poverty Only 22.5% Indians were poor, if one were to take the World Bank’s $1.9 per day poverty line in PPP terms, in 2011. This share was 24.8% in rural India. The share of Indian population considered food insecure by the FAO in 2011-12 was even lower, just 16.3%. The FAO measure essentially looks at calorie adequacy and therefore does not take into account other nutritional requirements. However, 63.3% of people in rural India could not afford what the paper describes as the Cost of a Recommended Diet (CoRD). This share increases to 76.2% if one were to assume that a third of their spending would go on non-food items.  Milk, vegetables are the key burden on nutritious diet budgets, not cereals NIN has laid out dietary guidelines which specify the required intake of food items under the broad categories of cereals, proteins (pulses, meat, fish and eggs), dairy, fruits, vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables and oil and fats. The paper has estimated CoRD by looking at the cost of the cheapest food items in each of these groups across India’s 380 rural districts, calculating the price of the nutritionally adequate food basket and then checking its affordability with expected earnings of men and women. The authors estimate CoRD to be Rs 45.1 and Rs 51.3 for women and men in 2011. The paper also gives a break up (by cost) of a nutritionally adequate diet and almost half of the cost is on account of dairy products and vegetables. The composition of CoRD, when compared with the weights in rural Consumer Price Index (CPI) food basket shows that the latter overestimates the importance of cereals and proteins at the cost of dairy products, fruits and vegetables. Another interesting finding of the paper is that not only have food prices increased between 2001 and 2011, which is expected, but so has their volatility.  Also read | Covid-19: Nearly 60 million of India’s poor most vulnerable, says Oxford study Monsoon worsens nutritional insecurity in India A key metric which the paper tracks is the ratio of CoRD and wage earnings, which is a good measure of affordability of nutritious diets. Affordability of nutritious diets worsens as the ratio becomes higher. The authors find that nutritional insecurity peaks in the country during the monsoon months, and is the highest in July. This is driven by an increase in CoRD, which seems to be a result of sharp rise in vegetable prices. Wages are mostly constant throughout the year, the paper finds.  Economic Survey’s Thalinomics does not capture nutritional inadequacy in India While the authors list out limitations to their findings such as validity of data used, difficulties of accounting for consumer preferences in calculating CoRD, non-food expenditure, impact of government schemes etc. they express confidence that the central conclusions continue to be robust. They also find issues with the Thalinomics discussion in this year’s Economic Survey, which concluded that affordability of vegetarian thalis improved 29% from 2006-07 to 2019-20 while that for non-vegetarian thalis improved by 18%. The Economic Survey’s methodology excluded dairy, fruits and dark green leafy vegetables, often the most expensive food items, the authors note. They also find an issue with industrial wages being used to compare affordability while nutritional insecurity is the biggest problem among unskilled workers. Because India does not have a consumption survey after 2011-12, estimates of nutritional insecurity cannot be calculated after this period. However, given the fact that the economy has been in a prolonged slowdown even before the pandmeic and rural wage growth has been weak, the situation could have worsened, Raghunathan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-per-cent-of-rural-india-can-t-afford-nutritious-diets/story-DR4GAYIgwkrFwxwFj1Q2sI.html
14-10-2020||India||Covid-19: Nearly 1 in 5 comorbid patient dies, says govt data||Nearly one in every five patients, or 17.9% of the people, with so-called comorbidities who contract the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India, succumb to the viral disease, according to the Union health ministry data. For patients with no underlying medical conditions, the corresponding proportion is 1.2%. This means that people with comorbidities are 15 times more likely to die if infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, than those with no underlying conditions.Comorbidity refers to the existence of multiple medical conditions in the same person. In the case of Covid-19, having conditions such hypertension, diabetes, heart, liver or kidney disease increases the risk of a patient developing a more severe form of the disease and of dying.Although the findings about the higher case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of cases that end up in death – for people with comorbidities are largely in line with what scientists around the world have observed, this is the first time the government has released data showing the correlation between fatality and comorbidities in India.In the US, the only country with more confirmed Covid-19 infections than India, a study by country’s federal agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published in June showed that 19.5% people with underlying diseases died compared to 1.6% of those who were healthy — proportions that are strikingly similar to India’s. The largest variance in the two groups (those with and without comorbidities) in India was reported among people above the age of 60 years where nearly a quarter (24.6%) of those with underlying conditions died against one in 20 patients (4.8%) with none. For those between 45 and 60 years of age, the CFR was 13.9% for patients with comorbidities against 1.5% for those without. Patients under the age of 45 years had the best CFR for both categories – 8.8% for those with underlying diseases and 0.2% for healthy individuals, the health ministry said during Tuesday’s weekly Covid-19 briefing. Experts said comorbidities can heavily impede the recovery in Covid-19 patients. “Comorbid conditions such as heart, kidney or liver diseases or diabetes etc. majorly impede the recovery process in serious Covid-19 patients. It also takes longer for Covid-19 patients with underlying medical conditions to recover, especially those with uncontrolled disease,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of respiratory medicine and interventional pulmonology at Fortis Hospital.The health ministry also provided fresh data on age- and gender-specific breakup of fatalities in the country. About 88% of Covid-19 deaths have been among those aged above 45 years, with those above 60 making up the biggest share of fatalities (53%). About 70% deaths have been of male patients, the health ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-nearly-1-in-5-comorbid-patient-dies-says-govt-data/story-DxQwJpjeEF3Ft8wj8ovGmL.html

According to the police, the incident came to light on Monday after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with the Geetanagar police station accusing her husband of sexually assaulting the teenager. “The girl’s mother is in the process of seeking divorce from her husband and stays separately. The victim stays with her father and other relatives,” said Dipul Boro, officer-in-charge of Geetanagar police station. “According to the complaint, the accused has been assaulting his daughter for the past two years. The intensity of the attacks increased in the past few months. The girl, who was having irregular menstruation, first told one of her aunts about the assaults who in turn informed the mother,” he added. Based on the complaint, the accused was arrested on Monday. He is stated to have admitted to the crime. The accused was produced in a city court on Tuesday and remanded to 14 days judicial custody. The police have lodged a case of rape under provisions of IPC and the POCSO Act and are conducting further examination. A medical examination of the girl has been conducted and its report is awaited. According to a report released by the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) released last month, Assam recorded the highest rate of crimes against women in 2019 at 117.8 per lakh population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-man-arrested-for-raping-14-year-old-daughter-for-last-two-years/story-NU57sRlsOm94iOHPEpz1uM.html

A BSF official, on condition of anonymity, said that they are creating awareness about the importance of wearing facemasks, maintaining social distance and washing hands regularly.“Since the lockdown period, we have distributed free ration along with facemasks, medicines and other related items to people living in the bordering areas. This is a continuous process. Besides distribution, we have now started to make people realize how they can avoid being infected by the disease through maintaining Covid-19 protocols,” said the official.“ ..BSF personnel at HQ Salbagan #Agartala took #Pledge to create awareness for containing #Coronavirus spread through appropriate #Behaviour of #COVID19 Protocols..,” BSF Tripura tweeted recently.Tripura shares 856 kilometer long international border with neighbouring Bangladesh. The state recorded a total of 28,461 Covid-19 cases, as per the latest health report, and among them, over 300 BSF personnel including few women and children from their camps tested positive with the virus since May. At present, nearly 35 are yet to recover. There is no fatality among the BSF.“Besides telling people about Covid-19 protocols, we have even given examples of some Covid-19 patients among the BSF battalions including children who have recovered after following these protocols,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-spike-in-covid-19-cases-bsf-begins-awareness-campaign-in-tripura-s-border-areas/story-tW6dFCNUugObyrCYkX23zN.html
14-10-2020||India||Karnataka BJP gives ticket to Congress defector Munirathna for RR Nagar assembly by-poll||After days of suspense, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday finally gave the party ticket to Munirathna for the R R Nagar assembly by-poll in Karnataka and to another party newbie Rajesh Gowda for the Sira assembly seat.Munirathna, a film producer turned politician had defected from the Congress and helped topple the Congress-JDS coalition government in Karnataka helping BJP to come to power. The saffron party decided to give the ticket to Munirathna after the Supreme Court dismissed a 2018 petition, on Tuesday afternoon, by the then defeated BJP candidate Tulasi Muniraju Gowda.The BJP candidate had accused Munirathna of electoral irregularities and sought that his election be squashed. There was also resentment within the local BJP- RSS workers on giving a ticket to the Congress defector. But with the Supreme Court clearing his earlier victory, the path was cleared for Munirathna.In Sira, the other assembly seat which is facing by-polls due to the death of incumbent JDS MLA B Satyanarayana - due to Covid-19, BJP has given the ticket to Rajesh Gowda who joined the party only 10 days ago. Rajesh Gowda’s father is a Congress stalwart C P Mudalagiryappa who has thrice been elected to Lok Sabha.While Congress has nominated former minister T B Jayachandra as its candidate from Sira, it has given the RR Nagar ticket to H Kusuma the daughter of former JDS leader Hanumantharayappa. JDS meanwhile has fielded Ammajamma the widow of Satyanarayana as its candidate in Sira and is yet to announce its nominee for RR Nagar.The last day of nominations is on October 16 and voting will be held on November 3 with results being declared on November 10. Though the outcome of the by-polls is unlikely to affect the ruling party - as BJP with 117 members in the 225 member assembly enjoys a clear majority - all the three parties are taking this as a prestige battle.For the ruling BJP which has never won either seat it would be an opportunity to expand its base, for the Congress under new KPCC chief D K Shivakumar it is an opportunity to prove a point that it can win again in the state. JDS is fighting to retain relevance in state politics as a key third player.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bjp-gives-ticket-to-congress-defector-munirathna-for-rr-nagar-assembly-by-poll/story-NIxQLh2d5kyZx7luoaoggL.html

They collectively possess field experience and analytical data which and above all personal struggles that provide insights into caste- based atrocities faced by Dalits especially the Dalit women and limitations to speedy and fair access to the criminal justice system to Dalit girls and women in India,” read the petition.Last week, a three-judge bench of the apex court heard a public interest litigation seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe and observed that the gang rape and murder in Hathras district was a horrible and extraordinary incident. The bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, directed the state government to place on record the steps taken to ensure protection of witnesses. The top court also asked the state to ascertain whether the family engaged a lawyer and sought details of the scope of proceedings relating to the incident before the Allahabad high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-petition-filed-in-top-court/story-tSTEDKEGiMAgPJZxLazlhI.html
14-10-2020||India||Azam Khan, family get bail in fake birth certificate case||The Allahabad high court on Tuesday granted bail to Samajwadi Party MP from Rampur Azam Khan, his wife Tazeen Fatma and son Abdullah Azam Khan in a case related to them obtaining a fake birth certificate for Abdullah.Abdullah Azam Khan and his mother may be released immediately, but Azam Khan will only be released after the trial court record records a statement by the complainant in the case, said the court.Justice Siddharth passed the order on a bail applications filed by Azam Khan, his wife and son. The three had surrendered in February before a Rampur court after their bail applications in connection with the case related to the alleged fake birth certificate of Abdullah were rejected.Last year, a first information report (FIR) was lodged by a person identified as Akash Saxena at the Ganj police station of Rampur, alleging that Azam Khan and Tazeen Fatima had got two birth certificates issued from two places— one dated January 28, 2012, from Nagar Palika Parishad, Rampur, and a second dated April 21, 2015, from Nagar Nigam, Lucknow -- relating to the birth of their son.According to the bail applicants, the offence of obtaining a fake birth certificate would not go beyond the purview of Section 23 of the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969, which provides that any information given for the purpose of being inserted in a register of births and deaths, which is known or believed by the person giving such information to be false, shall be punished with fine that may extend to Rs 50.The state government opposed the bail application on grounds that the fake birth certificate was used by Abdullah Azam Khan to contest state elections, that his parents had helped him in obtaining the document, and if released on bail, may influence witnesses in the case.In another case, the Allahabad high court on Tuesday granted bail to Abdullah Azam Khan and his mother for allegedly getting allotment of state land by cheating. The property was allotted to them in March 2014 after their bid of Rs 1,200 per month was found to be the highest.Justice Siddharth allowed the bail application of Abdullah and her mother and directed the trial court to decide the case soon, preferably within a year.The counsel for the petitioners argued that Fatma took the property on rent on the presumption that the property belonged to the Zila Sahkari Vikas Sangh, Rampur, and was not aware of the fact that it belonged to the district administration.“Even if it is accepted that the property belonging to the state has been let out by Zila Sahkari Vikas Sangh, Rampur to the applicant illegally, then the termination of tenancy was the only remedy,” argued the counsel.The state government counsel argued that Azam Khan, who was then a minister of the state government, used government machinery to create forged documents for extending undue gains to his wife and son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/azam-family-get-bail-in-fake-birth-certificate-case/story-7tcAkiBc6AU1Wa0aIWednM.html

14-10-2020||India||NIA charges 8 accused with Maoist conspiracy||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has laid out damning charges of Maoist conspiracy, receiving funds and recruiting cadre for left-wing extremist groups and inculcating sympathies among university students, against prominent activists and academics arrested in connection with the 2018 Bhima Koregaon caste clashes.The NIA claimed Delhi University professor Hany Babu Musaliyarveetil Tharayil, charge-sheeted last week along with seven other people in the case, inculcated sympathies for Maoists among students in Delhi, especially Dalit students. In a 10,000-page charge sheet – filed last week and reviewed by HT on Tuesday – the agency said Babu had with him documents pertaining to “mass mobility, analysis of cities like Mumbai, Surat from political, geological, socio-economical, religious profile as if done to see the potential of making inroads for Maoists”. Some documents mentioned methods for mastering of secret works, instructions of central committee of Maoists on work required to be done in urban areas; guidelines for work in working classes, finances, information literature related to a weapon, bomb, mortar as well as company drill of PLGA (People’s Liberation Guerilla Army), the charge sheet said. He was also in touch with a secretary – Paikhomba Meitei - of a Manipur-based banned outfit Kangleipak Communist Party- Military Council (KCP-MC), NIA adds Asserting that Babu was an active member of CPI (Maoist), the charge sheet added that he organised an event for the release of Delhi University professor GN Saibaba under the banner of ‘committee for the defence and release of G N Saibaba’. Saibaba is currently in jail on charges of alleged Maoist links. Babu’s wife, Jenny Rowena, denied the allegations.“I don’t think he even knows about any of these things. It’s good that they have filed a charge sheet because now we can fight the charges in the court of law. As far as his role in G N Saibaba committee is concerned, it’s in public domain. And the documents which they took away this year, they were always there. Why didn’t they take the same earlier? If there was something secret in documents recovered from him, wouldn’t we have destroyed it?” Last Friday, the NIA filed the charge sheet against eight persons. They are: academics Anand Teltumbde and Hany Babul; activist Gautam Navlakha; activist Father Stan Swamy; three members of Leftist cultural group Kabir Kala Manch - Jyoti Raghoba Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe, Ramesh Gaichor; and secretary of Maharashtra State Committee of the CPI (Maoist) Milind Teltumbde, who is said to be on the run. The case pertains to the violence that broke out in the village of Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018 during a celebration of a British-era war by Dalits, and left one person dead. The NIA has claimed that event held on December 31, 2017 in Pune called the Elgaar Parishad was used by Maoists to plan and fuel the violence. In all, 16 people have been arrested in connection with the case.On 83-year-old activist Father Stan Swamy, arrested last week, the charge sheet said he received Rs 8 lakh from an individual identified as “Comrade Mohan” for spreading the activities of CPI (Maoist). Several documents recovered from his place, which are part of charge sheet, allegedly included “an underground handbook, letter between cadres for using encryption, mini-manual of urban guerilla, the constitution of CPI Maoist, documents related to the status of PLGA in excel sheet, document on strategy and tactics”. In one of the letters seized from him, it is allegedly stated that Maoists were keeping an eye on the strategy of the Union home ministry pertaining to operations against them. According to NIA, this letter suggested that after the arrest of Telugu poet Varavara Rao (in November 2018 in connection with the same case) – referred to as ‘VV’ in the letter -- Maoists’ Central Committee felt they had no leader of equal experience, a situation that could lead to further splintering among the cadre, especially those working at an all-India level. “If we don’t take immediate measures, the new comrades who wish to join the party may become skeptical of our sincerity and ability to fight the fascist political powers in India,” the letter allegedly recovered from Swamy read. This letter is now part of the charge sheet. Another letter allegedly recovered from Swamy – dated July 2017 and written in Telugu, according to NIA -- forms the basis of the Elgar Parishad programme on December 31 that year as it talked about organising an event under the leadership of activist Sudhir Dhawale --- who is also behind bars -- to further the agenda of CPI (Maoist). Ranchi-based food rights activist Siraj Dutta said, “Father Stan Swamy has been working for the rights of Adivasis for decades. It’s all to harass him.” On the role of Navlakha, the NIA charge sheet said that his job was “to unite the intellectuals against the government” in urban areas to defeat it both physically and otherwise”.“Navlakha participated in fact finding committee (for Maoists’ work in urban areas); assigned task for recruitment of cadres for the guerilla activities of CPI (Maoist) and knew about the young activists in Delhi, Mumbai and Chhattisgarh who were ready to join and serve the Maoist revolution”, the charge sheet said. NIA said Navlakha allegedly visited Dandakaranya – a densely forested area in Bastar in Chhattisgarh that is largely controlled by Maoists - with Swedish author Jan Myrdal, known for his Marxist-Leninist ideology.Yug Chaudhry, Navlakha’s lawyer, denied the charges. “Yes, he has gone to the jungle for academic purposes. He has met the Maoists and written a book about Naxalism. It’s not a crime to study Naxalism.” As first reported by HT in July, the NIA charge sheet also mentioned that Navlakha met a senior official of the Pakistani spy agency ISI, through Ghulam Nabi Fai, a US-based Pakistan-bankrolled Kashmiri separatist who was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2011. From Navlakha, the NIA allegedly recovered strategic documents of Maoists, critical secret communications with underground senior leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-charges-8-accused-with-maoist-conspiracy/story-L1uvtzTRSeZlduW9Lm3DnK.html
14-10-2020||India||Pakistan PM’s adviser says India has sent a message with ‘desire for conversation’||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s adviser on national security issues has contended that India has indicated a desire for talks even as he set several conditions for a dialogue, including the rollback of several changes made in Jammu and Kashmir. Moeed Yusuf, special assistant to Khan on national security and strategic policy planning, said India has sent a message to Pakistan with “a desire for conversation” but refused to give details. Among the conditions set by Yusuf for a dialogue with India is release of political prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir, making Kashmiris a party to talks, ending restrictions in the region, rescinding the domicile law that allows non-Kashmiris to settle in the region, and stopping alleged human rights abuses. He also said the changes in Jammu and Kashmir are “not an internal matter”, and are “a matter for the UN”. Yusuf made the remarks in an interview with journalist Karan Thapar for the news portal The Wire, the first by a Pakistani official since India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019 and split it into two union territories. Yusuf said the two sides “must sit down like adults” for talks and contended the two key issues are Kashmir and terror. “I want to talk about both,” he said, adding that Pakistan “stands for peace and we want to move forward”. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Yusuf’s comments. It is extremely rare for Pakistani officials to talk on foreign policy issues such as relations with India without getting the go-ahead from the military establishment, which plays a key role in guiding ties with the US and India. Yusuf is considered to be close to the security establishment. Last month, Yusuf had created a flutter after he joined a virtual meeting of national security advisers of member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) with a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of India and Pakistan. India’s NSA Ajit Doval walked out of the meeting in protest and the matter did now go down well with Russia, which hosted the meeting. On the issue of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged involvement in spying, Yusuf contended there was evidence linking him to subversive activities. On the matter of India asking that Jadhav be represented by an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s Counsel to file an appeal against his death sentence, Yusuf said there is no law to allow an Indian lawyer to argue a case in a Pakistani court. He also refused to accept that Pakistan has denied India unimpeded and unconditional consular access to Jadhav. Asked about Pakistan’s repeated refusal to act against terrorists who target India from Pakistani soil and the failure to prosecute the seven men accused of involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, Yusuf blamed India for “deliberately delaying sending evidence and witnesses” for the trial so that it can keep the issue alive and use it to run down Pakistan in front of the world community. Speaking about Prime Minister Khan’s silence on the persecution of Uyghurs in China’s Xinjiang region while accusing India of “genocide” in Kashmir, Yusuf said this was “a false equivalence”. He said the Uyghurs were a “non-issue” as he was 100% satisfied that they were being treated properly by China. Yusuf also accused India of being involved in backing terror within Pakistan, and said the Indian embassy in Kabul had given $1 million to the Pakistani Taliban in 2019 to help the group merge with four other militant groups. However, he was unable to name all four groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-pm-s-adviser-says-india-has-sent-a-message-with-desire-for-conversation/story-FQr67HVg4KjHDrP0GjgtzM.html
14-10-2020||India||FAC to decide if coal mines can start mining before obtaining forest clearance||The Environment Ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) is dealing with three contentious policy issues which could have far reaching impacts on forest management. One of them is whether coal mines involving both forest and non-forest land can start mining in the latter before obtaining a forest clearance.Two other policy issues that were discussed at the September 21 meeting are: if a zoo can be considered a “forestry activity” and the definition of “permanent structures” under eco-tourism facilities which will attract provisions of the forest conservation act.Also read: 680 projects in protected areas given wildlife clearance in 5 yearsThe FAC hasn’t taken a decision on these policy issues yet. “FAC considered the policy issues and decided that Forest Conservation division of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) may have some more deliberation on the issues involving concerned divisions of the ministry, after which same may be placed before FAC with appropriate recommendation for analysis and decision,” the minutes of the meeting state.“We don’t know what will be the impact of starting mining in non-forest land on the adjoining forest land. Personally, I think taking a general or blanket decision on all such coal mines is not recommended. It should be decided on a case by case basis depending on how much forest area is involved,” said a senior environment ministry official on condition of anonymity. He added that no decisions had been taken yet on whether a zoo can be considered a forestry activity and definition of permanent structures in forests. No permanent structures are allowed to be raised in forest areas under the forest conservation act.The process of auctioning 38 coal blocks is underway, out of which many mines involve large tracts of forest areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the auction of 41 mines for commercial mining on June 18. He had said the market for coal is open now and that the auction will help turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity.But the list of 41 mines had suggested several of them are located in biodiversity rich forest areas in central India, including a few in one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forests called Hasdeo Arand spanning 170,000 ha. Following opposition from Chhattisgarh government, the ministry of mines had agreed in August that it will exclude five mines in Hasdeo Arand region from the auction.The description of mines up for auction on MSTC website shows several do not have required forest clearance and are in the midst of protected forests. There are several coal blocks in biodiversity rich forest land in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh that are still up for auction. For example, Chakla block has 55% forest cover and acts as drainage for major rivers like Damodar and Bakri. Jharkhand’s Choritand Tilaya also has forests in 50% of the area; Seregarha block is 40% forest. Madhya Pradesh’s Gotitoria East coal block is 80% forest and acts as drainage for Sitarewa river.“Any change in the procedure for forest clearances, including that of prior approvals will require a legal amendment through the Parliament. The FAC is only an advisory body. However, the bigger concern this throws up is that such a possibility is even being considered. Initiating mining operations without ascertaining impacts, viability and ensuring recognition of existing rights is not just legally flawed but does not have social or environmental legitimacy,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fac-to-decide-if-coal-mines-can-start-mining-before-obtaining-forest-clearance/story-VAcCNL5RHzyfynhEdXxlyO.html
14-10-2020||Today's||Why Tanishq withdrew ad showing inter-faith marriage: Chronology of a ‘killed’ campaign | Opinion||You can call it the power of social media or the perils of social media, depending on which side of this fence you are sitting on. But one thing is certain - the manner in which Tanishq was forced to withdraw its advertisement showing an inter-faith marriage - is a telling commentary of the divisive times we live in.Late on Tuesday evening, the brand issued a statement saying it was “deeply saddened with the inadvertent stirring of emotions” and that it was withdrawing the video.For those living under a rock and who have not seen it, the advertisement basically showed a Muslim family celebrating a traditional Hindu baby shower ceremony for their pregnant daughter-in-law. Also Watch | Tanishq ad row: Watch what Shashi Tharoor, Kangana Ranaut & others saidThe campaign was released on October 9 and immediately led to the hashtag #BoycottTanishq. The 45-second film faced massive backlash on social media. Among others was actor Kangana Ranaut accusing Tanishq of not only promoting “love jihad” but also sexism. The trolling included threats to the company’s employees and directors. This advert is wrong on many levels, Hindu bahu is living with the family for significant amount of time but acceptance happens only when she is carrying their heir. So what is she just a set of ovaries?This advert does not only promote love-jihad but also sexism #tanishqBy Monday evening, the ad was pulled off Tanishq’s YouTube channel. Tanishq later cited “hurt sentiments and the well-being of their employees, partners and store staff” as the reason for pulling their communication.But that did not end the outcry. The withdrawal of the ad provoked a different kind of backlash with people calling out Tanishq and its parent company the Tata Group, even Ratan Tata for NOT having a spine to stand up to trollers.Writer Chetan Bhagat tweeted that he expected a Tata group company to be fairer and braver. “Don’t get bullied,” he advised Tanishq. Actor Swara Bhaskar - among others - called it a sad lack of spine by the Tata Group. As a TATA group company, expected #Tanishq to be fairer and braver. If you have done nothing wrong, if you have shown something beautiful about our country, don't get bullied. Be Indian. Be strong.The withdrawal of the otherwise routine ad was disappointing for many. After all, it was not really making any political statement and was just another feel good effort to promote Hindu-Muslim unity.Advertising often mimics society and in this case the Tanishq ad was clearly an effort to showcase religious unity which has been part and parcel of the Indian way of life for decades. Giving in to cyberbullying and social media noise over a seemingly positive message gives the message that the brand foresaw some actual loss of goodwill amidst customers. Either that or the jewellery brand anticipated the cyber bullying to translate into on-ground trouble for its employees and store staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-tanishq-withdrew-ad-showing-inter-faith-marriage-chronology-of-a-killed-campaign-opinion/story-z1aO1cunTHAV7aneDTvdnN.html
