While the current challenges are mostly related to finance, market and raw material, and have got aggravated due to the pandemic, other issues pertaining to MSMEs have been there for years.A deep dive suggests at least four structural issues which go beyond the standard challenges. The first is the sheer number – around 20 million manufacturing enterprises which is higher than the population of 75% of most countries. The second is the challenge of linkages, as only around 15% of MSMEs are registered. The estimated 17 million unregistered MSMEs are mostly Own Account Enterprises (OAEs) – operating mostly as household units and pose a regulatory challenge for formal institutions to support them. Third, the setting up of unregistered OAEs often happens as a livelihood of “last resort” or is inherited due to lack of options rather than entrepreneurial vision. Fourth, the OAEs mostly survive with surplus family labour, lack business records, linkages with market, knowledge and technology. These make them poor candidates for growth, Covid or no Covid.Such structural issues may be handled through a dual strategy – one for the estimated three million artisanal OAEs and the other for estimated 14 million non-artisanal OAEs and other unregistered micro-enterprises.While artisanal OAEs face some of these growth challenges, joint enterprises of owners of household enterprises are often successes. India has seen several schemes, mostly with an emphasis on the creation of common infrastructure. However, equal importance may be given in creating a formal joint market or business promotion organisations of artisanal enterprises which can allow informal units to manufacture and formal joint enterprises to manage the forward and backward linkages. India needs at least 5,000 such joint enterprises with appropriate technical support that will propel them to grow and make the artisanal OAEs to grow along with them. Covid has added a fresh agenda of e-marketing, where heavy investment is needed. It is estimated that non-artisanal OAEs (based on overall OAE composition), are mostly manufacturers of textiles and apparel (44%), food products (11%), furniture and wood products (10%) and metal and non-metal products (6%). Here, there is need for creation and consolidation of four types of stakeholders: One, locally available and affordable or “barefoot” service providers in the areas of energy savings, bank linkage, technical support; two, strengthening of existing and creation of new industry associations, wherever they are absent, at cluster/district level; three, provide linkage with buyers who can implant knowledge among the OAEs through a business (learning by doing) model and; four, provide linkages with knowledge nodes. Much of this can be achieved with the support of district and cluster-level associations. A majority of these associations, at present, are only occasional policy promoters/challengers and are otherwise dormant. But they are the most trusted ally of the MSMEs and they are our best option. One needs to build their capacities to train and create barefoot service providers at the local level and also become service providers themselves. There is an existing repository of 2,000 plus such associations and there may be 5,000 of them. One can also incentivise bigger MSMEs through tax benefits for outsourcing as this is also a very effective route for learning and making the entire ecosystem competitive. The district industry centres can be empowered as the knowledge provider by creating a panel of experts for the most important clusters in that region. However the places which are industrialised are not the real poverty hotspots. Poverty hotspots often see an exodus of labour and the same labour with business knowledge from the clusters in the metros, post- Covid, has in many cases, returned to its origin. This reverse migration will work both ways. While the urban clusters will go for mechanisation and will need support for technology upgradation, poverty hotspots need to be identified for industrialisation and “creation of clusters” based on the comparative advantages of skill influx through reverse migration and thereby fulfilling the vision of “vocal for local”.Tamal Sarkar is executive director, Foundation for MSME Clusters, New Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/msmes-structural-issues-go-beyond-the-standard-challenges/story-bGlGI3i8bflAhqXkg5PR2J.html
02-10-2020||News||The Mahatma’s life was his message, writes President Ram Nath Kovind||Gandhiji was jailed in 1922 for writing articles campaigning for non-cooperation and civil disobedience. His colleague Shankerlal Banker, also jailed with him, had seen the Mahatma starting the day at 4 am, and not wasting a single minute till late in the night. From spinning and weaving for six hours a day, to studying the scriptures, he was constantly occupied. Banker enthusiastically joined in, and Gandhiji drafted a timetable for him too. When he was released early, Banker told Gandhiji that he had learned a new way of life. Gandhiji asked him to tell others about his lessons. Gandhiji then asked him if he had any idea of how people would react. Banker had no clue. “I can tell you what people would say. They’d say, ‘He is a Mahatma and he can lead such a life. We can’t’,” Gandhiji said. Then Gandhiji asked him to tell them that he was not born a Mahatma. “I too had many faults and I carefully and relentlessly worked to remove them. Now people call me Mahatma, though I am far from that. But this is the way open to all, and every individual can walk on it if he or she thinks through it and make progress in that direction with confidence and commitment.”As we celebrate Gandhiji’s 151st birth anniversary, I think of his advice. It is humbling and empowering in equal measure. He himself never claimed to be a great soul — indeed, he went out of his way to tell the world about his vulnerabilities. Yet, he is the best example of realising the maximum human potential. If anything, his achievements seem superhuman to us. What Albert Einstein said in his tribute to the Mahatma is true, and the present generation has a hard time believing that a frail old man with a toothy smile could have made it possible to win freedom without taking up arms. As Gandhiji himself tells us, he was an average child with weaknesses. The difference was that he diligently worked on his moral foundations. In his youth, he was shy and diffident, but he was consolidating his ethical outlook. This constant effort to be a better human being and to be more sensitive towards those around him made him a Mahatma. This path was, of course, extremely difficult. There were many failures along the way. But he continued doggedly, one step at a time.In his autobiography, he writes that what he had been “striving and pining to achieve” was “self-realisation, to see God face to face, to attain moksha”. His striving was then unique in that he did not renounce the world, but sacrificed his whole life for the upliftment of the downtrodden, and for the empowerment of fellow Indians. He was more concerned about his duties than his rights, and took up cudgels on behalf of others — Dalits, peasants, labourers, women and others. In the process, he evolved a new kind of compassionate politics that has answers to all the contemporary world’s pressing questions. Gandhiji shows, in great detail, what needs to be done — by individuals, organisations and nations — to achieve peaceful coexistence, sustainable development, economic and social equality.Moreover, he accomplished so much while remaining utterly humble. His colleagues and followers saw him not as a father figure, but as a mother figure. George Orwell rightly speaks of a “clean smell” he managed to leave behind. I realised what the English author meant when I visited the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad three years ago. The ground still remains hallowed, and the place still vibrates with the serenity he brought about there. I have felt similar peaceful vibrations whenever I have visited his samadhi at Raj Ghat in Delhi.In a world riven by strife, Gandhiji’s teachings have universal resonance. In my visits abroad, I have found his busts in many countries. In some places, I have unveiled them myself. Such a life is but rare, and thus, it is our duty to nurture and build on his legacy. From Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela to living legends such as Zambia’s first President, Kenneth Kaunda, and former United States President, Barack Obama, they all unequivocally repose faith in Gandhiji’s teachings.The year-long celebrations of his 150th birth anniversary that culminate today have been an apt occasion to rejuvenate his memories and reorient the moral and ethical foundations of public life. Many young people, in India and abroad, must have discovered Gandhiji’s timeless message during this past year.Gandhiji has so much more to offer to us if we take lessons from his life, particularly when we are facing a pandemic. During the outbreak of a deadly plague, he flung himself into health care and sanitation duties that exemplified his selfless service. As he put it in a speech in Alappuzha (Alleppey) in January, 1934, “I have that implicit faith in my mission that, if it succeeds — as it will succeed, it is bound to succeed — history will record it as a movement designed to knit all people in the world together, not as hostile to one another but as parts of one whole.” By invoking that faith and attitude, I am confident, we will be able to imagine and build a better world. The 151st anniversary is a good occasion to think through our priorities in the light of Gandhiji’s life and thought, and prepare ourselves again to hear his voice in our hearts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-mahatma-s-life-was-his-message/story-1UiKhYplgvSHKoEqEYO0EN.html
02-10-2020||News||Covid-19: There are answers that lie in Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj||Gandhi Jayanti is an opportunity to reconsider some of Gandhi’s core thoughts on the nature of human existence. This is particularly relevant in the present context when the Covid-19 pandemic has already claimed over a million lives across the world. It is interesting to reflect on the trajectory of Western capitalist development which has defined human progress since the Industrial Revolution nearly two-and-a-half centuries ago. This was one of Gandhi’s pet themes. The basic tenets of classical economics were outlined in Adam Smith’s foundational tract, The Wealth of Nations, which appeared in 1776. Within the next four decades, Ricardo and Malthus in England and Jean-Baptiste Say in France had laid the full foundations of the classical system. The watchwords of the classical system were laissez-faire and free trade. Adam Smith was possibly the finest representative of the Scottish enlightenment, and believed that this arrangement would ensure progress for all. But the later writers soon established that the material reality of the world is defined by scarcity. The onset of the Industrial Revolution brought about extensive and severe disruptions in the lives of the labouring class, even as a wealthy capitalist class was emerging in England. By this time, England was already the premier imperial power. A mere chartered company of the British monarch, the East India Company, was ruling over most of the Indian subcontinent, and the colonies of imperial Britain extended to North America and other parts of the globe. Classical economics was premised on the basic precept that all rational beings are naturally conditioned to pursue their self-interest. This view was strongly critiqued by a number of radical thinkers, among whom was John Ruskin. In his Unto This Last, Ruskin rejected the Smithian notion of “division of labour” as dehumanising and argued that classical economics fails to consider the social affections that bind communities together.The young Gandhi read Ruskin’s book on a train journey from Johannesburg to Durban in South Africa in June 1904 when he was 34. He was to confess later that this book changed his life forever. He had not been exposed to the writings of Smith and Ricardo till then, but was now determined to apply the precepts of Ruskin in his daily life.Barely five years later, in 1909, on a voyage from London to South Africa, Gandhiji penned his Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule. This was a trenchant critique of Western civilisation, and capitalism in particular. The colonial British government reckoned this to be a seditious piece of work and the pamphlet was proscribed in British India.Hind Swaraj may be regarded as the social and economic testament of Gandhi. His focus was on those living in the countryside, and he made a strong case to develop rural India as self-sufficient village republics. He fundamentally believed that all able-bodied men and women must be gainfully employed, and he was against machinery to the extent that it displaced labour.Possibly the greatest original insight of Gandhi was to advocate the principle of “limitation of wants”. This was the exact obverse of the whole project of Western classical, and later neo-classical, economics, which believed in the continuous expansion of the production possibility frontier. The latter idea is fundamental to the modern-day obsession with growth economics in virtually all genres of Western economic thought.Among the key classical thinkers, a major exception was John Stuart Mill who argued in favour of a “stationary state” to conserve the world’s resources. There have been a few other notable voices too, such as the institutional economist Thorstein Veblen who warned against conspicuous consumption. Gandhi’s views, quite independently, were in tune with the concerns of these rebel thinkers. The present episode of the pandemic gives us yet another opportunity to revisit Gandhi’s critique of Western civilisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-there-are-answers-that-lie-in-gandhi-s-hind-swaraj/story-5Id3Z3kXhmkz3jGt1FzCvO.html

02-10-2020||Gurugram||Liquor shop owner’s murder in Gurugram: One more suspect held||A month after a 42-year-old liquor shop owner was shot dead in Pataudi, the police on Thursday arrested a suspect from Bulandshahr district in Uttar Pradesh. The suspect, identified by police as Pawan, allegedly committed the crime at the behest of victim Inderjeet’s business rival Abhishek. Police said Abhishek offered Pawan ₹50 lakh for the job. The payment was never made as all suspects had gone into hiding after the crime.So far, seven people have been arrested in the case. On September 2 around 10pm Inderjeet and his two friends, Vikram and Vishal, were returning to their houses in a car, when a herd of cattle blocked their path in a lane in Jatauli village of Haily Mandi area. As they were trying to navigate their way around the cattle, several men on motorcycles allegedly cornered them and fired at least 20 rounds at their car. Inderjeet, who was behind the wheel, was shot 16 times and died on the spot, while Vikram had suffered three bullet injuries and was admitted to a hospital and later discharged, police had said. Vishal was unhurt in the incident. On questioning, said police, Pawan told them he and his accomplices, Ujwal and Jivan, and prime suspect Abhishek carried out the shooting. Inspector Indiwar, in-charge, crime branch, Farrukh Nagar, said, “Since the murder, Pawan had gone into hiding in Bulandshahr. They had made their plan to kill Inderjeet on August 30. They stole motorcycles from Noida for the crime and later dumped the vehicles and the guns used in the crime. These are yet to be recovered.” Police said Pawan was produced in a district court and sent to two-day police custody. The police probe had found that Abhishek had attacked Inderjeet last year too in a similar fashion. In that case, the court had declared him to be a proclaimed offender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/liquor-shop-owner-s-murder-in-gurugram-one-more-suspect-held/story-3kQirvE89H2TILskMp7UlK.html
02-10-2020||Gurugram||Haryana reduces cost of RT-PCR testing to ₹1,200||The Haryana government on Friday brought down the cost for RT-PCR testing —the gold standard for detecting Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19— to ₹1,200 from the existing ₹1,600.This is the second time the Haryana government has reduced the price for testing through the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at private labs. On August 29, the state government had reduced the cost of RT-PCR testing from ₹2,400 to ₹1,600.The department of health and family welfare on Friday issued a revised order stating that the overall charge for taking an RT-PCR has been reduced taking into account the cost of kits and consumables, and the consent of the leading private laboratories, . “No private laboratory should charge any amount more than ₹1,200 for RT-PCR. It includes the cost of sample pick up, packing, transportation of samples, documentation and reporting,” the order read.“We are continuously observing the cost of inputs for testing and keep aligning our rates. Haryana was the first state to cap the RT-PCR test price to ₹2,400 (in June) and then reduce it to ₹1,600 and now to ₹1,600. This is the lowest charge in the region,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department.The costs of antigen and antibody testing at private labs continue to remain the same. Rapid antigen test costs ₹650, while antibody test ₹250 in Haryana.Rishabh Rajput, director of Covid-19 and microbiology division, Modern Diagnostics, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified lab for Covid-19 testing in Gurugram, said, “The reduced RT-PCR testing price can compromise the quality assurance of the tests in smaller labs. Laboratories were earning a margin of 15-20 percent by administering RT-PCR at the previous cost of ₹1,600. This margin will further reduce especially when labs are sending their technicians to collect samples from homes. The new price slab will not impact big labs though.”On Friday, at least 2,161 RT-PCR tests were administered in Gurugram, while 901 tests were conducted through rapid antigen kits. Till now nearly 265, 937 samples have been tested in Gurugram, of which more than one lakh tested have been through antigen detection kits, as her data by the district health department.As reported by HT on September 24, the daily collection of RT-PCR samples in the city has plunged to nearly 1,000, sometimes even fewer, in government facilities. Data shows that with walk-in testing allowed from September 8, both government and private labs have had, however, witnessed an upward trajectory in testing number. The district health department had administered 1,900 RT-PCR tests – the highest tests in a single day, on September 14.“The health department has been collecting around 1,000 samples daily on an average for RT-PCR testing. In private labs too, the footfall is high. Bringing down the testing cost would mean increased footfall in private labs, especially when getting a test without a doctor’s prescription now allowed,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-reduces-cost-of-rt-pcr-testing-to-1-200/story-XYzKHeMWst0P3LTiGOIZ8O.html
02-10-2020||City||Gurugram: Shifting of high-tension power cables commences on Delhi-Gurgaon e-way||Gurugram: After nearly six-month delay, the National Highways Authority of India has started the process of shifting the two high-tension overhead power cables on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway near Kherki Daula. The shifting of these cables was required for the construction of cloverleaf tower that will connect the Dwarka Expressway, commonly known as Northern Peripheral Road, with the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) on other side of the highway. RK Mishra, project director, L&T, which is the NHAI contractor for the project, said that the entire shifting process would be carried out in the next 10 days. “After the shifting of cables, work on cloverleaf can be carried out and there would be no further delay in its construction,” said Mishra. NHAI officials said that the process for removal of power cables started on Thursday and the cables would be installed again on October 8. The shifting of overhead cables was supposed to be carried out in March this year, the officials said.A senior NHAI official said that they had received the go-ahead from the Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) and the work started after getting approval from traffic police and other agencies. “The stringing of these cables will be carried out on October 8,” he said, on the condition of anonymity. The NHAI officials said that the delay in the shifting of these high-tension power lines was hampering the construction of crucial cloverleaf tower. The officials privy to the matter said that various agencies of the state government and NHAI worked in tandem to resolve issues concerning the shifting of these cables and intervention from the state government also played a crucial role in resolution of the matter. The NHAI officials said that apart from these two overhead cables, some power transmission lines need to be shifted from two other places and they will pursue the matter with the authorities concerned to expedite their shifting as well. “The work on trumpet tower is also slowed because of delay in shifting of cables and we hope it will happen soon,” said the NHAI official quoted above. The Dwarka Expressway will connect Kherki Daula and Shiva temple at Mahipalpur through the 29- km expressway being developed by NHAI. The road will have a toll plaza and it will ensure reduction of traffic on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-shifting-of-high-tension-power-cables-commences-on-delhi-gurgaon-e-way/story-lVOeHTSOsuICqVbCvj8hVM.html
02-10-2020||Gurugram||Decision on school reopening to be taken after consultations next week, says Haryana education minister||The state education minister on Friday said the final decision regarding the graded opening of schools in Haryana will be taken only after a round of consultations with officials next week. The minister’s announcement comes on the day when the Gurugram administration, in line with the recent reopening guidelines released by the ministry of home affairs (MHA), allowed cinema halls, multiplexes to open in the city after October 15. Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal said before arriving at a decision on opening schools he will meet officials next week for consultations. “As of now, we have not made a decision in this regard. I’ll be heading to Chandigarh on Monday and will meet the officials concerned on Tuesday to discuss the various aspects before a decision is taken about opening schools,” said Pal.Schools across the country were closed in March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In Haryana, government schools had opened for students of classes 9 to 12 for academic guidance sessions on September 21. Last month, the state government had also conducted a demo run in two government schools in Karnal and Sonepat as part of which a limited number of students, with consent from their parents, took part in four classes of one-hour each for different subjects. The remaining students had joined the class through the online mode.An official in the education minister’s office privy to the developments said that the state had been carrying out preparatory work for reopening of schools for some time now. He said that whenever a final decision is taken, the school would be able to start schools without delay. “We conducted a demo run in some schools before initiating academic guidance visits. These visits have been going well. Teachers across the state were also asked to get tested for Covid-19 as a precautionary measure. Funds for sanitisation have already been allocated to schools. On the ground, our preparations are in place. Whenever a final decision is taken by the state government, we will be able to respond to it proactively,” said the official. He added that the government had been collecting feedback from parents and a final decision will be taken with due consultation following which the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the Central government will be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/decision-on-school-reopening-to-be-taken-after-consultations-next-week-says-haryana-education-minister/story-PGGhoungQsbGK7eRVKM4TO.html

02-10-2020||Gurugram||First merit list for undergraduate admissions in Haryana out||The first merit list for admission to undergraduate courses in government colleges in Haryana was released on Thursday evening. Students whose names are mentioned in the merit list have time till October 6 to submit the fee online as per the revised admission schedule. The second merit list is expected to come out on October 8.Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said while the first merit list had been declared, the payment gateway was yet to be made operational until Friday evening. The college’s nodal admission officer said that the state higher education department was working towards the creation of two payment gateways.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal, Government College in Sector 9, said the merit list had been prepared on the basis of the college, course, and subjection combination preferences shared by students at the time of filling the forms. “ “ Based on the results and preferences shared by students, the merit list has been prepared. While the merit list is out, the payment gateway hasn’t been started till now. The payment option will be made available soon after which students will be able to submit the fee online,” said Yadav.Among the changes introduced this year, the option of upgrading to a better college has been done away with. Applicants admitted in a particular course during the first merit list will not be allowed to change their course/subjects even if seats remain vacant after the first merit list. “No upward mobility of preference is allowed. Such applicants can make subject/faculty change as per the schedule only after the process of open merit lists/open counselling is over subject to the availability of seats,” as per the admission directives shared on Friday.Further, as per the revised admission rules, if an applicant has been offered admission to a particular course in the first merit list and (s)he does not submit the fee, then (s)he will not be considered in the second merit list.“Until last year, a student had the option of moving to a college of preference if they made it to the college in subsequent merit lists. This time, however, this option is not available. If a student makes it to the merit list of a college, their name will not appear in subsequent merit lists,” said Yadav.Such candidates will be considered in open merit list only subject to the availability of seats, he added. Open merit lists are created after the final merit list. On the basis of the physical presence of students in the counselling, colleges prepare merit lists on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/first-merit-list-for-undergraduate-admissions-in-haryana-out/story-fKEX1jNaW9EpzvjhOxkWRL.html

The cycle track, jointly developed by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), along Netaji Subhash Marg, was thrown open to the public with a cyclothon, in which more than 1,500 people took part on early Friday morning.“The first cyclothon of this year was organised on the occasion of World Car Free Day on September 22 along Golf Course Road. At that time, the idea of building a special cycle track came up. This cycle track is dedicated to the common man and we are appealing to the citizens to continue using it so that there is no encroachment on the track and cyclists can keep availing the facility to the fullest,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA. With a flyover and an underpass being constructed at HCC, the cycle track currently runs from the GMDA office in Sector 44 to Subhash Chowk. Once both the projects are completed, the cycle track would be extended by another 200 metres to HCC Metro station, said officials.The track is the first project under GMDA and MCG’s plan for creating 650 kilometres of dedicated cycle tracks in the city. In its next phase, GMDA is planning on making similar cycle tracks from HCC towards major road networks such as MG Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, and Signature Towers.Besides participants, local politicians, officials from MCG, GMDA, Raahgiri Foundation, Gurugram Police, and the district administration were also present for the event. “Gurugram’s attempt to create the city’s first dedicated and physically segregated cycle track is an attempt at the right direction. It also shows that our roads have space for walking and cycling if we are a little more creative in our approach. If we are able to built-up upon this initiative, it can be a game-changer for Gurugram,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri Foundation, one of the organisers for the event.As per an official release by GMDA on its social media account, more such initiatives would be held in the city under the aegis of ministry of housing and urban affairs through various national campaigns such as Cycles4Change and Streets4People. Prior to conducting the event, MCG officials had removed all illegal encroachments from the stretch. GMDA had placed concrete bollards on patches of the stretch where service lanes were absent to safeguard cyclists from vehicles, while a blank boundary walls along the cycle stretch was also painted with graffiti by officials of Kalagram.“I find cycling in Gurugram to be extremely unsafe. There were practically no facilities or infrastructure for cyclists before this. When I came to know that a dedicated cycle track is being launched, I cycled outside my condominium for the first time in 12 years. If the facility continues to be safeguarded for cyclists, I will use it on a weekly basis,” said Anand Rungta, a resident of Sector 47.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-first-cycle-track-between-huda-city-centre-and-subhash-chowk-opens-to-public/story-ZvG8QnbROU3iy81HxCo6qJ.html
02-10-2020||City||Gurugram: New Covid-19 cases show decline of 23% in a week||Gurugram: The district has witnessed a decline of nearly 23% in the number of new Covid-19 cases in the past seven days (September 25 – October 1) as compared to the cases recorded during the previous week (September 18-24), according to the data from the district health department. Health officials have attributed the decline in cases to strict surveillance of home-isolated Covid-19 patients to prevent them from transmitting the infection to others in the family. Between September 25 and October 1, a total of 1,819 new cases were confirmed, while 2,364 new cases were reported in the previous week. The officials said that in nearly 70% of the new confirmed cases during September 18-24, all the family members were being confirmed positive after one of them contracted the virus.Notably, September reported the maximum caseload of nearly 41% (or 8,500 cases), when the total count was 20, 417 on September 29. “Strict surveillance of home-isolated patients by maintaining regular contact through calls and home visits by doctors and ground team of health workers has been a successful preventive measure,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer. “The proportion of cases where the entire family is contracting the virus has come down. It requires more data evaluation to derive a conclusion,” he said. Presently, 2,141 patients are under home isolation, which is almost 90% of the total active cases (2,366) in the district. On Friday, 261 new cases were confirmed, taking the total count of people infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus to 21,168 in Gurugram. Of the active cases, 22 patients are in district Covid care centre, while 203 are hospitalised. Two deaths were also confirmed on Friday, taking the Covid-19 toll to 176. Following Haryana government’s directive to increase surveillance of home-isolated Covid patients, the Gurugram health department constituted a district monitoring committee for such patients. Thirty doctors — six MBBS and 24 ayurvedic — have been appointed who operate separately from the existing rapid response teams. These doctors visit home-isolated patients to ensure they get proper treatment. “The surveillance of home isolated patients has been increased. Simultaneously, we are retaining the testing. The cumulative number of tests administered by government and private labs are on average 3,000 per day,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. According to Yadav, the daily growth rate of the cases is 0.99%, while the average positivity rate is 7.65% now. “Cases are now doubling every 64 days. It has improved from 40 days, which was reported in mid-September,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-new-covid-19-cases-show-decline-of-23-in-a-week/story-3icG8hZh8kv7FIiiH4gpcP.html

Mortified at the ill-treatment meted out to her, us and other members of the family, she committed suicide today by hanging herself”. The sub-divisional officer of police (SDoP) Seetaram Yadav said, “The woman’s nieces who gave their statements to police said that the woman was not raped but molested.

The party, while announcing protests over the next few weeks, reiterated the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will enact its own farm and labour laws to negate central laws. Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat led the agitation at Lasalgaon in Nashik. “The farm laws passed by the Narendra Modi government will crush the framework of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) which has been constructed with a lot of efforts in the interest of farmers,” he said. Public works department minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan led the bullock cart march in Nanded. “The MVA government has formed a sub-committee to decide how to safeguard the interest of farmers. The Modi government is like East India Company in the pre-Independence era. A few industrialists are looting this country with the help of the government in Centre,” he said. City Congress president Eknath Gaikwad led the protest in Mumbai, MP Rajiv Satav in Hingoli, women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur and animal husbandry and dairy development minister Sunil Kedar in Wardha, and minister of state for home Satej Patil in Kolhapur, among others.

02-10-2020||City||Chadha’s stolen laptop recovered, 2 arrested||New Delhi: Two days after Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha’s laptop was stolen from his car in Naraina Vihar, the Delhi Police have arrested two men from south Delhi’s Madangir and recovered the laptop. The two men are involved in multiple cases of theft across Delhi, police said. Police identified the two men as Deepak, 28, and Bharat, 26, both residents of Inderpuri JJ colony. While Deepak has been involved in cases of robbery, theft, excise act and gambling, Bharat has two past cases of theft and sexual assault against him. AAP spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA, Chadha, had reported the theft on Monday night. The incident took place when Shivam Aggarwal, a staffer at Chadha’s office in the Delhi Jal Board — of which Chadha is the vice-chairperson — had parked his car outside his house in west Delhi’s Naraina Vihar. During investigations, the police had obtained CCTV camera footage, in which two men were seen stealing the laptop from Chadha’s car. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said they suspected that the gulel or thak-thak gangs were involved, and deployed their informants to track similar criminals active in the area. “On Thursday, we received information that the suspects belong to Madangir. On this, a trap was laid near BRT Road in Madangir Village, and around 8.40pm on Thursday, two suspects were intercepted,” Thakur said. “A search led to the recovery of two stolen laptops, two stolen cellphones and a catapult used to break the glass of cars. It was later confirmed that one of the stolen laptop belongs to Chadha,” he said. During interrogation, the two men told police they work as daily wage labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chadha-s-stolen-laptop-recovered-2-arrested/story-BVzWU9ZCLXlnUgmZA3KaYI.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn to streamline Covid-19 hospitalisation process||Amid a spike in the number of fatalities related to Covid-19 in the past month, the Chandigarh health department is streamlining the process to expedite shifting of patients who are in home isolation to hospitals in case their condition deteriorates.The city has been divided into five zones with dedicated rapid response teams in each zone that will respond to the emergency after receiving calls through helpdesk numbers. At present, there are 1,881 active cases in the city, and in each zone, there are about 250-300 patients in home isolation, some of whom may require hospitalisation at any stage.In comparison to 41 Covid-19 casualties in August, Chandigarh witnessed 106 deaths in September, though new cases started declining after a major surge in mid-September. While the seven-day average growth rate of infections has dropped to 1.4% from as high as 5% in early August, the fatality rate has jumped to 1.4% from 1.1% in just a week. Experts warn that there is a lag of one to two weeks between the peak of cases and deaths, so fatalities due to the mid-September surge will continue for a few days.Immediate responseA senior UT official privy to the development said patients who will complain of decreased oxygen saturation levels and difficulty in breathing will get immediate response and will be shifted to the Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, or Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32.“The patients requiring emergency will contact the rapid response teams activated in each zone, who in turn will ensure that the ambulance is sent to the particular address and the patient is shifted to the hospital concerned. The doctors on duty will examine the patients and take a call on whether they require short-term or long-term hospitalisation,” said the official.As the patients may require hospitalisation for moderate symptoms, arrangements have been made at GMSH-16, while GMCH-32 already has a Covid-19 facility.UT health secretary Arun Gupta confirmed the department is developing a protocol for immediately shifting patients who require hospitalisation.“This is being done to ensure that in case of any emergency, patients do not face any problem. In turn, it will help decrease the fatality rate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-to-streamline-covid-19-hospitalisation-process/story-1Vs3Lb85DG4vf0Ntzic8fN.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Street vendors want curbs on weekly markets lifted, write to L-G||Street vendors in the national capital have demanded that all weekly markets be allowed to open as usual as all other commercial activities have now been permitted by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority(DDMA). This comes a day after the DDMA allowed only two weekly markets to function in each municipal zone under the guidelines of Unlock 5.Weekly markets in Delhi were among the first set of commercial activities to be shut by the government in mid-March, to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). While a majority of commercial activities have been permitted, restrictions on weekly markets continue. The National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) has written to Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal requesting that all weekly markets be permitted. Despite repeated attempts, L-G’s office did not respond on the matter.Street vendors’ associations say the current order will adversely impact the livelihood of lakhs of vendors, as although weekly markets were given permission to operate in August itself, the nod came with several riders and restrictions. Arbind Singh, national coordinator of NASVI, said, “When gyms, restaurants and other commercial activities have been allowed, why not street vending? Our business is done in open spaces. The government’s decision to restrict the number of weekly markets is adversely impacting the livelihood of lakhs of vendors.” Singh said as per a conservative estimate, there are over 300 weekly markets in the city. Each municipal zone has about eight to 10 weekly markets daily. Rajiv Kumar Gupta, president of a weekly market in Madhu Vihar, said, “I have nearly 200 vendors associated with me. We organise markets in Madhu Vihar, Kalyanpuri, and other places. For the past six months, it has been a struggle to make ends meet. When other commercial activities have been allowed, weekly markets too should be allowed. There are usually about seven to nine weekly markets daily in a zone. The government should rethink its order.” Gupta said due to the pandemic, the size of stalls is smaller now as social distancing has to be maintained in the markets. Singh said street vendors will stage a protest if weekly markets are continued to be restricted. “They (vendors) were given no financial assistance during the pandemic. They are now not allowed to earn their livelihood. How will they take care of their families?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/street-vendors-want-curbs-on-weekly-markets-lifted-write-to-l-g/story-h5xedmlAdh0l4Du3DNAjxJ.html

02-10-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Cinemas, multiplexes allowed to resume operations from October 15||Almost seven months after they were shut to prevent the spread of Covid-19, cinemas and multiplexes in Gurugram would be allowed to open from October 15 onwards, the district administration said on Friday. An order issued by deputy commissioner, Gurugram, stated that cinemas, theatres and multiplexes will be allowed to open with 50 percent seating capacity in areas outside containment zone in accordance with the Centre’s guidelines for Unlock 5 that were issued on September 30.The order of the district administration stated that the standard operating procedures(SOPs) for the reopening of cinemas, theatres and multiplexes will be issued by the union ministry of information and broadcasting. The administration has also allowed entertainment parks to resume operations after October 15. For such establishments, SOPs will be issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, the order stated.The opening of cinema halls and multiplexes is being seen as a positive development by mall operators, who said that this was another indication that situation was moving towards normalcy. “PVR Cinemas operate from Ambience Malls and we have made all arrangements for following the safety protocols in multiplexes. All norms pertaining to social distancing, such as 50 percent occupancy of seats will be followed strictly,” said Vijay Aima, vice president, Ambience Mall. Majority of malls in the city have multiplexes and these were the preferred hub for entertainment for the residents before the onset of Covid-19 pandemic. A statement released by PVR Cinemas on Twitter on Friday said, “Social distancing will be maintained between seats, regular sanitisation of audis between shows, contactless food purchases and similar measures would be taken for a safe experience of moviegoers.”Owners of single screen cinemas, which mostly cater to blue-collar workers, who migrated in large numbers during the lockdown, said that resuming operations will help their employees get back on feet. “We have a capacity of around 500 seats and our theatre is large enough to ensure social distancing. Only 20 per cent of our seats usually got filled even prior to the pandemic and this will ensure safety of patrons. Right now our priority is to get the theatre cleaned, sanitised and make it ready for operations from October 15,” said Bhanu Pratap Singh, manager, Raj Cinema, which is located on Old Delhi-Gurgaon road. Meanwhile, the directions issued by district administration further said that social, academic, sports entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions will be allowed beyond the limit of 100 persons from October 15 onwards, outside the containment zones. As per the directions, in closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 200 persons. And all social distancing norms should be followed, it said.The swimming pools being used for training of sportspersons will be permitted to open from October 15 for which the SOP will be issued later. The district administration will also allow business to business (B2B) exhibitions in open areas, the order said. A spokesperson from the district administration said that the guidelines issued on Friday are in line with directions issued by ministry of home affairs. “The implementation would be based on the standard operating procedures issued by various Central ministries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-cinemas-multiplexes-allowed-to-resume-operations-from-october-15/story-LkCFbK6vJxp5Uv6di9CgKN.html
02-10-2020||City||Gurugram: GMDA officials asked to cycle to work||Gurugram: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has directed its staff to travel to work on bicycles throughout October to understand through personal experience the challenges faced by cyclists in the city. During the launch of the city’s first bicycle track along Netaji Subhash Marg on Friday, VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, said that it is important that their staff have a first-hand experience of the problems faced by cyclists on a daily basis, as the authority is planning to add around 650 kilometres of cycle tracks across the city.“One idea is to sensitise officials about the need of cyclists in the city by giving them a first-hand experience. There are multiple issues such as pollution, dust, potholes, safety, prioritization of vehicular traffic over cyclists, among other inconveniences that cyclists face every day. When the officials are planning to make more cycle tracks in the city, they need to factor in all these things before proceeding,” said Kundu.Kundu further said that the cycle stand launched outside the GMDA office near Huda City Centre “is just symbolic” and the public body will soon have a proper parking facility within the premises as well.“All officials, barring those with medical conditions, have been directed to commute to the office on a bicycle. In between, if they have any official work that requires field visit or inspection, they can use GMDA’s vehicles to commute,” said Kundu.Kundu said that if an official, without having any medical condition, does not come to the office on a cycle, he or she would be asked to give an explanation.“Although this is not an official directive, it is not going to be voluntary either. While I understand some officials come to the office from great distances, they can travel to a colleague’s house, located close to the GMDA office, in their personal vehicles or taxi and subsequently, cycle to the office together. The overall idea is that even if officials travel on cycle for a short distance, their first-hand experience of the problems faced by cyclists will be in the back of their mind while planning any future cycle tracks,” said Kundu.The 9.6-kilometre cycle track along Netaji Subhash Marg is located adjacent to the GMDA office, near Huda City Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-gmda-officials-asked-to-cycle-to-work/story-DaFGcjyuct3WxRTAeaqpsJ.html

He further stated that when the alleged incident took place, he was in Sri Lanka to shoot a film.In a statement released on Friday, Kashyap’s lawyer Priyanka Khimani said, “Kashyap has provided documentary proof of the fact that throughout August 2013 he was away in Sri Lanka in connection with the shooting of one of his films. Kashyap has categorically denied that any such alleged incident ever took place and has also denied all allegations levelled against him.”“These sudden, belated allegations of an alleged incident of August 2013 have been widely publicised by the complainant for the purpose of vilifying Kashyap, irrespective of the outcome of the judicial process,” Khimani said.“Kashyap is apprehensive that now that the falsity of her allegation has been established, she will alter her version of events in the investigative process as well. Kashyap is distressed with the false and reckless allegations made against him that have caused pain to him, his family and his fans. Kashyap intends to vigorously pursue the legal remedies available to him,” added the statement.The actor had recently made allegations that Kashyap had behaved inappropriately with her. The complainant in her statement to police said that Kashyap had called her to his flat at Yari Road in Andheri (West) in August 2013 to have a discussion about casting her in one of his upcoming films and allegedly sexually assaulted her.Following her complaint, a case was registered against Kashyap under sections 376 (I) (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with an intent to outrage her modesty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Versova police station on September 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/anurag-kashyap-denies-allegations-of-sexual-assault-says-was-shooting-in-sri-lanka/story-naFVBaVYPWuWMeE6barbrI.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||Why Maharashtra farmers don’t trade APMCs for private firms||Even as the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has stayed the implementation of the three Central legislations on farm sector reforms amid strong opposition from farmers’ organisations as well as the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Maharashtra has already ended the monopoly of the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC) by adopting major reforms in agriculture marketing since 2006. Maha attempts, results Maharashtra has 305 APMCs, most of which are controlled by traders and politicians. The APMC Act mandates these markets must have facilities such as auction halls, warehouses, weigh bridges, shops for retailers, police station, post office, bore-wells, farmer amenity centres and soil-testing laboratory. In 2006, Maharashtra became one of the first few states to adopt the model APMC Act, paving way for opening up of private markets on the lines of APMC and contract farming. In 2016, the state decided to de-regulate fruits, vegetables, onions and potatoes. However, 14 years after Maharashtra adopted the change, APMCs continue to record a turnover of ₹48,000 crore and remain preferred by farmers as they offer price protection. On the other hand, the alternative system, too, has gained ground, with an annual turnover of ₹13,000 crore. De-regulation of fruits, vegetables, onion and potatoes, however, has got tepid response from farmers in the past four years, as their arrival at APMCs have come down by 4-5%, according to an official from the marketing department. Contract farming has not clicked, as farmers claim they don’t get the promised remuneration, amid doubts over the quality of their produce, as there is no provision in the law to protect their interests. Officials claim contract farming is limited to hybrid seed farming and poultry business, whereas de-regulation of fruits, vegetables, onions and potatoes also got limited response in the past four years. They believe reforms take time to show results, citing how the changes brought about in 2006 are now showing results. Why the protests? Farmers feel the Centre is trying to hand over agriculture marketing to a few corporates with the help of the three legislations —Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and amendment in Essential Commodities Act 1955. They claim there is no guarantee that the farmer will get at least minimum support price (MSP) for their produce from a private trader, and the dispute mechanism is too weak to give them justice. “The Shanta Kumar committee set up by the Centre to bring reforms in food procurement mechanism has recommended abolishment of MSP. It has also recommended scrapping of the public distribution system (PDS) and system of procuring food grains through Food Corporation of India (FCI). The acts have been brought as another step to implement these recommendations. The only difference is the Centre is not accepting this overtly. Once MSP is abolished, farmers will certainly be exploited,” said Raju Shetti, who heads Swabhimani Paksha, a political outfit that had left National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2017. Ajit Nawale, state general secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha, said the Centre should have considered Maharashtra’s experience before bringing in the legislation. “The APMC law provides a security to farmers that if a buyer doesn’t pay remuneration against the produce, it can be recovered from the trader. In contrast, there is no such security for farmers trading outside APMC. Even in the new Bills, the Centre deliberately chose to remain silent on this aspect. Anyone having a PAN or Aadhaar card can become a trader. Is there any guarantee that the trader will not cheat farmers,” asked Nawale, who was the driving force behind the farmers’ agitation in June 2017 that eventually led then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver scheme. “In Nashik, traders from Kerala and Andhra Pradesh bought onions from us and didn’t pay the remuneration. Despite all efforts, we could not get our money,” he added. “The new Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act says in case of a dispute, the parties can approach a sub-divisional magistrate means deputy district collector, a post considered among the most corrupt in the revenue department,” says Girish Patil, agro-market expert. Under this law, the farmer can sell his finished produce to any merchant anywhere in the country. There will be no compulsion to sell it at APMC.“If the Central government is so sure that farmers would get better price than MSP outside APMC limits and under contract farming, why haven’t they made a provision in any of the bills saying no agreement can be for less than MSP,” asked Vijay Jawandhia, agriculture expert from Vidarbha. According to Jawandhia, ITC, under an initiative called e-Choupal, started procurement of soybeans in the state. They procured soybean from Vidarbha farmers for four years, as the prices in the international market were high and MSP declared by the Central government was low. As soon as prices of soybean in the international market started to decline and MSP comparatively went up, they stopped the procurement. “The point is if a big firm like ITC could not survive the volatile market, how will this dream shown by the Narendra Modi government of forming 10,000 Farmers’ Producer Organisations (FPO) survive,” he asked. A senior official from the state marketing department said the laws are formed on three principles — assurance of weighment, assurance of payment and competitive bidding by means of auction, whereas there is no such security if a farmer chooses to trade outside APMC limits. “This is the reason farmers are opposing the new legislations, as these aspects are not being considered by the Centre even now,” he said. Will it work?Anoop Kumar, principal secretary, state marketing department, said, “Maharashtra has been at the forefront for reforms in agriculture marketing. We have adopted most of the tenets of model APMC 2003. In the exercise of ranking states in marketing reforms, the state was ranked at first position by the NITI Aayog in 2017-18. Even after the facility of direct marketing was made available, big retailers are relying on middlemen and don’t prefer dealing with the farmers directly. This could be the reason farmers may not be getting much profit from direct marketing.” Fresh reforms do provide an alternative to farmers, according to another official from the state marketing department. Sunil Pawar, managing director, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board, that aims to coordinate the functioning of APMCs and their development, agreed. “The annual turnover of the alternative marketing system of agriculture produce, adopted in 2006, has reached ₹13,000 crore against the ₹48,000 crore annual turnover of APMCs in the state. We have issued 1,100 direct marketing licences that allow trading outside APMC, 60 private market licences and 50 single licences to traders that allow them to operate anywhere in the state,” Pawar said. With the same approach towards reforms, the state marketing department on August 10 issued a notification for strict implementation of the ordinances that have now been converted into laws by Parliament. “As per the provisions in the ordinances, the farmers are free to market their produce at field, factory, warehouse or cold storage without any hindrance and without any market fee applicable under APMC Act. Any other fee or charges applicable under APMC Act cannot be charged now as per the provisions made in the ordinances. The law and judiciary department has vetted the ordinances and validated its applicability. Though the existence of the APMCs has not been affected by promulgation of the ordinance, the farmers will have a parallel mechanism to get fair prices for their produce,” states the notification issued on August 10. But as farmers’ bodies decided to fight it and got support from the Congress and NCP, the MVA government, comprising the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP, on Wednesday took a step back and not only stayed its implementation, but also formed a cabinet sub-committee to look into concerns and objections. Having powers of a quasi-judicial authority, state marketing minister Balasaheb Patil, who is also from the NCP, conducted a hearing on an application filed by another NCP leader Shashikant Shinde and passed an order of interim stay on implementation of the notification. He has scheduled the next hearing on October 27. It was followed by a cabinet decision of setting up a sub-committee of ministers. Vilas Shinde, chairman, Sahyadri Farms, a farmer produce company, said that allowing farmers to sell produce outside APMC is giving bargaining power to them. “The provisions in the new laws are logical as both the traders and farmers should get the rights to decide what is better for them. We are moving towards fair trade.” Sahyadri Farms was set up in 2010 and has 8,000 farmers as members. They trade in fruits and vegetables and mostly export the commodities. The annual turnover of the firm is ₹450 crore. Vishnu Harak, a farmer from Shivde village, Nashik, said, “There are no facilities in APMCs and the governing body is found involved in corruption. Despite that, 90% farmers still believe in APMC because it offers security. We know that we will get our money against the produce,” he said. He also said the system of private trading is not for small farmers as traders don’t approach them. “Even if traders approach a marginal farmer they quote a lower price for produce and the farmer agrees, considering it saves transportation cost and trouble at APMC,” said Harak, who has a two-acre plot and prefers vegetable crops. He has taken tomato crops for this season. “Contract farming is more visible in vegetable seed, grapes and poultry farming. The production of most of the hybrid seeds such as cotton, jowar etc. comes under contract farming. In fruits, farming for grapes is being done under this system as they are fragile, difficult to handle and contract farming is beneficial for both the sides — farmers as well as the traders,” said a senior official from the state agriculture department. “Contract farming could not be successful in the state as the weather situation is exactly opposite to foreign countries. Maharashtra often faces natural calamities such as drought, floods, hailstorms, which affect quality of the produce. One of the major clauses of a contract is related to quality,” Nawale said. Despite opposition by many farmer organisations and political parties, no upsurge is observed in Maharashtra compared to Punjab and Haryana. NCP chief Sharad Pawar in a press conference held recently said wheat is a major crop in Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) procures 90% of their wheat produce at MSP. This is the reason they are more aggressive towards the apprehensions of MSP to be eliminated. In Maharashtra, major crops are sugarcane, cotton, soybean, tur and paddy. Harak said, “We don’t know yet why the new laws will hurt farmers’ interests. Those fighting for our rights should also inform us the reason behind it, so that we can take a stand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-maharashtra-farmers-don-t-trade-apmcs-for-private-firms/story-nECd9lQ9ve8FyTY5rhWHXJ.html

02-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count rises by 15,591 to 1,416,513; toll is 37,480||The trend of Maharashtra witnessing comparatively low Covid-19 cases every day for the past two weeks continued on Friday as the state reported 15,591 infections, taking the tally to 1,416,513. The state was routinely reporting more than 20,000 daily in the beginning of September.The state’s toll rose to 37,480 with an addition of 424 fatalities on Friday. However, of these, 272 deaths were reported in the past 48 hours, 65 were from last week and 87 from the period before that. Active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra stood at 260,876, 18.41% of the state’s overall cases.Although the daily caseload is low, state officials are wary that there could be a surge in infections after fresh relaxations come into effect from October 5. Officials said cases have increased every time lockdown restrictions have been eased since June 3. The state has allowed restaurants and bars to reopen from October 5, but run at 50% of their capacity. The government has also allowed all industrial and manufacturing units of non-essential units in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to start operations. Trains beginning and ending their journey within the state have been allowed to run from Wednesday.A senior health department official, on condition of anonymity, said they won’t be surprised if a surge in cases in witnessed again. “Cases go up rapidly after relaxations are implemented. This is because relaxations allow more people to step out of their homes and they are exposed to the virus and ultimately they get infected,” said the official. “This doesn’t mean relaxations shouldn’t be given, as we cannot expect people to confine themselves to their homes for months.”Since June 3, when the government began easing lockdown restrictions under its ‘Mission Begin Again’, the state has reported 1,341,653 cases till October 2, as against 74,860 infections reported from March 9 – when the first case was reported – till June 3.

Maharashtra has the highest Covid-19 toll across the country, with Tamil Nadu a distant second with 9,586 deaths (as on Thursday).In terms of case fatality rate (CFR) Maharashtra is second behind Punjab. While the state’s CFR is 2.65%, Punjab had a rate of 3% (as on Thursday).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-case-count-rises-by-15-591-to-1-416-513-toll-is-37-480/story-sV0BlPIhXS0zJGaAM0ehFM.html

02-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court directs Maharashtra government to ensure that Covid-19 pandemic guidelines are followed by private hospitals||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC), while observing that extraordinary situations require extraordinary measures, directed the state government to provide proper facilities to patients and ensure the upgradation of infrastructure as per the guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act for Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients at government and private hospitals amid the pandemic. The observations were made after it took note of a news report about a pregnant woman from Nanded being turned away by a private hospital in Aurangabad late at night as her case papers had been drawn at a government hospital. The woman was forced to return to the government hospital where she delivered her child. The court initiated a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) to ensure that hospitals do not turn away patients regardless of where they were originally admitted. A division bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and SD Kulkarni, while hearing the suo moto PIL, was informed by amicus curiae (a neutral lawyer appointed by the court) advocate NV Gaware that as per the court’s direction, he inquired about pregnant woman’s incident. In his report, Gaware submitted that the woman had initially got admitted to the government hospital at Aurangabad but left the hospital without informing the authorities. The woman then approached a private hospital, but after she was unable to provide the case papers drawn up at the government hospital, they turned her away. Gaware submitted that though the woman’s family was willing to pay the hospital charges, the medical facility refused to admit her and that is how the incident came to be reported in the media. Gaware further submitted that after speaking to the authorities concerned in the government and to private hospitals, he arrived at the conclusion that neither of the hospitals were at fault. He, however, added that after the woman was turned away by the private hospital, she was admitted to the gynaecology department of the government hospital, where she delivered her baby the next morning and the mother and the child were healthy and safe. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that though the private hospital was not at fault in this case, there had been many complaints about hospitals run by private trusts refusing to admit non-Covid patients. The bench said that there was a clear violation of the May 5 guidelines issued by the government in this regard. Private hospitals were not admitting patients to the 80% regulated beds that had been taken over by the government as per the guidelines issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. In light of these submissions, the court directed the state to not only ensure that private hospitals abide by the guidelines, but also to make sure that proper facilities and upgraded infrastructure was available in government as well as private hospitals, so that no patient – whether seeking admission for Covid-19 or non-Covid treatment or belonging to the middle or poor strata of the society – was turned away. “We hope and trust that the state and its authorities shall ensure the strict implementation of the guidelines issued from time to time. The state government is duty bound to implement the said guidelines in its true letters and spirit and shall not leave any stone unturned to implement the same,” observed the bench. It disposed of the suo moto PIL after expressing satisfaction with the inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-directs-maharashtra-government-to-ensure-that-covid-19-pandemic-guidelines-are-followed-by-private-hospitals/story-czpCb0jyHDgb6TzKHW3PJI.html

Mahadev Hari Patel underwent a heart transplant in 2018 at Fortis Hospital. Last month, he started having breathing troubles but considering he did not go out of his house since the Covid-19 outbreak in March, his son presumed it to be a post-transplantation complication. However, on September 16, when Patel was taken to a nearby nursing home, he tested positive for Covid-19. The infection has severely affected his lungs due to acute pneumonia, and on September 17 he was transferred to Global Hospital, Parel. “When we ran a CT scan, we found that his lungs were filled with fluid due to pneumonia. We observed that due to the infection, his transplanted heart had also been affected. His complete respiratory system was collapsing,” said Dr Prashant Borade, head of critical care unit, Global Hospital. Patel’s oxygen saturation dropped below 60% and he was put on a ventilator. While at the hospital, Patel suffered from a stroke which further complicated his condition. Due to the seizure, his brain had been affected too. Later, his kidneys also started deteriorating. Along with Covid-19, the 56-year-old’s body was going into multiple-organ failure. The main challenge for doctors was to treat the coronavirus while his immunity low so that his body didn’t reject the transplanted heart. Typically, doctors try to target Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, by strengthening the immunity. But in an organ recipient, strong immunity forces the body to reject the transplanted organ, identifying it as a foreign body. Post-transplant, patients are put on immunosuppressants — medication that lowers their immunity, which makes the treatment process of patients with Covid-19 most challenging. “Immunosuppressants are important for transplant patients, as they help the body accept a foreign organ. So, we had to find a balance between keeping his immunity low and treating the patient with Covid-19 who already had acute pneumonia,” said Dr Borade. After eight days on ventilation, Patel recovered from the coronavirus infection and multiple-organ failure. He was discharged from the hospital on September 24. “I never thought that I would be able to see my father again. Thankfully, he is doing well now,” said his son Dinesh Patel. “Due to the chance of contracting the infection, we never allowed him to go out. We don’t know how he got the infection as none of our family members is Covid-19 positive,” he added. The team at the hospital is now planning to publish the rare case study in a medical journal. “We are planning to publish it in a journal as we believe it is one of the rarest incidents in which a heart transplant patient with Covid-19 survived after multiple-organ failure,” said Dr Borade.Doctors believe the patient might have contracted the infection from an asymptomatic family member. “As they are kept on immunosuppressants, they are most vulnerable to the virus. But, it is quite rare that a heart recipient with multiple-organ failure recovered within eight days,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician and in-charge of private hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-heart-recipient-with-multi-organ-failure-recovers-from-covid-19-in-8-days/story-L8iVw3oRjs2nUaww93YJjK.html

The minister was on a surprise inspection visit to the hospital in the wee hours on Friday. Minister for PWD Gopal Bhargava, one of the senior-most ministers in the cabinet, inspected the civil hospital at Garhakota, his hometown, in Sagar district of Bundelkhand region at 2.30 am, as per his comments. In his Facebook post, Bhargava said, “I had been receiving complaints from people for several days regarding the absence of doctors and other staff and also want of facilities like X-ray and medicines at the hospital. Accompanied by some people of Garhakota, I conducted a surprise inspection at the hospital at 2.30 am. I called out to the staff repeatedly but there was no doctor, compounder, nurse, paramedical staff or even the peon.”Also read: India encourages indigenous vaccine production, says PM Modi“I am just thinking how irresponsible people there are that a minister of state government is awake at 2.30 am and the staff in his hometown’s hospital is missing. There is a similar situation at a primary health centre at Rehli and the hospital at Shahpur. I have decided to inspect these hospitals at least twice in day and night whenever I am staying at my hometown and will take action against those who are found involved in such carelessness. During the pandemic time, such carelessness in emergency services like health can’t be tolerated. On one hand, a labourer is involved in hard work to earn Rs 200 per day and on the other doctors and officers taking a ‘fat salary’ of Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per day are enjoying life in their air-conditioned houses,” the minister commented. Also read: Hathras - Making a mockery of the idea of justiceIn the video that the minister posted, he could be seen calling out to the staff members but all in vain as no one is seen responding to his calls before he rides a two-wheeler to get back home. State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Minister Gopal Bhargava must be appreciated for his candid admission. What he has said has corroborated the Congress’s stand that the health services in BJP government are in shambles and the government is doing nothing to address the issue”.Collector Deepak Singh said, “I have asked the chief medical and health officer (CMHO) to institute an inquiry and take action if someone is found guilty”.Commissioner, directorate of health services, Madhya Pradesh, Sanjay Goyal said, “As per CMHO, a doctor who was supposed to be on duty has told him that he and another staff were on the other side of the hospital when the minister reached there and that a delivery also took place in the night. However, since the video can’t be overlooked I have instructed the CMHO to issue a show-cause notice to the concerned staff to seek their explanation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/no-doctor-or-even-peon-mp-minister-finds-hospital-staff-missing-posts-video-on-social-media/story-y86Pb7aAzETfrkqNSPRlNO.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: Young artists have to paint a picture of positivity||Survival a challengeArtists need social support to sustain themselves. This cannot be more evident than in the times of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many artists, both from performing as well as visual arts, are struggling to strike a balance between the idealist call from within to put in efforts to ‘comfort the disturbed’ on the one hand and with the challenge to sustain themselves without exhibitions, performances or shootings. That said, even before the pandemic, no system existed to extend financial support to the artists either in exchange for their services or as a token to encourage them. Even when it comes to selection of art pieces for shows, those who specialise in realism and have an excellent grip over their mediums get rejected as contemporary art is given preference, even though it has a vague and subjective basis. KanwaljeetDon’t be tricity-centricThere are certain points which the akademi needs to focus on: 1.For the whole calendar year whatever the akademi plans is tricity-centric. This should change. 2.Only two events take place for artists – the annual state exhibition and the Sohan Quadri fellowship. More often than not, artists who know the right people in the art circles are selected. There is no well thought out plan to reach out to all artists, especially raw, young talent, and encourage them to participate. 3.The artists’ directory is still pending for the last three years. 4.The akademi has failed to find or support new talent to introduce and elevate them. 5.The art authorities do not send any communication to Punjab artists regarding art activities and workshops. Parveen Kumar Help those who need it the mostYes, artists have been struggling during the pandemic, especially the freelancers. Students need to be taught marketing skills. Action needs to be taken and from corporates to known names in the field, everyone should reach out to the struggling artists .  Kulpinder Sharma Learnings from couture weekThe success of the India Couture Week 2020 proves that the digital medium can be used effectively in communicating with a vast audience, minus hierarchy. Stakeholders in the arts should focus on digital shows. The Government Art College too should introduce various disciplines, including marketing along with communication to help budding artists showcase their work. Nepotism is the bane of the modern world, but nothing can hide true talent. SK Khosla Why not virual art shows?Artists have no work during the pandemic and it’s time the government announced measures to help them, including virtual art shows and scholarship programmes. Corporates too should step in and offer support to talented young persons. Many of them are suffering hardships. An artist friend of mine has started doing tattoos. I have been lucky because I have another business, but not being able to paint has been very painful. Surinder Kwatra Creativity makes the world go roundMany of us tend to think of art as something of a luxury, but it’s more than that. Artists open the doors for us to an imaginary world, something grander to look forward to. But how many of us understand the problems artists have been facing during the pandemic? People feel art is not a basic necessity but in these times it’s important for us to understand that “art is an effort to create, besides a real world, a more humane world.” And only when we understand this we save our artists and enable them to keep creating objects of beauty, even in these trying times. Ashish BhattacharjeeFame embraces those who work hardWhere there is a will there is a way. No nepotism exists in the tricity art scene. Any artist can achieve fame by working hard. Being innovative, adopting new techniques and learning from the great masters will always stand them in good stead.Remember,success demands perseverance.Sumesh Kumar BadhwarGovt support requiredThere is no dearth of talent but the neglectful attitude of art academies towards budding artists is a problem. The bureaucracy is now handling the affairs of art institutes. Scholarships and other sources of financial help are mostly extended / available only to those who are or know influential people in the art scene. However, in times like this, freelance artists should be supported by the academies and the ministries, and provided financial support by way of workshops and camps. Vigyan Vrat Creative expression smothered Nepotism exists in the very fabric of the society and art is no exception. Many talented artists have given up due to this social malaise. Though there is no hard proof of up and coming artists being treated badly, one does hear about the existence of this evil practice smothering creative expression. Those with power and influence everywhere favour friends and family members. To stop this, the intelligentsia and others in society have to come forward and raise a collective voice against any form of nepotism. Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhNo promoting family or friendsThe Chandigarh administration should come out with a policy disallowing any person in authority in the field of art from promoting a family member or close friend.Avinash GoyalHard work paysPeople do not decide whether they deserve a chance, but God always opens doors to those who can prove themselves. Only a few from the art field have achieved fame. Artists need to understand that this is a field where only talent and hard work survives. No one can stop them from chasing their dreams if they work hard consistently. Ishita Nara Don’t depend on vagaries of the market‘Omnis ars naturae imitatio est’(all art is imitation of nature) and ‘ars est celare artem’(art lies in concealing art). The superb pieces of art -- human beings-- are created in the womb, hidden away from the world.When art is commercialised, it is dependent on the vagaries of the market, where fair means or foul and merit or nepotism are unavoidable if one has to stay ahead of the game. However, sooner than later, excellence does speak for itself and for it to thrive, tricity artists must be motivated and encouraged to exhibit their talent through various fora. Budding artists need motivation with incentives.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaExplore options for international tie-upsBudding artists need to be guided by their colleges about the opportunities they can avail of in future. The government should provide them a platform by holding exhibitions at regular intervals not only to showcase their talent but to help them earn a better living too and achieve success in their field. Options for international tie-ups and collaborations should also be explored. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliCannot promote a family memberI think there can be “favouritism” in theatre and art but certainly not “nepotism”. There’s a difference between the two. We do show preferential treatment to a person or a group of persons in both these cases. In “favouritism” we support someone who may or may not be related to us whereas in “nepotism” we support someone who is either a friend or related to us - using power or money unfairly. Art has no place for nepotism. Gurpreet S Malhotra, KansalPhilanthropists must step upUnlike in Delhi or Mumbai, which are cities with an abundance of private art galleries, public exhibition centres and art lovers, the tricity is totally dependent on the patronage of a few ‘experts.’ Moreover, the gestation period for an artist to establish himself or herself is very long. Hence, there is a need for city philanthropists, including businessmen and industrialists to support budding talent. We need to open up places like the Sector 17 Central Vista and Kalagram for new artists to display their works. This does not mean that artists will not have to struggle, but new avenues will definitely open up for them. The Government College of Art should also simultaneously, open a permanent display hall for struggling artists. The College can charge a percentage fee on all sales, like Sotheby’s for this. Rajiv Boolchand Jain, Zirakpur Merit countsWell connected galleries that choose to go by their family names exhibit the power to make or break young artistes’ independent careers and have become enthusiastic promoters of a selected few while others are found jockeying for attention on social media to build their brands as artists. The need of the hour is to provide equal opportunity based on merit or calibre and demystify the creative tension between emerging and established artists. Art fair committees need to be ethically structured and accountability by these diverse stakeholders should be deemed necessary.

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Night curfew, Sunday curbs removed: Shopkeepers in Ludhiana breathe a sigh of relief ahead of festivals||With the state government abolishing night curfew and Sunday lockdown restrictions after 192 days (since March 23), shopkeepers in the city have finally breathed a sigh of relief.Following the announcement on Thursday, shop owners now hope that the business will be back on track ahead of the upcoming festival season. Amarjit Singh, president of the Model Town Market Association,said, “It is a welcome step by the state government as the traders were reeling under losses due to the night curfew and Sunday lockdown restrictions. Also, the decision to increase gathering limit at events to 100 is an appreciable step as now, weddings can be organised, and people will visit markets.”Citing losses incurred by traders due to low footfall in the markets, the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had earlier warned the government of an agitation if the restrictions are not removed by October 1. General secretary Sunil Mehra and district president Arvinder Makkar said, “Traders were under extreme pressure due to the losses. Now, they will be able to open shops normally with no night curfew restrictions in place. This move by the state government will certainly bring business back on track during the upcoming festival season.”Mehra added that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should conduct a meeting with the traders associations to provide more relief in terms of electricity bills, VAT refunds etc. A shopkeeper in the Ghumar Mandi market area, Babanpreet Singh, said, “The government has finally provided relief to the shopkeepers as large number of customers visit the markets on Sundays only. The traders were seeking abolition of Sunday lockdown restrictions for long time and this comes as a major relief.”Manpreet Singh Bunti, president of Akalgarh Market Garment Association, said, “Most of the customers from other districts visited wholesale markets of the city only on weekends. With Sunday lockdown restrictions in place, our business was hit badly.” Hospitality sector, restaurants welcome relaxations on gathering limitReeling under heavy losses, the hospitality sector has lauded the state government’s decision to increase gathering limit at events from 30 to 100 people. The owners of marriage palaces, restaurants, hotels and tent dealers have been seeking an increase the gathering limit for a long time and agitations were also held by tent dealers association in the past. The owners rued that no bookings are being made as it is impossible to arrange a wedding with just 30 people. President of Marriage Palaces Welfare Association, Amarjit Singh, said, “The state government has provided much needed relief to the sector as our business has been shut since the imposition of curfew on March 23. Now, we have started receiving enquiries from residents and we also expect that the state government will further increase the limit as per directions of the union government. With these restrictions in place, we were not even being able to meet fixed expenses.” Restaurant are also expected to be back on track with abolition of night curfew restrictions. Owner of Basant restaurants, Bhupinder Basant said, “This decision to abolish night curfew restrictions will surely increase the footfall in the restaurants as most customers visit restaurants after 8pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/night-curfew-sunday-curbs-removed-shopkeepers-in-ludhiana-breathe-sigh-of-relief-ahead-of-festivals/story-mWsO4CIM7IOZJq2yFEluxJ.html
02-10-2020||Noida||Garbage on fire went on for hours, agencies unsure who doused it||A major fire broke out near the fragile flood zone of the Hindon river, adjacent to the Hindon elevated road on Friday. According to residents, the fire lasted for many hours until the fire department doused it -- or at least that is what they thought.The Uttar Pradesh pollution control board (UPPCB) claims that they informed the fire department, and the city municipal corporation confirmed that they went along with the fire officials to douse it. The fire department, on the other hand, said neither did they receive any information, nor did they go to the spot. The area is an illegal dumping ground and despite many attempts to control it, it continues unabated. Environmentalists in the area say that many such incidents had been reported from the area in the past few years that have contributed to worsening air quality. “The fire is usually lit by some miscreants in the area, either those who are dumping the waste or scrap collectors or some others. The area is full of flammable material and the fire soon goes out of control,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. “Today’s fire started early morning near river Hindon and raged on for hours before it came to our notice. The UPPCB officials were alerted about the incident and thereafter, the fire was doused.”“We had informed both the corporation and the fire department. The corporation officials said that by the time their sanitary inspector went to the spot, the fire had already been doused,” Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP pollution control board.“Our staff went along with the fire department officials and doused the fire,” said Mithlesh Kumar Singh, city health officer of the municipal corporation.“I confirmed with the two fire stations at Kotwali and Sahibabad, we did not receive information about the fire near the elevated road. So, none of our fire tenders went to the spot,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer.So who doused the fire?“I am deputing one officer to get the fire incident inquired and also directing Ghaziabad development authority and the municipal corporation to take responsibility of any fire incidents in their respective jurisdiction areas,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.In 2015, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had directed that those violating garbage dumping norms be fined ₹20,000 and also told authorities to take strict action in this regard. “We have time and again raised the issue and despite the directions in our petition the instances of burning of garbage near the river have not stopped. In February, there was yet another massive fire in the area and fire tenders had to be called. The fires are generally ignited by ragpickers and scrap dealers who dump waste and flee,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “Since the Raj Nagar Extension is an open area, dumping of garbage and fire at dumps are common occurrence. The fires not only damage the flood plains but also give rise to air pollution which is already on higher side in the city.”“In September, we had four incidents of fire reported in the city,” said UPPCB’s Utsav Sharma “We will impose Rs 5000 penalty in case of a spot fire and Rs 25000 in case bulk waste is set afire. One more complaint of spot fire was received on Friday and we imposed Rs 5000 penalty.”Ghaziabad is on the list of 15 cities in Uttar Pradesh with high levels of air pollution. According to the figures of the UPPCB, the city in 2019 recorded 31 days with “severe” category of air on the air quality index (AQI). It had 67 days with “very poor” air and 112 days with “poor” AQI. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” In his recent visit to Ghaziabad on September 19 and later in a review meeting, Bhure Lal – the chairperson of the Environment (Pollution and Control) Authority (EPCA) had directed Ghaziabad officials to put curbs on burning of waste in wake of approaching winter season when air pollution increases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/garbage-on-fire-went-on-for-hours-agencies-unsure-who-doused-it/story-tLR1wnWyu0Lv4ZXUG30rHI.html
02-10-2020||Noida||Factory owners’ family held hostage, armed robbers with accomplices in police uniform flee with cash and gold worth ₹50 lakh||A gang of armed robbers, including two in police uniform, held a family in Modinagar hostage early Friday and fled with ₹2.35 lakh and jewellery items estimated to be worth ₹50 to 60 lakh. An FIR has been registered at the Modinagar police station. The incident took place around 3AM on Friday when 45-year-old Samir Siddiqui was sleeping in his house at Kidwai Nagar and several men knocked on the door of the house. When his mother, Sanjeeda Khatoon, opened the door, five-six men barged in, oh which two were in police uniform. “My mother was shocked to see the group of men along with two policemen. When she asked the reason, they said that there has been a case of ATM theft and the looted cash is suspected to be hidden at our house. Soon, the two men and the others came up to the first floor and knocked on the door of the room where I, my wife, our two children and my eight-year-old niece were sleeping,” Siddiqui said. Siddiqui runs a factory in the Modinagar industrial area which is engaged in manufacturing weighing scales for commercial vehicles. “I was taken by surprise and asked them the reason, or whether they had any search warrant. They said that a group of police were sitting at the house of the local councillor and had sent them for a search at my house. Soon, they started searching and opened up almirahs and started collecting cash and jewellery items. When I objected, they pointed guns towards my family. It was then that I realised they were robbers,” he added. The gang later tied the hands of the family with cloth and pushed them into a room. “The men were wearing masks usually used as a precaution for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. At least three of them had guns and one had an axe. He told us not to raise our voice, else they will kill my children – son aged two and daughter aged four years. We pleaded with them not to harm anyone and we will keep quiet. They took away ₹2.35 lakh in cash and jewellery which is estimated to be around ₹50-60 lakh. The jewellery belonged to my mother, my wife and my two sisters. I will give an assessment to the police,” he added. According to the family, the robbers were in the house for about 30 to 45 minutes. They added that some locals came by during the early-morning prayer hours and were shocked to see the family tied up. The family was freed and the police were informed. The police on their part maintained that there were four robbers and registered an FIR under IPC sections for robbery and cheating at the Modinagar police station. It should be noted here that in an incident involving more than four robbers, a case of dacoity under IPC section 395 is to be registered. This section carries more stringent punishment.“We lodged the FIR based on the complaint given by the family. If there are more than four robbers involved, we will add appropriate sections to the investigation. We visited the family to get details of the incident and teams have been formed to trace the criminals. So far, we have no clues. The estimate of the jewellery robbed will be given by the family,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, circle officer (Modinagar). Two arrested for dacoity at Avantika The police early Friday arrested two suspects who allegedly looted the family of a departmental store owner on the intervening night of August 22 and 23. The police identified the two suspects as Mohammad Suman, resident of Shastri Park, and Khurshid Alam, a resident of Mayur Vihar, both in Delhi. Soon after the incident, police had levied IPC section 392 (robbery) to the initial FIR but they arrested the suspects under IPC section 395 (dacoity), 397 (robbery, or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity). “About three-four members of the gang are absconding and they will be arrested soon. We have recovered ₹21,500 which they looted from the house, and some documents. The gang targets houses near railway tracks,” said Abhishek Verma, superintendent of police (city). The two suspects were arrested from the railway crossing near Avantika at 3am on Friday. “The robbers who were arrested admitted that there were three-four other accomplices with them during the robbery.

The industry employs 800,000 workers from different parts of the country. The pandemic had hit the industry hard, as many workers left for their homes in other districts and other states. It also suffered a loss of ₹2,000 crore due to slackening demand. However, there has been some pick up in sales since the easing of restrictions and the new project, along with the apparel hub coming up in sector-29, the industry is looking forward to a favourable season.Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida apparel export cluster (NAEC), said that they export garment worth over ₹25,000 crore every year. “We cater to everyone in Bollywood -- from the small to the big stars. It is a matter of pride for us that the garment products of Noida fulfil about 70% demand of apparel from film industry in Mumbai,” he said. He said the proposed infotainment city in the Yamuna expressway industrial development authority (Yeida) area, is expected to increase demand vy over ₹1,000 crore. “We also suggested to the Noida authority to develop a fashion hub in sector 32. It can also be converted later into fashion street, which can promote GB Nagar’s ‘one district, one product (ODOP)’,” he said. Exporter Manoj Sahoo said that the proposed infotainment city will create a huge employment and investment opportunities for the garment industry. “Over 500,000-strong work force will be needed for the mega apparel Park, which is coming up soon at Sector-29 near Yamuna Expressway. It will also attract investment of over ₹5,000 crore. The Yeida has already initiated the process of land allotment to investors to set up nearly 150 apparel units there,” he said. When contacted, Yeida CEO Arun Veer Singh, also said that upcoming mega apparel park and the infotainment city near Yamuna expressway, will create bigger employment opportunities for garment industry in GB Nagar. “It will also expect to attract many foreign investors in this sector. These projects will take the district on the global map,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-garment-industry-pins-high-hopes-on-upcoming-film-city/story-v2kOXklhpn10sfdNLxci3J.html

02-10-2020||Noida||SHO’s fake social media profile used to defraud people; probe underway||A fake social media profile of a station house officer (SHO), posted in Noida Central, is being used to attempt to defraud people into giving monetary donations, the police said.The SHO in question is unwell and is undergoing treatment for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in Delhi. However, a few days back, a social media account carrying a photograph of the SHO and his details started doing rounds.Police said that the person operating the account contacted a few of the SHO’s contacts on the social media account and started asking for monetary favours.“During the chats, the suspect told them that he needed money. The amount asked was around ₹20,000. As the SHO concerned is unwell, he was unable to take calls of his friends to clarify the situation for a while. However, one of them later approached the Noida police. We have brought this case to the notice of the cyber cell, which is looking into the matter,” said a Noida police official asking not to be named.People shared screenshots of the chats with the fake account in order to further alert people of the deception, said the police. Cyber cell officials said a probe in the matter is underway.“We are working on tracing the person behind the fake profile. A request has been sent to the social media company’s office in the US and with the response from there, we will nab the culprit,” said Baljeet Singh, inspector, Noida cyber cell.He said this particular modus operandi of creating fake profiles and then targeting the victim’s friends is becoming quite common.“Profiles of police personnel, government officials, etc., are made and then people are targeted. There is no administering authority for the internet so impersonating almost anyone is not an issue for these kinds of criminals,” said Singh.He said a complaint has been received from an acquaintance of the SHO and the matter is being looked into, said officials. However, an FIR has not been registered yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sho-s-fake-social-media-profile-used-to-defraud-people-probe-underway/story-r0gsjiNyS9M6WVtWt6YuqI.html

According to health officials, with this increase in testing they will be able to cover more suspected cases. They said it will also help in early detection and early referral in order to control the spread of the pandemic. According to official records, the district conducted 5,802 tests on September 29, and 6,025 tests on September 30, besides 6,014 on October 1. The overall 1,16,842 tests conducted in September have been the highest conducted in a single month since March in Ghaziabad.“The daily testing in the district has reached 6,000, the highest single day figure since March. We have deployed additional teams for this. It is not only the additional deployment, but the teams are properly monitored every day which is helping achieve this. Officers deputed for the purpose monitor the working hours of the teams and ensure that they leave for the testing centres at a specified time and also submit records in a timely manner,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.“As we have reached the daily testing figure of 6,000 per day, we will now try to scale it up further,” he added. The district in August conducted 92,384 tests. According to official figures of October 1, the district completed 3,20,449 overall tests so far, which include 1,90,090 tests conducted through rapid antigen kits. The rapid kits were introduced in the district on June 26 and they now have a share of 59.31% in overall testing. “Testing is done at 20 centres which also include mobile vans, mobile teams, etc. We have also issued 200 each of rapid antigen kits to 10 private hospitals which are providing paid Covid treatment. At private hospitals, testing through rapid kits is free. The hospitals also submit us daily records of tests. When the lot of 200 finishes, we issued more,” said an official from the district health department, not authorised to speak with the media. “As per directions from the government, we are now conducting one-third of our daily tests with the help of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests which are the gold standard to detect Covid. We have also deployed more lab technicians in our teams and this has also helped in increased testing,” the health official quoted above added. According to the state control room records of October 2, Ghaziabad has overall 14,588 Covid-19 cases so far which include 12,545 patients discharged and 78 deaths. Medical experts said that with the increased testing, the health department should continue to focus on the strategy of ‘test, track, treat and isolate’ in order to curb the fatality rate. “Since there were resources available for increased testing in the district, the focus should be more for 100% testing in containment zones. Since the containment zones have been narrowed down with micro containment zones, the smaller population can be tested 100%. This will help us find our more suspected cases and they can easily be filtered out,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Further, a part of the overall testing should also be conducted randomly for high risk groups which include healthcare workers, police personnel, senior citizens, etc. This will also help us check the spread of infection,” Dr Jindal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-achieves-target-of-conducting-6-000-covid-tests-daily/story-5Zp9RcgnrE4oMrgu9ohhyM.html

The suspects were identified as Ramesh, 35, a resident of Rohtak, and Niranjan, 34, a resident of Faridabad. Niranjan is a convicted criminal in a murder case and was out on parole, said the police. The police had arrested two other prime suspects – Mohit Vats and his uncle Suresh Sharma on –September 12 in the case. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said that Mohit had allegedly hired two sharpshooters and the two arrested persons, and plotted and executed the murder of property dealers Dal Chand Sharma and his friend Arun Tyagi in Ajnara Le Garden society’s parking on September 7 over personal enmity. “On Friday, the Bisrakh police received information about the two suspects’ presence in Greater Noida west. A police team reached the spot and arrested the two suspects,” he said. Chander said Dal Chand allegedly had personal enmity with Mohit, the alleged mastermind of the crime. On September 7 evening, Dal Chand and Arun were seated in the former’s Tata Harrier SUV in the parking lot of a high-rise society when two sharpshooters - Tek Chand and Daya Chand – approached them and sprayed bullets from both the front windows. Dal Chand received seven bullets and died on the spot while Tyagi received three bullets and was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead. Varun Tyagi, Arun’s brother, had filed a complaint at the Bisrakh police station and a case under Section 302 (murder) of IPC was registered. Chander said ten years ago, Dal Chand’s father was chosen as the head of his village in Faridabad and a rivalry allegedly ensued with Mohit’s family due to the election. In the past, Dal Chand’s elder brother Rajendra Sharma and Mohit’s elder brother Krishna used to work in partnership. However, their relationship turned sour and they parted ways. In 2011, Krishna allegedly killed Rajendra and his friend, one Kapil, in Haryana. In 2017, Dal Chand allegedly killed Krishna in Mathura to avenge his brother’s death, the DCP said.He said Mohit allegedly hired these suspects and two sharpshooters, and got Dal Chand and Arun murdered as revenge. “Ramesh and Niranjan were wanted in five criminal cases registered in Bisrakh and Faridabad. They had helped rope in the sharpshooters for the double murder. They were produced in court and sent to judicial custody,” Chander said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-more-arrested-for-the-double-murder-of-property-dealers-in-greater-noida-west/story-quf05YJqxsi1l1o5L2hAJL.html

The reason for the fire was unknown and no one was injured. Three fire engines, two rescue vehicles and three water tankers were sent to the spot to contain the blaze.As per the fire officials, the fire broke out in a wine shop in Arcadia Shopping Mall around 8.10 am on Friday morning. The eight shops on the ground floor which include a wine shop, medical shops, stationery and gift shops, hardware, mobile repair and sweet shops were damaged.Santosh Kadam, chief, RDMC, Thane, said, “Eye witnesses informed that the fire broke in the wine shop due to a short circuit but our team is yet to ascertain the source. It took four hours to douse the fire. It was brought under control at around 12.30 pm. The enclosed space of the shopping complex made access difficult for the fire vehicles leading to the spread of fire.”A fire brigade official said, “All the shops in the complex were closed when the fire began, so it spread rapidly inside the complex. We are trying to find the reason behind the fire.” Amit Jadeja, 42, owner of one of the shops, Shreeji Telecom, was the first to reach the spot after a watchman in the nearby building informed him about the fire.He said, “I stay near the shop and therefore I received a call from some of my friends and a watchman that they saw few sparks near the wine shop. I immediately reached the spot and called the wine shop owner. Till he came, there were three four sparks and fire started spreading to other shops. We could not open the wine shop to douse the fire and called the fire brigade.

02-10-2020||Mumbai||Kalyan to get rehab centre for treatment after Covid recovery||For most symptomatic Covid-19 patients, getting discharged from a hospital is merely half the battle won. The real challenge lies in the post-infection relief and rehabilitation. To assist in this, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) will soon start post-Covid rehabilitation facilities.This will be a voluntary day-care service for patients who are facing breathing problems post Covid treatment. The civic body has tied up with Indian Medical Association’s Kalyan chapter for this initiative. It will initially have one centre in Kalyan, and depending on the response, will start more such centres.A similar Covid rehab centre is set up in Hyderabad. Pune will also get a rehab centre by next week.A 38-year-old working professional from Khadakpada in Kalyan recovered from Covid about 20 days ago. He is still experiencing breathing difficulty. “I was in ICU for almost a fortnight although my Covid tests were negative. I was under observation for another five days after which I was discharged. I do not have any other problems but if I go about my daily tasks, I experience breathlessness. I called a pulmonary specialist, who suggested certain breathing exercises. I am feeling better now,” he said.He said that a Covid rehab centre might help patients in a big way. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “There are many patients who have breathing troubles even after recovering from Covid. Through our rehabilitation facility, physiotherapists will guide them with breathing exercises. They will also be provided with various equipments within the centre to train and exercise.”The initiative was put forth by the Indian Medical Association’s Kalyan chapter and will be implemented in co-ordination with the KDMC.“Three weeks ago, there was a Covid positive patient who recovered. However, he still faced difficulty in breathing. He was in ICU for 21 days. His Covid reports were negative and had no other health issues, so as per protocol we had to discharge him. He could avail the portable oxygen cylinder to ease his breathing at home. However, such patients also need pulmonary physiotherapy, which is not known to many. Hence, we doctors at IMA put forth the idea to the civic body to come up with a post-Covid care facility where such provisions can be made for the patients,” said Dr Prashant Patil, Secretary, IMA, Kalyan.As of now, the civic body has finalised Mahajanwadi hall, near Sahajanand Chowk in Kalyan for the post-Covid care facility. This will start from the coming week and as per response from the people, the centres will be increased in different parts of the twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli. This is a voluntary provision for those who are facing breathing problems post-Covid treatment. The hour-long session will cost Rs 100 for the patients. Around eight pulmonary physiotherapists from IMA Kalyan are supporting this initiative.Dr Manisha Lal, physiotherapist (cardio-pulmonary), said, “Often patients post 18 years of age develop fibrosis in the lungs due to low oxygen levels during Covid treatment. Such patients require physiotherapy to get their lungs to normalcy, we plan to provide them two sessions of a basic breathing course after around 17 days of getting discharged.“They can continue with the basic course at home for the next 15 days. We shall teach them the advanced course depending on the progress of their lungs, the advanced course includes exercises that are done along with the daily routine as well. These can then be continued at home by the patients. If they face any other problems they can come forward anytime to the facility and we shall guide them.”The hall in Kalyan currently finalised for the facility consists of a seating capacity of 40 to 50 people. They will have a standby ambulance and oxygen supplies available in case of any emergency. This will be a day-care facility where patients can visit as per the appointment. Apart from providing the basic and advanced breathing exercises, the doctors will also continuously monitor the health and progress of the patients.“It is essential to rehabilitate the lungs as well. We have also made provision for a spirometer. Those interested can purchase them for exercising at home. This is a transparent tube that helps understand the volume of air inhaled and exhaled by the lungs. This will also be available at the centre for exercise,” said Dr Manali Jain, physiotherapist.“We shall create awareness regarding this facility among the people as well. This will help us in understanding if we need to have more such centres in the city,” said Dr Panpatil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-to-get-rehab-centre-for-treatment-after-covid-recovery/story-FFYrn5Cox9pT4Eq1ZBMuzM.html

He had implemented the plastic-free village campaign in Vengurla, Aurangabad, Matheran and Karjat over the years.Kokare said, “In Karjat, we had turned a dumping ground into a four-acre garden by planting fruits, vegetable and flowers. We do have plans to change the Adharwadi dumping ground into a garden like the one in Karjat. Once the clearing work at the dumping site is completed, we will soon start the work of developing the garden.”In the Karjat’s model, the waste was segregated in 36 ways that include everyday wet waste, plastic, paper, chicken waste, human hair, coconut shell, leaf and yard waste, diaper, sanitary napkin, egg shell, leftover of animals, waste from mutton and fish market.An officer from solid waste management said, “One type of waste was segregated on each day of the week. On Mondays, plastic bottles are separated; on Tuesdays, glass, tube light, bulb, broken glasses, broken bangles; Wednesdays were for cardboard, clothes, rexin bags and dishes; Thursdays for electronic waste, wire, mobile charger and television computer port; Fridays for rubber, tyre, sleepers, shoes, ceramic, foam, scrap furniture and on Saturdays, thermocol and metals are separated.”The civic body there made by-laws for solid waste management as mandated under Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, for the project of zero waste management and imposed them strictly. There was ban on plastic and also made segregation of waste mandatory. The dump yard was cleared and the compost produced from the processed wet waste, is used to transform it into a garden. The one-of-its-kind park witnesses visitors every year as it also has a butterfly garden. On one side of the garden, waste is processed while the other side has garden.Since May this year, the KDMC too imposed waste segregation in all the societies. Six societies are also managing their own waste. The wet waste collected is send to the dumping ground for processing, while the dry waste is sold to scrap dealers.The KDMC ranked 22nd in the Swachch Bharat Survey 2020 compared to 77th last year due to these measures. One of the major reasons for improvement in the rank is due to the imposing of segregation of waste, decreasing the amount of waste dumped at the Adharwadi dumping ground claims the officials of solid waste management department of KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-takes-leaf-out-of-karjat-dumping-ground/story-niUyPeVZflnk0Fy7EaOHIL.html

The protesters said the tall claims made regarding the Swachhta Abhiyan in the city had fallen flat as they were left to live under pathetic conditions.Residents including Milkha Singh Khaira, Romi Jain, Rajinder Singh, Vishal Behl, among others, said that due to the sewer water accumulation in the streets of residential areas, they are unable to step out of their homes. Several complaints have been submitted to the authorities and the councillor, but to no avail, they rued.Khaira, who is a resident of Jain Colony, said, “Due to the lackadaisical approach of the municipal authorities, filthy sewer water has accumulated in our streets and vacant plots. This has produced stench in the entire colony. These conditions have been prevailing for the past three months. The project to install new sewer lines at Rahon Road is also going on at a slow pace and the potholes on the stretch only add to commuters’ woes.”Despite repeated attempts, MC executive engineer Ranbir Singh remained unavailable for comments.However, area councillor Ravinder Kaur said, “The work to install new sewer lines in the area would be completed within 10 days and the problem of sewer water accumulation would be resolved. Traffic police had dumped soil in an under-construction manhole near Basti Jodhewal chowk a few days back, due to which the project got delayed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-take-to-streets-over-sewer-water-accumulation-on-rahon-road/story-WkP28Nc9HFaZbUPxgxBBAP.html

In a statement issued here, Virbhadra Singh said people of Lahaul-Spiti will get round-the-year connectivity to the rest of the world by commissioning of the Atal Tunnel. The veteran leader said as a Union minister he had taken up early construction of the tunnel in 2010 with the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. “The project was envisaged by former PM Indira Gandhi during her night stay at Keylong in 1972. People there had met her and demanded construction of a road that would keep them connected to Manali-Kullu despite snowfall,” he said. Singh said in the same year, Indira Gandhi had asked the ministry of defense to explore possibilities of constructing a road or a tunnel. “In 2010, the then UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, under the leadership of PM Manmohan Singh, had laid the foundation stone of this tunnel on June 28,” he said, adding that the tunnel also holds importance from a strategic point of view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohtang-tunnel-project-was-envisaged-by-indira-gandhi-virbhadra-singh/story-1XWEZVIs4fLjLQ7M1Eke2M.html
02-10-2020||City||9-km-long Atal Tunnel an engineering marvel||The nine-kilometre-long Atal Tunnel, running across the 13,050-ft high Rohtang pass, on the Manali-Leh axis is the highest motorable highway tunnel in the world. An engineering marvel, it took 10 years for the Indian Army’s elite road construction agency, Border Roads Organisation, to complete the tunnel, constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 3,300 crore. The construction contract of the tunnel was awarded to Strabag-Afcons, a joint venture between India-based Afcons Infrastructure and Austria’s Strabag. The 9.02-km long tunnel, shaped like a horse shoe, is the longest highway tunnel in the world and connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year. Earlier, the valley used to be cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall. The tunnel has consumed 12,252 metric tonnes of steel, 1,69,426 metric tonnes of cement and 1,01,336 metric tonnes of concrete, and excavated 5,05,264 metric tonnes of soil and rocks by adopting the latest Austrian tunneling method for construction.Built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000-metres (10,000-feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL), the Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali and at an altitude of 3,060-metres, while the north portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near Teling village, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres. It is extremely significant from the defence point of view. The BRO worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault Zone. More than 3, 000 workers, along with engineers, from Bihar, Jharkhandh and Nepal worked overtime to complete the tunnel. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017. The tunnel provides a telephone facility at every 150 metre of its stretch, a fire hydrant every 60 metre, emergency exits every 500 metre, turning cavern every 2.2km, air quality monitors every 1 km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection system with CCTV cameras every 250 metre. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. Shanta, Dhumal to watch inauguration virtuallyA spokesman of the state government said here today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will dedicate the Atal Tunnel Rohtang to the nation on October 3, has personally advised the former chief ministers Shanta Kumar and Prem Kumar Dhumal to avoid their personal presence in this function in the wake of pandemic. He said that on the advice of PM, both former CMs have decided to abstain from the event and witness the event virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/9-km-long-atal-tunnel-an-engineering-marvel/story-hxYuskhbvkFAmQK1uQD1YK.html

The district administration’s standard operating procedure (SOP) for post-Covid-19 complications states: “An important drug-related problem is precipitation of gout following Favipiravir therapy. Additionally skin reactions are noticed in Favipiravir therapy. With Remdesivir, worsening of hepatic functions in underlying liver disease patients can occur. This needs to be monitored”. Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director at Sahyadri hospital, said, “We do follow all precautions before we start drug treatment. We conduct all the liver enzyme tests before the treatment. Once we establish that the person is healthy, we start the drugs; but, in the case of Remdesivir, we do observe in certain cases that enzymes are deranged after treatment. We had to stop it after the first dose. We have yet not come across people who face any worsening hepatic functions, or complaints from people who have recovered from Covid-19.” The Pune district administration has started its training for doctors on dealing with post-Covid-19 complications, based on SOPs prepared by Cuttack university. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman, state technical committee on communicable diseases, who heads the training committee said, “For any drug that needs to be administered, a doctor will definitely look for all possible side effects.

Tickoo has been on a hunger strike to protest against the Centre’s alleged apathy to the demands and needs of nearly 800 Kashmiri Pandit families that never left the Valley. “Yes we got an assurance from the government that our problems will be resolved on priority,” the Kashmiri Pandit Sanghrash Samiti president Sanjay Tickoo said. Some other leaders of the local Kashmiri Pandit Sanghrash Samiti, led by Tickoo, have been sitting on fast unto death at the courtyard of a local temple in Srinagar.In a statement issued here, KPSS said Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Iqbal Chowdhary handed a written assurance to the KPSS president that their demands will be addressed promptly and will be taken to the logical conclusion. “This visit by the senior government official was preceded by emissaries of the chief secretary as well as the additional deputy commissioner who came to the venue a number of times to negotiate with the KPSS president in the last two days. Therefore, the strike has been called off after 248 hours of Fast-Unto-Death pledge,” the KPSS said. The Samiti leaders had alleged that more than 800 Kashmiri Pandit families, who never migrated from the Valley, have been ignored by the government while framing the policies for migrant pandit families. The Samiti is demanding jobs for the unemployed youths of the pandit families living in Kashmir and also monthly cash assistance on the pattern of the scheme in place for migrant pandit families living in Jammu and other parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmiri-pandit-leader-calls-off-hunger-strike-after-assurances-from-government/story-PUIB97cfnTSqDno1dHX8SO.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||YouTubers introduce the world to Kashmiri cuisine||More often than not Kashmir is in news for either conflict or its breathtaking beauty, which had led Mughal emperor Jahangir to famously call it ‘heaven on earth’. However, the Valley’s delicious and unique cuisine is often relegated to a footnote. To remedy this glaring oversight, youngsters in the Valley have taken to YouTube to inform the world about the Valleys food habits ranging from the multi-course wedding cuisine: the Kashmiri Wazwan to indigenous day-to-day dishes. The Covid-induced lockdown and subsequent work-from-home culture has led to the popularity of food vlogs on social media platforms.In 2018, when Tasiya Hameed, 27, wanted to prepare the ‘wazwan pulaw’ after her marriage, she decided to trawl the internet for recipes. Though she found a good number of recipes, she was disappointed that none of them were from Kashmir.“They were Kashmiri only in name. At that moment, my husband and I, decided to start a YouTube channel on the preparation of Kashmiri food,” she said.Hameed, who has a masters in English, started the channel ‘Kashmir Food Fusion’ with the help of her husband . They reached out to Kashmiri professional cooks, the wazas, to learn and prepare wazwan for her online subscribers. Hers was one of the first such initiatives.Wazwan is a multi-course cuisine with many mutton dishes that are served at weddings in Kashmir. Traditionally, the meal ranges from anything between seven to 36 courses, most of which are prepared from meat cooked overnight on raging cooking fires. They involve a spread of huge copper vessels, mounds of mutton, chicken, fish, vegetables and heaps of spices among other ingredients. Prominent wazwan dishes, include rista (meatballs in a fiery red gravy), waza kokur (chicken garnished with crushed almonds), rogan josh (tender lamb cooked with Kashmiri spices), tabak maaz (ribs of lamb simmered in yogurt till tender, and then fried in ghee), and the ultimate dish gushtaba (a velvety textured ball of meat mixed with fat in white yogurt gravy).“Initially, it was very difficult to get an audience but then young Kashmiris studying or working outside the Valley started reaching out to us. Even the young generation of Kashmiri Pandits who would miss many of their trademark dishes such as muj gaede (a fish and radish dish), haakh and dum alloo, started following us,” she said.Within two years she had crossed one lakh subscribers and even received a silver button from YouTube in August. Hameed is currently writing a book, and plans to launch an app. She also dreams of opening her own restaurant in the long run.“Initially, it was just a passion – a love for our culture but now we are professional. I am able to earn through the channel as brands approach us for promoting their product,” she said, adding that now around 30 food channels were exploring the idea of Kashmiri cuisine on YouTube.Nazrana Bashir, 34, also decided to start a YouTube channel after her marriage. She first shifted to Gurgaon and then Mumbai and had to call home every time she tried a traditional Kashmiri dish. In 2018, she decided to start a food channel by the name of ‘Zoon Daeb’ with the help of her in-laws.“It is all about Kashmir and preserving its culture for the future generations. This will be my legacy for my kids,” she said. Bashir, who is a mass communication post graduate from Kashmir University, said many food bloggers had come up in the past year, which has helped break stereotypes about Kashmir.“People now know that Kashmir extends beyond tourism or conflict, says Bashir, who has around 27,000 subscribers on YouTube and has started relaying recipes thorough multiple languages. “There are variations between Indian, Pakistani and Kashmiri dishes. Often people in Mumbai invite themselves to our home on festivals to taste Kashmiri food,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/youtubers-introduce-the-world-to-kashmiri-cuisine/story-ePqetwNbSjQoAeUoTJqrSI.html

The remaining 81.4 per cent did report an associated risk factor.Of the 1,034 Covid-related deaths in rural Pune, i.e. those reported from gram panchayats and villages in Pune district as of September 30, 54.06 per cent reported a comorbid condition; 38.58 per cent did not have any comorbidity; and 7.35 per cent did not specify.The analysis of these 1,034 deaths from rural Pune also shows that the most common comorbidities are diabetes and hypertension (27.90%); diabetes (24.68%); and hypertension (13.95%). The data also claims that 20.11 per cent of the deaths took place within 24 hours of admission; 25.33 per cent took place within two to four days of admission; and, 16.34 per cent took place within four-seven days of admission. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president, Indian Medical Association, Maharashtra, said, “This is a very high percentage. There could be multiple reasons, like lack of awareness about wearing masks, respiratory hygiene, social distancing and disinfecting the premises. Also poor contact tracing and early detection by the administration is one reason. Sometimes, it takes two-three days for the reports to come in and by then, patients would have to spread the virus. I have had patients who come from Junnar and nearby villages on day seven of having the infection, when the situation is hard to handle. Also, most people in the villages are unaware of their comorbid conditions. Twenty percent of the patients are shifted to the city for critical care when the patient’s condition deteriorates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/46-of-rural-pune-s-covid-fatalities-did-not-have-or-report-comorbid-conditions/story-kpCsK1F8SqFhMhoU6QmoeM.html

The laws, which were thrust upon the farmers without any discussion in the Parliament, will destroy the mandi system and bring an end to the minimum support price,” he added.Kundu further said that leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar seem to be sharing the same views on these laws as Hooda did not register any protest against the legislations during the one-day assembly session.Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta, farmer leader Rakesh Takait and Samajwadi party MLA from Uttar Pradesh, Nahid Hasan reached the dharna site to offer their support to Kundu.Yadav said instead of listening to farmers, the government took the ordinance route to pass these laws. “Farmers are now worried that private players will increase or decrease the prices of their produce at will and farmers’ bargaining power will be reduced,” he added. Yadav also hit out at Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, saying, “Despite belonging to Devi Lal’s family, he (Dushyant) has no quality as of his great grandfather and he is greedy for power. His wicket will fall soon because now the farmers’ have come out on streets against these laws.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/meham-mla-kundu-begins-indefinite-strike-against-farm-laws/story-6Kl2zsnAWpVcQODQDQYllI.html

02-10-2020||City||Cong, BJP workers exchange blows in Ludhiana||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress workers exchanged blows near the Clock Tower on Friday, even as social organisations were paying their respects to the father of the nation on Gandhi Jayanti celebrations near the municipal corporation’s Zone A office. BJP workers were protesting outside the Congress office to condemn Thursday’s vandalism at its office which they claim was carried out by Youth Congress workers. Timely intervention of police, prevented the situation from taking an ugly turn, even as the episode lasted for around two hours.Jeevan Gupta, state general secretary of the BJP, said party workers were protesting peacefully. “The Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government has failed on all fronts. The government has triggered farmers’ protest to divert attention of people from scams,” Gupta claimed, adding that Congress workers had also damaged the posters of BJP leaders in the Clock Tower area. With a large number of workers of both parties gathering at the spot, police blocked the Old Sessions Chowk flyover; vehicles heading from Jagraon Bridge towards Clock Tower were diverted, leading to a jam on the Jagraon Bridge and the Domoria Bridge. District Youth Congress president Yogesh Handa said, “BJP reflects the ideology of Nathuram Godse. They tried to instigate Congress workers and deliberately chose Gandhi Jayanti to create ruckus.” “Instead of protesting against the Congress government, the BJP should reflect upon its misrule. Farmers are on roads, businessmen are suffering losses, economy is at all-time low and rapes are happening every day under the PM Narendra Modi-led regime,” said Handa. Later, both the parties separately visited the statue of Gandhi to pay homage to the father of the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-bjp-workers-exchange-blows-in-ludhiana/story-h9G87DGi6ANin7WqyI63JK.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Gandhi Jayanti: CRPF yodhas ride to pay tribute to the Mahatma||“Jab able-bodied log cycle rallies kar sakte hain, toh hum kyu nahi? Hausla buland hona chahiye bas (When able-bodied people can participate in cycle rallies then why not us? One only needs grit to achieve this).” These words were the sentiment behind the decision of four differently-abled yodhas’ of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), to ride 1,000km across four states on a bicycle, to pay obeisance to Mahatma Gandhi. With unwavering spirit as their guide and sheer determination as their fuel, a team of differently-abled CRPF warriors embarked on a Paracycle Rally from Sabarmati Ashram in Gujarat on September 17 to reach Rajghat, Delhi. After 16 days of gruelling journey, the rally concluded on October 2, the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, in the Capital. And the four CRPF warriors — RK Singh, Veerbhadra Singh, Ajay Kumar and KK Roy — were accompanied by CRPF commandant KK Pandey, and 20 other cyclists.  Some moments with Divyang warriors of CRPF👏👏👏 @crpfindia @PMOIndia @HMOIndia @KirenRijiju pic.twitter.com/fM8CBld7aERK Singh, one of the people behind the organisation of this paracycling rally, reveals the reason for his indomitable spirit. “I was recruited in CRPF in 1990, and lost my leg in a Naxal encounter in 2011. After recovering from the injury, I decided to restart my life with an artificial limb, and went back to cycling and other sports that I used to play as an able-bodied soldier,” says Singh, who is decorated with the Shaurya Chakra. Recently, Singh got together with fellow differently-abled personnel to put forth the idea of a cycle rally in order to send forth a positive message to other differently-abled individuals who might that there’s nothing to forward to. “CRPF wholeheartedly supports the Fit India Movement, and at the time of Covid-19, this rally assumed a bigger importance to send forth the message of a healthy lifestyle, no matter who you are,” Singh adds. Riding almost 100km each day is no mean task. CRPF commandant KK Pandey, who made this journey with the team of cyclists says it’s an honour to have participated in this rally that culminated on Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary. “Gandhiji always focussed on the virtues of swachhta and swasth. His entire life was devoted to creating a world where everyone is treated as equal. This is our message too, and I believe there couldn’t be a better way of paying homage to the Mahatma,” says Pandey. The cyclists were felicitated by Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports, when they arrived at Rajghat in Delhi. “Staying fit is not a tough task. We decided to give this message through cycling, because this is one of the easiest ways of ensuring our well-being, even amid the pandemic,” says Pandey, adding, “These soldiers are an inspiration to the world. Apne angon ka balidan karne ke bawajood, jab ye log 1,000 km ki duri tay kar sakte hain, toh hum kyu nahi kar sakte (Having sacrified their limbs to safeguard the country, if these differently-abled officers can cycle through 1,000km then why can’t we).”Author tweets @Bhagat_MallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gandhi-jayanti-crpf-yodhas-ride-to-pay-tribute-to-the-mahatma/story-iRIceYZtTpEx7hmg9JJ6WP.html

BJP leaders said Shah took special care of the Bengal BJP unit when he was party president and has selected each member of the state committee that is responsible for the party’s poll management next year.At a meeting at Nadda’s residence in Delhi on Thursday, it was decided that Shah will visit Kolkata before Durga Puja to address state leaders and chart their course of action. Shah, Nadda, and other senior central leaders held discussions with Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh and national vice-president Mukul Roy for four hours at the meeting.Also Read: Amit Shah to chart strategy, stem rumblings in Bengal unit at Delhi meetBJP’s state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said Bengal holds a special place in the country’s electoral dynamics because except for the first few years after Independence, the state has always been the face of anti-Centre politics. “From that perspective, winning the state elections will have a huge political impact in the eastern part of India. Also, Bengal plays a big role in trade and commerce in the region. Bengal’s geographical location matters a lot to the BJP government.”Majumdar said Shah wants the party to use its best resources to win the polls.“Shah nurtured the Bengal BJP when he was party president and is doing so even now. He treats the state unit as his own baby. He personally selected the team of state leaders. It is only natural that the team will not play the final match without its coach,” said Majumdar.Bengal BJP leaders feel that Shah can effectively address the issue of poll violence. In Bengal, violence and electoral malpractice has been a regular feature of almost all polls.Also Read: ‘Glossy statements’: Home Ministry’s sharp comeback to Amnesty on ‘witch-hunt’ barb“The home minister can play a big role in ensuring that people can vote freely,” said a BJP leader, who did not want to be named.At Thursday’s meeting, Shah asked Ghosh and Roy to intensify political activities on specific issues, said state leaders aware of the matter.Ghosh said Shah will address BJP state committee leaders in Kolkata before Durga Puja. “The date has not been decided yet. After the pujas, Nadda Ji will also come to Bengal,” said Ghosh.“We discussed activities that will be taken up over specific issues to counter the TMC [Trinamool Congress] government. On October 5, protests will be held outside the offices of all community block development officers in Bengal against corruption in the distribution of relief for people affected by cyclone Amphan in May,” he said.“On October 8, the Yuva Morcha will march to Nabanna, the state secretariat.”Ghosh returned to Kolkata on Friday and headed straight to rallies in support of the farm laws passed last month. The laws have triggered protests by farmers.There is speculation that Roy may be entrusted with the task of overseeing the Bengal unit’s election machinery since the BJP performed well in the 2018 panchayat and 2019 Lok Sabha election when he was made convenor of the state election committee. He has also helped many TMC turncoats join the party.The BJP has been upbeat over its prospects in the 2021 West Bengal assembly polls since its performance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Its vote share in the state increased to over 40% in 2019 from a mere 2% in the 2011 assembly polls. The BJP won 18 out of West Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats to emerge as the second-largest party after TMC in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/amit-shah-to-lead-bengal-bjp-in-2021-assembly-polls-state-leaders/story-3mhwuNdQvhCUg3t5tJ9XnO.html

The party, which has anyway been locked in a bitter tussle with BJP over probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput , also said the Mumbai police should be allowed to probe the incident since Uttar Pradesh police had failed in doing its job. Sena MP Sanjay Raut also called the heckling of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi by UP police ‘gangrape of democracy.’Also read: Priyanka Gandhi arrives at Valmiki temple in Delhi to attend prayer meet for Hathras victimOn Friday, Sena workers demonstrated in several areas, condemning the gangrape and raised slogans against the BJP government in UP headed by Yogi Adityanath. “In Mumbai, when an actor’s illegal office was partially demolished, everyone pounced on us and put the Maharashtra government in the dock. But here, after this ghastly incident, one is allowed to even question the Uttar Pradesh Government,” remarked Sena MP Sanjay Raut. The Sena staged protests at Churchgate, Thane and Mira Bhayender where its workers shouted slogans against the BJP-led government in UP. Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik also demanded that the state police be allowed to register a case of this rape in Mumbai and send its team to Hathras to investigate the matter. Sarnaik said even the Bihar Police had come to Mumbai to investigate Sushant Singh Rajput’s case citing the incompetency of the Mumbai Police.“Since the Uttar Pradesh Police has failed in investigating the case, it is natural that the Mumbai Police should get involved now. There should be no double standards here,” said Sarnaik.The BJP, however, alleged that the Sena was politicising the issue. “The Sena should have sensitivity while commenting on such an important issue where a 19-year-old is involved. They are just playing politics to score some brownie points, which is unfortunate,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.The Dalit woman was allegedly raped and brutalised by four upper-caste men on September 14 when she had gone to the fields in her village to gather cattle fodder. Left partially paralysed and admitted for treatment in the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College of Aligarh Muslim University, she was shifted to New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital when her condition did not improve and she died on Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hathras-gangrape-shiv-sena-holds-protests-says-mumbai-police-should-start-probe/story-vSrFA5c0eKrz5fBambc0WK.html

02-10-2020||Dehradun||Farm bills 2020: Farmer protests hit paddy purchase, sale in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar||Farmer protests over the three farm bills recently passed by Parliament have affected the procurement and sale of paddy in Uttarakhand, especially in Haridwar where most of the crop is grown. Farmers associated with Bharatiya Kisan Union factions of Tikait, Ambawat, Tomar, Ridh and Uttarakhand Kisan Morcha are protesting across the state, particularly in the plain region farm belts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar. Also read: Stubble burns, farmers from Haryana say they have no optionPaddy procurement centres, run by the food and civil supplies department and Uttarakhand State Cooperative Federation Limited (UCF), have seen an abysmal footfall since they opened on Thursday. Farmer union representatives said they were busy holding protests, sit-ins and blocking highways, leaving them no time to queue up at paddy procurement centres. In addition, they are expected to register through e-portals -- something they are not used to. Till last year, cooperative committees were involved in procuring the produce from farmers but now it is done through food and civil supplies department and the UCF. In the paddy-growing area of Haridwar, there are 17 procurement centres; seven of the UCF and the rest of food and civil supplies department. A quick survey of these centres revealed that most of them saw just a handful of farmers visit in these two days.“Due to farmer agitation, all agriculture-related work has been affected. But, we have make that sacrifice. Farm bills are anti-farmer and the minimum procurement price is also low, farmers are voluntarily joining the agitation... paddy crops can be sold a few days late too,” said Rahul Chaudhary, a farmer leader from Bahadrabad. Farmers aren’t too happy with the minimum support price either. The government set Rs 1,868 per quintal for common grade paddy, and Rs 1,888 per quintal for grade A as the minimum support price. “The government should increase minimum support prices of crops, provide a subsidy, lower fertilizer costs and ensure proper procurement set-up. Farmers should have a bigger say in the process,” said Manglaur legislator Qazi Nizamuddin. On the low footfall, however, UCF officials said paddy crop was still being harvested and more farmers were expected now that the monsoon season was over.“Our centres are assisting farmers in every possible way so that this process is convenient and time-saving for them. Operators register farmers’ details coming for procurement and the payment gets credited into their accounts within a stipulated time frame. As our centres will remain open till December, footfall will increase in the coming days,” said Mangalaur and Paniylaa–Lathardeva procurement centre in-charge Rajendra Singh Bisht.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/farm-bills-2020-farmer-protests-hit-paddy-purchase-sale-in-uttarakhand-s-haridwar/story-lPM7Be85lhof8DnZBVssMK.html

Anil Sharma, the president of the All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference, an umbrella organisation of sarpanches and panches in the Union Territory, said, “We had high hopes from the first two editions of the B2V. The first edition was rolled out last year during then governor Satyapal Malik’s tenure. At that time, panchayati raj institutions made all arrangements for officials and organised gram sabhas, but the result was zero as panchayats were not given funds.” “The government asked us to use the amount given under the 14th finance commission for the B2V1 programmes. Since that amount was allocated for other works, those plans had to be cancelled and funds were used for the B2V1 programme. Yet works taken up during the first edition are incomplete,” he said. The second edition under then lieutenant governor GC Murmu met a similar fate. “On September 8, the government announced Rs 10 lakh each for 4,129 panchayats for B2V works but no funds have been released yet,” he said. Describing the administration’s programme as a positive initiative, Sharma said, “We have urged the lieutenant governor to release Rs 25 lakh per panchayat, per edition of B2V programme. It will usher in overall development in all 4,129 panchayats,” he said. The third edition of the programme will continue till October 12. More than 4,000 officers have been asked to visit villages, hear the grievances of people and try to resolve them on the spot. Besides, domicile and other certificates will be issued. Chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam said that the third edition was preceded by a fortnight-long drive to assess requirements. The financial commissioner, finance, and principal secretary, revenue, have been nominated nodal officers for B2V3 in Kashmir and Jammu, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/we-welcome-b2v-initiative-but-release-funds-j-k-panchayats/story-JzulSM4btnTFfJCRQKDmIL.html

The formation of an eight-member committee tasked with framing rules for the implementation of Marathi education in classes 1 to 10, was announced in a government resolution released on Thursday.“The committee will ensure that schools across the state belonging to different boards like CBSE, ICSE, IB and IGCSE abide by the guidelines issued by the state with respect to teaching the language. The committee will keep a tab on schools across the state for the effective implementation of the policy,” said a member of the committee. The committee is headed by the director of education and has members from the state education board, Bal Bharati and the Maharashtra state council of education research and training (MSCERT). The Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Act, 2020 was passed in both the houses of the state legislature in the last budget session. As per the act, schools that follow boards other than the state board would have to adhere to the syllabus and teaching plan for the language as prescribed by the state education department from time to time.Also Read: Kin of 10 Maharashtra cops will not get Rs 50 lakh compensation as they didn’t contract virus on dutyThe rule has been in effect in the state from the current academic year (2020-21).

Cotton, hand-painted, embroidered, you name it and she has made a mask out of it. “As soon as the lockdown started, it dawned over me that where would the security guys, domestic helps, and their kids get masks from? Unko maks mile honge but those need to be washed as well, so what if they don’t have a spare one... Pehle maine unke liye cotton masks banane shuru kiye. Because I do stitching, I would often have decoration material such as beads, ghungroo, etc so I started making some for my friends and family, too,” says the 75-year-old.Since April, Narula has made and distributed over 1,000 masks without charging a dime. “I start around 10am everyday, and spend all day making these. I add the elastic to the ready ones around 5pm everyday. This has been my routine for all these months... I look for cloth in the house that is unused, and start making fancy and party masks, too. One day, my machine broke down and I was feeling so depressed. The next day, it started working on it’s own. I guess my prayers were heard; that was the happiest moment for me,” she says with a smile, recalling the other time when she used to teach children in a school for the underprivileged.“I love to help others. Mera mann hai ki sabko masks pahuche. I’m so grateful that I can make these masks kyunki mere mann mein ichha hai ki main jitna kar sakoon dusron ke liye utna kam hai. People ask me at times to charge money for these, but I’m so happy and satisfied with my work that I don’t want to take money in return. In fact some people even enquired about these masks on Facebook, and I tell them ‘Aap aao, main gate pe bhijwa dungi for you to collect’. Hope coronavirus vanishes from our lives soon, but till the time it’s there, I’ll be more than willing to provide people with this necessity, free of cost,” she adds. And not just masks, she has also been sewing sweaters! Sharing how fond she is of stitching and knitting, Narula says, “I can’t sit idle! When my kids were young, I would often make sweaters for them. I always made original designs and never copied form any magazine. Ab mere bachche bade ho gaye hain, and since it’s my hobby to knit sweaters, I continue to do so for those kids who can’t afford them in the winter season.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-based-retired-school-teacher-is-mask-fairy-for-underprivileged-kids/story-kABEgoYiJgbXOdNB4zbunK.html

One Twitter user even wrote: “Multitalented officer”. On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, we got talking with Vij, special DGP, Chhattisgarh Police Headquarters, Raipur, who shares, “This wasn’t the first time I made Gandhiji’s sketch in April 2009. The very first time I sketched the Mahatma was as an engineering student in Kurukshetra, in the 1980s.” He goes on to add, “Now, I try to steal some time for my passion and each time is blissful.”Vij also confesses that he’s deeply influenced by Gandhi’s “principles of truth and non-violence”. He adds, “Mahatma Gandhi believed that crime is a social disease, and therefore criminals required suitable reformative treatment, and not punishment. He wanted the Police to be replaced with peace volunteers. But he realised that this wasn’t possible till the masses understood and lived the creed of non-violence. He also exhorted that the Police must be like friends to the public,” he says.

He added the endeavour is as challenging as ambitious. “It involves visits of over 4,000 gazetted officers to each and every Panchayat so that they can be well versed with the local issues and developmental needs.

However, the police turned down his request. “I am sick and tired of UP,” O’Brien said.“The arrogant police are mishandling the situation. They have pushed Ghosh-Dastidar to the ground for trying to comfort the victim’s family members. We wanted to offer solidarity to her family,” he said.“It is an atrocity against Dalits and women by the government. Can’t I even meet and comfort the family members of the victim?” asked Ghosh-Dastidar.The situation between the media persons and the UP Police outside the village remained tense for the second consecutive day amid allegations that the woman’s family members were being harassed.A youth, who claimed to be a cousin of the victim, emerged from the village to the main road on Friday morning and alleged that the police had taken control over her family members.He alleged that the victim’s father had passed out on Wednesday after the police thrashed him with a stick. “They have seized our mobile phones,” he alleged.He further alleged the police had occupied the woman’s house and personnel were deployed in the streets of the village and even on adjoining farm lands.

Air Quality Index (AQI) hit 148 recently and India Meteorological Department expects air quality to deteriorate further by the end of this month. So, city residents are gearing up for the low AQI days expected in the months to come by buying air purifiers and plants, halting outdoor workouts, and even running awareness campaigns to ban firecrackers. Air-purifier, a mustGurugram resident Upasana Mahatani is hoping for “kinder” days ahead in terms of air quality, but is still preparing for the worst. “I’m ordering another air purifier and, unfortunately, we have more than enough masks,” she says. App to report waste burning Manas Fuloria, CEO of software firm Nagarro, is working towards a tangible solution to the problem. He says, “We are building an app so that people can report waste burning via WhatsApp. For eg someone can click and send a photo, and we will inform the authorities.” Awareness campaigns Ruchika Sethi, founder of a group Citizens of Clean Air, is also looking for solutions. “We are planning a campaign for banning firecrackers. Last year, government had approved bursting of green firecrackers and even regular ones were sold as green crackers... We’ll send out advisories at society level to continue respecting breathing difficulties of vulnerable categories.”Work (in, not) outBanker Mohit Chauhan says, “The solace during the lockdown was the better air quality. But with the onset of crop burning season, we are dreading the coming months. This week onwards, the air quality started dropping... Outdoor runs will be off and fitness regimen might move to gyms... The only respite is maybe due to limited traffic, vehicular pollution may not add to the issue.” One more month to go. pic.twitter.com/ILxuv8TgD6Plants to the rescueDelhi-based author Siddharth Singh, who has written The Great Smog of India, shares that he feels like shifting form the city to another place for these dreaded days. “I wanted to move out of Delhi for the 3-4 week period when the air quality in Delhi is stuck in the hazardous territory. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to do that due to the pandemic. So, instead, I’ve ensured that my house is insulated from the outside air, and to do that I’ve purchased new filters for my indoor air purifiers. I have indoor plants too, but mostly because I love greenery. I’ll also be avoiding any strenuous activities during the peak smog period as that has a disproportionately adverse impact on the lungs and body. Apart from this, there isn’t much one can do to protect oneself.” SIngh adds, “An advice, for people who run RWAs or manage buildings and employees, is to ensure that people who have to work outside like the guards and all, have N95 masks, and an electric output for heating in the winter. Without these, they will have no choice but to burn wood, which is dangerous for them and everyone else as well.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-ncr-residents-prep-for-bad-aqi-days-ahead-with-air-purifiers-indoor-plants/story-IWZ5tIfjE8yjWPtKwXwwTI.html

Soon, more Covid-19 cases were reported among Maharashtra Police personnel posted in Thane, Pune, Navi Mumbai and rural parts of the state.While processing the case files of deceased policemen for the compensation package, Maharashtra Police officials observed that there are a few, who have died since the viral outbreak was first reported but had never performed any Covid-19-related duty.An Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who is posted at Maharashtra Police’s headquarters, said out of the total 247 deaths among the police personnel due to Covid-19, including 84 in Mumbai Police alone, 10 families of the deceased were not eligible to get the state government’s compensation.These deceased policemen belonged to various district police units across Maharashtra and none was from Mumbai Police.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Vilas Genu Kachare, who belonged to Sangli district and was posted at Sanjay Nagar police station, is among the 10 deceased policemen, whose family members have been denied the state government’s compensation package. He was absent from duty since last October and was an alcoholic. He had died after suffering a fall in the washroom. He had tested Covid-19 positive after his death. Kachare is survived by his wife and a son. The state government’s order clearly stated that those police personnel would be eligible for the Rs 50-lakh compensation, who had performed Covid-19 related work at least 14 days before getting admitted to hospital or 14 days prior to their death.“The 10 policemen are from various districts of the state. Preliminary information suggested that they were on long leave due to various personal reasons when they had tested Covid-19 positive. Some policemen were absent for months. However, their families staked claim for the Rs 50-lakh compensation after they had died of the contagion,” said another police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-kin-of-10-maharashtra-cops-will-not-get-rs-50-lakh-compensation-as-they-didn-t-contract-virus-on-duty/story-TWg1Tw4tjQAotdPMqrJbWJ.html

02-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai records over 43% increase in testing in September, highest so far||Mumbai created a new record and reported a 43% spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests in September, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data showed. Until September 29, over 3.41 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in Mumbai. The corresponding figure for August and July was 2.38 lakh and 2.04 lakh, respectively. Data showed that out of the total 11.15 lakh tests conducted in Mumbai up to September 29, more than 52% or 5.80 lakh tests were conducted in August and September alone. The BMC had started to conduct Covid-19 tests on February 3 and the first case of the viral infection in the city was detected on March 11. The average Covid-19 daily tests in the past few months have consistently gone up. Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally surges past 6.39 million, death toll nears 1 lakhIn May, 3,872 tests were conducted on average on a daily basis. In June, the corresponding figure went up to 4,422 tests daily. In July and August, it breached the 6,400 and 7,700 mark, respectively.In September, the average was 11,775 tests.Aggressive testing mechanism was adopted in September, which also led to the detection of over 60,000 Covid-19 cases, as compared to the previous months. A data analysis of 1.41 lakh cases in Mumbai revealed that the city had reported around 7,000 Covid-19 cases until April 30.In May, Mumbai reported 31,874 Covid-19 cases, followed by June (36,559), July (35,139) and in August (around 30,474). BMC officials attributed the aggressive testing mechanism to the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions in a bid to revive the economic activities that have been battered by the Covid-19 pandemic.Civic officials said many employers are getting their employees tested, which have led to an uptick in Covid-19 test figures. Similarly, many inbound flight passengers are getting themselves tested on arrival at the airport.“We are testing to our full capacity and are able to test around 15,000 swab samples daily. However, in the coming days, the aim is to conduct around 20,000 tests. We will increase our capacity, which will happen with time,” Iqbal Singh Chahal, commissioner, BMC, had said last week.At present, 23 private laboratories in Mumbai are conducting Covid-19 tests. The one-lakh-test mark was crossed on May 6, two lakh on June 1, three lakh on June 24, four lakh on July 14, five lakh on July 29, six lakh on August 9, seven lakh on August 22, eight lakh on September 3, 10 lakh on September 20, and 11 lakh on September 27. Mumbai’s Covid-19 positivity rate is 18.15%.Earlier on July 7, the BMC authorities had relaxed the norms to conduct a Covid-19 test. They had removed the clause that made prescription from a registered medical practitioner mandatory. However, BMC officials claimed that the number of Mumbaikars, who were voluntarily getting themselves tested at private laboratories, went up only from September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-over-43-increase-in-testing-in-september-highest-so-far/story-xTRImu0p0EbWDVuZMGZfdI.html

02-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi yet to appoint a full-time state disability commissioner||The post of the state commissioner for persons with disabilities (PwD) in Delhi has been vacant for five-and-a-half months. Disability rights activists want the Delhi government to fill the post so that grievances of PwD can be addressed at the earliest, especially during the Coronavirus pandemic.After TD Dhariyal’s term as the state commissioner for PwD ended in December, the Delhi government gave additional charge to former bureaucrat Ramesh Negi, who was then the chairman of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, in March. But Negi’s tenure ended in May and since then the post has been vacant.In the absence of a full-time state commissioner, the staff is forwarding complaints to the respective departments for necessary action or requesting action taken reports. “We are getting a lot of complaints. But we are just forwarding them to the concerned departments. If we get action taken report, we forward it to the complainant,” said an official at the state commissioner’s office, requesting anonymity.Also Read: With fewer admissions, 61% of Covid-19 beds in Delhi vacant“The subordinate officials don’t have the power to pass any order. It is only the state Commissioner who can issue notices, summons, and hold hearings to address the grievances of people and pass orders for departments to comply. While the pandemic has been tough on people at large, it has made things extremely difficult for people with disabilities,” said Dhariyal.Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said, “We had initiated the process to appoint a new commissioner before the assembly elections and had sent a few names to the chief secretary. As services are not under us, the selection of the new state commissioner has to be done by the committee chaired by the chief secretary.”Delhi government’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “Principal secretary home is heading the committee and the process is on.”Stressing on the need for a full-time commissioner, disability rights advocate and co-founder of Samarthyam Anjlee Agarwal cited how caregivers for PwD were listed among those eligible for a curfew pass during the lockdown after she approached the then commissioner Negi to intervene.Also Read: 50 teams to check pollution in Delhi-NCR“The fact that there was a state commissioner for PwD, it became easier for us to get the issue addressed. The commissioner is the bridge between the disabled person and the government. An important order passed in Delhi can be replicated in other parts of the country,” Agarwal said.Dr Satendra Singh, professor at University College of Medical Sciences, said that state commissioners are the nodal authority to address concerns of people.“People with disabilities are facing problems, especially now during Covid pandemic, related to getting disability certificates, office-related matters etc. The Centre has also said that the commissioners will be the nodal officers to address all issues faced by disabled people during the pandemic. But the post is lying vacant for so many months. The government should appoint a full-time commissioner so that our grievances can be addressed at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-yet-to-appoint-a-full-time-state-disability-commissioner/story-Z7pjSLVGr76jmMXL14wOoL.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||PM Modi to inaugurate strategic Atal Tunnel at Rohtang tomorrow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by five hours, at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday. Modi will also attend public functions at Sissu in Lahaul-Spiti district and at Solang Valley, officials said. The prime minister will be accompanied by defence minister Rajnath Singh, they said. Atal Tunnel is the longest highway tunnel in the world, and the 9.02-km tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year. The valley was earlier cut off for six months every year due to heavy snowfall. MODI TO TRAVEL THROUGH TUNNEL, FLAG OFF BUS The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) from the mean sea level. According to the officials, the Prime Minister will arrive at the Centre for Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) in Kullu district on October 3. He will halt at a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) guest house and interact with the officials there. Meanwhile, the defence minister will reach Manali on Friday evening and hold a meeting with BRO officials. He will also inspect the tunnel ahead of its inauguration by the Prime Minister, officials said. Modi will travel through the Atal Tunnel to reach its north portal in Lahaul valley of Lahaul-Spiti district and flag off a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus for the south portal in Manali, they said. The south portal of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the north portal of the tunnel is located near Teling village at Sissu in the Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres. HORSE-SHOE SHAPED, SINGLE TUBE TUNNEL It is a horse-shoe shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and has an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres, officials said. The tunnel, built at a cost of about Rs 3,300 crore, is significant from the point of view of the country’s defence, they said. The BRO worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah fault zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017. Talking about the tunnel, a BRO official said it provides a telephone facility at every 150 metres of its stretch, a fire hydrant every 60 metres, emergency exits every 500 metres, turning cavern every 2.2 km, air quality monitors every 1 km, broadcasting system and automatic incident detection system with CCTV cameras every 250 metres. FRIEND’S SUGGESTION PAVED THE WAY The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002. Vajpayee got the idea for constructing the tunnel on a suggestion from his friend Arjun Gopal of Tashi Dobhe village in Lahaul, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had said. The Modi government decided to name it Atal Tunnel in December 2019 to honour the former prime minister who had passed away the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-strategic-atal-tunnel-at-rohtang-tomorrow/story-ZXeUlGwWK8kHvchShrLLjM.html
02-10-2020||Bhopal||MP Congress claims credit for fall in rape cases in 2019, BJP has different theory||After 14 years, Madhya Pradesh’s image of a state registering the highest number of rape cases in the country, has changed with a 10% decrease in number of rape cases reported in 2019, according to national crime records bureau (NCRB) 2019 data.The figures have resulted in a political slugfest, with the Congress claiming credit for the decline and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing the rival party of underreporting cases.The NCRB data pertains to the year 2019, when Congress leader Kamal Nath was the chief minister. Nath was replaced by BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan in March 2020 after 22 Congress MLAs rebelled and resigned from the state assembly, resulting in Nath losing majority on the floor of the house.As per the NCRB report released on Tuesday, Madhya Pradesh reported the third highest number of rape cases after Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh in 2019. The central Indian state reported 5,822 total rape cases in 2019 compared to 6,677 in 2018, a decline of about 10%. Overall cognizable crime cases against women in the state reduced by 19%, according to NCRB data. In case of rape of minors, Madhya Pradesh continues to top the chart with 3,337 such cases reported in 2019.Also Read: 2 arrested for rape and murder of 2-year-old in MPCongress leaders claimed credit for the fall in rape cases in 2019, but experts working in the area of women rights said the decline was due to under reporting of cases and also because of the change in the way of presenting rape data. “This year, the data is very technical. The number of total rape cases has gone down from 5,433 in 2018 to 2,485 in 2019 but we can’t say there is an actual fall of 54% in rape cases. While submitting the crime data to NCRB, MP police reported rapes in two different categories- of rape with adults and with minors, presented as offence under Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO). However, if we add up all the cases registered under section 376 (rape) of IPC with both women and minor girls, there is a decrease of 10%,” she said. Also Read: Hathras gang rape: AAP senior leaders to protest at India Gate todayA woman activist, Rolly Shivhare, said, “We can’t accept this data as it seems to be a case of under reporting. We haven’t seen any concrete step taken by the then Congress government in 2019 to curb crime against women. Their focus was mainly on farmers and unemployment, not women related issues.” Ruling BJP supported the experts’ view. BJP spokesperson Neha Bagga said, “The data represents nothing but fudging of numbers to show improvement. The number of cases looks like it has reduced due to under reporting, whereas, the BJP has always believed in reporting each and every incident of crime. The BJP-led state government had introduced many schemes and measures to curb crime during its previous regime. But the Congress government didn’t take any step in its 15-months’ rule from Dec 2018 to March 2020.” The Congress, however, claims that the reduction is a result of the then government’s “zero tolerance” policy for crime against women.“The then chief minister Kamal Nath’s zero tolerance policy for crime against women worked and sensitized the police, which resulted in not only rape cases but overall cognizable crime against women being reduced. To not report crime cases is a tactic of the BJP, not of the Congress,” said Congress leader and MP state women commission’s chairperson, Shobha Oza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-congress-claims-credit-for-fall-in-rape-cases-in-2019-bjp-has-different-theory/story-AdJSglEWPOA3u8HH3fduzO.html

02-10-2020||City||Wildlife sanctuary near proposed Chandrapur greenfield airport: Panel to submit report by Oct 31||A six-member committee has been appointed by the Maharashtra forest department to check the feasibility of declaring a 265 sq km area at Kanhargaon in Chandrapur as either a wildlife sanctuary or a conservation reserve based on consultations with local residents.The area of the proposed sanctuary falls in close proximity to the proposed 340-hectare Chandrapur greenfield airport, and if the sanctuary is declared, the airport area will fall within the eco-sensitive zone of the sanctuary, said members of the State Board of Wildlife (SBWL). However, conservation reserves do not have ESZ.Maharashtra’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Nitin Kakodkar, who constituted the committee earlier this week directed that a report on the final status of the proposed sanctuary or conservation reserve needs to be submitted by October 31.At a meeting of the SBWL in December 2018, the proposal to declare the sanctuary received in-principle approval. “However, during public consultations with local residents, there was stiff opposition to the declaration of a sanctuary. The matter was heard during the last (15th) SBWL meeting on August 7, and it was decided that we should revisit the matter, find out the opinion of locals and ensure the area gets the proposed protected status,” said Kakodkar. “Thus, this committee needs to assess the reasons for the opposition and submit details of villages against sanctuary declaration in less than a month.”“During the last SBWL meeting, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that while local residents around Kanhargaon were consulted but unfortunately nobody had taken a view about the tigers and other wildlife... how they are generally affected by human activities,” said SBWL member Kishor Rithe. He added Thackeray was for the approval for the sanctuary.Rithe said that Kanhargaon was declared a sanctuary in-principle by the previous government. “However, former forest minister (Sudhir Mungantiwar) who belongs to Chandrapur district had requested that local villagers be consulted. Probably there was a fear that the greenfield airport which comes in ESZ of the proposed sanctuary may halt the sanctuary’s final notification. FDCM [Forest Development Corporation Of Maharashtra] also has a commercial interest in the area. Regrettably, the poor wildlife cannot fight these forces, and hence there is an overall delay in issuing the final sanctuary notification,” said Rithe.According to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, the area extending from Vihirgaon and Murti, where the airport has been proposed, to Rajura forest area and Kanhargaon proposed sanctuary zones, forms part of an identified tiger corridor. The zone is also an important interstate link for tiger dispersal between Kawal and Indravati tiger reserves in Telangana and Chandrapur as well as the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve buffer, which is 38 km from the proposed airport site and 32 km from the Chaprala Wildlife Sanctuary, said a report by WII on the feasibility of the airport and proposed wildlife mitigation measures.“The proposed site is within the critical habitat and connectivity corridors of tigers. The present site may or shall not be considered for the construction of the proposed airport,” the report said. It added there were 12 tigers in a 20-30 km radius around the proposed airport site between Rajura reserved forest and Kanhargaon. There are 15 tigers and at least 23 leopards within the 265 sq km Kanhargaon area.The Chandrapur airport construction would require the diversion of 75-hectare forest land and destruction of 3,817 trees, according to the proposal by the Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC), which applied for forest clearances earlier this year. “We have submitted our views to the state government on the feasibility of the airport after studying MADC’s submissions and the WII report. We cannot disclose our submission at the moment as it is up to the state government to take a final call,” said Kakodkar.Gaurav Upshyam, senior manager (regional connectivity scheme), MADC, said there was no other alternate site for the airport. “The proposed project cannot be shifted elsewhere,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildlife-sanctuary-near-proposed-chandrapur-greenfield-airport-panel-to-submit-report-by-oct-31/story-hRgKift6CWQgbjPEJAUVSK.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||With fewer admissions, 61% of Covid-19 beds in Delhi vacant||With fewer cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) being reported in Delhi every day, the total number of hospitalisations across the city has also started declining over the last one week. On average, 6,598 people were hospitals on any given day in the last seven days, as compared to 7,014 during the week before that. There were only 6,146 people in hospitals as on Wednesday, according to the daily health bulletin. The number of active cases, or those living with the infection, has dropped to an average of 28,300 in the last seven days as compared to 31,562 the week before that. This has resulted in more beds that were earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 becoming vacant. Over 61% of the beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19—both in government and private hospitals—are currently vacant. However, when it comes to the intensive care unit (ICU) beds, only 34.2% are vacant, data from the Delhi Corona App shows. Seeing the ICU beds fill up faster in the second week of September, the Delhi government had asked its hospitals to increase the number of ICU beds and had ordered 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds for the treatment of Covid-19. In about 10 days, government hospitals as well as private hospitals were able to add 500 beds each. However, the order for the 33 private hospitals was challenged in the high court and the court has said it would hear the matter again on October 9, asking the Delhi government to submit data on whether ICU beds were available for the treatment of non-Covid-19 patients. As on Monday, about 55% of the ICU beds in the government hospitals were occupied and 72.5% of the beds in private sector hospitals were occupied, according to the Delhi Corona App. As for the occupancy in 12 of the big private hospitals, the occupancy has reduced slightly, but is at 84%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-fewer-admissions-61-of-covid-19-beds-in-delhi-vacant/story-vWzWFOd9Hl8ZsZramGQh5L.html

However, he was suspended from the BSP after last year’s parliamentary elections on charges of “indulging in anti-party activities” Ramvir and his family wield considerable clout in and around Hathras, which has grabbed headlines following the gang-rape and murder of a Dalit teenager (19) earlier this week by four upper caste men. Also Read: Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Mamata slam UP govt over Hathras gangrapeThe incident has sparked a political controversy much to the embarrassment of the UP government. The BJP was tight-lipped on whether Chiragvir would be deployed for damage control in the aftermath of the Hathras incident. BSP chief Mayawati has upped the ante against the UP government. She has demanded that CM Adityanath should resign or be replaced by some other BJP leader following the incident. Chiragvir was slated to join the BJP in Agra in August. But that move was put off at the last moment and on Thursday, the party made an abrupt announcement about its latest Brahmin face.“As a Ram bhakt, I feel the BJP is the best option to serve the country,” Chiragvir said after joining the party. He cited that he was impressed with the party’s policies and also the style of governance of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Adityanath.Also Read: Hathras gang-rape: Lawyers demand president’s rule in Uttar PradeshUP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh welcomed Chiragvir to the party and hoped that the new entrant would strengthen its base in the western UP region.In August, Satish Chandra Mishra, national general secretary, BSP, had cleared the air about Chiragvir’s bid to join the BJP and also the political fate of his father.“Ramvir Upadhyaya had been suspended by the party, as he had engaged in anti-party activities last year by supporting opposition candidates during the parliamentary elections. Neither his, nor his son’s joining (the BJP) will make any difference to our party,” Mishra had said.Ramvir’s brother Mukul, a former member of UP legislative council (MLC), had also joined the BJP last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/son-of-suspended-bsp-mla-from-hathras-joins-bjp/story-dJdc3FnTBOJ8UeNqvm3AmI.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Akali leaders consider shifting farm agitation from Punjab to Delhi||A day after their kisan marches to Raj Bhawan in Chandigarh were cut short and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leadership was detained and let off, the party leaders will be meeting shortly to discuss the strategy to put pressure on the Centre to revoke the three farm laws.Party sources said that the SAD leaders will be meeting to discuss their course of action and are considering shifting the protest from Punjab to Delhi.“We are considering taking the protests against the farm bills to the national capital, New Delhi. The party’s core committee meet is expected to take place shortly after which we will announce the further course of action. We are considering beginning a sit-in or a chain hunger strike outside Parliament,” said the party’s kisan (farmer) wing president Sikandar Singh Maluka.On Thursday night, police detained SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife, former Union minister and Bathinda MP, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, and other senior Akali leaders when they were trying to enter Chandigarh while leading marches from the three Sikh Takhts (seats of temporal authority). The Akali leaders were to submit a memorandum, addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind, to Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore demanding the repeal of the farm laws. While Sukhbir and senior SAD leaders, including Prem Singh Chandumajra, Bikram Singh Majithia and Jagir Kaur, were taken into preventive custody near Mullanpur; Harsimrat, Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma and Youth Akali Dal president Parambans Singh Bunty Romana were detained at Zirakpur. The police used water cannons and canecharged the protesters to disperse them as they tried to force their way across the barricades placed to stop them from entering Chandigarh at the Mullanpur and Zirakpur borders. The Chandigarh administration had imposed Section 144 of the CrPC, banning assembly of five and more people at one place. The police wanted only a few leaders to meet the Punjab governor to submit the memorandum but the SAD leadership demanded that all Akali members be allowed. “We detained them (Akali leaders) for a brief period and they were later released,” Chandigarh Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Chahal said. CHANDUMAJRA, JAGIR KAUR INJURED Chandumajra and Jagir Kaur received minor injuries as they fell on the ground in the melee. The Akali leaders were taken to the Sector 17 police station where they again held a protest against the Punjab government and the Chandigarh administration and demanded that they be allowed to give memorandum to the governor. Before being detained, Harsimrat addressed her supporters stating that they would continue to protest till the Union government rolled back the agriculture laws. She claimed her party had not been taken into confidence before introducing the bills. Earlier in the day, Sukhbir, Harsimrat and Chandumajra launched kisan (farmer) marches from Akal Takht, Amritsar, Takht Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sabo, and Takht Keshgarh Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, respectively, and headed for Chandigarh to hand over a memorandum, addressed to the President, to the Punjab governor, with an appeal to convene a special session of Parliament to amend the recent farm laws. BADAL SENIOR CONDEMNS USE OF FORCE Meanwhile, Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal strongly condemned the use of force on “peaceful” Akalis by the Chandigarh Police and said that the “brutal” lathicharge made this a “painful and dark day” for democracy in the country’s history. Last week, the SAD had announced to part ways with the NDA, the third major party to walk out of the BJP-led coalition in the last couple of years. On September 17, Harsimrat Kaur Badal had quit the Union Cabinet after the SAD chief strongly opposed the farm bills in Lok Sabha, claiming the legislations will “destroy” the agriculture sector in Punjab. President Ram Nath Kovind has given assent to the three contentious bills -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.

02-10-2020||Bhopal||MP saw more Covid cases in September than first 5 months of outbreak combined||Madhya Pradesh registered more Covid-19 cases in the month of September than were recorded in the first five months of coronavirus outbreak. In September, it also recorded as many as 40% of all Covid-19 deaths in the state, as per the health department’s Covid bulletins. As on Wednesday, the Covid-19 cases tally stood at 128,047 with 2,316 deaths and the recovery of 104,734 patients from the disease since March 20 onwards. The Covid-19 tests tally stood at 2,035,134. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Madhya Pradesh from Jabalpur on March 20.As many as 64,082 Covid cases were reported from across the state in the month of September alone, whereas, 63,965 Covid cases had been reported between March 20 and August 31—a period of more than five months.Similarly, 922 Covid-19 patients died in September against 1,394 deaths recorded in the period from March 20 to August 31. As per the official data, on an average, one Covid case was reported every less than 4 minutes from across the state between March and August, whereas in September, three Covid cases were reported every two minutes, thus registering an increase of 469%. Similarly, between March and August, death of a Covid patient was reported every 170 minutes on an average, whereas in September, a death due to Covid-19 was reported almost every 47 minutes. Also Read: At least 14 states have less than 5,000 active Covid-19 cases each: Health ministryThere was an increase in positivity rate too, which varied from day to day. For instance, in the last five days of August, the positivity rates were recorded at 5.5%, 4.8%, 5.3%, 6.2% and 5.5% respectively. The same on the last five days of September stood at 10%, 12.2%, 9%, 10% and 8.6%. However, if the number of cases, deaths and positivity rates increased alarmingly in September, so did the number of those who recovered from the disease across the state. The recoveries rose from 48,657 registered between March and August to 56,077 in September alone. Thus, on an average, one Covid patient recovered from the disease every less than 5 minutes in the six months period between March and August, while more than six patients recovered every 5 minutes in September as Covid cases went up significantly. More than 6.57 lakhs tests were conducted in September that accounted for less than 50% of the total tests conducted between March and August. Madhya Pradesh lags behind several states on the number of tests conducted per million of the population, as per health department officials. As per the health bulletin released on Wednesday night, MP had conducted 28,032 Covid-19 tests per million. Public health experts find the state government’s current handling of the Covid-19 situation worrying and disappointing. “Apart from the government data which lacks transparency, more worrying is the fact that the government seems to have withdrawn itself from its responsibility to control the Covid situation. The government authorities are repeatedly attributing a significant increase in Covid cases to people moving around during Unlock whereas huge gatherings are witnessed in almost every political meeting ahead of bypolls in the state,” said Amulya Nidhi, a public health expert. Also Read: MP pharma factory murder: Police make 3 more arrestsAnother public health expert SR Azad said, “Till now the government has not made public its death audit report. There is no data available on patients and deaths hospital wise. There is no response to the growing number of complaints from the Covid patients and their relatives and till now there is no aggressive strategy to control the situation.” Despite efforts, additional chief secretary, health department, Mohd Suleman, couldn’t be reached for comments. However, on Thursday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “There is a constant improvement in the Covid situation across the state. While the recovery rate has gone up to 82.5%, the number of active cases is coming down constantly. The number of active cases had reduced by 2000 in the past 4 days. The death rate too, has come down significantly. In the past 15 days, the death rate was 1% while the overall death rate is 1.08%.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-saw-more-covid-cases-in-september-than-first-5-months-of-outbreak-combine/story-Jr1dZ8SqhPsKnBJrf9HY4M.html

02-10-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sonam’s musician||In your life too, there must be people you don’t personally know but whom you would often spot in the BC (before corona) era.An ATM guard. A fruit seller. A beggar.On daily seeing these unknown yet familiar faces—during our commute, somewhere in our street—what impression do they leave on us? What do we take away from them? And how to remember?Sonam Pandey, a 22-year-old Master’s student in Hindi Literature, just finished immortalising a man she knew—in a painting. The drawing looks like one of those watercolours sold by street artists in the touristic quarters of Paris—the typical evening sight of a musician serenading on a bridge, below a faintly glowing lamp.Except that this is Vaishali, in Ghaziabad. Where the aforementioned musician would station himself on the pedestrian footbridge, every day, outside the Metro station.“I would often see him while exiting the station, playing his harmonium,” says Ms Pandey on WhatsApp video, from her home in Brij Vihar, near Vaishali.Actually, that gentleman is named Pradeep (his picture is from a year ago). About 30, he would sit on the footbridge to play bhajans and Hindi film songs, while occasional passersby would drop a coin or two on his instrument. A native of Hardoi in UP, Pradeep was crippled since birth and used a special wheelchair to go about. During the day, especially in summer months, he would avoid the bridge (it has no roof to protect him from the harsh sun) and would rather lounge or sleep under a tree beneath. He lived in a homeless shelter that didn’t allow people to spend the day hours inside. Pradeep would say that he had no family, pointedly mentioning that he never felt alone “because I live with four friends, who are crippled like me.”But where is he now? The Metro service has resumed on the Blue Line—Vaishali is the route’s starting point—and he still isn’t anywhere to be seen. Ms Pandey reports she hasn’t spotted him since the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown began, in late March.The young woman often turns to drawing when feeling low. Last Saturday, while wondering about the footbridge musician’s whereabouts, she recreated him on her drawing paper in one hour flat.“Maybe he has gone to some other place,” she suggests, hopefully.Until the musician eventually comes back, one of the places where he can be found is in her dream-like painting. In some ways, a perfect shelter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-sonam-s-musician/story-zkvrIZ7Z5xtrHgIjKwz2pI.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||50 teams to check pollution in Delhi-NCR||Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said on Thursday that 50 Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) teams will be deployed starting on October 15 in the National Capital Region (NCR) to curb air pollution this winter.CPCB will also coordinate with north-western states daily to monitor emissions, Javadekar said following a review meeting with the environment ministers of Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.“The 50 teams will be on the ground monitoring polluting activities in Delhi-NCR. They will inform relevant government agencies immediately so that quick action can be taken {when air quality dips. In fact, we deployed the teams in a dry run between September 15 and 20, and did find several pollution sources such as dumping of waste, construction rubble and dust, unpaved roads,” said Prashant Gargava, member-secretary of CPCB.The review took place as the capital and neighbouring towns in the NCR brace for the winter, when a thick smoky haze envelops the region mainly as a result of post-harvest stubble burning in northern Indian states such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, disrupting air and train traffic. Ensuring farmers don’t set crop stubble on fire may be more difficult this year because small farmers hurt by the Covid-19-led economic slowdown may not have the means to hire machines and tractors to clear their farmlands of stubble, experts have said. Till September 29, 520 crop fires have been reported in Punjab and 175 in Haryana till Thursday, according to CPCB.Rice and wheat that are the staples grown in the region are dependent on nitrogenous fertiliser that leads to soil degradation, an expert said. “The key issue is linked to the cropping patterns. Unless the rice-wheat cropping system is broken, the ecological crisis of high groundwater use, high fertilizer use or stubble burning will not stop,” said G V Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad. “The gap between rice and wheat seasons is short, labour wages are high, which leads to stubble burning.” Given the short gap, burning is usually the quickest and cheapest way of ridding the fields of stubble. According to the index maintained by CPCB, air quality in NCR was “satisfactory” for just eight days, a level at which atmospheric pollution poses little or no risk, in September. On the remaining 22 days of the month, it was moderate. Comparatively, August saw four good air days; air quality was satisfactory over the rest of the month.At Thursday’s meeting, the environment ministers decided to focus on so-called hot spots of air pollution. For example, Delhi will focus on controlling pollution sources in 13 hot spots, including Mayapuri, Bawana, Narela, Dwarka, Rohini, RK Puram and Jahangirpuri. Similarly, Haryana will focus on Panipat, Sonepat, Jhajjar and other areas; Uttar Pradesh will concentrate its anti-pollution effort on Bulandshahr, Meerut, Noida and Greater Noida; and Rajasthan will focus on Bhiwadi. Trials have begun on a stubble decomposer developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) in all stubble-burning states, Javadekar said. “We may see results of the trials in a year or so. The Centre has already disbursed ₹1,700 crore in the past three years for subsidising straw management machinery to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. That has also resulted in reduction of area under stubble burning,” he claimed.Punjab officials informed the Centre that the state was trying to raise awareness in the districts where stubble-burning is common on the link between Covid-19 and air pollution. “The Punjab government is communicating the link to farmers and locals,” Javadekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/50-teams-to-check-pollution-in-delhi-ncr/story-bykHGCvRazL7GqkoxYmN0N.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Efforts on to retrieve body of retired BSF officer who died on recce to China border||The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is carrying out an operation to bring back the body of SC Negi, 70, a former deputy inspector general (DIG) of the Border Security Force (BSF), who died in the icy heights of Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday while voluntarily leading a reconnaissance mission to find a shorter route to the China border. The ITBP said the retired BSF officer was rescued by a patrol party of the force from the remote Nishangaon area of Kinnaur district along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China. Negi was seen lying injured with multiple fractures by an ITBP patrol. He died while being carried by ITBP personnel. The body is kept at Ganthambralam border post at a height of 18,600 feet in Himachal Pradesh, while a helicopter sortie is awaited to pick the mortal remains. “There is no foul play. He died after falling. His body has injury marks,” Kinnaur superintendent of police Sarju Ram Rana said. Negi, who belonged to Kinnaur, commanded a BSF battalion during 1999 Kargil War. He retired in 2010 after 33 years of service. A noted mountaineer, he was the “oldest Indian police officer” to lead an expedition to Mount Everest. “He took his last breath in the mountains for the cause of the nation when he was willingly leading a recce (reconnaissance) and survey team of security forces to explore the shortest route to the China border in Himachal Pradesh,” the BSF said in a statement. The security forces, however, declined to disclose the point of origin and end of the recce. “He (Negi) was advised by his family against the trip in view of his age, but he said it will be his last one,” the BSF said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/efforts-on-to-retrieve-body-of-retired-bsf-officer-who-died-on-recce-to-china-border/story-LMqrNG1hE92Xm3jjR3tcBO.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s September GST collection grows 8% year-on-year amid Covid-19 pandemic||The goods and services tax (GST) collection in Punjab grew by a little over 8% year-on-year in September, showing a clear sign of economic recovery after months of subdued business activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the first time that the monthly GST collection has shown an increase year-on-year in the first half of the financial year 2020-21 during which the coronavirus-induced lockdown had hit the businesses and the government revenues hard. The GST collection, including both state goods and services tax (SGST) and integrated goods and services tax (IGST), was Rs 1,055.23 crore in September 2020 as against Rs 974.96 crore in the corresponding month previous year, showing a growth of 8.23%, according to the data compiled by the taxation department. September’s mop-up is also 7% more than the previous month (August 2020). Commissioner (taxation) Nilkanth S Avhad said the numbers signal economic recovery and an improvement in business sentiment. “However, there may be a minor component of tax payments for previous months in the last month’s collection as the Central government had given relaxation to small businesses with a turnover of less than Rs 5 crore in filing of return,” he added. The relaxation ended of September 30. The value-added tax (VAT) and central sales tax (CST) collection – most of which comes from diesel and petrol, have reported 39% increase year-on-year. Against Rs 332 crore in September 2019, the collection was Rs 462.98 crore this time. The jump in VAT is mainly on account of the increased rates of petrol and diesel. However, the overall GST mop-up during the first half of the financial year 2020-21 has been sluggish, dropping by 31% year-on-year. The state’s collection for the April-September period was Rs 4,685.72 crore as against Rs 6,790.34 crore during the corresponding months of the previous year. The dip in revenue has been a dampener for the fund-starved government even though its monthly GST revenue is protected at Rs 2,403 in 2020-21. At the time of switching to GST, the Centre had guaranteed 14% year-on-year growth over the 2015-16-base and the state was to be compensated for any shortfall. Though there is a shortfall of Rs 8,312.77 crore in the GST revenue during the April-August period, the state has not received any compensation so far. The Centre, which, too, has seen a drop in its collections, offered two options – borrow the compensation amount arising out of GST implementation, or the entire shortfall – to the states with certain riders, but the Punjab government has turned down both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-sept-gst-collection-grows-8-yoy-amid-covid/story-i0qJKUNptpSn299WlWwmGI.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Spotlight turns on protest hotspots in Punjab as farmers intensify stir against agriculture laws||The 31 farmer organisations that intensified their stir across Punjab against the Centre’s agriculture laws on Thursday are focusing on certain points that have emerged as the protest hotspots from where they want to take their fight forward. HT visits these sites to check what is happening on the ground. Devi Dasspura, Amritsar With members of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee laying siege to the Amritsar-Delhi railway route for the eighth consecutive day on Thursday against the Centre’s agriculture bills, Devi Dasspura village of Amritsar district has turned into an epicentre of the ‘rail roko’ agitation in the Majha region. Nearly 18 km from the Amritsar city and 3km from Jandiala Guru town, Devi Dasspura, which has a considerable population of farmers, is situated along the National Highway-1. The farmers have also blocked the rail tracks in Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts of the region. Led by Sarwan Singh Pandher, state general secretary of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, the agitating farmers have pitched tents on both sides of the tracks. A makeshift stage has been set up with a public address system to address the protesters from time to time. A separate tent has been set up for a community kitchen (langar) where food is prepared and served by volunteers of the Kar Sewa and nihang organisations. Besides plain water, sweet coloured water and shardai, a traditional beverage usually prepared with a variety of ingredients by nihangs, are served to the those from kiosks at the protest site.Also, vendors are seen selling ‘matka kulfi’ and ‘gol gappas’ etc. Farmers from Gurdaspur and Tarn Taran districts are also coming to the village participate in the agitation. Shambu, Patiala Situated on the Punjab-Haryana interstate border, Shambu village in the Patiala district has turned into a major hotspot of farmer protests in the area. While 31 farmer organisations laid siege to the railway tracks on New Delhi-Rajpura line here on Thursday for an indefinite period, the village has been witnessing protests since September 23 against the farm legislations. On September 20, the Youth Congress workers had organised a protest at nearby Dhabu after they were stopped by the Haryana Police from entering the neighbouring state. Three days later, hundreds of protesters led by Punjab MLAs Simarjeet Singh Bains and his brother Balwinder Singh Bains held a protest at Shambu as they were also denied entry into Haryana while taking out a procession to the national capital. On September 25, thousands of farmers accompanied by social organisations and Punjabi artists staged a protest at the village, blocking the national highway throughout the day as part of their Punjab bandh call. Not only farmers, the youth from rural areas of the nearby districts, particularly Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib, joined farmers in huge numbers. Harbhajan Singh Buttar, a Krantikari Kisan Union leader, said the protest site was chosen due to its proximity with the New Delhi- Jalandhar national highway. “With Haryana restricting the entry of farmers, protest at Shambu will give a clear message that if they don’t allow us to move to Delhi, we will block the rail route and the national highway,” he said. Phillaur, Jalandhar Hundreds of farmers owing allegiance to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) and the Jamhuri Kisan Sabha on Thursday started the ‘rail roko’ agitation and blocked the Phillaur railway junction in Jalandhar district in protest against the farm bills. Farmers from Jalandhar, Kapurthala and the Malwa region gathered at the junction in the afternoon and announced to hold a protest for indefinite period asking the BJP led Union government to withdraw the farm bills and guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops. A large number of farmers from SBS Nagar, Jalandhar, Phagwara and Goraya gathered and pitched tents on the railway track. Similar rail roko protests were witnessed at Doraha, Jagraon and Samrala in Ludhiana where farmers put their charpoys on the railway tracks. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the BKU (Rajewal) said while the economy was completely in shambles, the farming sector was the only saving gracing. “But the BJP government at the Centre wants to usurp this sector and hand it over to its crony capitalist friends. But the farmers in Punjab will not let this happen and fight till the time the laws are withdrawn,” said Rajewal. Surinder Singh, a farmer from Phagwara, said the Centre is trying to grab their land. “The Narendra Modi-led government has betrayed the farmers. If this government was really concerned about the welfare of farmers, it should have promised MSP to farmers,” he said. Lehra Bega, Bathinda A strong gathering of nearly 1,000 farmers led by a woman leader, Paramjit Kaur Pitho, from Thursday started an indefinite dharna at the toll plaza on National Highway-7 at Lehra Bega village in Bathinda district against the farm laws. Activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugraha) have put up tents forcing the agency collecting highway user fees to close the booths. Only one motorway was kept open on both sides and there was no toll plaza official to collect fee from vehicles. The site, located about 20km from Bathinda city, also had women protesters. BKU leader Paramjit said the site was chosen as a symbol to hit the corporate houses directly at their revenue points. “Our activists have started staging a dharna at a Reliance Group-owned petrol pump a few meters from the toll plaza. The corporate houses are making inroads for the agriculture sector in connivance with the Central government,” she said to a thunderous applause from the gathering. The organisers have arranged a generator set to power pedestal fans and a public address system. During the lunchtime, the volunteers served the participants with chapati, pickle, lassi and tea at the dharna site. Beant Singh Jethuke, another union leader, urged farmers to motivate fellow villagers to join the stir to press for a rollback of new laws.

02-10-2020||Jaipur||Political row over Rajasthan’s rape cases||A political row erupted on Thursday over cases of sexual assault in Rajasthan in the last 10 days, following the Hathras incident in Uttar Pradesh. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attacked the Congress-led state government over incidents of gang-rape in Baran, Sikar, Ajmer and Jaipur, while the Congress, in defence, said it had taken quick action in all cases. In Baran, two girls, 15 and 13, went missing on September 18 and their father filed a missing persons’ report at Mahila police station on September 19. The girls were found in Kota two days later with two minor boys, both aged 17. On Wednesday, the girls’ father told media outlets that his daughters were kidnapped and gang-raped in Jaipur, Kota and Ajmer, after being intoxicated. Baran SP Dr Ravi said the girls, in their statement before a magistrate, said they went with the boys for an outing. The medical examination of the girls was also conducted in which no evidence of sexual assault was found, he added. The family alleged police inaction in the case. The Baran Police denied the allegation. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the Opposition was misleading people by drawing an analogy between the Baran and the Hathras cases. “Hathras gang rape incident is extremely condemnable… the incident of Baran is being compared with the Hathras incident which is very unfortunate. The girls in Baran in their statement under CrPC 164 provision have refused being raped and have stated of going on outing with the boys,” he wrote on Twitter. In Sikar, a minor alleged on September 29 that two men had entered her house in January and sexually assaulted her, and also filmed the act. The girl said the accused drugged her father and that her mother had gone out. Two of the three accused had been arrested in the Sikar case, the police said. BJP spokesperson and party law-maker Ramlal Sharma said, “The government has failed to curb such incidents. We demand that the state government immediately investigate these cases and present the challan in the court, and set up a special court to punish them,” said Sharma. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the Congress government takes such incidents seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/political-row-over-rajasthan-s-rape-cases/story-p3i4Pfb6HYdn0lmMnolJtL.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Making Chandigarh safe and secure my priority: SSP Chahal||Kuldeep Singh Chahal is back in Chandigarh, this time as the senior superintendent of police. He had joined the UT police as an assistant sub-inspector in 2005 and then cleared the Indian Police Services exam. The 2009-cadre IPS officer talked to HT on the day he took charge of his new assignment. Excerpts of an interview: What are going to be your priorities as the Chandigarh SSP?Maintaining law and order in the city will be the priority. Women, children and senior citizens are vulnerable, thus special focus will be on providing a safe environment to them. “We care for you” is want I will be working for and connecting with the residents at every level.What are the challenges you foresee?Life is a challenge and as an officer, we are trained to deal with any situation. In Chandigarh, which is the capital of two states, ensuring law and order is the endeavour of the force.The lack of intercity co-ordination in tricity has been an area of concern. Your plan?Of late, the co-ordination among the officers in tricity has improved and it has led to solving a number of crimes. To ensure that the co-ordination improves, I will ensure regular meetings at different levels and immediate sharing of information about crimes. How policing is going to be different in Chandigarh?The ultimate aim is to serve the people. Nothing much changes with change of city. Here, people are more aware and outspoken. Corruption, groupism among ranks have emerged as a challenge…We have zero tolerance to corruption and no one will be spared if found involved in any kind of malpractice. A single allegation of corruption against an individual dents the image of the entire force. With regards to groupism, Chandigarh Police is disciplined and professional and these things don’t matter when it comes to duty.Of late gangsters have marked their presence in tricity, especially in Chandigarh. What do you plan to check this?There have been an active movement of gangsters in the tricity of late, but quick police action has helped to keep them under check. No one in conflict with law will be spared.In recent years street crime has emerged as serious problem. Your take. Already, Chandigarh Police had good number of police deployments on the ground. Night dominance and vulnerable areas will see more police presence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/making-city-safe-and-secure-my-priority-ssp-chahal/story-Ybai8aIhwhptljeO4g6r6N.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s senior citizens most vulnerable to fraudsters||Often known as the best city to retire in, Chandigarh saw the highest rate of cheating cases against senior citizens (those aged above 60) in 2019, a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed.As per the report titled, Crimes in India 2019, Chandigarh, with a population of 70,000 senior citizens and seven cases under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code, had a rate of 10.4 in 2019. The rate of crime is calculated by taking into account the number of incidents per lakh population. The city was followed by Delhi with a rate of 9.2 and Maharashtra at 7.5. The national rate for this crime is at 2.2 incidents per lakh population.Other crimesThe city also has the second highest rate of thefts against senior citizens with 29.8 incidents per one lakh population after Delhi at 48.5. Chandigarh has the third highest rate of total crimes committed against seniors. At 74.5 incidents per lakh population, it is third after Delhi at 93.8 and Gujarat at 85.4. A total of 50 crimes were committed against seniors in the city in 2019, which came down from 64 in 2018. With 34 cases pending from previous years, the Chandigarh police investigated 84 in all in 2019, out of which chargesheet was submitted in 17 cases. As many as 44 cases are still pending.Seniors living alone most vulnerableFormer president and founding member of the Chandigarh Senior Citizens Association, Brigadier Keshav Chandra (retd) said, “Chandigarh has a large number of senior citizens whose children live in other cities, thus leaving them vulnerable. Seniors must make it a rule to read all documents thoroughly before signing it. Banks and the administration must also ensure that forms and other documents can be made more accessible for seniors as the small fonts are sometimes not very legible for them.” Chandra further added that the police should also educate seniors about the various ways that fraudsters can cheat them of their money or property.Talking about the services that the police are providing to the seniors, the public relations officer of the Chandigarh police, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk said, “During the lockdown, we have prepared lists of how many seniors are living in a sector and where they are living. The beat staff have provided them with their contact numbers, and they have been asked to check with them regularly to ensure that police remains approachable for the seniors.”President of Second Innings Association in Chandigarh, RK Garg added, “Going digital has been detrimental for seniors. It is possible for fraudsters to access their contact numbers over their social media and defraud them. Stricter security is needed for such transactions and seniors need to be made aware of how people can cheat them by asking them details about their bank accounts, mutual fund investments and insurance policies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-senior-citizens-most-vulnerable-to-fraudsters/story-hBtqPfrfdXFUUt206CfNtL.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Police, in PPE, chasing Covid positive robber on loose||A prisoner infected with Covid-19 escaped from the government-run Lok Nayak Hospital last week, becoming one of the men most wanted by Delhi Police after forcing at least six personnel of the department, who had come in contact with him without knowing his medical condition, into self-isolation. A Delhi Police team from the central district is now chasing the man, whom they want to capture before he spreads the infection. Wearing face shields, gloves and carrying hand sanitisers along with their weapons, the central district officers have been to the house of the fugitive prisoner in north-east Delhi at least twice. On both occasions, the police kept their personal protective equipment (PPE) suits handy so that they could catch him.Officials privy to the details of the case said that when the man was first arrested from the Rajiv Chowk metro station September 22, no one knew he was Covid-positive. The man, whom police identified as Mehtab Ahmed,33, had travelled at least 10km on a metro train before attempting to steal a passenger’s cell phone; he was caught in the act and handed to the police, who suspect he may have infected other unwary passengers on Delhi Metro premises. Narrating the details of the case, a senior Delhi police officer, who didn’t want to be named, said that on September 22, they received information from a metro passenger who had caught Mehtab red-handed while stealing the passenger’s cell phone. Police suspect Mehtab was asymptomatic when he entered the metro rail coach and may have passed the temperature checks at thermal scanners at the entry gates. On the afternoon of September 22, the passenger, Saksham Labania, 19, had boarded the metro at Kashmere Gate and was on his way to Uttam Nagar. Labania said in his statement to the police that when he got off at the Rajiv Chowk station, two persons who were behind him inside the train disembarked at the same time. “One of them tried to steal my phone. I caught him with the help of others and took him to a police booth near platform number 3 from where he was formally arrested,” Labania wrote in his police statement.The metro police seized the Oppo A53 phone that Mehtab had stolen and took him to the metro station’s lockup inside the building where he was kept that night. The officer cited above said that until that night no one had a clue that Mehtab was a Covid-19 patient. “Maybe he (Mehtab) did not know it himself. The following morning when he was taken to Tihar, the jail officers conducted a mandatory Covid test. The test results showed he was Covid-19 positive. Mehtab also complained of body ache and fever, after which he was referred to Lok Nayak hospital. The police team that had come in contact with Mehtab was also informed after which they too have gone into self-isolation,” said the officer. According to case files, Mehtab was admitted to a Covid-19 ward on the sixth floor of the hospital. Two Delhi police constables were also guarding him because Mehtab was a prisoner from Tihar jail. According to the FIR filed by police, on the afternoon of September 23, Mehtab entered the bathroom, removed the window grille and fled from the hospital. Police registered a case. A police officer from the IP Estate police station, whose team is now on the lookout for the fugitive, said: “We have been to his house in Shastri Park twice and told his family members about Mehtab’s condition. Not only has he committed a crime by fleeing police custody but he is also carrying the virus and must be spreading it wherever he is hiding. This is the first such case of a Covid prisoner that we are handling... our team wore a face shield and gloves. Our PPE kits were also ready in the car.” HT contacted Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for a response on how the Covid-19 patient had managed to travel for over 10km with other passengers. DMRC executive director Anuj Dayal said: “Only asymptomatic passengers are allowed inside.” A Tihar jail officer said they are confident Mehtab did not spread the virus inside the prison because all new prisoners are made to undergo the mandatory Covid-19 test, and are allowed inside with others only afterwards. “There are eight active cases among prisoners in Tihar but all these eight are of new prisoners. Mehtab did not spread it inside prison but he must be doing so wherever he is hiding,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-in-ppe-chasing-covid-positive-robber-on-loose/story-Eh6KYhswZYvoqSqxzp0zOP.html

Singh replaces Kuldeep Singh Chahal, who is on deputation to Chandigarh as the SSP. After assuming the charge, the SSP held a meeting with his subordinates.Singh said policing would be based on police-public participation, adding that people should feel that they are listened to and should have the confidence to come forward and report illegal activity in their vicinity.He also pointed out that the safety of women and elderly, traffic management and Covid-19 safety protocol compliance were other important areas of focus.Special vigil will be maintained over organised/white-collar crime and the functioning of all police stations would be closely monitored by him to evaluate their performance, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-mohali-ssp-advocates-resident-friendly-policing/story-DMiYWgISzXBX98fw9eMqUN.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Unpaid since June, 150 computer teachers in Chandigarh relieved of duty||Around 150 senior and junior computer instructors and data entry operators, hired by the UT education department through a private contractor, were relieved of duty on Thursday, four months after not being paid any salary.This, when the teachers had been regularly sending representations in that regard to the department and were, in turn, being acknowledged.Earlier, the instructors were drawing salaries from the Society for Promotion of IT in Chandigarh (SPIC), but the education department had hired a private contractor through the government e-marketplace (GeM) in June.In a complaint submitted to the district education officer, the teachers had accused the contractor of asking for ₹12,000 from each of them in lieu of retaining jobs, but no action has been taken against the contractor so far.Sources said that if the allegations were proven true, a notice will be sent to the contractor and the education department will have to hire another one through the GeM.Meanwhile, the teachers said they hadn’t received their salaries since June amid the pandemic, and will be seeking legal action against the contractor.President of UT cadre of education employees’ union, Swarn Singh Kamboj, said it was unjust that the teachers were being laid off during the pandemic without being paid. “We will speak to the director of school education to rehire the teachers. They had been working for the past six to eight years and the department must stand by them.”Saying that the department was also concerned about the teachers, director school education (DSE) Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “The teachers were outsourced and we weren’t able to pay their salaries, so they had to be relieved. However, we are aware of the issues they have been facing with their contractors, and we aim to resolve them and bring things back to normal by next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unpaid-since-june-150-computer-teachers-in-chandigarh-relieved-of-duty/story-FBShJWLmSONN9ab3lrLepL.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||HC notice to Haryana on plea challenging bifurcation of Panchkula MC||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday put Haryana government on notice acting on a plea challenging the bifurcation of the Panchkula municipal corporation (MC).Former councillor of the erstwhile combined MC of Panchkula district, Satinder Singh Tony, has challenged the September 17 notification of the state notifying Kalka municipal council while segregating Kalka-Pinjore area from the bounds of Panchkula MC.Seeking a response from the state by November 11, the high court bench of justice Daya Chaudhary and justice MI Mehta has asked the government why the notification should not be stayed, pending proceedings.Tony had argued that objections to the proposal by stakeholders had not been taken into consideration by the government before carrying out the notification. He also cited a resolution passed by the Panchkula MC House against the move in 2018, which was ignored in violation of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994.It was further argued that even before the notification came out, the authorities had completed the delimitation of the existing wards of Panchkula in August, which proved that it was a premeditated move.The Haryana Municipal Corporation Act was amended last year and the word ‘existing’ was added before ‘population’. Tony pointed out that population was an important criteria to form or abolish a corporation, and as per rules, the last published figure of population in Indian census report was a vital document. However, the divisional commissioner had considered the decennial growth rate up till 2017 to bifurcate the corporation.The Panchkula MC was divided into Kalka municipal council and MC for Panchkula city on the report of divisional commissioner, Ambala, which had come in the aftermath of demands from then BJP legislators of Kalka and Panchkula in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-haryana-on-plea-challenging-bifurcation-of-panchkula-mc/story-LgAFn215nTp7OWJCmzhfcN.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||40% of J&K’s Covid-related deaths took place in September||Jammu and Kashmir logged 40% of the overall Covid-related fatalities in the UT in September, the highest so far. Though deaths have gone down in Kashmir, there has been a corresponding spike in Jammu division. The UT had logged 326 deaths in August and 478 deaths in September. J&K recorded 68% of the total Covid fatalities (804) in August and September . So far, the UT has reported 1,181 fatalities. The death toll had crossed the 500-mark on August 13 and 1000-mark on September 20. Of the 1,181 deaths, 839 were reported in Kashmir and 342 in Jammu.

02-10-2020||Mumbai||Sexual assault case: Mumbai Police question Anurag Kashyap for 8 hours||Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap was questioned by Versova police for close to eight hours on Thursday. Kashyap has been accused of sexual assault by a 30-year-old actor and was asked to join the probe on Tuesday. On September 22, Mumbai Police had filed a first information report (FIR) after an actor filed a complaint alleging Kashyap had sexually assaulted her in 2013 when she’d approached him for work. Kashyap has been charged under sections 376 (I) (rape), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with an intent to outrage her modesty,), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He has denied the allegations. On Thursday, Kashyap reached Versova police station with his advocate at around 10am and left at 6pm. Abhishek Trimukhe, deputy commissioner of police (zone-9), said, “We have recorded his statement and are investigating the case thoroughly.” The complainant was taken to Cooper Hospital for a medical examination. In her complaint, the actor alleged Kashyap had invited her to his home on Yari Road in August 2013, to discuss a role in one of his upcoming films. When she was at his residence, Kashyap allegedly sexually assaulted her. The complainant said she managed to get away and leave his house. Afterwards, she had narrated her ordeal to her driver Omprakash and her manager Rakesh Kumar, according to her statement. The actor also said that she had posted this incident on social media two years ago, when conversations regarding sexual harassment at workplaces had been encouraged by the #MeToo movement, but she deleted the post upon advice from her family and friends in the film industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sexual-assault-case-mumbai-police-question-anurag-kashyap-for-eight-hours/story-2cHy3sQtEzSzV7QC0IMGRO.html

02-10-2020||City||Hathras gang-rape: First handle Uttar Pradesh’s jungle raj, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh taunts Yogi Adityanath||Reacting to the gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh taunted Uttar Pradesh chief minister (CM) Yogi Adityanath, asking him to deal with the “jungle raj in his state, instead of advising others on how to handle law and order”. Even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray condemned the incident, state Congress as well as Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar condemned the manhandling of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi by UP Police as he headed to meet the victim’s family. The 19-year-old, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday a fortnight after she was gang-raped, was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. “We saw Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanth giving advice to others during the past few months. I advise him to first take care of his state and initiate strict action against the jungle raj prevailing there,” said Deshmukh. Thackeray said his government won’t tolerate Hathras-like incident in the state. “For that matter, any kind of crime against women, including harassment and molestation, would be dealt with severely,” said Thackeray. Condemning the treatment given to Gandhi, Pawar tweeted: “Reckless behaviour of UP Police towards @INCIndia leader Shri @RahulGandhi is extremely condemnable. It is reprehensible for those who are supposed to uphold the law to trample upon the democratic values in such a manner.” Maharashtra revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat held the UP government guilty for the whole incident. “This incident is a blot on the country and shows the functioning of the state government,” said Thorat. The Mumbai Congress workers, angered, held protests and sloganeered against Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hathras-gang-rape-first-handle-uttar-pradesh-s-jungle-raj-maharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-taunts-yogi-adityanath/story-rAOwjaRk8d5541wcEijNsN.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||After facing flak for supporting only actors, Union minister Ramdas Athawale to meet Hathras victim’s family||Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale has announced that he would meet the family of the Hathras gang rape victim in Uttar Pradesh (UP) on Friday. Athawale made the statement after facing flak for seeking justice only for actors while neglecting the Hathras victim. On Wednesday, Athawale announced that his Republican Party of India (RPI) will also hold protests at Azad Maidan against the Hathras incident. “I will meet the family of the victim on Friday and also meet (UP) Governor Anandiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday and demand a fast track court trial in the case,” the minister said. The minister was criticised after he visited Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari on Tuesday along with an actor who had accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of sexual assault but remained silent on the Hathras victim, who succumbed to her injuries after being tortured by four men. Athawale had also supported actor Kangana Ranaut, who launched a tirade against the Shiv Sena. The minister said his party will offer security to Ranaut and also met Koshyari to protest against the demolition of the actor’s office by the Mumbai civic body and demanded compensation for her. The Shiv Sena had then hit out at Athawale and said that he was more concerned about getting justice for actors instead of common people. Apart from political rivals, he also faced criticism from on social media after citizens questioned the priorities of the Union minister and said he was more interested in fighting for celebrities instead of Dalits. Political observers opine that the Dalit leadership has “bowed” before the major political parties. “Athawale knows that celebrities would attract more publicity for him than taking up the cause of Dalits and hence he favours them,” said political analyst Hemant Desai. On September 14, the 19-year-old from Hathras district was allegedly attacked and raped in a field near her home by four men. Details of the barbaric assault emerged last week. The woman was shifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she passed away on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-facing-flak-for-supporting-only-actors-union-minister-ramdas-athawale-to-meet-hathras-victim-s-family/story-lBSzyDzfoBaUZ7oOkrK9DN.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to adopt Centre’s Model Tenancy Act||Speedy resolution of the tenant-landlord conflicts will soon be possible in the city with the UT administration deciding to go with the centre’s Model Tenancy Act 2020. The administration has sought suggestions from the public on the model Act.The Model Tenancy Act proposes to establish a framework for the regulation of tenancy matters (residential and commercial) and to balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, including fast adjudication process for resolution of disputes.Once implemented, all tenant-landlord conflicts will be taken up by a rent court and not by a civil court. The draft states, “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in the areas to which this Act extends, only the rent court and no civil court shall have jurisdiction, to hear and decide the applications relating to disputes between landowner and tenant.”Confirming the development, additional secretary (estates) Uma Shankar Gupta said, “The administration has already given concurrence to the model Act. After taking suggestions, it will be sent to the central government for final approval, and then implemented in the city.”More than 50% of population in the city lives in rented accommodation, as per the Economic Survey 2018.Stating that the new Tenancy Act will overhaul this relationship, Gupta said, “All disputes between tenants and landlords will be decided in a time-bound manner — within three months — by the Rent Authority. Here, simplified procedure will also ensure speedy relief to people.”The existing tenancy provisions of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act 1949 are outdated, said Ajay Jagga, a city-based advocate. “It urgently requires changes which are in tune with the changed times. It will facilitate greater supply of rented accommodation and lowering of rents. ”Procedural changes on the cardsA rent authority will have to be set up, which will exclusive jurisdiction over tenancy issues.All the rent agreements will have to be submitted to the rent authority constituted under the Act. The landowner and the tenant will have to separately file the particulars about the tenancy agreement within a month of the agreement. Currently, these can be registered at the sub-registrar’s office.After reviewing the agreements, the authority will give registration numbers. It will publish online information and registration numbers of all tenancies.The authority will adjudicate the disputes between a landlord and tenant. Currently, rent-related disputes are resolved by civil courts, where the pendency rate is high.Appeals against authority’s orders will be made in the rent court, headed by a senior judicial officer, and the case will have to be dispose of within 60 days. Against a rent court order, an appeal can be filed with the rent tribunal.Landlord vs Tenant A landlord will be entitled to compensation of double the monthly rent for use and occupation of a premise by a tenant who does not vacate the unit after his tenancy has been terminated by order, notice or agreement.No tenant will be allowed to sublet the rented building without prior permission from the landlord.The landlord cannot increase the rent amount within the time period stated in the agreement. The landlord will have to give a written three-month notice before revising the rent.Under the model Act, the landlord or the property manager appointed by him must give the tenant a notice of 24 hours in advance to enter the premises.Both tenant and landlord are responsible for maintenance under the model Act. The rent agreement will define responsibility of both. Both can charge or deduct the amount from rent or security deposit, as the case be, for repairs done on behalf of the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-to-adopt-centre-s-model-tenancy-act/story-kzLgzfGryOKHnrcb4Vs4wJ.html

Panjab University has already decided to scrap its undergraduate and postgraduate entrance tests this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Diksha Bhanot, state president of the student body, who is a research scholar at the university, said, “The work of the research scholars is suffering for the last six months. Since many other institutions are opening up for research scholars, PU authorities should also allow its scholars to use the labs and libraries.”Over the recent advisory of the Panjab University asking the final-semester students to vacate the hostels within three days after their last paper, the ABVP demanded that students should not be forced to vacate their accommodation.Meanwhile, the Students For Society (SFS) also wrote to the PU administration, demanding that research scholars be allowed to avail HRA of lockdown period and no rent should be collected from them.PU dean students welfare (DSW) SK Tomar said, “The issue of research scholars is being looked into by the university and decisions will be taken for the benefit of the students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-body-holds-protest-wants-reopening-of-pu-labs-hostels-for-scholars/story-J5gLFRnYickCBl6q0I3ZbN.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Stubble burns, farmers from Haryana say they have no option||Sukhi Ram, 36, a farmer in Chanarthal Village in Haryana’s Kurukshetra district, hired three workers to harvest his paddy crop and separate the chaff. It took him two days to finish harvesting, and another five days for the crop residue to dry up completely so that it could be set ablaze. Ram, who tills 500 square metres of land (0.124 acres), is aware of the controversy over the burning of crop residue, and its environmental impacts. But for someone with such a small land holding, using stubble removing machines is not a financially viable option, he says. “I have a transport business on the side, which took a major hit during the Covid-19 lockdown. Even if that was not the case, for farmers like me, who do not own a lot of land, hiring machines for removing stubble is not a very favourable option. We might shift if the government comes up with a better alternative,” Ram said. HT travelled in villages across Kurukshetra, Karnal and Kaithal districts -- areas from where the maximum number of stubble burning cases are reported every year in Haryana. Several farmers with small land holdings (less than one acre) said the government reached out to them to create awareness about the ill-effects of stubble burning, but added that no real alternatives were offered to them.Haryana government officials said though they expect the instances of farm fires to be fewer this year compared to the previous year due to the easy availability of stubble removal machines such as Happy Seeder and Super Seeder, they agreed that several small farmers are already burning the residue in their fields.“We have reached out to the farmers to make buying and hiring machines easy and affordable for them, but for farmers with small land holdings, the machines are basically useless. For them, burning is a cheaper option than availing of the government subsidy ,” said a Kurukshetra administration official. Delhi government data shows that last year stubble burning accounted for 44% of the city’s air pollution -- an annual problem that plunges the city into a health emergency in the winter months, making it one of the most polluted cities in the world. Experts say besides causing air pollution, burning stubble also affects the fertility of the soil as it causes loss of nitrogen, sulphur, potassium and bacteriological content of the soil. Latest data by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) shows that between September 25 and September 29, 120 incidents of crop stubble burning were recorded in the state. Most of these fires were reported from Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Ambala districts. “We are keeping a close watch on these fires, but over the last few years we have seen that the numbers have consistently gone down and we are expecting that this year too, the number of farm fires will be less compared to last year,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB. Last year, 6,364 stubble burning cases were reported from the state as compared to 10, 288 in 2018. With 12.50 lakh hectares under paddy, Haryana is the second biggest producer of paddy waste in the country, after neighbouring Punjab. To reduce the incidents of stubble burning, the state last year set up 2,879 custom hiring centres, which provided as many as 15,928 stubble removal machines to farmers. This year, its target is to provide 2,741 machines, including 791 straw balers. Karamvir Singh, the village head from Chochra in Karnal district, said while the village panchayats are working towards providing easy access to machines at a subsidised rate to farmers, unless moving away from burning is incentivised, the practice cannot be stopped completely. “Currently, all that a farmer needs to get rid of stubble is a match box. Therefore, unless there is monetary incentive to encourage him to shift, no amount of awareness will be able to stop this practice,” said Singh. The Supreme Court last year directed the Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh governments to give ₹100 per quintal for non-basmati produce as incentives to farmers who are not burning their stubble. The apex court also ordered the three states to bear the operational cost of hiring of machines for handling the agricultural residue on behalf of marginal and small farmers. Most farmers in the districts of Karnal, Kaithal and Kurukshetra, however, said the incentive was yet to be distributed. An official in Haryana chief secretary’s office said, “All district officials have been directed to make sure that machines are made available to farmers, especially the small and marginalised farmers, at very nominal rates. We are also working towards providing monetary incentives to them,” an official from the CS office said.Satellite imagery by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shows that the number of fires seen over Haryana has increased over the last one week. “More fires have started appearing in Haryana over the past few days, whereas the numbers are lower in Punjab compared to the last week,” said Pawan Gupta, research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stubble-burns-farmers-from-haryana-say-they-have-no-option/story-ax2p4e1pjnBkXkv3aOYa0K.html

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh philatelist to depict Gandhi’s journey through stamps on his birth anniversary today||In post-Independence India, Mahatma Gandhi is the individual personality/theme on which the country’s postal department has issued maximum number of stamps. Such stamps depict the important events associated with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi — from his days in South Africa to his return to India and from his ‘Dandi March’ to India’s freedom. Taking a route of philately, the collection and study of stamps, Chandigarh-based stamp collectors are trying to educate people, especially the younger generation, about the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi in the country’s freedom struggle. “Philately has a great potential to reach out to the people on any subject. Stamps and post cards are not only facilitators of communication, but they also carry a message and there always are stories and history associated with them. I am using Gandhi’s stamps to reach out to the students to make them aware of his contribution during the pre-independence era,” says one such philatelist Rakesh Wallia, 64, who has been exhibiting Gandhi’s theme since 1986. He has, over years, touched all government schools of Chandigarh several times while promoting philately through Gandhi. Another stamp collector, Vipan Kumar Thakur, 56, who is an inspector in the income tax department, Chandigarh, is showcasing his collection on Gandhi during a function to mark Gandhi’s birth anniversary at Gandhi Smarak Bhawan in Sector 16 on Friday.“I have been into stamp collection since my childhood, but my interest in Gandhi grew a decade ago only. I am exhibiting Gandhi’s collection for the last five years,” says Thakur. “In philately, one frame on a topic requires an exhibit of a minimum 16 A4 size sheet. Through stamps, postcards and first-day covers, I have tried to touch all important aspects of Gandhi’s involvement in the country’s freedom movement. People, especially students, get attracted as they find it a different way of storytelling. Supported mainly by visuals and a little text, it has more recall value,” adds Thakur, who also runs a blog on philately — simplephilatelicclub.blogspot.com“Our focus is to touch Gandhi’s life through as many mediums as possible. On October 2, we are having a number of events, including a lecture, an artist’s work on Gandhi through salt and Gandhi’s life journey through philately exhibition,” says Devraj Tyagi, director, Gandhi Smarak Bhawan. Since November 1948, when the Indian postal department issued a set of four stamps on Gandhi for the first time, till last year when the world celebrated Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, India has issued 94 stamps on the great leader. Out of those 94 stamps, Thakur has around 70 stamps in his collection. “I have got the first set of four stamps issued on Gandhi in 1948 and also have a stamp made of khadi. Apart from that, I have a collection on Rabindranath Tagore,” says Thakur. Walia has a complete set on Gandhi’s India theme, except for a ₹10 service stamp, which is a rare on Gandhi theme and has approximately 20 stamps in circulation. In 2017, four sets of Gandhi’s service stamps were auctioned for ₹4.7 crore in England. They were bought by an Australian.“In my Gandhi’s exhibit, I use 67 stamps and other philately material. It is arranged in sequence as his life’s journey moves on,” says Walia. Chandigarh’s general post office in Sector 17 is, meanwhile, opening its philately bureau on Friday (October 2) to felicitate the stamp lovers. “The importance of Gandhi and his work can be gauged from the fact that over 87 countries across the world and United Nations Postal Administration have issued stamps on one of the greatest leader. To encourage stamp collection, we are opening our philately bureau tomorrow, so that the interested ones can buy stamps on Gandhi theme,” says Manoj Kumar, senior superintendent of post offices, Chandigarh division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-philatelist-to-depict-gandhi-s-journey-through-stamps-on-his-birth-anniversary-today/story-BfbW78YlHYhGmyTjsKlWTN.html

Police were alerted by the house owner and the two were taken to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, where they were declared dead.Officials privy to the investigation said it was unclear how exactly the two got electrocuted. “It’s not clear whether the power was switched on by mistake by the two or by the owner when they were inside the tank. However, foul play has been ruled out,” they said.A case under section 304-A (death by negligence) was registered against Ram Avtar at the Sector 26 police station and he was arrested and later released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-plumbers-die-of-electrocution-in-sector-27-house-owner-booked/story-WALDDbQYJxQ918c5J7ESNI.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 infections go past 1,400,000 in Maharashtra; toll 37,056||Maharashtra on Thursday went past 1,400,000 Covid-19 cases, with 16,476 fresh infections taking the tally to 1,400,922. The latest 100,000 cases came in six days, indicating a drop in new infections, after the state had moved from 1,100,000 to 1,200,000 in four days and then to 1,300,000 in five days. Mumbai reported 2,352 new cases and 43 fatalities, taking the tally to 207,620 and toll to 8,972. The state reported 394 deaths on Thursday, taking its toll to 37,056. Of them, 229 were from the past 48 hours, 103 were from last week and remaining 62 were from the period before it, according to the state health department.Pune and Nagpur districts witnessed a drop in cases over the past few days, while cases in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) slightly increased to 28.28% of the state figures, after hovering between 23% and 25% last week. Pune reported 2,625 cases (1,069 in city, 953 in rural parts and 603 in Pimpri-Chinchwad) and added 45 new deaths, including 10 each in rural parts and Pimpri-Chinchwad, and 25 in city. After Mumbai and Pune, Nashik in north Maharashtra saw the highest caseload at 1,290 cases, while Nagpur in Vidarbha clocked 999 cases and 60 deaths. Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar and Sangli in western Maharashtra remained one of the top contributors to the state tally with 460, 417, 835 and 515 cases respectively.While the weekly case fatality rate (CFR) kept rising over the past two weeks, the positivity rate rose significantly in September to 22.37% (591,905 infections from 2,646,276 tests) from 17.91% (370,423 infections from 2,068,801 tests) in August. The positivity rate was 22.41% in July and 21.23% in June. September saw addition of 591,905 cases (42.75% of the total state cases) and 12,079 deaths (32.95% of the total deaths), highest in terms of cases and death in any months since outbreak. State authorities have not been able to achieve the target, set in the first week of July, of bring the CFR to less than 1% and the positivity rate below 10%. The weekly CFR, which had dropped to 1.71% in the first week of September, has again risen to more than 2.3% over the last week (September 25-October 1). The overall CFR stands at 2.65%, second-highest in the country after Punjab. “It is because of low testing and the fatigue. The tracking of susceptible people is not up to the mark, leading to the late admission of infected patients. They are referred to hospitals on the third or fourth days, against the expected admission in first 48 hours. This leads to high death rate. Secondly, the number of cases was high in the second and third weeks of September and the fatalities out of those infections are being reported now,” an official from health department said.Leader of opposition in legislative Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has slammed the state government for the rise in the positivity rate. “The rise in the positivity rate is the result of failure of increasing the expected number of tests. In August, the tests were increased by 42% over the earlier month and it resulted in the positivity rate dropping to 18%. In September, the rise in number of tests over earlier month was just 24% and it led to the rise in the positivity rate to 22.37%. CM Uddhav Thackeray during his video conference with the Prime Minister said that they were planning to increase the daily tests to 1.5 lakh, but the daily tests average in September was 88,209. The situation in Mumbai is worse, as city’s positivity rate in September rose to 17.5% from 13.63%, as the number of daily tests have restricted to the daily average of 11,715 tests in September,” he said.Dr Sadhana Tayade, director, directorate, health services, said that they expect the positivity rate to fall in next few weeks once the tests are increased. “Our aim is to reduce the mortality rate below 1% and the positivity below 10%. It is true that we have brought the CFR below 2%, but the positivity rate is still high. Until we are tracing the people and keeping the mortality in check, positivity rate should not be a matter of worry. We are aiming to increase the number of tests by double in coming weeks and expect the positivity rate to come under control very soon. Though the effect of My Family, My Responsibility drive has not been assessed yet, we expect it to help up detecting the infection early and treating them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-infections-go-past-1-400-000-in-maharashtra-toll-37-056/story-Ko08tgCy5jxDvihFCQDWWN.html

I was trying to dodge the scooty, however my bike hit a pothole and I lost my balance and my leg got caught in the footrest. A few passers-by shifted me to a private hospital,” added Pomendkar who was heading to attend the protest.The MNS party members then asked Pomendkar himself to cut the cake against the potholes on city roads. Sapna Koli, City Engineer, KDMC said, “We have carried out repair work on temporary basis, but it didn’t last due to heavy rain. Carrying out road repairs work during monsoon is a waste of time and money as it doesn’t work out. We have budget of ₹14 crore for road repair work and as soon as the monsoon ends, the work will start.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mns-leader-from-dombivli-on-his-way-to-stir-falls-off-bike-gets-10-stitches/story-JTBxJIz1aKLQMQoLrpg0sI.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||Sero survey in Mumbai: 45% in slums of 3 wards had Covid-19 antibodies||Forty-five percent of slum residents and 18% of individuals from other areas surveyed across three city wards were exposed to Sars-Cov2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), till August’s second half, according to the second phase of the sero survey conducted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), as part of the national study. The civic body said the results indicate that there could be a reduction in the infection’s spread in slum areas. The sero survey is a study of how many people have antibodies (Immunoglobulin-G) against Sars-Cov-2 in their blood, indicating these people may have been silently infected and recovered, thus helping to map the trend and spread of infection. The latest survey showed that the virus prevalence in slums went down by 12 percentage points and rose marginally in non-slums, in comparison to the first study in the first half of July. In the first survey, 6,936 samples were collected from R-North (Dahisar, Borivli), M-West (Chembur), F-North (Dadar, Matunga, Wadala), of which 57% samples from slums showed antibodies, followed by 16% from non-slum areas. The BMC’s second survey, covering the same areas, tested 5,384 people and found 45% samples from slums and 18% from non-slum areas showed antibodies.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the public health department of BMC, said, “It is encouraging that in slums, the rate of infection is going down. The number of infected health workers is also less, because of the care they have been taking.”Even though recent trends show that high-rises across Mumbai are reporting more Covid-19 cases, Kakani said, “In high-rises, there were only 18% people with antibodies, because this survey was done before the Ganesh festival. It was after the festival that our number of cases increased, and people got a chance to mingle with each other.”The BMC in a statement on Thursday said, “Sero-positivity from the second round indicates there could be a reduction in the spread of infection in slum areas. Marginal increase in sero-positivity of non-slum areas correlates with increase in reported cases in August from non-slum areas.”According to BMC officials, in the second phase, the sero-prevalence observed among health workers working in slum areas was lower than sero-prevalence in the slum populations (citizens), and this could be due to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, which includes use of masks and hand hygiene.The BMC, further in the statement, added, “Emerging scientific evidence hints at fall of antibody levels in recovered or asymptomatic patients over a period of time and might have contributed to the trend between two rounds of sero-survey. The impact of this on immunity, if any, is still unknown.”Further, the second phase stated that sero-prevalence in women was marginally higher than men in both the rounds, followed by age-wise prevalence, which was comparable to the first round in all ages. In the second round, sero-prevalence in the age group of people above 40 was slightly higher. Sero-prevalence among health workers in both rounds was approximately 27% (as an average).According to BMC, the second phase of the sero survey was conducted in the second half of August, in which out of a total 5,840 samples, 5,384 participants [92%] were recruited from the general population, while the remaining were frontline workers. In the whole exercise (combining both phases of the surve), a total of 728 health workers were recruited for the study. Meanwhile, in the second phase, the sampling included people who may have been symptomatic and recovered or asymptomatic. Further, no sampling was done in active containment zones (i.e. during the study period) followed by around 1-2% of the samples belonged to people who had participated in both the rounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sero-survey-in-mumbai-45-in-slums-of-3-wards-had-covid-19-antibodies/story-aIOL5Cr2gvnOjWHY3NqUBP.html
02-10-2020||City||Navi Mumbai toll hike: MNS workers protest, traffic moves at snail pace||Serpentine queues and a protest by Maharashtra Navnirman Sena party workers at the toll nakas of Navi Mumbai marked the first day of hike in toll charges announced by the state government.Traffic moved slowly, resulting in congestion at the Vashi toll naka as motorists argued with the toll operators over the increased charges. Many claimed they had no idea about the hike. Motorists were also upset at the increase during the pandemic and also additional burden on Navi Mumbai residents.Brian D’Souza, 42, a motorist residing in Sanpada, said, “This is ridiculous. Local residents should be exempted from toll charges as is done in other regions. Mumbai residents do not pay toll tax and yet use all the flyovers in Mumbai. However, we in Navi Mumbai have been paying toll charges every day and now we have to pay more.”He added, “For long we have been demanding waiver and the political leaders have been promising action on it. Basically, we are being penalised for shifting to the city.”Shailesh Patil, 51, another commuter added, “People are just starting to work after suffering financially for months in the Covid pandemic. How can there be an increase in the toll charges. The government should have, in fact, waived it for a few months. Aren’t we already burdened?”A toll official at Vashi toll naka said on condition of anonymity, “We had a tough time with several motorists arguing with our staff when they did not get the expected change in return. We had to explain to them that the charges have been hiked. Several motorists refused to accept and claimed that we were trying to fleece them.”Meanwhile, the local unit of MNS staged a protest at Airoli toll naka, the other exit point of Navi Mumbai. The party workers raised slogans against the hike and demanded that it be rolled back immediately. The police later dispersed the protestors.Navi Mumbai MNS chief, Gajanan Kale, said, “We will not sit quiet. We will continue to agitate against this unjustified hike. The people are already suffering and this will add to their misery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-toll-hike-mns-workers-protest-traffic-moves-at-snail-pace/story-9ZNiKXpJtzz2BeMMeC5C4N.html

The father of the woman, whose death has triggered a massive outrage in the country and sharp criticism for the UP government, said he was being pressured by government officials and demanded a CBI probe into the matter. The father, around 50, claimed that he was “pressured” into going to a police station where the district magistrate and police officials made three members of his family sign some document. “But we are not satisfied with this. My daughter’s case should be probed by the CBI and monitored by a Supreme Court judge. We are under pressure from officials and confined to our home while the media has also been disallowed from meeting us,” he said in a purported video shared by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Twitter. The development came as a video surfaced purportedly showing Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar meeting the family at their home, where he allegedly asked the woman’s father to “reconsider” if he wants to stick with the statement or change it. “Aap apni vishwasniyata khatam mat kariye. Media wale main aapko bata doon… aaj abhi aadhe chale gaye, kal subah tak aadhe aur nikal jaenge aur 2-4 din bachenge ... Hum hi bas khade hain aapke saath mein, thik hai. Ab aapki ichha hai, aapko baar-baar bayaan badalna hai, nahi badalna hai... (You should not destroy your credibility. About the media, I must tell you, half of them have left today… the other half would leave by tomorrow morning... two or four more days maybe. Only we are standing by your side, alright. Now, it is up to you whether you want to change your statement repeatedly or not...),” DM Laxkar tells the victim’s father according to the video on social media. A woman member of the family claimed they were being pressured by the district magistrate and feared “these people now won’t let us live here”, according to another purported video shared by Rahul Gandhi. “Un logon ne mummy ke ulte seedhe video bana rakhe hain, us time haalat aise the ke jiske jo mu mein aa raha tha wo hum log bole ja rahe the... ab ye log humein yahan rehne nahi denge. Ye DM zyada hi chaalbaazi kar rahe hain, pressure daal rahe zabardasti... keh rah eke tum logon ki baton ka bharosa nahi hai, zabardasti bayaan badal rahe. (They have made random videos of mother’s statements. Soon after the incident, the situation was such that we were speaking anything that came to our mind... But now they (administration) won’t let us live here anymore. This DM is indulging in trickery, he is pressuring us. Says we are not reliable, we are changing our statement,” the sobbing woman alleged. Reacting to the video, Rahul Gandhi in a Hindi tweet said, “How long will you suppress the voice of the poor-Dalit-adivasis? How long will you hide the truth? How many more daughters will be secretly burnt? You will not be able to stop the country’s voice now.” He also used the hashtags “JusticeForIndiasDaughters” and “HathrasHorror” with his tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hathras-case-victim-s-family-alleges-admin-police-pressure-demands-cbi-probe/story-G83srawrjRZgLoecxA5mML.html
02-10-2020||City||Thane plaza sees chaos on first day of toll hike||Chaos greeted Thane commuters travelling to and from Mumbai on Thursday, the first day of implementation of increase in toll charges. The traffic was slow-moving at Anandnagar and LBS Road toll plazas during peak hours. Commuters had to wait almost an hour at the toll plaza as a long queue of vehicles was seen waiting at both the entry points to Mumbai.The state government has issued a notification revising rates for toll recovery at the entry points to Mumbai last week. The one-way toll for a passenger car, which was ₹35, has been increased to ₹40.A traffic police near the toll naka said, “Most motorists were not aware of the hike in toll prices leading to confusion early on Thursday morning. It was the first day of hike in rate, so the traffic was slow moving, but the situation was under control. As it was peak hour, the backlog and queue seemed to be quite long. The situation will be normal from next week when most people will know about the hike.”Satish Raje, 39, resident of Ghodbunder Road, who was travelling to Chembur through the Eastern Express Highway, added, “What usually takes me hardly 10 minutes, the same stretch of road took around an hour to reach. Not many were aware of the hike in toll prices that led to confusion and traffic in the morning hours.”Another commuter, Shirin Mathew, 44, also was stranded in traffic and took over half-an-hour to merely cross the toll plaza. Mathew, a resident of Vartak Nagar, Thane, who travels to Vikroli said, “Usually Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays are the days when the roads have traffic as many offices follow the alternate working day pattern nowadays. However, Friday being a national holiday, there were many who opted to go to work today. Moreover, the hike in toll prices also led to some confusion and traffic at the toll naka in the morning.”The announcement of the hike in toll charges did not go well with the commuters and activists in Thane. “There is no daily or return pass system at the toll naka. This is a deterrent. We have to shell out more money both ways and during this pandemic, with no option of public transport, they have hiked the price further,” said Ashish Mule, 29, who car pools with his colleagues daily to Parel.Jayant Mhaiskar, chairman and managing director of MEP Infra, which manages the toll, said, “We have deployed additional staff at the toll naka for collection until people get used to the new rates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-plaza-sees-chaos-on-first-day-of-toll-hike/story-9lDYVxLVAGiB9RN0ZGaJVL.html

Around 5.32 lakh aspirants from across the state have registered for the exam, which will be conducted in two shifts everyday till October 6. “All the PCB (Physics-Chemistry-Biology) questions were very easy and almost all of them were from within the prescribed syllabus. As the exam was held online, some students were feeling anxious but the test was conducted smoothly,” said Om Trivedi, one of the aspirants who appeared for the exam on Thursday. This is the first time that the exam authority will conduct only two papers—Physics-Chemistry-Maths (PCM) and Physics-Chemistry-Biology (PCB) — in multiple sessions, as the combined third paper of PCMB has been dropped from the entrance exam altogether. “The exam was conducted keeping in mind the current [Covid-19] scenario and considering the mental status of the students who have been studying for the past few years for these entrance exams. This year has been very stressful and having an easy paper for CET was confidence boosting for us,” said Anvir Sahay, another aspirant. HT had previously reported how this year the registrations to the state CET exam sore by more than 1 lakh aspirants as compared to last year. Official records shared by the state CET cell reveal that 5.32 lakh aspirants registered for the exam this year, as compared to 4.13 lakh aspirants in 2019 and 4.35 lakh registrations in 2018. Experts attributed the rise in registrations to the delay in conducting national-level entrance exams for engineering courses as well as to the introduction of new-age courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Analytics, Blockchain, among others, by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/students-in-maharashtra-find-first-session-of-state-cet-exam-easy/story-Fd2wBD4aL06ohDjFjGIH1I.html

The teenager who stayed with the caterer ran away with a bag of gold worth ₹2.49 lakh on Sunday. The boy stayed at the caterer’s house in Vashi and even worked for him.A Navi Mumbai-based auto driver discovered the minor boy at a railway station on March 10. The juvenile told him that he’s an orphan and ran away from his uncle’s house in Uttar Pradesh, fed up by the torture. With no place to live for the minor in a new city, the auto driver called up Prakash Bhagwat, 39, and told him if he would be willing to shelter the boy for a few days.Bhagwat who runs a catering service, agreed to provide shelter at his Vashi home, where he stays with wife and a brother.“Out of sympathy, the complainant continued sheltering the minor. Taking advantage of their trust, the minor stole valuables from the house,” said Vinayak Vast, ACP, Vashi divn.During investigations, the minor was traced at a chawl in Jogeshwari (E). He has been sent to a children’s remand home in Bhiwandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-year-old-robs-gold-worth-2-49-lakh-in-navi-mumbai-detained/story-tlxPSxSCVKGg58pOsVtLjJ.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||Freedom of expression should be exercised within four walls of Constitution: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) while observing that criticism of persons holding public posts has become rampant on social media, said while such persons should face and bear it, the citizens were required to exercise restraint to an extent so that the dignity of the post was not abused and to ensure there is no ‘unfair’ criticism beyond the rights provided under the Constitution. The HC made the observations while hearing the plea of a Nagpur resident seeking to quash a first information report (FIR) against him for posting abusive tweets against Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son Aaditya Thackeray on Twitter on June 1 and 30. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the petition by Sameet Thakkar, 32, was informed by advocate Abhinav Chandrachud that the petition sought that the FIR against Thakkar be quashed and set aside as well. Thakkar also sought interim protection from arrest. A complaint was registered against Thakkar at VP Marg Police station on July 2 by advocate Dharmendra Mishra, a legal consultant for the Shiv Sena, for posting abusive and offensive tweets on June 1 and 30 against the Thackeray duo. Thakkar was booked under sections 292 (obscene acts or words in public), 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Information Technology Act. While making light of the complaint, Chandrachud submitted that persons holding public posts should let go of such comments at times and referred to former Supreme Court judge justice VR Krishna Iyer’s observation: “The dogs may bark but the caravan will pass.” He added that the SC had also observed that those who occupy positions of power should have ‘thick skin’ while reacting to criticism. In light of this, he said the ‘obscenity’ charge against his client was excessive. Advocate JP Yagnik, for the state, assured the court that Thakkar would not be arrested if he cooperated with the investigation and attended the police station as and when called for questioning. After hearing the submissions, the court while addressing Chandrachud said, “Sometimes the tweets are abusive. The rights of your client cannot violate someone else’s constitutional rights. Responsible citizens should know they have rights, but to what extent.” Justice Shinde said, “Now it has become easy to criticise through social media posts. People think they can get publicity if they post something against the PM or CM. Perhaps, they think that is the easiest way to get publicity. You know now even the judiciary is not an exception.” He further added that as it was a known fact that the rights to freedom of speech and expression were not absolute, citizens should refrain and ensure that someone else’s rights are not violated because of their abusive language. The bench said that democracy allows citizens to be free, and hence there will be comments, but the comments have to be within the four walls of rights under the Constitution. After Chandrachud assured the court that his client would abide by the court’s observations, Thakkar was directed to appear before the investigating officer on Monday (October 5) and posted the matter for hearing on October 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/freedom-of-expression-should-be-exercised-within-four-walls-of-constitution-bombay-hc/story-M3XGnSHPJpRJcw1GnufVIO.html

Most city colleges, however, have decided to start their exams from October 5.While exams at five state universities has been indefinitely deferred due to an ongoing pen-down strike of non-teaching staff members, MU said their decision to decentralise online exams helped ensure the schedule stays as is.“Since all colleges have been divided under different clusters, these clusters have been given the choice of conducting exams as per their schedule as long as the same is conducted between October 1 and 31 and that it is conducted online in multiple choice question (MCQ) format,” said a statement released by MU on Thursday evening.

Andheri government railway police (GRP), too, arrested a woman for using fake identity. There has been a rise in instances of people creating fake identity cards of essential services workers to be able to board local trains for their regular commute. In the first instance, Mira Road resident Ramesh Takke, 36, was arrested when trying to board a local train using a fake identity card. Takke was reportedly in touch with people who make fake identity cards for travelling by local trains.“We have started intensive drives to check unauthorised travel. There have been five incidents of people travelling with fake identity cards that were caught during inspections till now. We request passengers who are not authorised not to travel by locals,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relation officer, WR. WR then handed Takke over to GRP.Inspector Bharat Chaudhary from Andheri GRP said they have arrested Takke on the charges of forgery and cheating. According to Chaudhary, Takke, who works at a printing press, asked one of his contact to make a fake identity card. “We have arrested Takke based on the forged identity card that he had received from his contact. We have also detained the person who had sent him the forged identity and are investigating his role,” said Chaudhary.In another incident, Andheri GRP arrested a woman for stealing the identity card of a neighbour, who is a nurse, and sticking her own photo on a photocopy of the identity card. “The woman’s mother-in-law had informed us of the incident, based on which we arrested the woman for forgery and cheating,” added Chaudhary.Earlier, WR had detained two people travelling with fake identity cards at Borivli station.The Central Railway, too, has detained 30 people till now for unauthorised travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-commuters-use-fake-identity-cards-to-travel-by-local-trains-in-mumbai-arrested/story-OaWzS8RI2TbdJ274eFxBSL.html
02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Conducting entrance test not possible: PU panel||A special panel of Panjab University on Thursday said that it is not possible for the varsity to conduct entrance exams for five-year integrated law course in the present circumstances.This comes two days after the varsity told the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) that it will reconsider its decision of scrapping the entrance test for the course run, following an aspirant’s plea. The panel, headed by syndicate member Anu Chatrath, in its meeting on Thursday reiterated that the conduct of the entrance test is not possible, especially since the university has to complete the admission process by the end of October as per the guidelines of the University Grants Commission.DPS Randhawa, who is a member of the panel, said, “According to the UGC guidelines, the admission should be completed by October 31 and the academic session will get late if we will not carry out admissions during this time.” The proceedings of the committee will be finalised on Friday and sent to vice- chancellor Raj Kumar. Besides scrapping UG entrance tests this year, PU has also scrapped entrance tests for PU-CET (PG), MPhil/ PhD, PULEET, PUMEET and MBA (executive) due to the pandemic.The decision to scrap the exam was taken on August 11 in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, and was initially challenged by two law course aspirants, who argued that the premise to not hold the entrance was invalid when PU was conducting such exams for other courses. Class-12 marks as a sole criterion for determining the suitability of a candidate for admission to the course would neither be reasonable nor reliable, they had argued. Following the plea, the high court had asked PU to reconsider its decision by September 15. However, PU again decided against holding the exam, which resulted in the second round of litigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/conducting-entrance-test-not-possible-pu-panel/story-vQv1lBNxMS74IXeSw5QEiN.html
02-10-2020||City||Civic officials, police clash in Kalyan, video goes viral||In a perfect example of lack of co-ordination between two authorities, several residents caught without wearing mask were made to wait for more than an hour to pay fine in Kalyan on Thursday morning.The police officials who caught them did not have the receipt book and claimed that the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) officials who were supposed to reach the spot at 10 am reached only at 11.45 am.This led to an argument between the police and KDMC, which was caught on video by passers-by.The police and the civic officials had carried out a joint operation against people not wearing masks in Kalyan and Dombivli.On Thursday morning, a team from Bazarpeth police reached Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Chowk in Kalyan for the joint operation at 10am. “Yashwant Chavan, senior police inspector of Bazarpeth police station, and his team members started catching the violators. But, as the KDMC officials had the receipt books and the authority to impose fine, they could not fine the people. Those caught for not wearing mask were asked to wait along with our team till 11:45 am, after which the KDMC officials reached the spot and started taking the fine,” said an official from Bazarpeth who was at the spot.A KDMC official reached the spot at 11.00 am but he didn’t have the receipt book. At 11:45 am, when Bhagaji Bhangare, ward officer, C Ward, KDMC, reached the spot, the police officers at the spot got into an argument with him as to why they took so long to get the receipt book.In the video that went viral, the police are heard saying, “This is not the way to work, if you are not interested, then do not force us to take action. Ensure the next time you are on time.”Yashwant Chavan, senior police inspector, Bazarpeth police station, did not comment on the issue and said, “Such things keep happening in the department and we should not take it seriously. Our main priority is to take action against the violators and not let small arguments come in the way.”Bhagaji Bhangare, ward officer, C ward, KDMC, denied there was any delay and informed the KDMC has collected almost ₹1 lakh fine till date.“On Thursday, we had assigned three teams to the police to fine people without mask. Two teams were stationed with Bazarpeth police, while one was with Mahatma Phule police. The Mahatma Phule police are also fining people travelling without mask on motorcycles and vehicles.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/civic-officials-police-clash-in-kalyan-video-goes-viral/story-57z6d3MtDbMotrqhBQVjUP.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||Maratha quota: After different view on SSR case, Parth Pawar goes against NCP line, to move SC||After going against the party line to demand a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, Parth, grandnephew of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, has jumped into the politically crucial matter of Maratha reservation. He has announced that he will file an intervention application before the Supreme Court (SC) in the ongoing petition over reservation to the Maratha community. Supporting quota for the community in government jobs and education, he has asked Maratha leaders to wake up to fight for the cause and has also sought intervention by the state to resolve the crisis. Interestingly, Pawars are Marathas and the NCP chief is the most powerful leader from the community. The NCP is also known as a party dominated by the Maratha leaders. Parth is the son of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, nephew of the NCP chief, who is also deputy chief minister in the MVA government. “Devastated to hear of the tragic death of Vivek who committed suicide for the cause of Maratha reservations. Before a chain reaction of such unfortunate incident starts, Maratha leaders have to wake up & fight for this cause. Requesting Maha govt to step in to solve the crisis,” he said, in a series of tweets. He was referring to a suicide committed by Vivek Rahade, 18, from Beed on Wednesday. Rahade has recently appeared for NEET exams and was worried about its results, according to news reports. On September 30, he died by suicide at his farm. The family has claimed that he has committed suicide for Maratha reservation. “The flame that Vivek has ignited in our minds can set the whole system ablaze. The future of an entire generation is at stake. I have no choice but to approach the Hon’ble Supreme Court and file an intervenor application in the Maratha reservation matter pending before it...,” Parth added further. After a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court stayed the reservation for Marathas in jobs and education for 2020-21 on September 9, the issue has become politically sensitive as the community has announced state-wide protests. The state government has filed a petition in the SC to vacate stay on implementation of the quota.Marathas were granted 12% and 13% reservation in employment and education, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. “We don’t see anything wrong in his demand. In fact, it is good that someone from the party wants to fight for the cause of the Maratha community as the NCP has been in favour providing reservation since day one. He (Parth Pawar) has all the right to make a demand from the state government, at the same time as an individual, he also has all the right to support a movement,” said party spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik.In August, Parth was publicly rebuked by the NCP chief over demanding CBI probe into Rajput’s death, going against the party stand. Pawar had called him “immature” and had also said he doesn’t give a damn about what Parth says. Later, after the Supreme Court allowed handing over the case to CBI, Parth had tweeted, “Satyamev Jayate” (truth alone triumphs). The tweet had no mention of the case, but it is assumed that he was referring to the Apex court’s judgment in the actor’s death case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-after-different-view-on-ssr-case-parth-pawar-goes-against-ncp-line-to-move-sc/story-F5Uw1DaGR4hJbRMHPAgLIN.html
02-10-2020||Mumbai||BJP’s Pravin Darekar-led Mumbai cooperative bank gets notice over losses, loans to sugar factories||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Pravin Darekar-led Mumbai District Central Cooperative Bank Limited has been served notice by the state cooperation department for alleged discrepancies on six counts, including losses in the last financial year, reduction in capital receipts, recovery of loans to sugar factories and corporate companies and loans to cooperative housing societies for their self-redevelopment.In a letter dated September 18, cooperation commissioner and registrar Anil Kawade formed a team of three officials in Mumbai to examine alleged irregularities in the bank, one of the leading cooperative district financial institutions in the state. The team led by divisional joint registrar Bajirao Shinde has been asked to check into losses of ₹47.99 crore and capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to 7.11% in the financial year 2019-20. The team has also been directed to examine loans given to sugar factories and corporate loans and their recovery, expenditure on the modernisation of bank offices, including its core banking solutions over the last five years, and loans to cooperative housing societies under its ambitious self-redevelopment scheme.Darekar, leader of opposition in the legislative Council, has, however, said that the notice is not an inquiry but an inspection of account books, and the action was politically motivated. The cooperation department team has been asked to submit its report within a month. “It is true that we sustained losses of ₹47 crore in the last financial year, but they have been made up within the second quarter which ended on September 30. Similarly, the CRAR has been increased to 10% now. They have been talking about computerisation, which was never done in the last five years. Our recovery of loans to the sugar factories and corporate companies is up to mark and the loans helped us in earning ₹125 crore. They have been saying that there was no Reserve Bank of India (RBI) permission taken for the self-redevelopment scheme. We recently met RBI officials and they praised our initiative,” he said, adding that the team deputed for the examination of the records will be handed over all documents. The bank has been steeped in controversy over irregularities in its account books over the last few years. The bank, led by Darekar as its chairman, faced various charges of irregularities, including disbursement of loans of ₹2.35 crore to relatives of the chairman using fake documents. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the regulating authority, had directed the state cooperation department in March 2018 to file a first information report (FIR) regarding the misappropriation of funds by two of the bank’s branches in Borivli. In March 2015, the economic offences wing of the Mumbai Police registered an FIR against Darekar and three other officer bearers for misappropriation of funds and embezzlement amounting ₹128 crore. They faced charges of misusing the overdraft facility, dubious transactions in the names of around 60 labour credit societies formed in a single day and irregularities of ₹5.9 crore in allotting a contract to set up a disaster recovery system – a backup for IT-related operations.According to an official from the cooperation department, political pressure prevented any solid action from being taken in the past. “The bank has faced allegations of irregularities and embezzlement in the past too, but no action has been taken as yet. No FIR was filed despite NABARD directives to the government for fraudulent transactions. The EOW has completed its investigation in ₹128 crore scam but no charge sheet has been filed owing to political pressure from the then BJP-led state government. The action in that case and even in other cases is unlikely, even after the change in power in the state. Arrests of the accused under section 88 and action of attachment of properties of the directors under section 98 of the Cooperation Act was possible, had the inquiry been taken to the logical end. The fresh inquiry ordered by the cooperation commissioner is a routine process and could prove to be grievous if it is conducted seriously,” an official from the department said.Darekar, who was a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) legislator from 2009 and 2014, joined BJP after his defeat in the 2014 Assembly elections. BJP sent him to the Legislative Council in June 2016 and he was elected leader of opposition in the upper house last year.Darekar said that the notice sent was out of political ego and claimed that the government is attempting to suppress his voice. “The bank sent a notice to the cooperation department for the recovery of ₹250 crore against the guarantee given by the government for loans to the sugar factories. We demanded to not give new guarantees to the sugar factories until the old guarantee to banks like us was settled. The notice by the cooperation department is because of our notice for the recovery of guarantee to them. The government wants to suppress my voice,” he said.The legislator added that he has been given clean chit by the Bombay high court in all other cases pending against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-s-pravin-darekar-led-mumbai-cooperative-bank-gets-notice-over-losses-loans-to-sugar-factories/story-vqDtTGGAKejr4eBJNqIfaO.html
02-10-2020||City||Covid-19 Navratri restrictions leave potters out of business||Sixty-year-old Dhanjibhai Kumbhar, who once used to be busy making garba pots (decorated earthen pots) ahead of the Navratri festival, is now sitting idle at his home. While he had no time to even relax earlier, he now has all the time in the world contemplating the future of his business. With the Maharashtra government, on Tuesday, banning dandiya, garba and processions during Navratri, the artisans who usually look forward to some business during the festival have lost all the hopes.“The ban has led to more tense atmosphere among us artisans as we have no other means to earn. Whatever we earn during the festival is saved for the rest of the year. With no garba and processions, who will buy the pots. Our business will be affected badly,” said Kumbhar.The state had issued an SOP on how Navratri would be marked in the state. The state home ministry suggested that all dandiya, garba and cultural programmes should be cancelled this year to ensure the safety of the citizens. The government stated that all the festivals must be celebrated in a simple manner. The festivals of Navratri, Dussehra and Durga Puja are about to begin with Navratri scheduled from October 17, and Dussehra slated for October 25.The garbo pots are placed overhead while performing garba dance during Navratri. People in Gujarati Kumbharwada locality have been keeping the tradition alive for the last 75 years.With poor business during this year’s Janmashtami due to Covid-19 pandemic-led lockdown, artisans at the Gujarati Kumbharwada in Kalyan claim to have no orders for the upcoming Navratri also. “Janmashtami this year saw very low sales and we fear the same during Navratri. I have not received a single order for the pots. People used to keep visiting Kumbharwada to select their favourite pots. This year, no one has come to us,” said Kumbhar, who runs this business with his wife. The couple, however, has started making the pots, looking forward to some business in the coming days. Men in the family make earthen pots and women decorate them with different colours and designs. The pots are decorated with shining glass materials, colourful threads, glitters and colour paints. They are in the price range of ₹25 to ₹400-₹500 depending on their sizes, colours and decorations. The couple is not tech-savvy and hence are unable to take up the business online. Their two sons work in private companies and are not keen on taking up the business too. “Today’s generation do not have interest in this traditional business. Taking the business online is not my cup of tea. The lockdown has completely affected my work,” said Kumbhar. The couple makes the garbo pots outside their house, dries, colours and decorates them for customers. Every year, it gets order for around a thousand pots a month before the festival. During Janmashtami, Kumbhar used to get orders for at least 500 handis, but this year only 200 were ordered. Of these, he could only sell 100 as many customers did not turn up. The remaining 100 handis are still kept at his house. “During the festive season, I manage to earn at least ₹30,000 a month. This time, I could hardly earn anything. We are completely clueless if we should continue making the pots or not,” he added. Harshada Jawre, 20, who comes to Gujarati Kumbharwada every year to make the pots and decorate them with her creativity, says she has no work this time and has earned very little. “I have been doing this work for almost nine years and this is the first time there is no work at all. Usually, I earn from ₹8 to ₹100 for each pot, depending on the size and type of the pots. When there is a lot of order, I earn enough,” said Jawre, who lives near Kala Talao, Kalyan (W) with her mother and two brothers. She added, “The Kumbharwada that used to look very attractive with beautiful pots during festive season now looks like a normal place. We used to work late nights, colouring the pots and enjoying it. This time there is no such atmosphere here.” BOX ABOUT GUJARATI KUMBHARWADA Located opposite Kalyan’s Kala Talao, the narrow lanes of Gujarati Kumbharwada have potters producing thousands of clay lamps, pots that illuminate city homes during Navratri and Diwali festivals. Men in the family arrange the mud, shape them into pots and diyas. Women and college-going girls paint hundreds of brown lamps and pots into colourful and decorative ones. In the past, 50 families used to make diyas. Today, only around 10 of them do.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-navratri-restrictions-leave-potters-out-of-business/story-x3p3AUyJd1G3tLz8kw3itI.html

02-10-2020||Delhi||Durga Puja may remain low-key this year: No pandals, cultural programmes||Despite the Centre relaxing limits on religious and cultural gatherings in its latest reopening plan on Wednesday, several Durga Puja committees in Delhi said they have decided to tone down festivities this year for fear of the spread of Covid-19. Organisers said they will do away with pandals, cultural programmes, and the worship of large idols this year.“It would be immensely risky to organise a community Durga Puja this year. First, there is the general risk of transmission. Second, visitors will not be allowed to be frisked while entering the venue, adding to a security risk. Third, if Covid-19 cases surface, the venue will have to be sealed under the current protocols,” said Debashis Saha, chief coordinator of the Durga Puja Samiti at Matri Mandir in south Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave.Saha said there will be no idols this year, no cultural programme, gatherings for reading the shlokas (popularly known as anjali), decorated pandals and bhog (food offerings to the deity distributed among devotees).Other organisers that have decided to cut down on the celebrations in a similar manner this year — and go only by the bare basics — include those in Kashmere Gate, the city’s oldest Durga Puja Samiti (committee), B-Block and Mela Ground in Chittaranjan Park, and Mayur Vihar Phase 1.These are some of the prominent Durga Puja venues in Delhi, that witness around 500-odd community pandals each year.Tamal Rakshit, executive committee member of the Durga Puja committee in Chittaranjan Park B-Block, said, “Community celebrations involve immense amount of risk for both the organisers and the devotees. No matter how much prepared the organisers are, the situation can get out of hand in multiple ways. We have to be scientific here. We have decided to keep the celebrations low-key with no idols and cultural programme.”New guidelines on gatheringThe central government’s guidelines relaxing Covid-19 restrictions, issued on Thursday, which removed the maximum limit on the size of religious and cultural gatherings in case of an open venue, could decide the future course of action.For halls and closed venues, the maximum limit has been extended from 100 to 200 individuals.The guidelines, however, are yet to be notified in the Capital by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). This essentially means any gathering beyond 50 individuals (as per the last notified guidelines) is still prohibited in Delhi.The DDMA is chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.A senior official of the DDMA said organising Durga Puja would still require separate permission – to be cleared by police and sub-divisional magistrates. The matter is likely to be discussed by DDMA later this week.“Even if the administration gives us permission in the days to come, there is hardly any time to prepare now. So, we are left with no option than to go ahead with celebrations without idols, pandals and cultural programmes. The rituals will be done on a smaller scale,” said Robin Bose, general secretary of the Durga Puja committee at north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate.Preparations for the festival take anything between two and three months, several organisers said. They involve rounds of planning, getting sponsors, hiring idol-makers, which many organisers get from West Bengal.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department, Safdarjung Hospital, said: “At this point, people should prioritise social distancing above everything and anything. They should avoid gatherings and follow rituals at homes or indoors, without any community participation. It is for their safety.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/durga-puja-may-remain-low-key-this-year-no-pandals-cultural-programmes/story-d7iSr1OEdsm3XTAR5MZLaP.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||‘Plantation drive harming ecology of Central Ridge’: Experts||The landscape of Delhi’s Central Ridge on Thursday morning had a less greener hue than it usually does during the post-Monsoon October period. Dug up patches of land – covering several hectares – could be spotted planted with hundreds of young saplings replacing the native species of shrubs and ground vegetation in these areas. The pits, barely two-three metres apart in some cases, were surrounded by dying creepers and pruned branches of existing trees, which had been pushed to the periphery of the plantation area.Delhi-based environmentalist and author Pradip Krishen walked around the area with other tree activists, ecologists and journalists on Thursday to explain the extent of “damage” caused to the native species by this “undesired plantation”. “My guess is that around 10-12 hectares have been flattened already. The Ridge has a dry, rocky, and thin soil. Most of the saplings that are being planted here won’t survive here if they are not watered regularly and perpetually,” said Krishen.Having walked for about three kilometres through the protected forest land, an abundance of jamun, cyrus, maulshri, ullu, kassod, and kadamb saplings meets the eyes, which Krishen said cannot be considered native to the ridge and should not have been planted here.He added that at least 30 native species that could grow well here — including amaltas, chudail papdi, dhau, dhak, hingot, ronjh, bistendu and khair, among others, — must be planted. These trees are well-adapted to prosper under the harsh conditions of the ridge.Some patches of ground vegetation and shrubs had been cleared away using a JCB machine to dig the pits.“The rootstocks are still here, which means they can grow back,” said Padmavati Dwivedi, a tree activist, who led the first tree census of Delhi a few years ago. Touching the tiny leaves sprouting out of a rootstock, Dwivedi said, “If they had to clear out patches for plantation, why not remove the invasive vilayti kikar through proper procedure instead of using machines, which would further damage the ecosystem.”The Central Ridge, located near Karol Bagh, spreads over 864 hectares of which 423 hectares are managed by the forest department. It is a part of the Aravallis, one of the oldest mountain ranges in the world. It is infested with vilayti kikar (prosopis juliflora), an exotic and invasive tree species, which with its deep roots sucks up much of the groundwater leaving the land dry. The vilayti kikars also do not allow sunlight to reach the forest floor, which in turn prevents other species to grow along with it. The Delhi government had in 2018 proposed a project to replace the tree species with indigenous varieties. However, the project is still awaiting the nod of the state cabinet.Following a series of separate orders by Delhi High Court last year to plant tree saplings (including mango and jackfruit) as compensation, a plantation drive was launched at the Central Ridge area by the Delhi forest department. This drive, experts however feared , could disrupt the fragile ecosystem of the ridge.On Thursday, environmentalists and tree activists walked around the Ridge area to take stock of the several green patches that had been cleared by JCBs, leaving behind empty pits, with little space between them. Even the saplings that had been planted were done so in a grid-like manner.“Forest restorations are to be done in a planned way. For instance, trees which may grow together are planted in one area. Pioneer trees, which grow alone, should be planted in a separate area. There seems to be no such planning here. The Ridge forest is an open thorn forest and yet the holes had been spaced for a dense woodland,” said Krishen, who has been working for over a decade to restore degraded parts of the desert in around Jaipur and Jodhpur.The activists also said that a plantation drive being carried out after the rainy season would not serve its purpose. “In a 25-30 hectares patch of the ridge, the forest department is carrying out plantation activity at a time when the monsoon season is over in Delhi. The only time to plant on the dry, rocky, thin-soiled ridge is early in the rainy season. Most of the pits are lying empty,” Krishen wrote in his letter to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Monday, requesting his intervention to halt the plantation drive.While L-G’s office did not respond to repeated requests for a comment on the matter, Delhi government’s environment department reacting to Krishen’s letter said that the plantation is being done on the directions of the high court of Delhi.The department said in response to HT’s query said that “from last year to now, at least 32,000 saplings have been planted under the drive, with 9,000 more waiting to be planted for which the pits have been dug up. However, the pits are empty because the saplings to be planted here have to brought by the litigants. The saplings brought by them were not suitable and hence they were asked to return them and get new ones. Besides, the 13 varieties of species that have been planted here are as per the list of species mentioned in the court order.”Explaining the use of JCB machine, the department said that the machine was used only at places where the soil was very hard and pits could not be dug manually.Highlighting the urgency of the matter, activists said that continuing with the plantation would set everything back, damage the area, and cause soil run-off. “Until we have the expertise and a dedicated team of ecologists, designers and landscape architects who can study the soil and not just species and try to emulate natural forest systems similar to that of the Ridge, we should leave the area as it is,” said Krishen.CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem in Delhi University, said that he had last year told the forest department that indiscriminate large-scale plantation will disturb the biodiversity of the ridge. “This kind of plantation activity must be stopped. No exotic trees could be planted here. The ridge is a huge recharging zone and indiscriminate plantation can disturb the aquifer system. I had given a list of species that could be planted here. Also, the department has to first restore its native ecosystem by removing vilayti kikar and growing native species,” said Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/green-experts-alarmed-at-indiscriminate-plantation-drive-at-ridge-want-l-g-to-intervene/story-9nIYgPFrqPVidYyG0dsRPI.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt will kick off campaign to curb air pollution||State environment minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said the government will launch a widespread campaign to curb air pollution, which peaks in the national capital during the winter, with an action plan he said that would include preparing bio-chemicals, and spraying them across 800 hectares of farmland in the rural belt of Delhi where farmers burn crop stubble. The Delhi government is going to set up a centralised system to produce biochemicals, aimed at preventing stubble burning, at Najafgarh’s Kharkhari Nahar village, under the supervision of scientists from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which has recently developed a low-cost solution to stop farmers from setting fire to paddy stubble. The IARI has demonstrated this technology in Delhi, Haryana and parts of Punjab. The solution will be sprayed at Delhi farmlands free of cost, the minister said during a press conference. “To stop stubble burning in Delhi we have formed an action plan, under which farmers will need to fill up a form with details of their village, area under cultivation and when they want the Delhi government to spray the chemical to tackle stubble burning, “ said Rai. Based on the form, the government will deploy officials to spray the chemical at the designated farmland. Agricultural development officers at all districts will lead the task of filling up of forms and creating awareness about the same, he added. The centralised system for preparing the chemical spray at Kharkhari Nahar village will be set up on October 5, while the chemicals will be produced from October 6 at 400 different camps here under the supervision of IARI scientists, who have developed the technology. “Within a few days of starting production, the first round of chemicals will be ready. Based on the demand, we will spray the chemical through tractors at the farm fields,” Rai said. He also said that during a joint air pollution review meeting comprising Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan and presided over by union environment minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday, the Delhi government has requested the states to adopt the decomposer technology to curb stubble burning, fumes from which travel to Delhi contributing to high pollution levels during winter. “Last year there was no stubble burning inside Delhi. But in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and western UP, massive stubble burning took place, contributing to 45% of overall pollution levels in Delhi. This is also the time when Diwali is celebrated, and the amalgamation of all these factors affect Delhi’s air quality,” Rai said. He added that though the central government offers a subsidy to farmers to purchase equipment so that they don’t need to burn paddy stubble, not many farmers have been availing it because they have to spend a considerable amount on procuring it. “In Delhi, the central government gives around ₹3 crore as subsidy to farmers so that they can buy machines and do not burn stubble. But only 80 farmers in Delhi have applied for. We will use our scheme, we will use the bio decomposer technology on 800 hectares land of Delhi for just Rs 20 lakh while the farmers will not have to pay anything,” the minister said. Besides, he said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will hold a meeting with 10 government agencies including municipal corporations on October 5 where each agency will be submitting their action plan for the winter. The minister also said that besides stubble burning and locals emissions there are various activities in the NCR towns such as Noida, Gurugram and Ghaziabad, which contribute to pollution in Delhi. While thermal power plant in Delhi has been shut down in Delhi, 11 thermal plants at the NCR contribute to pollution in Delhi and must be replaced with better technology. “The fumes from thermal plants contribute to 9% rise in PM 10 levels while 11% increase in PM 2.5 levels, he said. Besides, brick-kilns of outdated technology running in these towns also adds to pollution. There are around 1,640 brick kilns in UP, 161 in Haryana and 164 in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-will-kick-off-campaign-to-curb-air-pollution/story-t1XieiIUObEil8xjgS2Z2O.html
02-10-2020||Election:||Filing of nomination papers for Bihar Assembly Election 2020 begins||Filing of nomination papers for the Bihar Assembly elections commenced on Thursday when notification was issued for the first of the three-phase poll.Seventy-one of the total 243 constituencies go to polls in the first phase on October 28, though only three independent candidates turned up to file their nomination papers on the first day.Election Commission sources said that two candidates filed their nomination papers in Aurangabad while one did it in Wazirganj.Filing of nominations for the first phase will come to a close on October 8. The process may pick up momentum once the major players, including the ruling NDA and the opposition Grand Alliance, decide which seat is to be contested by which constituent.Many key Assembly segments go to polls in the first phase, for which the last date of withdrawal of nomination is October 12.One among the seats where contests would be closely watched is Mokama in rural Patna, where mafia don-turned- politician Anant Singh would seek to prove a point to his former mentor, Chief Minister and JD(U) president Nitish Kumar.Singh had begun his political career over a decade ago as a JD(U) MLA and retained the seat for the party twice before parting ways ahead of the 2015 Assembly polls which Kumar fought in alliance with arch-rival Lalu Prasad of the RJD.He retained the seat as an Independent in 2015, defeating the JD(U)’s Neeraj Kumar, who is currently a powerful minister in the state cabinet.Booked under the stringent UAPA last year following the recovery of hand grenades and an AK-47 rifle from his residence, Singh seeks to retain his seat with support of the RJD-Congress combine though it is not clear whether either party is willing to field him as the official candidate.His wife Veena Devi had unsuccessfully fought from Munger in the Lok Sabha polls last year. His late elder brother Dilip Singh, himself a history-sheeter, had served as a minister in the Rabri Devi government.The first phase is also likely to be in the spotlight because of former IPS officer Gupteshwar Pandey, who had served as an outspoken DGP of Bihar until taking voluntary retirement last week and following it up with a formal induction into the JD(U).He is expected to be fielded from one of the Assembly segments in his native district of Buxar, all of which go to polls in the first phase.Other prominent figures whose fates might be decided in the first phase include veteran Congress leader and former Assembly Speaker Sadanand Singh, who has been winning Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district on the trot, and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi who will be looking forward to retaining Imamganj as the NDA candidate.Notifications for the second and third phases will be issued on October 9 and 13, respectively. Elections for those two phases will be held on November 3 and 7. Votes will be counted on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/filing-of-nomination-papers-for-bihar-assembly-election-2020-begins/story-cxy73HucwCvATupXizswFM.html

The leaders were on their way to attend a public event in a village in Yamunanagar’s Radaur segment. BKU district president Sanju Gudiyana said the farmers staged a protest against both the leaders in Uncha Chandana and Bakana villages of Radaur. “The farmers and villagers showed their anger by displaying black flags and obstructing their cavalcade,” he said. Deputy superintendent of police Randhir Singh said the farmers were agitating at a corner when the MP was crossing and he halted for five to ten minutes to talk to them. MP Saini was not available for comment. However, his personal assistant Ravi said the MP had stopped to talk to the agitating farmers at his will. “We were heading for an event in Bakana village to address some farmers on the agriculture laws and met the protesters on our way. The MP asked the farmers to leave the road and join the event to clear out their misconceptions on the laws,” Ravi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bku-farmers-show-black-flags-to-kurukshetra-mp-saini-former-minister-kamboj/story-r68z2UWq1mnIWTDP6oY2nM.html

02-10-2020||Mumbai||3 new damselfly species discovered in Western Ghats in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka||Researchers and nature conservationists have discovered three new odonate species of reedtail damselflies (Protosticta species) from across three states in the southern Western Ghats.The new species include the blue-legged reedtail (Protosticta cyanofemora) from the wet, evergreen forests of Shendurney Wildlife Sanctuary in Kollam, Kerala and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. The second species – Myristica reedtail (Protosticta myristicaensis) was documented from the Myristica swamp at Kathalekan in Shivamogga, Karnataka, and the third species – Shola reedtail (Protosticta sholai) was identified from the Upper Manalar area of Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary in Theni, Tamil Nadu.Similar to dragonflies, damselflies are small soft-bodied insects with a long and slender abdomen, two pairs of wings, three pairs of long legs, and very large eyes. They eat smaller insects or smaller damselflies. In this case, the distinguishing factors among these new species were bright blue legs and eyes for the blue-legged reedtail; very small size with distinct turquoise eye colour for the Myristica reedtail, and light yellow legs and yellow abdominal markings for the Shola reedtail. Among them, characteristic features such as their claspers and prothorax (part of their thorax) differed significantly.The findings by Shantanu Joshi and Krusnamegh Kunte from the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, KA Subramanian and R Babu from Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Chennai, and Dattarprasad Sawant from KEM Hospital, Mumbai, were published in the international taxonomic journal Zootaxa on Wednesday.“The idea for this research started when I was conducting some surveys in northern Karnataka. At Myristicta swamp – a unique habitat endemic to the Western Ghats – I came across a distinctly unique damselfly. It was small in size and flying near tree roots,” said Joshi, adding that he confirmed that this was an undescribed species. “With my collaborators from ZSI, we found two more species of the same genus across different forest regions within the Western Ghats’s biodiversity hotspots.”Prior to these discoveries, there were nine known reedtail damselfly species endemic to the Western Ghats. “Our findings have increased this number to 12. Five of these 12 species [42%] have been described within last five years, indicating high potential for odonate species discovery from this region, and also emphasises the need for protecting the overall Western Ghats biodiversity,” said Joshi.“More research and molecular analysis are needed to study relationships of these species in the Western Ghats, with those from the Himalayan and Southeast Asian regions,” said Subramanian.Western Ghats is a globally recognised biodiversity hot spot with over 193 species of dragonflies and damselflies of which 40% are endemic to the region.The findings come at a time when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the Union environment ministry to finally notify the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around 1.4 lakh-sqkm Western Ghats spanning across six states, which has been pending for six years, by December. Of the proposed 56,825 sqkm, all six states have proposed that over 6,000 sqkm should be further reduced from the final notification, an affidavit by the Union environment ministry submitted before NGT read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-new-damselfly-species-discovered-in-western-ghats-underlines-need-for-habitat-protection/story-xhCBEe7dRLA5lgxMElyq0J.html

It caused friction between the two. They were drinking last night and started fighting about it and it turned violent,” said police sub- inspector Santosh Shinde of Kondhwa police station. The deceased, Khude, was named as an accused in an earlier case of attempted murder registered in Bund Garden police station. The complainant in that case was Dhumal. “The same reason led to a violent fight between the two,” according to PSI Shinde. A case under Section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered at Kondhwa police station against Dhumal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/festering-friendship-leads-to-murder-1-held-for-body-found-in-kondhwa/story-Fp7MBZw72AkUxZFpVptjKJ.html
02-10-2020||Pune||Pune trial pendency 4th highest in nation||Pune city has a pendency of 96.4%, and a conviction rate of 12.9%, in cases related to crime against women for the year 2019, according to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau of India (NCRB).The publication, titled ‘Crime in India, 2019’, compares data from all states and union territories along with data from 19 metropolitan cities. The definition of metropolitan, as per NCRB, is a city that has a population in excess of 10 lakh. However, only metropolitan cities which have a population of at least 20 lakh have been considered in the study.In 2019, the courts in Pune sent 1,172 cases to trial. A total of 12,420 cases are pending trial from the previous years.Of all the cases which went to trial in 2019, 58 were convicted, 384 were acquitted and eight cases were discharged.These are only among cases which reached the legal end of investigation. There are 2,432 cases, including 1,390 cases from 2019, and 1,042 cases from previous years, which are awaiting investigation by the police.While cases keep mounting in the annals of the judiciary in the city, the addition to the burden has lessened under this category in the past three years, according to the data. The annual number of cases registered in Pune has, however, come down compared to 2017. From 2,032 in 2017, and 1,481 in 2018, the city police registered 1,390 cases in 2019.On a national level, NCRB report points to an increase in crimes against women in the 19 cities it surveyed in the year 2019, as compared to 2018.“A total of 45,485 cases of crime against women were registered during 2019, showing an increase of 7.8% over 2018 (42,180 cases),” reads a part of the summary of the report.Discussing reasons for cases getting stuck in court, a senior police inspector of the Pimpri-Chinchwad police, requesting anonymity, narrated an incident of a minor’s rape at a labour camp. “The girl woke up in the middle of the night and was walking towards the bathroom when this man pulled her into his room and raped her. During the assault she raised an alarm and the neighbours and her parents came and rescued her, but he had already done the deed by then. The parents settled the matter when the boy agreed to give money and marry her. When that promise fell flat three days later, they came to the police. When the case was registered, he agreed to marry her. Now the complainant and her parents do not wish to pursue the case. How do we make such a case stand in court? This is not the only incident of its kind.”“Firstly, awareness of people about registration of these cases - there is a stark increase as these complaints are taken up on a fast track basis. Judicial persons have not increased proportionately. Secondly, this has simply added to the pendency that was already high. The usual issues of availability of witnesses and complainants for procedures like identification parade are also majorly at play. For example, the labourer women who come here for work, they register cases and then are forced to change location as per their work. It is difficult to trace them. After all, no court wants to keep pendency on purpose but n number of reasons are at play,” said Advocate Leena Pathak who practices in Pune district court and is a public prosecutor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/96-pendency-of-cases-involving-crime-against-women-in-pune-ncrb/story-VXAJvdzBp4qX40cnLrhpRN.html

Currently, according to Maha-Metro public relation’s officer Hemant Sonawane, 4,500 labourers are working on Pune Metro sites.“This is double the strength as compared to July-August, when Maha- Metro resumed work, post lockdown,” Sonawane said on Thursday.In the past two weeks, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, also Pune’s guardian minister, visited Metro sites in the city to keep abreast of the latest metro developments.Sonawane added, “It is true that due to Covid-19 lockdown, Maha-Metro’s work has been delayed. Workers returned to their respective states. However, now at least 80 per cent of the labourers have returned begun work.” The metro lines from Swargate-Nigdi and Vanaz-Ramwadi are 43% complete. This includes a six-kilometre stretch, from Agriculture College ground to Swargate, on the Nigdi-Swargate line. Atul Gadgil, Maha-Metro’s director, said, “Maha-Metro made an effort to bring back the labourers to the metro sites. Maha-Metro wrote letters to various district collectors in respective states and requested them to issue passes for labourers to travel.” On September 19, Ajit Pawar visited both, elevated and underground metro works and said that the state government would ensure that Maha-Metro’s work is not get affected due to financial reasons.Maha-Metro, in September, also achieved a breakthrough by completing digging of the 1,600-metre underground tunnel from Agriculture college to the civil court, Shivajinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maha-metro-labour-force-doubles-in-sept-to-4-500-workers/story-9ZNWqkgyvX0rLzEdHqzecK.html
02-10-2020||Delhi||Weekly mkts rules eased, DDMA call on schools, cinema halls later||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has ordered that status quo should be maintained in all activities permitted in the national Capital so far, even as it allowed two weekly markets to be held per day per zone instead of one from Thursday. Also Read: States, UT govts will not impose any local lockdown outside containment zones: Centre in new guidelinesThe order, issued by Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, on Wednesday night followed the Union home ministry’s guidelines to unlock almost all activities by allowing a graded restart of schools, partial reopening of movie theatres, and large gatherings including political and religious events.Since these fresh relaxations have been allowed by the Central government from October 15, the Delhi government said a decision on permitting all such activities will be taken in a graded manner and not during a single DDMA meeting. Clarifying Delhi’s current position after the Centre’s guidelines were released, the DDMA’s latest order stated: “The situation of Covid-19 has been reviewed and it has been decided that status quo in respect of prohibited/permitted activities (including activities on trial basis) may be maintained in NCT of Delhi till 31.10.2020 or further orders, whichever is earlier.”Also Read: Make social gatherings safe with tissues, sanitiser, masks: Delhi health minister “It has also been decided that opening of two weekly markets per day per zone in all three municipal corporations/ New Delhi Municipal Council/Delhi Cantonment Board may be allowed instead of one weekly market per day per zone,” read the order. Senior officials in chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said the government had urged Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to allow all weekly markets to resume operations in the city. Baijal is the DDMA chairperson, and Kejriwal it’s vice-chair.“The proposal was sent to the L-G, but the L-G instead allowed two weekly markets per zone per day. The chief minister was of the view that all weekly markets should now be allowed to open as the people engaged in this activity are already facing a lot of hardships due to the lockdown. Now when everything is opened, they also are demanding resumption of full operations,” said an official on condition of anonymity. The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter. The latest DDMA order also clarified that any form of public gatherings such as protests and rallies will continue to be prohibited until further orders. “It is further directed that all social/academic/sports/entertainment/cultural/religious/political functions/other gatherings and large congregations shall be continued to be prohibited throughout NCT of Delhi,” the order stated.A senior government official said DDMA will meet in the next few days to review the city’s Covid-19 situation and decide whether movie theatres and, more importantly, educational institutions should be reopened and if yes, how. “Schools in Delhi have anyway been ordered to stay shut till October 5. So, a decision is likely to be taken within the next four days. Central universities such as Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) will also have to wait for DDMA orders,” said the official on condition of anonymity.The Centre’s guidelines state that the decision for reopening schools and coaching institutions in a graded manner can be taken by the states/Union Territories after October 15 “in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation”. However, if students preferred to attend online classes, they would be permitted to do so. The guidelines said attendance must not be enforced, and must depend entirely on parental consent.Besides, interstate buses have also not been allowed in Delhi till now despite them being allowed under the Centre’s previous unlock guidelines.The Central government has permitted all of these activities from October 15, leaving it to the state governments to decide whether they want to implement it or not depending on the prevailing Covid-19 situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/unlock-5-status-quo-in-delhi-more-relaxation-for-weekly-markets/story-jUJEXaf0bVviCBqwmUp8sI.html

He says the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf had attacked Kargil without informing him. “I would have sacked the army chief if Kargil operation was conducted without informing me,” Khan said in an interview to private news channel Samaa TV on Thursday.Also read: Imran Khan faces pushback over Gilgit-Baltistan move. China ties his hands | AnalysisKhan also said that he would sack the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief if the latter asked him to resign. The comment was made in the context of three-time prime minister Sharif’s claim that the ISI chief asked him to step down in 2014 when Khan had unleashed a big protest sit-in the national capital.He said the army was keeping the country united and slammed Sharif for targeting the military establishment.“Look at Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen; the entire Muslim world is ablaze [so] why are we safe? If it weren’t for our army, our country would’ve been in three pieces…” Khan said.Sharif recently made two speeches from London, where he has been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds, directly attacking the army for interference in politics and claimed that Khan came to power through its support.Also read: ‘People, not governments, fight wars’: PM Modi on Kargil WarThe powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Khan also said that it was not the army’s job to run the government and failure of a democratically elected government should not be used to impose a martial law.“If a judge gives a wrong decision it means the judiciary has to evolve. The army has evolved as well. Contemporary civil-military relations are the best in history because they are all working in their spheres,” he said.He also claimed that the army was standing by the government in all matters including relations with India, opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/would-have-sacked-army-chief-if-kargil-war-was-conducted-without-informing-me-imran-khan/story-rIoJsZwYP2hQGpEAOnXPZL.html
02-10-2020||World||Covid-19 infected UK MP attended House; told to resign||An MP of the Scottish National Party who tested positive for coronavirus, attended the House of Commons on Wednesday and later travelled on public transport from London to Edinburgh faced persistent calls to resign on Friday.Margaret Ferrier, MP from Rutherglen and Hamilton West, has been suspended by her party. Nicola Sturgeon, party leader and Scotland’s First Minister, said she had spoken to Ferrier and asked her to step down as MP. She also faced strong criticism from speaker Lindsay Hoyle.Ferrier’s actions revived debate about everyone, irrespective of position, following law and quarantine rules after evidence emerged of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Stanley Johnson, father of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, not obeying such rules.Ian Blackford, SNP leader in Westminster, said Ferrier had broken the law and should therefore reflect very carefully on whether she can continue as a Member of Parliament for her constituents. “Nobody is above the law, nobody is above the regulations…I am calling on Margaret to do the right thing.”Ferrier, 60, apologised for her behaviour in a statement: “I apologise unreservedly for breaching Covid-19 restrictions by travelling this week when I shouldn’t have. There is no excuse for my actions.”“I deeply regret my actions. I take full responsibility and I would urge everyone not to make the same mistakes that I have, and do all they can to help limit the spread of Covid-19”, she added.Ferrier spoke for four minutes in the House of Commons in person. The House has been functioning under strict Covid-secure conditions that include few MPs present, with others joining debates through video link.Ferrier’s actions are now a subject of police investigation in London and Scotland, Hoyle said. It could result in a £4,000 fine recently announced by the government for those breaching quarantine regulations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infected-uk-mp-attended-house-told-to-resign/story-kdeNMihag1gmJKWdKVPYDP.html

All you need to knowA separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for Covid-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020.The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology.It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 per cent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries.Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of Covid-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reliance-develops-rt-pcr-kit-that-can-give-covid-19-results-in-2-hrs/story-Vz96WT0DThdpCeyN2CUKeI.html

02-10-2020||World||Some parallels in Covid scripts of Boris Johnson, Donald Trump||Initially denying and playing down the virus, followed by contraction and fever, and eventual self-isolation.There are some parallels in the Covid-19 scripts of US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson; the latter had to be hospitalised and was on a ventilator for several days in April.It was a brush with death, he admitted later. His recovery was close, “it could have gone either way.”Like Trump, who played down the virus and was rarely seen wearing a mask in public, Johnson too had made light of the virus earlier this year.On March 3, the day his scientific and medical advisers cautioned against shaking hands, Johnson declared on live television: “I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients”. “And I shook hands with everybody, you’ll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,” he had stated with a smile.But by March end, Johnson had contracted the virus and had to be admitted to the St Thomas’ Hospital near Downing Street on April 5. He spent three nights in the intensive care unit before returning to Number 10 a much-sobered man.At the time of contracting the virus, both Johnson and Trump were overweight. After recovery, Johnson implored Britons to take to exercise to shed excess fat as he cited his own struggles while announcing measures to deal with the pandemic.The blanket coverage of Johnson’s illness and recovery generated some sympathy even though there was much criticism of his government’s handling of the pandemic. There are obvious differences in the scripts of the two leaders considered to be of similar political persuasions, but the key variable is that there is an election due across the Atlantic and whether Trump’s situation will generate similar sympathy among the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-parallels-in-covid-scripts-of-boris-johnson-donald-trump/story-28Xux8nIooD7GV3abE4lmJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine alone won’t curb spread of virus, report warns||A successful vaccine for Covid-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus and many challenged would have to be overcome to deliver a successful vaccination programme, a recent study has warned. A report of Royal Society’s DELVE (Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics) Initiative suggests that there are serious challenges to developing, evaluating, manufacturing and distributing the vaccine.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine: Fever, body aches common symptoms. All you need to knowWhy have scientists not been able to develop the vaccine yet?A successful vaccine stimulates immune responses that negate chances of transmission of infection and reduce risk and severity of disease. It also ensures long term protection so that people do not have to be re-vaccinated frequently.Currently, scientists have not been able to put their finger on SARS-CoV-2 infection’s immune responses. They do not even know if the infection has any immune responses. Antibodies and T cells have been detected in those who have recovered from the virus, but it is not clear whether it leads to protection against reinfection, according to the report.Evaluating prospective vaccine candidatesOver 200 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are currently in development, with a handful being in later stages of clinical trials. Some of the candidates that are in later stages of trials, such as the Oxford/Astrazeneca candidate, have used ‘viral vectors’ -- where a part of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic code is inserted in another harmless virus through which antibodies are generated.Others, such as Moderna, have used an alternative design, where a viral genetic code is produced as an RNA vaccine, which also leads to the production of viral protein when it enters a cell, the report stated.Even as development of these candidates has been accelerated, vaccines fail at a later level of trails many times due to poor immunogenicity, it added.Challenges in manufacture of a future vaccineOnce a vaccine is available, the choice of vaccination strategies will need to be phased to match manufacturing capacity.Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) estimates that for 2021, a global annual capacity of between 2 to 4 billion doses could be available without disrupting existing vaccine supplies, with much of the capacity being in India and China, the report said.Also Read: Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positiveIf immunity is short lived and annual vaccine boosters are needed, capacity will be needed to extend coverage whilst maintaining immunity in existing recipients, it added.The challenge of vaccine distributionThe vaccine supply chain consists of a series of transportation and storage steps.Sourcing of raw materials used for drug product manufacturing and distribution of the finished product might be disrupted due to the pandemic itself.Supply chain will be disrupted in case borders are closed due to lockdown, personnel become ill, countries compete for short supply or medical system is overwhelmed. For making transportation easy, manufacturers are working towards improving thermostability of prospective vaccines to reduce the need of the distribution at very low temperatures, the report said.Additional medical staff will need to be trained to immunise the population rapidly, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-alone-won-t-curb-spread-of-virus-report-warns/story-BRT7mDkTALqqYoP2yWf3EK.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump joins growing list of Covid-infected world leaders||President Donald Trump has tested positive for the coronavirus, joining a small group of world leaders who have been infected. Trump is 74, putting him at higher risk of serious complications. Here’s a look at other leaders who have had the virus. Some are sending Trump their wishes for a speedy recovery. Boris JohnsonThe British prime minister was the first major world leader confirmed to have Covid-19, after facing criticism for downplaying the pandemic. He was moved to intensive care in April after his symptoms dramatically worsened a day after he was hospitalized for what were called routine tests. He was given oxygen but did not need a ventilator, officials said. He later expressed his gratitude to National Health Service staff for saving his life when his treatment could have “gone either way.” Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, also tested positive in March and showed mild symptoms.Jair BolsonaroThe Brazilian president announced his illness in July and used it to publicly extol hydroxychloroquine, the unproven malaria drug that he’d been promoting as a treatment for Covid-19 and was taking himself. For months he had flirted with the virus, calling it a “little flu,” as he flouted social distancing at lively demonstrations and encouraged crowds during outings from the presidential residence, often without a mask.Juan Orlando HernandezThe Honduras president announced in June that he had tested positive, along with two other people who worked closely with him. Hernández said he had started what he called the “MAIZ treatment,” an experimental and unproven combination of microdacyn, azithromycin, ivermectin and zinc. He was briefly hospitalized and released. He has added his voice to growing pleas for equitable access to any Covid-19 vaccine, asking the recent UN gathering of world leaders, “Are people to be left to die?”Alexander LukashenkoThe president of Belarus, who dismissed concerns about the virus as “psychosis” and recommended drinking vodka to stay healthy, said in July he had contracted it himself but was asymptomatic. Belarus is one of the few countries that took no comprehensive measures against the virus. Other top officials in former Soviet states who were infected include Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.Prince Albert II of MonacoThe palace of Monaco in March said the ruler of the tiny Mediterranean principality tested positive but his health was not worrying. He was the first head of state who publicly said he was infected.Also Read| Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positive Alejandro GiammatteiThe Guatemalan president said he tested positive for the virus in September. “My symptoms are very mild. Up to now, I have body aches, it hurt more yesterday than today, like a bad cold,” he said during a televised address. “I don’t have a fever, I have a bit of a cough.” He said he’d be working from home.Jeanine AnezThe virus drove the Bolivian interim president into isolation in July, but she said she was feeling well.Luis AbinaderThe newly elected president of the Dominican Republic contracted and recovered from Covid-19 during his campaign. He spent weeks in isolation before the country’s July election.IranIran, the epicentre of the Mideast’s initial coronavirus outbreak, has seen several top officials test positive. Among them are senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri and Vice President Massoumeh Ebtekar. Cabinet members have tested positive, too.IndiaVice President M. Venkaiah Naidu, 71, recently tested positive but his office said he had no symptoms and was quarantined at home. Home minister Amit Shah, the No. 2 man in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, was hospitalized for Covid-19 last month and has recovered. Junior railways minister Suresh Angadi last week was the first federal minister to die from Covid-19.Also Read: US Prez Trump, Melania test positive for Covid-19; could hit his presidential campaignIsraelIsrael’s then-Health Minister Yaakov Litzman tested positive in April and recovered.

The minister for Jerusalem affairs, Rafi Peretz, tested positive over the summer as cases surged nationwide and recovered.South AfricaThe country’s defense minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, mineral resources and energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, and labor minister, Thulas Nxesi, were infected as cases surged in June and July.South SudanVice President Riek Machar was among several Cabinet ministers infected.GambiaVice President Isatou Touray tested positive in July along with the ministers of finance, energy and agriculture.Guinea-BissauPrime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam in April said he tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joins-growing-list-of-covid-infected-world-leaders/story-sPn4P9eLvETx6jQ4D4SBOM.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump Covid-19 positive: How vice president Pence could take charge if needed||Like two U.S. presidents before him, Donald Trump could temporarily hand over power to his vice president should he become incapacitated, for example while undergoing a medical procedure as treatment for the coronavirus.Trump said on Friday that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and was going into quarantine to begin the recovery process immediately.Under Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution’s 25th Amendment, adopted in 1967 following the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy, Trump could declare in writing his inability to discharge his duties.Vice President Mike Pence would become acting president, although Trump would remain in office. The president would regain his powers by declaring in writing that he is again ready to discharge them.The 25th Amendment’s Section 4 also offers a path to stripping a president of power if, for instance, his Cabinet believes he has become incapacitated, but this has never been invoked.SECTION 3 PRECEDENTS- On July 13, 1985, President Ronald Reagan elected to have a precancerous lesion removed after it was discovered during a colonoscopy. He signed a letter that, while not specifically invoking Section 3, said he was mindful of its provisions. Vice President George H.W. Bush was acting president for nearly eight hours, from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan issued a letter declaring himself able to resume his duties.- On June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush invoked Section 3, temporarily transferring his powers to Vice President Dick Cheney before undergoing a colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president from 7:09 a.m. to 9:24 a.m.- On July 21, 2007, Bush again invoked Section 3 before another colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president from 7:16 a.m. to 9:21 a.m.SECTION 4Under Section 4, the vice president and a majority of either Cabinet officials or “such other body as Congress may by law provide” can inform leaders in the two houses of Congress that the president “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”.In such a case, the vice president takes over as acting president. The president resumes office after informing the same two congressional leaders “that no inability exists” unless the Cabinet officials or other body declare otherwise. Congress then must assemble within 48 hours to decide the issue.If two-thirds of the members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate vote in their respective chambers that the president is unable to discharge the duties of office, the vice president remains acting president until after the next scheduled presidential election decides the next White House occupant. Otherwise, the president resumes office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-covid-19-positive-how-vice-president-pence-could-take-charge-if-needed/story-prQ0gXvahyXVDgaLyz1QbK.html
02-10-2020||World||Shock, sympathy, mockery: World reacts to Trump being coronavirus positive||News of the infection of the most powerful man in the world with the most notorious disease in the world drew instant reactions of shock, sympathy, undisguised glee and, of course, the ever-present outrage and curiosity that follow much of what Donald Trump does, even from 10,000 miles away.Trump’s announcement Friday, on Twitter, that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and the deep uncertainty that accompanied it, permeated the global news cycle, upending countless plans and sparking comment everywhere from presidential offices to the thousands looking to weigh in on social media.The positive test reading for the leader of the world’s largest economy adds more uncertainty to investors’ worries, including, most prominently, how the infection might affect the Nov. 3 election between Trump, a Republican, and Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. stock futures and Asian shares fell in the wake of the news. The future contracts for both the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials lost 1.9%. Oil prices also slipped. Stock prices in Japan and Australia tumbled.“To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,” Rabobank said in a commentary. “Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this U.S. election campaign.”World leaders and officials were quick to weigh in, and there was both sympathy and something approaching schadenfreude.“Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.U.S.-India ties have prospered under Trump, and India is seen as a partner to balance China’s growing weight in Asia.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized for a week in April after he contracted Covid-19, wished Trump a “speedy recovery.”“Our best wishes go to the president and the first lady, but it demonstrates that no one is immune from Covid-19 and catching it. So it shows that no matter the precautions, we are all susceptible to this,” Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, deputy leader of the conservative Nationals party, said on Australian Broadcasting Corp. TV. “A trying time, and it just goes to show that a global pandemic can in fact touch anybody, even the president of the United States.”Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, speaking at a weekly news conference, did not mention Trump’s reluctance to wear masks when asked about his infection, but she said the news “reminded me of how widely masks are worn in Japan.”Major media across the globe also played up the announcement, with bulletins crawling across TV screens in Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, Dubai and Beijing.China’s official Xinhua News Agency flashed the news, and an anchor on state broadcaster CCTV announced it; there was no immediate comment from the government Friday, the second day of an eight-day national holiday.The positive test result for Trump and his wife was the most searched topic in China on the widely used social media app Weibo a few hours after the announcement, with most comments mocking or critical.One user darkly joked that Trump had finally tweeted something positive.The Chinese government has bristled at Trump’s attempts to blame China, where the disease emerged, for the pandemic and called for global cooperation in fighting it, a message that has resonated with the public.Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted in English that “President Trump and the first lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19.”Multiple Arab news media outlets on Friday continuously broadcast footage of Trump and his wife after the virus announcement.Al-Arabiya, a Saudi-owned satellite channel based in Dubai, cut to a long live shot of the White House. Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera channel brought in four commentators to discuss the “prevailing state of uncertainty” in the United States, questioning whether Trump could effectively steer a reelection campaign and run the country from quarantine.Iranian state television announced Trump had the virus, an anchor breaking the news with an unflattering image of the U.S. president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses. U.S.-Iran ties have suffered since Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed crushing sanctions.Social media platforms were ablaze with quick reaction.Would Trump blame the Chinese? Would he thumb his nose at his critics and enemies by breezing through the quarantine without serious symptoms, tweeting away from the White House? Would he become gravely ill, or worse, and, if he did, what would that mean for the U.S. election, one of the most contentious in recent history?While the uncertainty seemed palpable on a scroll through various nations’ social media, many of the comments seemed to revel in the announcement.“Here comes a chance for him to actually try out his idea of injecting disinfectant into himself and fighting back (against allegations that) it was fake news!” tweeted Hiroyuki Nishimura, a Japanese internet entrepreneur, referring to an idea Trump floated earlier this year for treatment.Keio University economics professor Masaru Kaneko tweeted that populist leaders like British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro “got infected because they tended not to take the coronavirus seriously. The two other leaders seriously tackled (the virus) after they got infected themselves. Will the United States follow their examples?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shock-sympathy-mockery-world-reacts-to-trump-being-coronavirus-positive/story-NfpCDYDkNfaePk6R52KfeM.html
02-10-2020||World||Donald Trump tests positive for Covid-19, upending US election||President Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19, upending the already tense US election, but was described by his doctor on Friday as feeling “well” and able to perform his duties while quarantining.Trump, 74, first announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, had tested positive.“We will get through this TOGETHER!” he wrote.The news detonated a political bombshell a month before election day.The first immediate consequence was cancelation of a Trump campaign rally meant to take place in Florida later Friday.Badly behind in the polls against Democratic challenger Joe Biden ahead of November 3, Trump has been using large rallies -- where most people go without masks -- to try to change the subject from his much criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic.Just Thursday he said in a speech to a New York charity event: “The end of the pandemic is in sight and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country.”But now the leader who has repeatedly cast doubt on the seriousness of the virus -- despite more than 200,000 Americans already dying -- has become the world’s highest profile patient, proving that all the resources of the White House could not prevent the risk.Biden, who has made criticism of the Republican’s coronavirus response his key issue, made no immediate statement about the president’s health after the news broke.Technically obese and in his 70s, Trump is in a higher-risk category for coronavirus patients.Trump’s official physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement that the president and his wife “are both well at this time.”“They plan to remain home at the White House during their convalescence,” he said. However, “I expect the president to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering.”- Campaign upheaval -Trump’s positive test was more than a PR disaster for a president who has staked everything on trying to persuade Americans that fears of the virus are overblown.There were concrete, instant impacts to his campaign strategy, particularly throwing into doubt the future of his signature rallies.The events, which Trump says prove his true political strength better than the dismal opinion polls, bring together thousands of people, often without masks and sometimes in contravention of local rules.All that is now on hold, at least for the immediate future, and with the clock ticking rapidly down on the election.In addition to canceling the Florida trip, it looked certain that Trump would have to abandon a trip scheduled for this weekend in Wisconsin, another battleground. He had also been expected to travel frequently next week, including longer distances to western states.A second televised debate with Biden is scheduled for October 15.- Close aide gets virus -The news came right after one of Trump’s closest advisors, Hope Hicks, was reported Thursday to have come down with the virus.Hicks, 31, traveled with Trump to Cleveland for his first debate with Biden on Tuesday. She was with him again for a campaign rally in Minnesota on Wednesday.With Hicks sharing Trump’s Air Force One plane and the even more cramped confines of the Marine One helicopter, speculation immediately erupted that Trump and possibly many others in his close entourage were exposed.Despite Hicks’ diagnosis, Trump took another Air Force One trip on Thursday to meet with donors in New Jersey.It was only late Thursday that Trump confirmed media reports about Hicks while giving an interview to Fox News. He announced that he had been tested but did not say whether he had received the results.“You know I spend a lot of time with Hope, and so does the first lady,” Trump said.Hicks is the most senior White House aide announced to have contracted Covid-19.In May, the spokeswoman of Vice President Mike Pence and wife of Trump’s speech writer, Katie Miller, came down with the virus. National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien contracted the virus and went into quarantine in July.- Masks controversy -For months, Trump has courted controversy with his insistence that the coronavirus pandemic is as good as over and that lockdowns ordered in an attempt to beat the virus back were too draconian.In what has become an overtly political gesture, Trump almost never wears a mask in public.He argues that he doesn’t need to as he is frequently tested, but the example is followed by his supporters and many of his aides.But Trump’s own health experts have often given less rosy assessments of the state of the pandemic in the world’s richest country.And Trump has been especially criticized by Biden and at times also by local leaders for holding the rallies.Biden is running a deliberately low key campaign with social distancing at most events, no large gatherings, and conspicuous use of his mask wherever he goes.At their first debate on Tuesday, the candidates were tested and spent the angry, often chaotic 90 minutes standing close to each other. Trump’s family and supporters in the audience did not wear masks.White House spokesman Judd Deere earlier said “the president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”Deere said the White House takes care to follow procedures “for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the president is traveling.”sms/mtp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tests-positive-for-covid-upending-us-election/story-PgRwEcvefTuGEB7HdN7b4N.html

02-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: Democratic nominee Joe Biden shatters fundraising records||Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has again shattered fundraising records, topping his already gargantuan August cash haul during the month of September, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.An exact total for the month is not yet clear. But both people, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to reveal internal details, said Thursday that he surpassed the $365 million raised last month through his joint fundraising effort with the Democratic National Committee.Biden’s success raising money speaks to the enthusiasm of Democratic donors to oust President Donald Trump from office. The money will help him continue to dominate the advertising wars and will position the campaign well for the possibility of a protracted legal fight after the Nov. 3 election.The possibility of a court battle over the outcome looms. Trump has repeatedly refused to say whether he will accept the results if he loses. And he has argued repeatedly without offering proof that the election will be plagued by widespread voter fraud, particularly from ballots cast by mail.Democrats have seen a torrent of new money in recent weeks. Candidates up and down the ballot took in more than $100 million donated online following the death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as Republicans moved forward to replace her with a conservative justice.And Biden himself raised over $31 million on Wednesday, following a chaotic debate against Trump, who refused to clearly condemn white supremacists who support him and personally insulted Biden’s family.A Biden campaign spokesperson declined to comment when asked about the fundraising totals.The Trump campaign hasn’t yet released their September fundraising numbers.The gobs of cash Biden has raised since securing the Democratic nomination amount to a complete reversal in fortune for the former vice president. During the Democratic primary, he struggled to raise cash and was almost broke by the time he won the South Carolina primary, which catapulted him to a commanding Super Tuesday performance.In the months since, a flood of donations and low spending has enabled him to eclipse Trump’s once-formidable cash reserves.That has allowed Biden to dominate the airwaves with TV advertising in battleground states with just weeks to go before the election.Biden will not have to formally submit his September fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission until later this month.

02-10-2020||World||NASA scrubs SS Kalpana Chawla Cygnus launch to ISS||The launch of Northrop Grumman’s Antares rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS) was scrubbed by about 9:40 p.m. due to an unknown problem with a component of ground support equipment. The commercial cargo spacecraft, a Northrop Grumman Cygnus, was set to blast off on Thursday night carrying the name of deceased NASA astronaut Kalpana “K.C.” Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to enter space, for her key contributions to human spaceflight.“Tonight’s launch attempt for @NorthropGrumman’s Antares rocket to send the #Cygnus resupply craft to the @Space_Station was scrubbed about 2 minutes and 40 seconds before liftoff due to an unknown problem with a component of ground support equipment,” NASA tweeted.“We have scrubbed tonight’s #Antares launch attempt after receiving off-nominal data from ground support equipment. Stay tuned for the time of the next launch attempt,” Northern Grumman.This marked the second delay in total for Northrop Grumman’s latest commercial resupply mission. The night launch was already pushed back from its original launch window of Tuesday evening due to weather conditions. NASA has yet to detail specific reasons for the abort, after needing to delay at the original 11-minute mark due to a boat in the range. On the NG-14 mission, the S.S. Kalpana Chawla was supposed to deliver approximately 3,630 kilograms of cargo to the station.Research flying aboard the Cygnus includes the test of a biologic drug that could be used for the treatment of leukaemia, a plant growth study that will cultivate radishes as a model for future crops in space, a compact toilet for astronauts to use on deep-space exploration missions and a 360-degree virtual reality camera that will be used to film during a spacewalk for an immersive cinematic production.Northrop Grumman, an American global aerospace and defence technology company said that this mission is named after Chawla in memory of the mission specialist who died with her six crewmates aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 Northrop Grumman stated that it is proud to celebrate the life of Kalpana Chawla and her dream of flying through the air and in space. “It is the company’s tradition to name each Cygnus after an individual who has played a pivotal role in human spaceflight,” said Northrop Grumman. While Chawla made the ultimate sacrifice in service to the space program, her legacy lives on. She has not only inspired her colleagues but also many back in India, to follow in her footsteps. Her final research conducted onboard Columbia helped understand astronaut health and safety during spaceflight. Born in Haryana, India, Chawla moved to the United States to earn her master’s and doctorate degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas in 1984 and University of Colorado in 1988, respectively. She then began her career at NASA, conducting research in fluid dynamics at the Ames Research Center in California.After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Chawla applied for and became a NASA astronaut as a member of “The Flying Escargot,” NASA’s 15th class of trainees. In 1997, she launched on STS-87, a 15-day shuttle mission that was dedicated to the science flying as part of the fourth United States Microgravity Payload (USMP-4).Chawla’s second spaceflight, STS-107, came to a tragic end on February 1, 2003, following 16 days of conducting science onboard the space shuttle Columbia. A small piece of foam that struck the orbiter’s left wing during launch created a hole that went undetected during the mission. Upon Columbia’s return to Earth, hot plasma entered the wing, tearing it apart, and the resulting loss of control led to the vehicle disintegrating and the death of the crew. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-scrubs-ss-kalpana-chawla-cygnus-launch-to-iss/story-UtMa4JDJ3aly3caZDXBicL.html
02-10-2020||World||Mask norms relaxed for Sikhs in Canadian police||Canada’s premier law enforcement agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), has relaxed norms on wearing of medical grade masks that were considered discriminatory and forced many bearded officers, mainly Sikhs, off the frontlines.Those rules were implemented in April following the Covid-19 pandemic. This matter was addressed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the House of Commons this week. “This is absolutely unacceptable. We asked the RCMP to review its policies to make sure that this example of systemic racism is put aside.”In a statement, RCMP’s Chief Human Resources Officer Gail Johnson announced the relaxation with regard to personal protective equipment (PPE). She said, “Impacted bearded members across Canada may return to operational duties wearing the appropriate PPE assigned to them based on a risk assessment carried out by the commanding officers in their respective provinces.”She added that bearded members will be assigned to operational duties “only if the risk of exposure is low or multiple responding officers will be present. At no time will we accept putting our officers or the public at any undue risk.” The decision will also depend on a risk assessment undertaken by respective commanding officers, while the RCMP will continue to make an accommodation for officers who prefer other policing duties as a safety precaution.“The issue of personal protective equipment (PPE) and impacts on RCMP members with facial hair during the pandemic has been a topic of public debate the last few days. I share the frustrations of our police officers across Canada who are personally affected,” Johnson stated.As yet, appropriate fitting respirators for those with facial hair does not yet exist , she saidBut the RCMP has begun work with Innovations Solutions Canada to explore the research and development of inclusively designed PPE and to ensure regulatory requirements support safe and non-discriminatory practices across Canada. “We are still working to identify or create a mask that meets our front-line needs as well as occupational health and safety regulations.”There had been reports of Sikh officers being taken off the frontlines and given desk assignments as the RCMP had deemed that when it came to respirators, “one of the most common causes of a breached seal is facial hair.”In her statement, Johnson said, “We are committed to resolving this issue as quickly as possible in order to help us further advance the important work that is ongoing in the RCMP to enhance diversity, equity, accountability and trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mask-norms-relaxed-for-sikhs-in-canadian-police/story-TUGEp7sc5qzzwSM51e5LNK.html

Visas for those already enrolled will be revoked if they are deemed to pose a risk,” Fisher reported.According to The Times, the moves comes after widespread concerns around intellectual property (IP) theft by students at the UK’s top research labs.Chinese students have been accused of IP theft in both the UK and the US. A Whitehall source said: “The ATAS (Academic Technology Approval Scheme) system is being expanded as we know that security threats are constantly evolving... We know that there are those who would seek to exploit our position as leaders in science & innovation. Ministers decided to take action earlier this year.”A recent report from a think tank, the Henry Jackson Society, found that 900 graduates of Chinese universities allegedly linked to the People’s Liberation Army are enrolled in postgraduate studies at 33 British universities with serious research arms.In 2018-19 Chinese students accounted for 12 per cent of all postgraduates studying at UK universities. Hundreds could face being blocked from taking up places going forward.In May, a similar move was taken by the United States. The Trump administration had announced that it has banned some Chinese students and researchers from entering the United States after accusing them of stealing intellectual property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-students-may-face-ban-in-uk-amid-security-concerns-says-report/story-klQOZ6B3wqWcmCtWkuHn6K.html

02-10-2020||World||Canada snubs China Day celebrations, anti-China protests held in main cities||From the Mayor of Canada’s largest city boycotting a flag-raising event and a provincial legislature cancelling a scheduled ceremony to multiple protests, there was much to mar China’s National Day celebrations in the country.While the Chinese flag was hoisted near City Hall in Toronto, the event was marked by the city’s Mayor John Tory absence. The outlet Toronto Sun quoted his spokesperson as saying that this was due “to a number of issues between Canada and China which are of great concern to him.” Meanwhile, the Ontario Legislative Assembly was to host a ceremony with China’s Consul General in Toronto but cancelled the event after an outcry. The province’s Premiere Doug Ford said this was “not the appropriate time to be raising this flag” while its education minister Stephen Lecce elaborated in a tweet, “Our legislature is a symbol of our cherished freedoms and our enduring democracy. It is for that reason that we must consistently, principally, and unapologetically stand up for those fundamental Canadian values.”Several groups protesting recent actions by Beijing against Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and Mongolians, also gathered in Toronto and Vancouver outside the Chinese consulates in these cities. They were part of a Global Day of Action against the “Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s crackdowns against freedom, democracy, and human rights” that intensified across China. “We have witnessed a gross increase on the assault on communities living under its rule,” the organisers said.In Toronto, nearly 300 protestors collected outside the Chinese consulate. Among them was Youdon Tsamotshang, board chair of Students for a Free Tibet Canada. She said this year was “specifically different” from protests held earlier, because “a lot of eyes are on the Chinese government.” “Covid-19 is a big reason why, human rights atrocities are another. There is even more interest because of that.” The coalition that collected included Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese and natives of southern Mongolia. An Indian flag was also waved during the protest as a sign of solidarity, as India confronts China over Ladakh.Six main issues were raised at the protest: That Occupied Tibet is one of the least free places in the world, millions of Uighurs are detained in mass internment camps in occupied East Turkestan, loss of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong, erasure of Southern Mongolian culture and language, intimidation and geopolitical bullying of Taiwan and detention and disappearance of countless Chinese lawyers, feminists and activists.These events also marked how relations between Canada and China have plummeted since the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei in Vancouver in 2018. Since then the Canadian government has accused China of indulging in “hostage diplomacy”. China has arrested two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who remain in Chinese jails for over 660 days. Placards featuring the two detainees were also in display at the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-snubs-china-day-celebrations-anti-china-protests-held-in-main-cities/story-Z7EWPDLacxybrzmGS84WDN.html
02-10-2020||World||Hong Kong police arrest 86 for protesting on China holiday||Hong Kong police arrested at least 86 people on suspicion of unauthorized assembly on China’s National Day holiday after crowds gathered on the streets of a popular shopping district and other areas chanting pro-democracy slogans.Those arrested included four district councilors, police said in a statement posted on Facebook. They said the people were arrested after they ignored repeated warnings for them to disperse Thursday.Online calls urged people to join protests, and crowds turned up at Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay shopping district, some people chanting “Disband the police” and “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our time,” a popular pro-democracy slogan that has been banned by the Hong Kong government for alleged secessionist sentiments. 74 were arrested in Causeway Bay.A heavy police presence outnumbered the protesters at the scene.Separately, 20 people were also given penalties for breaching social-distancing regulations, which currently prohibit public gatherings of more than four people.National Day, which celebrates the founding of the People’s Republic of China, has become a day of protest in Hong Kong by those who oppose Beijing’s increasing control over the semi-autonomous city. Large-scale protests are forbidden because of social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus.In the afternoon, police cordoned off some areas in the district and searched people on the streets. On several occasions, they unfurled warning banners that urged protesters to disperse, saying they were participating in an illegal assembly.Protests against the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments swelled last year, and Beijing clamped down on expressions of anti-government sentiment in the city with a new national security law that took effect June 30.The law outlaws subversive, secessionist, and terrorist activity, as well as collusion with foreign powers to interfere in the city’s internal affairs. The US and Britain accuse China of infringing on the city’s freedoms, and the US has imposed sanctions on government officials in Hong Kong and China over the law.At a National Day reception, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said “stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded” under the new law.Lam also accused some foreign governments of holding “double standards” and leveling unjustified accusations against the authorities who implement the new law.

02-10-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s sister reported in public for first time since July||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first appearance in state media since July, an absence that had fuelled speculation her power was clipped after she led a contentious pressure campaign against South Korea.Kim Yo Jong joined her brother and a handful of other top cadres on a tour to inspect reconstruction work to repair damage caused by massive flooding in recent weeks, the state’s Korean Central News Agency reported Friday.Kim Yo Jong saw her profile rise among political analysts as the likely successor to her brother when a prolonged absence in April raised questions about his health. She was last mentioned in state media when she joined her brother on an inspection tour of a chicken farm, which included a glimpse in state media of her picking up a cigarette butt from her brother.“The listing of the accompanying officials in today’s report indicates that she has not been demoted,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent political analyst who used to work for the US government in areas related to North Korea.Kim Yo Jong’s status rose in the first part of the year where she was a key player on policies toward the country’s two biggest adversaries, the US and South Korea. A leading South Korean newspaper, the Chosun, reported in recent days that she might even visit President Donald Trump before the presidential election in a show of support.Kim Yo Jong led a series of threats and provocations against South Korea that culminated with Pyongyang in June blowing up a joint liaison office north of the border built in 2018 as a symbol of reconciliation between the two countries still technically at war. Just as soon as it looked like more was on the way, her brother reversed course in late June and halted plans to step up provocations.In July, she issued a message saying that North Korea had no intention of holding a meeting with Trump, calling on him to change his policy of applying sanctions against the state. After that, she was conspicuously absent from two key meetings in August of the ruling Workers’ Party, raising speculation that she had fallen out of favor.“We will never know what happened during her latest two-month absence, but I do not believe she was punished,” said Lee, who added it would be unthinkable for a national campaign like the one against South Korea to be launched and executed without the top leader’s approval.Choosing a woman to deliver pointed messages is notable for the Kim family, which has ruled the male-dominated society since the 1940s. Kim Yo Jong has become the highest-ranking female member of the family, and a rare sibling allowed to stay in a prominent position or even get mentioned in state media.Siblings have often not fared well in North Korea. Kim Jong Un has been accused of ordering the murder of his older half-brother and most serious rival, Kim Jong Nam, in 2017. Former leader Kim Jong Il’s brother was found drowned when they were children and his half-brother was effectively exiled for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-reported-in-public-for-first-time-since-july/story-Dy125m4EbbA7gGen2k0naK.html
02-10-2020||World||Trump not too keen on debate rule changes||President Donald Trump on Thursday indicated he will be averse to accepting changes in rules for the remaining two presidential debates, saying he “easily won” the first showdown.The rule changes are being considered by the body that conducts the debates to prevent a repeat of the chaos witnessed in the first debate in Ohio, in which Trump had repeatedly interrupted Joe Biden, his Democratic rival, and argued with the moderator Chris Wallace.“Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?” Trump wrote in a tweet, claiming victory when even his own allies have publicly conceded he may have hurt himself more by his conduct than his intended target, Biden.Trump had repeatedly talked over Biden and heckled him in an apparent bid to dominate the stage, forcing an exasperated Biden to call him a “clown” at one stage and ask him to “shut up” at another. All the while, the president had defied rules of engagement that his campaign had agreed with the commission.Trump’s tweet came after the Commission on Presidential Debates, set up in 1987 to conduct election debates for president and vice-president, said it plans to introduce “additional structure” to ensure “a more orderly discussion of the issues” for the remaining debates, one for vice-president and two for president. This may include cutting the mic of the person who is not speaking.Biden, who has called Trump a “national embarrassment” for this debate behaviour, said he is open to changes in the debate format, though he has neither called for them nor made his participation in the remaining rounds contingent on them. Asked about allowing the moderator to mute speakers, Biden said on Thursday that he was open to it as long as “we have an opportunity to respond to the questions from the people in the audience.”The next presidential debate will be a town hall in which members of the audience question the candidates. “I think it’s appropriate that when a person, a constituent, some considering how they’re going to vote this year, when they ask a question, of whomever they ask that question, gets an opportunity to answer it fully.”Trump has been trailing Biden in polls, even in the six or eight battleground states that will determine the outcome. He was expected to use the first debate to snatch the initiative and turn around the race. He failed on both counts, from all indications and may have ended up alienating potential voters.Biden leads Trump 50.1%-42.9% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls nationally and 50.9%-42.7% in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls.Both nominees and their surrogates are stumping in battleground states, with Trump focusing on opening up new pathways to victory and a second term as he trails in the battleground states that won him the 2016 election, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-not-too-keen-on-debate-rule-changes/story-LQETHicpDPNK8DdpL4dVVJ.html
02-10-2020||World||US President Trump, first lady Melania test positive for Covid-19||US president Donald Trump and first lady Melania have tested positive for coronavirus and will go into quarantine, the US president tweeted late on Thursday evening hours after one of his most senior advisers, Hope Hicks, was reported to have contracted the infection. Hicks had travelled with the president on multiple trips this week including abroad Marine One, the presidential helicopter, and Air Force One. It isn’t immediately clear how Trump contracted the virus that has infected over 7 million Americans and killed more than 200,000.Trump announced his health status on Twitter, saying they will “begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!,” he said.Within minutes of Trump’s announcement, Bloomberg reported U.S. stock futures fell more than 1 per cent and 0il prices extended losses to drop around 2 per cent early Friday. Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!New agency Reuters said Trump had kept up a rigorous travel schedule across the country in recent weeks, holding rallies with thousands of people in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, despite warnings from public health professionals against having events with large crowds.Trump had a packed schedule for Friday too including a private fund-raiser at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a campaign rally in Florida and a call with “vulnerable seniors” about the disease, the New York Times reported.The infection would impact Trump’s ability to campaign in person for the presidential elections. There is no clarity from his office if he will continue to address events over video but his new schedule just lists a midday phone call on “Covid-19 support to vulnerable seniors.”‘We will get through this together’: Trump & Melania test positive for Covid-19The president’s physician Sean Conley said Donald Trump and Melania “are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence”.“Rest assured, I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Dr Conley said in a statement.White House spokesman Judd Deere said contact tracing for Trump and Melania Trump was being carried out. Bloomberg said the 74-year-old president’s positive result was likely to sharpen an already intense public attention on his handling of the pandemic as he campaigns for re-election against Democrat Joe Biden, who leads in national polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-melania-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-zey89GSI5SWXNOAv9aRBAM.html

The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process!”Hicks had travelled with Trump and his team on Air Force One to Cleveland, Ohio for the first presidential debate. She also travelled with Trump to his rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Wednesday and was seen in close contact with senior members of the president’s campaign.According to rules made by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people who were in close contact with Hicks should quarantine themselves. That would include the president, the first lady and senior members of the president’s re-election campaign.Bloomberg, which first reported Hicks testing positive, said she had felt ill in Minnesota and quarantined herself on the way back on the presidential aircraft.“The president takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously,” White House spokesman Judd Deere has said in a statement. “White House Operations collaborates with the physician to the president and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible, both on complex and when the president is travelling.”Hicks is the fourth White House personnel to test positive for Coronavirus, after a personal military valet of the president, a member of the vice-president’s staff and the National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien. But Hicks has been the closest of them all to the president, who had gone on a 10-day course of Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-melania-start-quarantine-process-after-top-aide-hope-hicks-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-Zx99N4V0GMgSj1gBrE8QdP.html
02-10-2020||World||US lawmaker introduces legislation to overhaul H-1B visa system||An influential American lawmaker has introduced a legislation in the House of Representatives to overhaul the H-1B visa system to prevent the firing of domestic workers.Introduced on Thursday by Congressman Mo Brooks from Alabama, the American Jobs First Act seeks to sops employers from hiring foreign H-1B workers if they have recently, or plan to, furlough their US workers.It also requires employers to pay their H-1B workers more than the American workers to ensure foreign labour is only used when absolutely necessary.The American Jobs First Act suspends the F-1 OPT program, which grants all foreign students extendable work permits and exacerbates job market competition among American graduates.Further it ends the diversity visa lottery program, which fails to serve US interests by issuing 50,000 green cards to foreigners from around the world regardless of their qualifications.American Jobs First Act will bring much needed reform and oversight to the H-1B visa program to ensure that US workers are no longer disadvantaged in their own country, Congressman Brooks said.To end the allure of cheap foreign labour, the bill will require employers to pay any H-1B workers a minimum amount of USD 110,000, he said.“And to stop American worker replacement, my bill will require companies seeking H-1B labour to not have fired any American workers for at least two years without just cause and commit to not firing any workers without just cause for two years after,” Brooks said.Commonsense H-1B reform measures like these, alongside ending the unfair Optional Practical Training (OPT) and diversity visa lottery programs, all serve to promote American interests when it comes to immigration, he said.Early this year, the Tennessee Valley Authority callously gut punched tech workers when they tried to replace Americans with cheap foreign H-1B workers, Brooks said.Thanks to President Trump, TVA board member heads rolled and TVA reversed course, he added. But, changes in the law are necessary to ensure American workers don’t face replacement by cheap foreign labour in the future, Brooks said.“Due to intense pressure from big business, H-1B reform has been stalled for years, but Americans are hurting, and they cannot wait any longer for relief. Firing American workers only to hire cheap foreign workers to replace them is not only unpatriotic, it’s downright repulsive!” the lawmaker said.Chris Chmielenski, the deputy director of NumbersUSA, said the American Jobs First Act makes a number of much-needed reforms to the H-1B program, including setting a wage floor of USD 110,000 for all H-1B workers so that employers who say they can’t find an American to take a job have to put their money where their mouths are.“It ends the outrageous Optional Practical Training program that actually gives employers a tax break for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans,” he said.The legislation also ends the visa lottery that hands out 50,000 green cards, with work permits, based on a randomized computer drawing, Chmielenski added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmaker-introduces-legislation-to-overhaul-h-1b-visa-system/story-3IHcd9YdaJzcOeOIfDX7OM.html

02-10-2020||World||US House pays tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151 birth anniversary||Scores of US House of Representatives on Thursday (local time) paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151st birth anniversary.On the eve of Gandhi Jayanti, Congressman Rohit Khanna posted a message saying: “Gandhi taught us that the best fight for justice was a fight wage with principles of non-violence.”“Mahatma Gandhi changed the course of human history. So many people were inspired by his actions,” said Congressman Tom Suozzi in a tribute to Gandhi.Congressman TJ Coxsa and Mike Fitzpatrick also offered their tributes to Gandhi. While Coxsa encouraged people to embrace their differences to honour his legacy, Fitzpatrick endorsed Gandhi’s idea of selfless service.“I believe we can best honor Gandhi’s legacy by choosing to embrace our differences and dedicating ourselves to creating a world that is equitable for all,” Coxsa said.“Gandhi believed that the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in service of others. As elected officials, we come together to reflect on the achievements and lasting impact he had,” Fitzpatrick said. Several other Congressman offered their tributes to Gandhi via Indian Embassy’s Twitter handle.A special message from Ted Yoho read: “his philosophies inspired many including Dr. Martin Luther King’s peaceful protests that led to our nation’s civil right legislation in the 1960’s.”Congressman Ami Bera said that Gandhi is an “inspiration for all”.

02-10-2020||World||Fires in Brazil’s Amazon increase 13%from a year ago, data shows||Fires in Brazil’s Amazon increased 13% in the first nine months of the year compared with a year ago, as the rainforest region experiences its worst rash of fires in a decade, data from space research agency Inpe showed on Thursday.Satellites in September recorded 32,017 hot spots in the world’s largest rainforest, a 61% rise from the same month in 2019.In August last year, surging fires in the Amazon captured global headlines and prompted criticism from world leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the rainforest.On Tuesday, U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called for a world effort to offer $20 billion to end Amazon deforestation and threatened Brazil with unspecified “economic consequences” if it did not “stop tearing down the forest.”President Jair Bolsonaro lambasted Biden’s comment as a “cowardly threat” to Brazil’s sovereignty and a “clear sign of contempt.”The data from Inpe show that in 2019, fires spiked in August and declined considerably the month after, but this year’s peak has been more sustained. Both August and September of 2020 have matched or surpassed last year’s single-month high.“We have had two months with a lot of fire. It’s already worse than last year,” said Ane Alencar, science director for Brazil’s Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM).“It could get worse if the drought continues. We are at the mercy of the rain.”The Amazon is experiencing a more severe dry season than last year, which scientists attribute in part to warming in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean pulling moisture away from South America.The entire Amazon, which spans nine countries, currently has 28,892 active fires, according to a fire monitoring tool funded in-part by U.S. space agency NASA.The fires in September are not only burning recently deforested areas and farmland, where ranchers set them to clear land, but are also increasingly burning virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire.Roughly 62% of major Amazon fires were in forests in September, compared with only 15% in August, according to an analysis of satellite images by U.S.-based non-profit Amazon Conservation.The warming of the North Atlantic is also helping drive drought in the Brazilian Pantanal, the world’s largest wetland, which has suffered more fires this year than ever previously recorded, according to Inpe data.A Federal University of Rio de Janeiro analysis found that 23% of the wetlands, which are home to the densest population of jaguars in the world, has burned.“Brazil is on fire,” said Cristiane Mazzetti, a forest campaigner for advocacy group Greenpeace Brasil, in a statement.(Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fires-in-brazil-s-amazon-increase-13-from-a-year-ago-data-shows/story-PK4JQQuPtDi19Yb9KsrjVL.html
02-10-2020||World||US presidential election 2020: After bitter debate, Trump, Biden to speak at charity event||After a week in which they brawled in a debate and flayed each other on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden were making appearances Thursday night at an annual event meant to promote collegiality and good humour.It probably helps that they will be speaking remotely. The two rivals are the entertainment at the 75th Annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, which went virtual because of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump’s appearance at the dinner four years ago along with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton produced some laughs, but several cringe-worthy moments, too.When Trump described Clinton as corrupt, he crossed the line for many of those in attendance and was booed loudly.Fast forward four years, and now Trump and Biden have the challenge of poking fun at themselves and each other after a debate night in which Biden called the president a “clown” and “the worst president America has ever had” while Trump questioned Biden’s intelligence and attacked his son Hunter.The dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally shown that those vying to lead the nation can get along, or pretend to, for one night.The event has become a tradition for presidential candidates since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960.In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because of Clinton’s veto of a late-term abortion ban.This year’s dinner comes as Biden and Trump make fierce plays for Catholic voters, a large swath of the electorate that spans the US political spectrum, including a significant slice of swing voters in battleground states.The former vice president talks often of his Irish Catholic roots.He regularly attends Mass, including when he travels, and he talks often of the role that his faith has played in his life, saying that it “gave me purpose” and “hope” after the deaths of his first wife and young daughter in a car accident in 1972 and the death of his son Beau Biden in 2015.Nonetheless, the Smith dinner could present some tensions for Biden, even in virtual form. The host, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York, represents the outspoken social conservative base of US Catholicism. Dolan spoke during the Republican National Convention and for years, including when he led the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was a frequent cable news presence touting the church’s opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.Biden emphasizes other aspects of faith. In one campaign ad, Biden is shown talking about Pope Francis, who has urged Catholics not to focus so vociferously on the church’s opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage at the expense of social justice.Meanwhile, Trump has won favour with many Catholics for his anti-abortion policies and support for “school choice.” (AP) AD||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-election-2020-after-bitter-debate-trump-biden-to-speak-at-charity-event/story-dTFL4H4a0msjB2JkDmA6bO.html
02-10-2020||World||Top Trump aide Hope Hicks tests positive for coronavirus||Hope Hicks, one of President Donald Trump’s closest aides, has tested positive for the coronavirus.Hicks, who serves as counselor to the president and traveled with him to a rally Wednesday, tested positive Thursday, according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private health information. She is the closest aide to Trump to test positive so far.The White House did not immediately respond to multiple questions about the last time Trump was tested and whether he and other staffers who spent time with Hicks in recent days will be asked to quarantine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump traveled Thursday to New Jersey for a fundraiser. His social media director Dan Scavino and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany were originally set to join him, but were replaced at the last minute by other aides.In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, “The President takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”“White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting Covid-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the President is traveling,” Deere said.Hicks traveled with the president multiple times this week, including aboard Marine One, the presidential helicopter, to a rally in Minnesota Wednesday, and aboard Air Force One to Tuesday night’s first presidential debate.Hicks, one of the president’s most trusted aides, previously served as White House communications director and rejoined the administration this year ahead of the election. Her positive test was first reported by Bloomberg News.Multiple White House staffers have tested positive for the virus, including Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, national security adviser Robert O’Brien, and one of the president’s personal valets.After earlier positive cases close to the president, the White House instituted a daily testing regimen for the president’s senior aides. Others who will be in close proximity to the president and vice president, including reporters, are also tested every day.While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have been in close contact with someone with Covid-19 quarantine for 14 days, White House staffers are considered essential workers. CDC’s guidelines for exposed essential workers allows them to return to work if they take precautions, including taking their temperature before going into work, wearing a mask at all times and practicing social distancing.Trump, the White House and his campaign have flouted other CDC guidelines and recommendations from public health officials, and largely refused to wear masks or practice social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-trump-aide-hope-hicks-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-lzax7tusrjM7QvcRWZmQMP.html
02-10-2020||World||Will no longer remain quiet on ‘dual accountability standards’ in Pakistan: Nawaz Sharif||Former Prime Minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Thursday said that he would no longer remain quiet on the “dual standards” of accountability in Pakistan. Addressing a PML-N meeting through a video link from London, he said, “Nawaz Sharif is not made of the kind of stuff that can remain quiet on dual standards of accountability.”Sharif said that although Prime Minister Imran Khan is to blame for the country’s current state, “it is those who brought him into power who are truly responsible”.In response to Sharif’s recent speeches criticizing the government, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) on Thursday banned the broadcast and rebroadcast of any speech, interview or public address of absconders or proclaimed offenders.Pakistan’s regulatory body banned the broadcasting of content including commentary, opinions or suggestions about the potential fate of sub-judice matter.“If licensee fails to comply with the aforementioned directives, the authority shall take action under Section 29 and 30 of PEMRA Ordinance which may result in the imposition of fine and suspension/revocation of licence,” the court order was quoted by The Express Tribune.Moreover, a Pakistan court on Thursday ordered authorities to seize Sharif’s assets during a hearing of a case filed by the country’s anti-graft body National Accountability Bureau (NAB).Dawn reported that the accountability watchdog filed a record of Sharif’s “moveable and immoveable properties” as had been earlier directed by the court.These developments come after Islamabad High Court (IHC) had slammed the former Prime Minister on Wednesday over his failure to appear before the court after permission was granted to fly abroad to get medical treatment in November last year.“Accused [Sharif] knows that he went abroad after defeating the system. He must be laughing at the system while sitting abroad. It’s shameful conduct by the accused,” Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was quoted as saying by The Express Tribune.Pakistan has fast-tracked the process to bring back PML-N leader from London, where he had been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds.PM Imran Khan on Tuesday tasked relevant authorities with bringing back Sharif at the earliest. The decision was taken during a cabinet meeting where the Prime Minister also issued the directive to pursue the matter vigorously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-no-longer-remain-quiet-on-dual-accountability-standards-in-pakistan-nawaz-sharif/story-XgCUhtZqySyARAvBinORpL.html
02-10-2020||World||China threatens global economy, health by exploiting natural resources: US||The Chinese people have suffered the worst environmental impacts, however, it is Beijing who threatens the global economy by exploiting natural resources through its One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative, according to United States State Department.“Despite the Chinese Communist Party’s claims of a zero-tolerance policy towards illegal fishing, Chinese vessels routinely violate the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of other coastal states, fish without permission, and overfish licensing agreements,” US State Department said.In a report titled ‘China’s Environmental Abuses Fact Sheet’, State Department said: “Beijing is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases; the largest source of marine debris; the worst perpetrators of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing; and the world’s largest consumer of trafficked wildlife and timber products. While the Chinese people have suffered the worst environmental impacts of its actions, Beijing also threatens the global economy and global health by unsustainably exploiting natural resources and exporting its willful disregard for the environment through its One Belt One Road initiative.”Further talking about the OBOR project, more commonly known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the report states that it “aspires to create a network of enhanced overland and maritime trade routes to better link China with the world. However, the implementation of BRI lacks clear environmental guidelines, safety standards, and worker protections”.“Many BRI-funded projects do not meet international standards, leaving countries to deal with the harmful consequences long after a project is completed. Environmental safeguards depend on the laws of host countries, and Beijing is leading nations away from developing their economies sustainably,” the report further added. The report also raised concerns about China’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, as the country has been the world’s largest annual greenhouse gas emitter since 2006. “China’s total emissions are twice that of the United States and nearly one-third of all emissions globally,” it said. Besides, China is also the world’s largest consumer of legal and illegal wildlife, and it has been identified as a Focus Country under the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-global-economy-health-by-exploiting-natural-resources-us/story-B14L9yMi9rDdLQnNKkOwEP.html
02-10-2020||World||Trump moves Wisconsin rally amid surge in Covid-19 cases||President Donald Trump moved a planned western Wisconsin appearance to elsewhere in the state amid calls from a city mayor and the state’s governor, both Democrats, that he not hold a rally there due to a surge in coronavirus cases.The director of the La Crosse airport said the event was canceled due to a lease issue, not concerns over the coronavirus.Wisconsin ranks third among states for per-capita increases in cases over the past two weeks. State health officials reported 2,887 newly confirmed cases on Thursday, a new daily record, along with 21 more deaths. The state has now seen 125,161 cases and 1,348 deaths since the pandemic began.Trump replaced the La Crosse rally with one in Janesville about 175 miles away where the virus is not spreading quite as rapidly. He’s also holding a rally Saturday in Green Bay. Both will be outside at airports. Trump’s decision to visit Janesville prompted authorities there to also request that Trump reconsider.Both La Crosse and Green Bay have been identified as a “red zone” for community spread of Covid-19 by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Janesville is not on the list.The coronavirus task force report urged social distancing in “red zones” to the “maximum degree possible.” Trump rallies typically draw many thousands of people, who crowd closely together, shouting and cheering -- the vast majority without masks.A political rally violated the terms of the La Crosse airport’s lease with Colgan Air Service, which planned to host the rally, airport director Ian Turner said.“The tenant was notified of this, disagreed with the City of La Crosse’ position, but opted not to host the event,” Turner said in a statement. Kelly Colgan Hammen, president of the private air service where the rally was to be held, did not immediately return a message.“The tenant was notified of this, disagreed with the City of La Crosse’ position, but opted not to host the event,” Turner said in a statement. He did not identify who the tenant was.Trump made a similar move last month, changing his plans for large airport rallies in Nevada after local officials warned they would violate the state’s ban on gatherings of more than 50 people. There is no statewide limit on gatherings in Wisconsin after Republicans successfully challenged the Democratic governor’s “safer at home” order this spring.State and local health officials in Wisconsin urged attendees to follow local guidelines but stopped short of asking Trump not to come.A collaborative of health care organizations in La Crosse, including Gundersen Health System, Mayo Clinic Health System and La Crosse County, recommends that people avoid anyplace where people aren’t wearing masks or physical distancing. They also recommend limiting outdoor gatherings to no more than 100 people.“Masks and physical distancing should be required,” according to guidance released Wednesday by the health collaborative. “Venues should consider cancelling or rescheduling any large gatherings planned for the next 14 days.”As of Thursday, La Crosse County had reported 3,205 cases and three deaths. The state listed the activity level of Covid-19 as “very high.”Brown County, where Green Bay is located, has had 9,796 cases and 66 deaths. The number of positive cases over the past two weeks was up 24%, according to the state Department of Health Services.In Rock County, where Janesville is located, virus activity is listed as “high,” one level lower than Brown and La Crosse counties.Rock County Board Chairwoman Kara Purviance said in a statement that the county is seeing its highest number of active cases yet, and she hoped Trump would reconsider. But if the rally proceeds, she said, she urges residents to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks.Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said he hoped Trump would cancel his visit to the state. If Trump holds a rally in Wisconsin he should insist his supporters wear masks and not let them in if they refuse, the governor said.“He can control this,” Evers said.Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt defended the president coming to Wisconsin, saying his supporters get energized by his in-person appearances.“We’re going to take precautions,” Hitt said. “We’re going to make sure we have masks, we’re going to encourage people to wear masks. ... We need to make sure we’re open and tell people, ‘Look if you think you’ve been exposed please do not come.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-moves-wisconsin-rally-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-hnhXPP8RIJlaW4NpODSiTJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Nearly 20,000 Amazon workers in US tested positive for Covid-19||Amazon said Thursday that nearly 20,000 of its front-line US workers have tested positive or been presumed positive for the virus that causes Covid-19.But the online retail behemoth, revealing the data for the first time, said that the infection rate of its employees was well below that seen in the general US population. The disclosure comes after months of pressure from Amazon workers and labour groups calling for the company to divulge the Cpvid-19 numbers.Amazon said in a corporate blog that it provided the data as part of its effort to keep employees informed, and to share details and best practices with governments and other companies.”We hope other large companies will also release their detailed learnings and case rates because doing so will help all of us,” Amazon said. “This is not an arena where companies should compete — this is an arena where companies should help one another.”The Seattle-based company said that it examined data from March 1 to Sept. 19 on 1.37 million workers at Amazon and Whole Foods Market across the US.It said it compared the Covid-19 case rates to the general population, as reported by Johns Hopkins University for the same period. Based on that analysis, if the rate among Amazon and Whole Foods employees were the same as that for the general population, it estimated it would have seen 33,952 cases among its workforce. That is 42% higher that Amazon’s actual rate.The company also said it is conducting thousands of tests a day, which will grow to 50,000 tests a day across 650 sites by November.Companies have no legal obligation to publicly reveal how many of their workers have contracted the virus, and few are doing so.Employers do have to provide a safe working environment, which means they must alert staff if they might have been exposed to the virus, according to guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency that enforces workplace safety. They are also obligated to keep track of Covid-19 infections contracted on the job, and must report to OSHA if there is a hospitalization or death related to the disease.A perceived lack of transparency has left workers at various retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, to become amateur sleuths in their spare time. Unions and advocate groups have taken up the cause, too, creating lists or building online maps of stores where workers can self-report cases they know about.Walmart had said in July that its Covid-19 cases track with the rest of the country, but didn’t explain why it doesn’t provide numbers.Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents grocery and meatpacking workers, called Amazon’s disclosure as “the most damning evidence we have seen that corporate America has completely failed to protect our country’s frontline workers in this pandemic.”UFCW is calling for immediate action by federal regulators and a full congressional investigation.“This titanic safety failure demands the highest level of scrutiny,” Perrone said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-20-000-amazon-workers-in-us-tested-positive-for-covid-19/story-pH2Ofv5RKHOSoP4luFnuYL.html
02-10-2020||World||US Senate panel moves to compel Facebook, Google, Twitter CEOs to testify||A Senate panel voted Thursday to compel testimony from the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter as lawmakers opened a new front in the battle over hate speech, misinformation and perceived political bias on social media a month before the presidential election.The Senate Commerce Committee authorized subpoenas for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to force them to appear at a planned hearing if they do not agree to do so voluntarily.The executives’ testimony is needed “to reveal the extent of influence that their companies have over American speech during a critical time in our democratic process,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who heads the committee.The committee’s unanimous vote marked the start of a new bipartisan initiative against Big Tech companies, which have been under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from state attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech.Facebook, meanwhile, is expanding restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. The new prohibitions laid out in a blog post come days after President Donald Trump raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process during a debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden.A new review by The Associated Press found that Facebook and Twitter still aren’t enforcing even the limited restrictions they’ve recently put in place to stem the tide of dangerous material from QAnon, with an audience of millions on their platforms. The two companies had promised to stop encouraging the growth of the baseless conspiracy theory, which fashions Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and government officials.A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on the committee’s subpoena action. Representatives of Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.With Trump leading the way, conservative Republicans have kept up a barrage of criticism of Silicon Valley’s social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative views.The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms, putting down a legislative marker in Trump’s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.At a White House event last week, officials said the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Attorney General William Barr said the administration will also seek legislation to let individuals pursue legal claims against online platforms for “bad-faith censorship.”Democrats, on the other hand, have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists.The three CEOs are being summoned to testify as the Justice Department moves toward antitrust action against Google with a focus on the company’s dominance in online search and whether it was used to stifle competition and hurt consumers.A bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also has been investigating Google’s business practices. They have cited “potential monopolistic behavior.”Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell ads.Facebook, Amazon and Apple have also been targets of sweeping antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.In the House, a judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan investigation of Big Tech’s market dominance. Zuckerberg and Pichai as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook testified at a highly charged hearing by the panel in July.The subcommittee, which is expected to issue a report on its findings soon, held a hearing Thursday at which experts discussed proposals to strengthen the antitrust laws and promote competition among Big Tech companies.Speaking of the July hearing with the four CEOs, panel chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said, “We pressed them for answers about their business practices, including about the evidence we uncovered that they have exploited, entrenched and expanded their power in anti-competitive and abusive ways.”“To put it simply, their answers were evasive,” Cicilline said. “Änd they raised new questions about whether they believe their companies are beyond oversight.”__Follow Gordon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mgordonap||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-moves-to-compel-facebook-google-twitter-ceos-to-testify/story-hHns4RkB7jIwhbAjuWC4CJ.html
02-10-2020||World||Critical moment, says PM Johnson, as new Covid-19 cases surge||After months of low numbers of new cases and deaths, a new real-time study showed higher prevalence of the coronavirus across the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson describing the situation as a “critical moment”. As of Wednesday evening, 7,108 new cases were reported across the UK – more than the daily peaks in April and May, prompting renewed concern and more restrictions in several areas, particularly in north England.Facing criticism from Labour over the government’s handling of the pandemic, Johnson implored people to follow guidelines, as they did earlier this year, when the virus was suppressed for months, before resurging in September.Another national lockdown remains an option, he declared.As government’s top experts cautioned about “things going in the wrong direction”, Johnson said: “(No) matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this, and that’s by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others”.“At this critical moment, when I know people will be wanting to know the details, I will be providing regular updates through these press conferences. And I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now”.Johnson adopted a markedly different approach from that of chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week exhorted Britons to “learn to live with it (coronavirus) and live without fear”, while outlining new measures to protect millions of jobs affected by the pandemic.Johnson said: “I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course, despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say, I profoundly disagree”.“And I don’t think it’s what the British people want, I don’t think they want to throw in the sponge, they want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do,” he added.Researchers at Imperial College London said an interim report from the largest testing programme has found high infection prevalence across the UK and that cases have continued to rise, based on results from swab tests carried out by more than 80,000 people out of a total of 150,000, taken between September 18 and 26.The biggest rise in cases was found in those aged over 65, which saw seven times as many cases as previously. A similar increase was found in those aged between 55-64. Young people continued to have the highest rates of infection, with 1 in 100 estimated to have the virus.The reproduction (R) number decreased from 1.7 to 1.1 but with a wide possible range for the recent value of 0.7 to 1.5. This suggests that the rate of new infections has decreased, but an R above 1 would mean cases will continue to rise if current trends continue.Paul Elliott, director of the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT 1) at the college, said: “While our latest findings show some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working, the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date”.“This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease and the public’s adherence to these, which will be vital to minimise further significant illness and loss of life from Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/critical-moment-says-pm-johnson-as-new-covid-19-cases-surge/story-ZHwzGuEPqMWUdMGjc76GzN.html
02-10-2020||World||Navalny blames Putin, Kremlin links him with CIA||The Kremlin on Thursday accused opposition politician Alexei Navalny of working with the CIA after Navalny said he believed President Vladimir Putin was behind the suspected poisoning that put him in a coma in Germany.The accusation from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appears to be the first time the Russian authorities have directly accused Putin’s highest-profile critic of working with a foreign intelligence agency.It raises the stakes should Navalny fulfil a pledge to return to Russia, and may add to pressure on Western leaders, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to take action over his case.Navalny responded by saying he would sue Peskov over the accusation, challenging him to present evidence to back it up. His aide Lyubov Sobol called the allegation “complete gibberish”.Navalny, 44, emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill in during a flight in Siberia and being air-lifted to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with novichok, a rare Russian nerve agent.“I believe that Putin is behind the crime and I don’t have any other versions of what happened,” Navalny told Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine in an interview published on Thursday.Peskov said Navalny’s allegations against Putin were unacceptable, groundless and insulting.“It’s not the patient working with Western intelligence, it’s Western intelligence working with him. That would be more accurate. There is such information. I can even say definitely - specialists of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency are working with him currently,” the Kremlin spokesman said.In response, Navalny wrote on his website: “Firstly, I am suing Peskov.”“And secondly, I demand the publication of proof and facts, demonstrating my ‘work with CIA specialists’. Show it on television at prime time. You have my permission.”You know you are dyingGermany and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny’s illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.In a separate development, Russian news agency RIA said Moscow had invited experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to come to Russia to cooperate on the Navalny case.Germany requested the OPCW’s assistance last month. Russia has criticised both Berlin and the agency for what it says is their refusal to share information.Navalny has posted on social media about his recovery, but the interview with Der Spiegel was the first he has given to a major news organisation since regaining consciousness.He told Der Spiegel he would return to Russia.“My task is now to remain fearless. And I have no fear! If my hands are shaking, it’s because of the poison, not out of fear. I will not give Putin the gift of not returning,” he said.Describing the moment that the poison began to take effect, Navalny said: “You don’t feel any pain but you know you’re dying.” He said he was making a steady recovery and was now relearning how to balance on one leg.Navalny has tormented the Kremlin for years with online videos in which he details the lavish lifestyles and undeclared wealth of senior officials he castigates as “swindlers and thieves”.In a country where opposition figures have little access to traditional politics, his anti-corruption campaign has become one of the few successful outlets for popular discontent. He and his wife are now living in a rented flat in Berlin, but he said he would only resume posting videos once he was back in Russia. “I do not want to be the opposition leader in exile.”The politician, who was visited at his hospital bedside by Merkel, said he felt a personal bond to Germany and was impressed by Merkel’s knowledge of Russia.“My impression is that Merkel needs no advice from me,” he said. “But any Russia strategy must account for the depth of madness that Putin has now reached.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-alexei-navalny-accuses-vladimir-putin-of-being-behind-poisoning/story-QZhNgiKtUs5RGy9K66EH6I.html

The UP Police has been accused by the victim’s family of forcibly cremating her in the middle of the night earlier this week, and access to the town and the family have been cut off for the media and opposition leaders. District officials have contended that they have consent from the woman’s family, but the manner in which the developments took place have raised questions over the conduct of the administration and law enforcement. Priyanka Gandhi joined hundreds of people, including Congress leaders PL Punia, Sushmita Dev, Anil Choudhary and BV Srinivas, in solidarity with the 19-year-old woman. Priyanka Gandhi told reporters that she was at the event to express her condolences and offer prayers for the deceased. “We are all here to ensure that the girl gets justice. We will pressure the government to get her justice,” she said. “Her family has got no help from the state government. They must feel they are all alone. We are holding the prayer meeting for them. They should know that they are not alone and fight the injustice being done to them. We will put political pressure and every woman in this country must put moral pressure on the government,” she added. All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said it is the women of this country who will take down the National Democratic Alliance government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “As the Mahila Congress, we have to take the lead and protest against this injustice,” Dev said.Delhi Congress chief Choudhary said that the party will work relentlessly to ensure the family gets justice. “Every day, there are at least 10 incidents of rape in UP. Why are Rahul ji and Priyanka ji not being allowed to meet the family? They are silencing democracy and we will not stand for it.” Youth Congress chief BV Srinivas said that the PM and the UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) must resign. “They have not said a word all this time, they must take responsibility and be held accountable.”“It is unfortunate that a humanitarian issue is being politicised. The government is already taking action that is needed,” said Sanjay Mayukh, national spokesperson of the BJP.On Thursday, Priyanka Gandhi and her brother Rahul Gandhi were briefly arrested as they tried to visit Hathras on the grounds that there was a ban on public assembly in the town. The UP Police took them to a guest house at the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida before escorting them back to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-rest-until-hathras-family-gets-justice-priyanka-gandhi/story-HOuQ74jOQIndOe1gP2QasI.html
02-10-2020||India||Thakur mahapanchayat held in Hathras||AGRA: Members from Brahmin and Thakur communities held a mahapanchayat or mega gathering on Friday roughly two kilometres from the village in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district where a Dalit teenager was gangraped and murdered, and demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the high-profile incident.Despite prohibitory orders in the area, members of the upper-caste communities gathered at Baghna village and claimed that all four accused men -- Sandip Singh, Ramu, Lavkush Sikarwar and Ravi -- were innocent. The four men, who all belong to the dominant Thakur caste, have been arrested. At the gathering, members threatened to launch an agitation unless hte accused were released. The members also referred to comments by the Uttar Pradesh additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar and Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar, who had cited the forensic lab report to reject charges that the 19-year-old Dalit woman was raped . “There was representation of all in the mahapanchayat. We demand a CBI probe into the matter, besides narco test of members of the accused and the victim’s families so that the actual culprit gets punishment. The forensic science lab has not confirmed gang rape, thus all four (accused) should be released,” said Sumant Kishore Singh, the representative of chief of Hasayan block. Singh went from door to door to gather support of the upper castes on the issue.“We will meet members of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on Saturday and apprise them of the truth. If we do not get justice even then, a bigger agitation will be called,” said an upper caste member who attended the mahapanchayat, which began on Friday morning. The state government has formed a three-member SIT to probe the case and the district administration has claimed that the matter will be heard in a fast- track court.The victim belonged to the Valmiki (Dalit) community and had named four accused for brutalising and gang raping her.She was gang raped and brutalised on September 14. After battling for life at JN Medical College in Aligarh, she was shifted to New Delhi on September 28 and died at Safdarjung Hospital the next day.Initially, a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (attempt to murder) was registered against only one accused. Thereafter, Section 354 (attempt to outrage modesty) was added. Finally, a case of gang rape (376D) was registered against the four accused, all of whom are in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thakur-mahapanchayat-held-in-hathras/story-FbgQWs89QTBGJf3KiX0nbJ.html

Minister for municipal administration Botsa Satyanarayana, chief secretary Neelam Sawhney, director-general of Police Gautam Sawang, MLA Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy and other senior officials also joined Jagan in clapping for five minutes.Also read: India encourages indigenous vaccine production, says PM ModiAll YSRC MPs, MLAs, party leaders and government officials from village level to the state level, besides common people, came out of their respective offices and residences to take part in the clapping programme.In his message to the people in the afternoon, Jagan called upon the people to display their symbolic appreciation to the village secretaries and volunteers by clapping their hands on the occasion of completion of one year of the village secretariat concept.State panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said the symbolic gesture of clapping would give a big boost to the village secretariat employees and village volunteers who have been rendering selfless services to the people.He said the concept was launched to bring the administration to the doorsteps of the common man. As many as 543 services were being provided through these village secretariats as part of providing corruption-free administration in the state.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Central cabinet secretary also lauded the village secretariat concept,” the minister claimed.Around 1.26 lakh village secretaries have been appointed to administer these 11,158 village secretariats and 3,786 ward secretariats (as they are called in urban areas), besides, the government also appointed over 2.8 lakh village and ward volunteers to take the services to the doorsteps of the beneficiaries.While each village secretary is paid a monthly salary of Rs 15,000, each village volunteer appointed on an outsourcing basis is given a monthly remuneration of Rs 5,000. In all, each village/ward secretariat comprises 10-12 employees working under various wings of the government including panchayat raj and rural development, revenue, medical and health, animal husbandry, power, agriculture and social welfare in rural areas and municipal services in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/following-cm-jagan-s-call-lakhs-of-people-participate-in-clapping-programme/story-IrYJJhAaflyoXCUWhCuu5K.html
02-10-2020||India||India, Germany to hold talks on October 6 on resumption of flights||Germany said on Friday it will hold talks with India on October 6 on how to resume passenger flight operations between the two countries. “We have received signals that India is also interested in a quick and satisfactory solution for both sides,” the German Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI) told PTI. On Tuesday, Lufthansa had announced cancellation of all “planned flights” between India and Germany from September 30 to October 20 because of an “unexpected rejection” of its flight schedule by the Indian authorities. Air India on Thursday cancelled all 12 flights between Frankfurt and India till October 14 because Germany withdrew its permission to operate them. In response to queries sent by the PTI, the BMVI stated it and the Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation are “confirmed to hold bilateral talks on October 6 through video conference”. “The aim is to find a solution on how to restore civil air transport between Germany and India in the spirit of the existing air transport agreement between our two countries,” it added. In response to question on what is the way forward to resolve the situation, the BMVI said it “does not want to anticipate the bilateral talks”. “In the light of our long history of good aviation relations, we are convinced that we can reach a mutually beneficial solution. We have received signals that India is also interested in a quick and satisfactory solution for both sides,” it added. Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, special flights have been permitted under “air bubble” arrangements India has formed with 16 countries, including Germany. Few hours after Lufthansa’s announcement on Tuesday on the cancellation of flights, Indian aviation regulator DGCA had said there are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa. “As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity, we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) noted. Asked to comment on DGCA’s observation about “inequitable distribution of traffic”, the BMVI said on Friday that the German authorities, like Indian authorities, have adopted special entry requirements due to the coronavirus pandemic and they are applicable regardless of which airline is carrying passengers into Germany. “German airlines and their passengers must also comply with the regulations. Even in the crisis situation, the German authorities have in principle not restricted the frequencies approved for the 2020 summer flight schedule,” the BMVI added. Lufthansa said on Tuesday it had applied for continuation of the special flights it was allowed to operate until the end of September but would now have to cancel them because of the “unexpected rejection”. The German carrier said it “sincerely urges” Indian authorities to work together with the German government to establish a temporary travel agreement between both countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-germany-to-hold-talks-on-october-6-on-resumption-of-flights/story-wNFKmOZMXfERhCaLDeKvRN.html

Our daughters need you and we are all with you,” Kailash Satyarthi tweeted.The social reformer’s tweet came in the wake of protests against the gang-rape and torture of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’ Hathras. The victim succumbed to her injuries in New Delhi’s Safdarjang Hospital on Tuesday.Meanwhile, a day after PM Modi sought strict action against the gang-rape culprits, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath ordered the suspension of Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir and two other police officials for their handling of the case. “Narco-analysis polygraph tests” would also be conducted on everyone involved in the case, he said.Opposition parties have called upon PM Modi to break his silence over the brutal rape of the woman. “The PM washes the feet of Dalits before elections but remains quiet when a Dalit daughter of Uttar Pradesh is brutally raped. We will organise a protest at India Gate at 5pm today. The PM will have to give us answers,” Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad said in a video message on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobel-laureate-kailash-satyarthi-urges-pm-modi-to-end-crisis-of-justice-amid-outrage-over-hathras-case/story-ZNhq0h8lHjsGQyDtdAijIL.html
02-10-2020||India||Hathras, Bhadohi incidents bolster TMC’s agenda to win back BJP’s Dalit votes in Bengal||Back to back killing of Dalit women in Uttar Pradesh has added a twist to caste politics in West Bengal with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) seeing an opportunity to reach out to backward class voters who supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in several of the 18 Lok Sabha seats the party won in 2019. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will hit the streets in Kolkata on Saturday to raise the issue and target the BJP. This will be her first rally since the Covid-19 pandemic began in March. TMC leaders will hold protests in every community block in the districts. The campaign started on Friday afternoon when the TMC’s media cell in Bengal crowded the social media with videos of its four MPs grappling with policemen about a kilometre away from the Hathras victim’s village. The team was led by TMC Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien and included Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar. Also read: Yogi Adityanath suspends Hathras SP, wants narco-analysis testsHowever, it was the presence of the Joynagar Lok Sabha MP Pratima Mondal and former Bongaon Lok Sabha MP Mamata Bala Thakur and their heated exchange with the UP police that had a political significance in West Bengal. While Mondal belongs to the scheduled caste community, Thakur is a member of the Matua community, which is part of Bengal’s Dalit population. Both alleged that they were manhandled. “The team was sent by our leader Mamata Banerjee,” said a senior TMC leader who did not want to be named. Once treated as untouchables, the ancestors of the majority of the Namasudras (Dalits) in the state originally hailed from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and migrated to West Bengal after 1947 to escape religious persecution. There are about 10 million people from the Namasudra community in Bengal. During the 2011 census, Bengal’s population stood at 91.3 million. Part of this Dalit population is the Matua community which is headed by its supreme body, All India Matua Mahasangha. The Mahasangha played host to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally at Thakurnagar in North 24-Parganas district before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Contesting on a BJP ticket, the sect’s young face, Shantanu Thakur, defeated his aunt, TMC’s Mamata Bala Thakur, at the Bongaon seat. After Partition, the Matuas relocated to West Bengal and became the state’s second-most influential scheduled caste community with an estimated population of more than three million. Also read: Allow politicians in Hathras, tweets ‘elder sister’ Uma Bharti to YogiAccording to estimates by ruling and opposition parties, the Dalit communities can influence poll results in more than 50 of the states’ 294 assembly seats. Most of these seats are located in districts along the India-Bangladesh border.  Horrors continue, yet the "CHOWKIDARS" are asleep. Now, Bhadohi witnesses a vicious act of violence with another young-dalit girl, ironically on the eve of Non-violence day.This is @BJP4India’s Uttar Pradesh — where the rule of law ends & the rule of upper-caste savages begins. pic.twitter.com/SS2Mob4eDqChief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee took the lead in targeting the BJP even before the TMC team tried to reach Hathras. “Horrors continue, yet the “CHOWKIDARS” are asleep. Now, Bhadohi witnesses a vicious act of violence with another young-dalit girl, ironically on the eve of Non-violence day. This is @BJP4India’s Uttar Pradesh — where the rule of law ends & the rule of upper-caste savages begins,” he tweeted. “What a shame @narendramodi ji that an @AITCofficial Lok Sabha MP & representative of the SC community Pratima Mondal was manhandled by male officers of @Uppolice. HAS IT BECOME A TREND IN UP TO DISRESPECT SC WOMEN @myogiadityanath? #ShameOnYogi #HathrasHorror #DalitLivesMatter,” tweeted the TMC. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh refused to give any importance to the TMC’s agitation. “This is drama. Hundreds of women are raped and murdered in Bengal but no TMC leader cares to visit their homes,” Ghosh said at a rally held in support of the farm bills. The BJP leader, however, condemned the Hathras incident, saying the culprits should be punished. The backward class vote bank is crucial for both the TMC and the BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls, a ruling party leader said on condition of anonymity. Before the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP, which always had a refugee cell, carried out an extensive campaign on the then proposed citizenship law in Bengal to reach out to Hindus who left Bangladesh as refugees. Realising the importance of this vote bank, the TMC too launched its refugee cell in January this year. The cell now has units in all districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-bhadohi-incidents-bolster-tmc-s-agenda-to-win-back-bjp-s-dalit-votes-in-bengal/story-qUwHZfXOPyEwqqBrJTe30K.html

The PM was inaugurating the Vaishvik Bharatiya Vaigyanik (VAIBHAV) Summit 2020 — a virtual summit of national and international researchers.“In 2014, four new vaccines were introduced in our immunisation programme. This included an indigenously developed Rotavirus vaccine. Recently, we also gave market authorisation for an indigenously developed pneumococcal vaccine. We encourage indigenous vaccine production,” the PM said. ““We broke inertia in the system. The long break in vaccine production was broken in 2014,” the PM said.“Our vaccine developers are active and globally competitive during this pandemic. Time is of the essence and we have committed to eliminate tuberculosis from India by 2025 , five years ahead of the deadline,” PM Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-encourages-indigenous-vaccine-production-says-pm-modi/story-hP8iHQqXzbUuBkmoX4aCXK.html
02-10-2020||India||PM Modi running his govt in atmosphere of ‘fear’, says Sonia Gandhi||Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on Friday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging he is running his government in an atmosphere of “fear”.On Gandhi Jayanti, she also invoked the Father of the Nation, to assail the government which, she claimed, swears by his name but demolishes his ideals through its actions.The Congress leader also accused the Centre of having weakened laws like MNREGA and Right to Information (RTI) Act which her party’s government had enacted to protect the interests of common people.“Some people swear by Gandhi jis name but demolish his ideals and principles through their actions. Anarchy, atrocity and mistreatment prevail everywhere. An environment of discrimination has been created in the society where atrocities are being inflicted on innocent people,” she said.She was virtually addressing a ‘Gandhi Chetna Rally’ at Congress party office in Motihari, the headquarters of East Champaran district in Bihar, to mark the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.It was in Champaran where Gandhi had experimented with ‘Satyagraha’ for the first time in India. It would later become his most potent weapon in the fight against the British rule.“Enough is enough. I would like to say that some people are running the government by creating an atmosphere of emotion, confusion and fear (bhavna, bhram aur bhay). You (people) need to remain alert and cautious and take the right decisions, she said.“We have to fight it out together and that will be our real tribute to Gandhi ji.” The Congress leader also unveiled a life-size statue of the Mahatma, and asserted his ideals are the “soul and spirit” of her party.In her speech, which many saw as the launch of her party’s campaign for the Bihar elections, the process of which has already started, Sonia Gandhi said the common man was always at the centre of Congress’s welfare programmes.“But whenever the Congress tries to work for the development of the poor, certain forces stand up against the party for their vested interest,” she alleged.She said the Modi government first ridiculed the MNREGA, the UPA government’s rural livelihood scheme, but later continued with it.“Just imagine what could have happened if there was no MNREGA during the Covid pandemic? People in large numbers would have starved,” she asserted.She also drew a parallel between the times when Mahatma Gandhi launched Champaran Satyagraha for the farmers, who were being forced by the British to grow indigo, and now when agriculturists were up in arms against the new farm laws.“A handful of people are getting richer, while millions are losing their livelihood,” she said.The Congress leader said lakhs of youth were losing jobs as small industries were closing down and big public sector undertakings being privatised.The RTI Act introduced by the previous Congress government for bringing in greater transparency in governance has been diluted, she alleged.“You keep asking questions through RTI but will not get suitable replies,” she said.She said several laws enacted by the UPA governments for the welfare of women, workers, the health and education sectors, have been “weakened”.“The weakening of these laws has deprived people of their rights,” she asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-running-his-govt-in-atmosphere-of-fear-says-sonia-gandhi/story-otN9G6OiPGPKmRb9QEvwwK.html

The chief minister took the decision on the basis of an initial report of the special investigation team set up to look into the case, a statement by the Uttar Pradesh government said.Also Read: Hathras gang-rape case: UP cops barricade village to stop media, Oppn from meeting familyThe government also decided that “narco-analysis polygraph tests” would be conducted on everyone involved in the case. This decision is expected to include the rape victim’s family as well, particularly in context of the state government’s autopsy report that contradicted the victim’s allegation that she had been gang-raped on 14 September.Watch | Hathras case: UP CM Adityanath suspends SP, ordered narco-analysis tests The 19-year-old died on Tuesday and according to her family, she was cremated past midnight under alleged pressure from the district administration. This allegation had provoked the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court to take cognisance of the case. The judges will hear the case on 12 October.Also Read: Uma Bharti tweets some advice on handling Hathras case to Yogi AdityanathThe UP government’s statement said the Hathras police chief Vikrant Vir was being placed under suspension for “negligence and tardy investigations”. Also to be suspended are the circle officer Ram Shabd, inspector Dinesh Kumar Varma, senior sub-inspector Jagvir Singh and head constable Mahesh Pal.The chief minister had earlier ordered the special investigation team led by home secretary Bhagwan Swarup to submit its probe report within seven days. But the SIT appears to have been told to come up with a preliminary version in face of escalating protests after the woman’s rushed cremation.The action against the police officers handling the investigation is seen as an expression of the government’s displeasure at the police officers letting the situation get out of hand and signal that the administration was responsive to the many concerns expressed around the probe.Also Watch| Hathras case: UP CM Adityanath suspends SP, ordered narco-analysis tests The announcement was preceded by Yogi Adityanath’s tweet earlier in the day that pledged to ensure exemplary punishment for the guilty in crimes against women.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party promptly praised the chief minister for the action. “I welcome the suspension of senior #Police officials from #Hathrus,” BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal tweeted.There is some concern within the BJP over the opposition’s strident campaign over the Hathras incident to build a narrative that projects the BJP to be anti-Dalit but the party is expected to tread carefully so that it does not alienate its traditional support base.Also Read: 2 km from Hathras village, mahapanchayat demands release of accused and a CBI probeThe narco-analysis on all parties concerned including the police officers involved in the probe is seen to be part of this balancing act.The opposition is unlikely to tone down its attacks on the government after the suspensions. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted a fresh attack at Yogi Adityanath soon after news of the suspensions emerged, wondering what would change by suspending “a few pawns”. The Congress leader, who along with brother Rahul Gandhi had been prevented from reaching the Hathras village where the victim’s family lives, said the chief minister was trying to shift blame and the government must reveal the phone records of the district magistrate and SP to ascertain who had been issuing instructions to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-suspends-hathras-sp-2-others-after-sit-report/story-xNRjVQpmXAaZvhDsO1lxTP.html

They also demanded a CBI probe. The accused have been arrested and all of them belong to the so-called upper castes.The mahapanchayat threatened to launch an agitation if the accused are not released and also referred to the report of the Agra Forensic Science Lab. On Thursday, additional director general of police (law and order) Prashant Kumar and Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar had quoted the report of the forensic science lab to deny the gang rape. “There was representation of all in the mahapanchayat. We demand a CBI probe into the matter, besides the narco test of the accused and the victim’s families so that the actual culprit gets punished. The forensic science lab has not confirmed gang rape, thus all four (accused) should be released,” said Sumant Kishore Singh, representative of Hasayan block.

The operators of these activities have started taking bookings followed by the ease of restrictions on the incoming of tourists in the state under Unlock-5. Excited with the queries and bookings, the operators say that the response from the tourists after reopening was more than expected. Devendra Gosain of Jumpin Heights adventure sports in Rishikesh said, “We are happy to reopen for the tourists after a gap of about six months in the pandemic.” Gosain said that on the first day of reopening on Friday they received 30 bookings for bungee jumping which was “more than expected”. “We had thought that if we get 10 bookings on Friday it will be enough for us considering the present situation in the pandemic. However, till Friday evening we got 30 people enjoying the bungee jumping sport. We are happy with the start,” said Gosain. Gosain, however, added that not many people know that adventure sports have restarted in Rishikesh. “After the ease in restrictions, people are coming to visit the town which is the capital of adventure sports in India. But not many know that bungee jumping and other adventure sports have restarted. Most of our customers came to know about it from the locals,” said Gosain adding that they are following all the Covid-19 precautions - like social distancing and sanitising of the safety harness and other equipment.

He said, “Like a few days ago, water rafting was also restarted and is getting good response from the visitors, we are hopeful for these aforementioned adventure sports also.” “Friday was the first day but we hope the numbers will increase with time as the government has eased the restrictions on tourism activities in the state,” he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bungee-jumping-other-adventure-sports-kick-off-in-rishikesh-after-6-months/story-ZzJ7BVBdbkwguSDtD4VPNJ.html

Finally, in 2015 my acting break came in a mini-series, ‘Kabhi Aise Geet Gaya Karo’ and then there was no looking back,” she said. With TV shows like ‘Dahleez,’ ‘Krishnadasi,’ ‘Sasural Simar Ka’ and web series ‘Mind the Malhotras’, Nikki believes be it TV or web, an actor’s job is to live his or her character to its best. “For me acting was never a course. Instead it was my passion and I have learned it all live on sets under big names I was working with. So I enjoy both web and TV and want to be part of projects that have interesting stories to tell,” she said. With her maternal side in Najeebabad, UP, Nikki is a frequent flyer to the state. “I love my nani’s hometown. It helps unwind me after my exhausting work life. That’s a reason me and my mother visit the place almost every year.” Talking about her upcoming show, she said, “My show ‘Brahmarakshas’ will bring a unique and compelling narrative inspired by folklores. The show depicts the journey of an ordinary young girl, Kalindi whose life takes interesting twist and turns.” Other than acting, Nikki plans to pursue her graduation too and complete her studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/for-me-acting-was-always-a-passion/story-N74HNVroetu9cji51NtDdO.html

The deadline for the SIT probe ends on October 7.The Hathras woman was allegedly gang-raped and brutally tortured on September 14. She succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on Tuesday.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday had set-up the three-member SIT to probe the Hathras incident, they have been asked to submit the report in seven days. The SIT is headed by home secretary Bhagwan Swaroop. Its two other members are deputy inspector general Chandra Prakash and Commandant, PAC Agra, Poonam (who goes by one name).Social activist and lawyer Nutan Thakur said it was highly objectionable that police officials were denying rape when the investigation was still underway. It showed the premeditated attitude of the police investigators, she alleged.Thakur said senior police officials should properly analyse the facts before jumping to any conclusion during the course of the investigation in such a serious offence. She also questioned the delay in collecting samples for forensic examination as it could change the line of investigation.“Moreover, the victim’s statement recorded before death, during which she had alleged sexual assault, is crucial to the investigation,” she said.The statement denying rape also suggested that the police were trying to put pressure on the victim’s family, she alleged.A Lucknow-based senior forensic expert, requesting anonymity, questioned whether the victim’s sample was collected within a certain time period to ascertain whether she had been subjected to sexual assault.He asked whether the police preserved other evidence, like the clothes that the victim was wearing at the time of the crime and samples of her nails, as there was the maximum possibility that these could establish if she had been sexually assaulted or not.It is not yet confirmed whether the police preserved other evidence, like clothes and samples of her nails.“The state police have always lacked in forensic evidence of sexual assault,” he stated, questioning the police efficiency in handling such serious cases.He said DNA of semen would not be detected if the vaginal swab was collected a week after the rape or sexual assault. In this particular case, the sample was collected 10 days after the alleged rape on September 14, he added.He said the presence of semen on clothes could be detected lifelong.Additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar had stated that the samples for forensic examination were collected when the victim spoke about sexual assault at an Aligarh hospital and they (the samples) were sent to the Agra forensic science laboratory on September 25.On Thursday, ADG Kumar and Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar had denied rape on the basis of post-mortem examination and the report from Agra forensic science laboratory (FSL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-rape-claim-before-sit-report-in-hathras-case-raises-doubts-say-experts/story-5RbyeAmlDB012e2n2XlISI.html

02-10-2020||India||‘Won’t stop until justice done’: Priyanka Gandhi at prayer meet for UP woman||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Friday attended a prayer meet at the Valmiki temple in Delhi for the 19-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras. The woman succumbed to her injuries and died at a Delhi hospital earlier this week.The UP police are accused by the family of forcing the cremation of the woman in the dead of the night. District officials contended that they had consent from the woman’s family, but the manner in which the developments took place raised questions over the conduct of the administration and law enforcement. Priyanka joined hundreds of people, including senior Congress leaders PL Punia, Sushmita Dev, Anil Choudhary and BV Srinivas, who showed up in solidarity with the woman at the temple in the national capital. The Congress leader told those present that while she was there to express her condolences to the family, she would not rest until justice is done. “We are all here to ensure that that girl gets justice,” Priyanka said. “We will pressure the government to get her justice.” “Her family has got no help from the government. They must feel they are all alone. We are holding the prayer meeting for them. They should know that they are not alone and fight the injustice being done to them. We will put political pressure and every woman in this country must put moral pressure on the government,” she added. Priyanka also highlighted that the family has received no help from the government. “They weren’t even allowed to light the funeral pyre. It is not the culture of our country that the father and the brother don’t conduct the last rites. It is not the tradition of our country to cremate any one after sunset,” she said. “We have come here to offer our condolences, but more than that we are all here to ensure that the family and our sister gets justice. We will not stop until we get justice,” Priyanka asserted. All India Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev told Hindustan Times that it is the women of this country who will take down Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “As the Mahila Congress under the aegis of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, we have to take the lead and protest against this injustice,” Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev tells Hindustan Times. “It is the women of this country who will bring down Narendra Modi.” Delhi Pradesh Congress chief Choudhary told HT that the party will work relentlessly to ensure the victim’s family gets justice. “Priyanka ji has constantly been highlighting the problems faced by the people of Uttar Pradesh. Her suggestions have fallen on deaf ears. Every day there are at least 10 incidents of rape in that state. Why are Rahul ji and Priyanka ji not being allowed to meet the family? They are silencing democracy and we will not stand for it.” Youth Congress chief BV Srinivas said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the UP chief minister Yogi Aditynath must resign. “They have not said a word all this time, they must take responsibility and be held accountable,” he told HT. On Thursday, Priyanka Gandhi and her brother Rahul, the Congress says, were briefly arrested as they tried to visit Hathras. The UP police escorted them back to Delhi. Back in the village, scores of police personnel in and around the area have been deployed to prevent the entry of opposition leaders and the media. It is being seen as an attempt to scuttle the growing anger over the administration’s handling of the woman’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-stop-until-justice-done-priyanka-gandhi-at-prayer-meet-for-up-woman/story-x1JjKxaY9Fui8OQJ9JIRGJ.html

The CM’s disclosure came in his Rs 300 crore defamation suit filed against Dubey and two others in a Ranchi court.Godda parliamentarian, Dubey, in a series of tweets between July 27-29, had levelled sexual assault allegations against Soren. He had highlighted the seven-year-old ‘sexual harassment’ case lodged by a woman against Soren in Mumbai and alleged that Soren had then misused his office to settle the case.Dubey alleged that such an allegation against the chief minister was a shame on democracy. “Mumbai police should re-investigate the matter,” Dubey had tweeted on July 28.Reacting to Dubey’s comment, on July 29, Soren had tweeted that he would give a befitting reply to Dubey within 48 hours.Also read: Once a protege of KCR, retired professor wants to try his luck in MLC pollsFollowing this, Soren filed the aforesaid defamation suit in a Ranchi court on August 4 against Dubey, Twitter and Facebook, seeking compensation of Rs 100 crore from each of the defendants.Soren, in his plaint, disclosed that he had not entered into any settlement or compromise with the lady who had allegedly filed the complaint against him.“In fact, the plaintiff (Soren) was not aware of the purported complaint till the defendant (Dubey) tweeted and posted about the same,” Soren said in his plaint.He stated that he had instructed his lawyer in Mumbai to carry out a search of the court records. Due to the limited functioning of the court in prevailing pandemic situation and during religious holidays, the lawyer has not been able to provide any information to him, the chief minister said.He stated that he would bring on record the facts in relation to the woman’s complaint whenever these come to his knowledge in future.Soren said that it transpired from Dubey’s tweets and Facebook posts that the woman had withdrawn her complaint out of her own volition within few days of filing the complaint and that too before the first date of hearing.“Defendant number 1 (Dubey) knows well that the plaintiff (Soren) has not entered into any settlement with the lady... He has made the tweets and posts with actual malice. In order to further disseminate his malicious statement, he has published the same by tagging popular name and widely followed persons...,” Soren said.He argued that the derogatory statements, amounting to an attack on his moral character, were made to lower his reputation in public estimation and excite adverse opinion against him.The Ranchi court, which had issued notices to Dubey and others admitting Soren’s defamation suit, is likely to hear the plaint on Saturday.“We have received the court’s notice and we will present our defence on the next date of hearing tomorrow,” said Dubey’s lawyer Diwakar Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/have-no-knowledge-about-sexual-harassment-case-lodged-against-me-in-2013-jharkhand-cm/story-zs1qbLdm5APsOr6921e5pO.html

02-10-2020||India||Once a protege of KCR, retired professor wants to try his luck in MLC polls||After failing to make his presence felt in the last assembly elections in Telangana in December 2018, former Osmania University (OU) professor and Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) president M Kodandaram is planning to try his luck in the ensuing elections to state legislative council under graduates’ quota.The elections to the two MLC seats under graduates’ constituencies – one comprising Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam districts and another encompassing Rangareddy, Mahbubnagar and Hyderabad districts - are scheduled to be held in February and March. The process for the conduct of elections for the two seats began on Thursday with the enrolment of graduate voters. Though there is still four months’ time for the elections, all the political parties including the Congress, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the Bharatiya Janata Party have already commenced the exercise for the selection of candidates, inviting applications from the aspirants.Also read: ‘Ready to fight even with God’ - KCR on river water dispute with AndhraKodandaram, once a protégé of Telangana Rashtra Samithi president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, has announced his intentions to contest the MLC elections from Nalgonda-Warangal-Khammam graduates’ constituency. For the last few weeks, he has been extensively touring these districts to mobilise support for his candidature.“There is a need to have a strong opposition voice in the legislative council that can represent the people’s voice. At present, there is hardly any representation of the opposition in the council. That is why there have been requests from all sections of people that I should contest the elections to represent the voice of the oppressed,” Kodandaram told Hindustan Times.Kodandaram was a powerful leader with a huge mass appeal before 2014 when he spearheaded the movement for separate Telangana state as the chairman of Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) comprising all political parties, workers, employees and students.However, he refused to join hands with the TRS in post-Telangana scenario but wanted to continue the TJAC as a watch-dog of the people. This resulted in differences between KCR and Kodandaram and the latter turned a bitter critic of the TRS government.Before 2018 elections, he floated a separate political party Telangana Jana Samithi as an alternative voice of the people of Telangana. “There was an anti-establishment atmosphere in 2018 too but we could not succeed in capitalising on it for various reasons,” Kodandaram said.The TJS leader is hoping to get support from other opposition parties, particularly the Congress with which his party had joined hands to form grand alliance along with the Telugu Desam Party and the CPI. However, the Congress party is planning to go alone and has received applications from aspirants for the two MLC seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-a-protege-of-kcr-retired-professor-wants-to-try-his-luck-in-mlc-polls/story-lJZHfYQ9gBk3wWltrBJT6M.html

We will organise a protest at India Gate at 5pm today. The PM will have to give us answers,” he said.The Bhim Army chief had also led a protest at Gate Number 5 of Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday, soon after the victim was declared dead. On Wednesday, Azad was put under house arrest by local police in Saharanpur, where he started a “dharna”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gang-rape-protests-in-delhi-bhim-army-aap-supporters-gather-at-jantar-mantar/story-13qogMAzd59wSKfegg21rO.html

The campaign kicked-off at the party state headquarters in Dehradun. The campaign was initiated by state unit head Pritam Singh by signing a letter addressed to the President to direct the Centre to repeal the laws or bring a new bill ensuring that the MSP mechanism will not be ended. Singh said, “The three laws brought by the Centre are absolutely anti-farmer. The Centre, under PM Modi, is working against the welfare of the farmers while promoting crony capitalism.”“Lakhs of farmers are protesting against them and Congress will continue to support them. We request the President through the signature campaign to direct the Central government to repeal the three laws or bring a new bill to ensure that the MSP will not be ended,” said Singh. Also read: BJP leader wanted to give Mamata Banerjee Covid hug, tests +ve for virusMeanwhile, the ruling BJP termed the campaign as a farce. Bansidhar Bhagat, party state president, said, “This is a farce and not more than a political gimmick. In all these years when they ruled the country, they never thought of working for the farmers, and now when PM Modi is working for them, they can’t tolerate it.”“This signature campaign against the agriculture laws only shows their anti-farmer mindset,” said Bhagat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-congress-starts-signature-campaign-against-farm-bills/story-dp3HaTsQGCecs7kFWT6HyL.html

They beheaded the bodies near the burial site of Rashmi Gour and set them on fire,” Deuri said.Senior police officers and Executive Magistrate Jintu Borah have visited the site and collected the remains from the pyre, besides soil samples, he said.A case has been registered and nine persons, including two women, have been arrested and weapons seized, the officer said.A manhunt has been launched to nab the remaining accused, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-lynched-beheaded-set-on-fire-over-witchcraft-suspicion-in-assam/story-2OqrnHYZZ2a3uYrrftWq8H.html

02-10-2020||India||Priyanka Gandhi attends prayer meet for Hathras victim at Delhi temple||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Friday attended a prayer meet at the Valmiki temple in Delhi for the 19-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly gang-raped in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras. The woman died earlier this week.The UP police is accused by the family of forcing the cremation of the woman in the dead of the night. District officials contended that they had consent from the woman’s family, but the manner in which the developments took place raised questions over the conduct of the administration and law enforcement.“We have come here to offer our condolences, but more than that we are all here to ensure that the family and our sister get justice. We will not stop until we get justice,” said Priyanka Gandhi at the prayer meeting.The Congress leader urged every woman in the country to raise her voice against this injustice.“The family has received no help from the government. Instead, they weren’t even allowed to light the funeral pyre. It is not the culture of our country that the father and the brother don’t conduct the last rites. It is not the tradition of our country to cremate any one after sunset,” she added.A tribute for the victim of the brutal gangrape victim in Hathras has been organised by the temple trust. Senior Congress leaders PL Punia, Sushmita Dev and Anil Choudhary have already offered a floral tribute and are sitting in solidarity.“As the Mahila Congress under the aegis of Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, we have to take the lead and protest against this injustice,” Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev tells Hindustan Times. “It is the women of this country who will bring down Narendra Modi.”On Thursday, Priyanka Gandhi and her brother Rahul, the Congress says, were briefly arrested as they tried to visit Hathras. The UP police escorted them back to Delhi. Back in the village, scores of police personnel in and around the area have been deployed to prevent the entry of opposition leaders and the media. It is seen as an attempt to scuttle the growing anger over the administration’s handling of the young woman’s death.Earlier today, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien reached the district with some party leaders but was stopped 1.5 km from the young woman’s house in Boolgarhi village. Derek O’Brien, who still insisted on meeting her family, was pushed to the ground by a police team.A teenager who emerged from the village on Friday morning alleged the police had seized mobile phones of the rape victim’s family and the family wanted to make a statement to the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-gandhi-arrives-at-valmiki-temple-in-delhi-to-attend-prayer-meet-for-hathras-victim/story-LGr9jV5ubhQ7yhpSsMh07O.html

In the new guidelines, the ministry has allowed the reopening of schools outside of the containment zones in a graded manner from October 15.But the final decision has been left on states and Union territories. The states will make a decision based on their assessment of the pandemic situation. They have been advised to encourage online classes and students will be allowed to attend classes only with the written consents from parents. Attendance will not be considered necessary.All the states and Union territories have been directed to prepare their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) suiting to the local requirements. Schools which will be allowed open will have to follow the SOPs issued by the states and Union territories. The SOP will be issued after consultation with the officials of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).Many states have decided against reopening schools till the end of this month, considering the rising numbers of Covid-19 infections. Uttar Pradesh is the only state which is ready to reopen schools in a graded manner from October 15 in response to Unlock 5.0 guidelines.Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home) said district administrations will assess the situation in their respective jurisdictions and decide in consultation with the management of schools and other educational institutions when to reopen. He, however, said online education would be encouraged.If students preferred to continue their studies online instead of physically attending classes, they would be allowed to do so, Awasthi added. Students would be able to attend school only with the written permission of their parents or guardians, he also said.Maharashtra, which has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 infections in the country, has decided against opening any educational institutions at least till October 31. West Bengal has postponed the decision to reopen schools till mid-November.The governments of Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala have decided to continue keeping schools shut till October 31. The Delhi government has issued an order on Wednesday to maintain the “status quo” for all prohibited activities in Delhi until October 31.Andhra Pradesh has decided to defer the reopening of educational institutions till November 2.Some of the states— Assam, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir which had earlier decided to call students to schools for guidance — are puzzled on whether they should re-open the schools from October 15. Many states, including Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, are also yet to come up with re-opening plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-up-willing-to-reopen-schools-other-states-to-keep-them-shut-until-october-end/story-YbCEZL18sPBWjaoFReodwM.html

Mr Derek is one of my good friends.

Women constables requested them to go back as no one is allowed to enter the village. When they tied to enter forcibly, women constables stopped them,” Hathras Sadar SDM Prem Prakash Meena said.This latest controversy comes barely 24 hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, too, was caught on camera being manhandled by the police while trying to march from Greater Noida to Hathras to meet the victim’s kin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amazing-character-of-dramatics-up-minister-on-derek-o-brien-roughed-up-by-police/story-xL6OmhiQMzjjYFW4dNMC5H.html
02-10-2020||India||Peasant leader Akhil Gogoi’s KMSS launches party ahead of 2021 Assam polls||A day after its leader Akhil Gogoi was granted bail by a special court, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), an Assam organization working for farmers’ rights, announced the formation of a new political party ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. Called Raijor Dal or peoples’ party, the new outfit is the fourth political party to be formed in the state in the past few months - all maintaining a strong regional stance and opposition to the Citizenship Amend Act (CAA). One of the new parties, United Regional Party, Assam (URPA) founded by advocate Arup Borbora, and nearly 70 other organizations have vouched support to Raijor Dal, which aims to promote regional interests and oppose the ruling BJP-led coalition and Congress-All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) alliance. Gogoi, the founder of the KMSS, has been in jail since December last year on charges of inciting violence during the anti-CAA stir. He was granted bail by a National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Thursday but he is still in jail as his bail application in connection with another case filed by the agency is pending. Also read: Fever, body aches after Covid-19 vaccine trial - All you need to know“The new party is the outcome of the fight against the CAA by the KMSS and 70 other organisations since October 2018. Our fight against the CAA continues and Raijor Dal will stand for uncompromised regionalism. We aim to overthrow the BJP regime as well the Congress-AIUDF combine,” said KMSS president Bhasco De Saikia. There’s fear among indigenous communities in Assam that the CAA, which grants Indian citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, will lead to an influx of illegal immigrants to the state from Bangladesh. Two of Assam’s biggest student bodies - All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) - have formed Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP). Journalist-turned-Rajya Sabha MP Ajit Bhuyan has floated Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) and URPA was formed by Dutta and eminent filmmaker Jahnu Barua. “All groups, communities and organizations need to come together to protect the interest of Assam and its indigenous populations. It is a good thing that so many organizations have come together to form Raijor Dal,” filmmaker Jahnu Barua said at the launch event of the new party. Arup Borbora of the URPA hoped that all new regional parties would come together and contest the next assembly polls scheduled in March-April next year from one platform. “Anyone is free to form a political party and contest elections in a democratic country. But we are not bothered by the new parties. Our party has 42 lakh members in Assam and even if each one of them brings an extra vote, we would get 84 lakh votes and retain power,” BJP Assam president Ranjeet Kumar Dass said recently. Opposition Congress, which has formed an alliance with the AIUDF for the next polls, has been asking all parties to join forces against the BJP-led government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peasant-leader-akhil-gogoi-s-kmss-launches-party-ahead-of-2021-assam-polls/story-32Tj5tSkwNVTtYHbu3k5pK.html

According to the hospital known as Government Jai Prakash district hospital, a woman delivered a male child at 10.35 am on Thursday through a caesarean section (C-section), while another woman was to undergo a C-section (on another table in the same operation theatre) and who later gave birth to a female child at 10.53 am. While families of both the women were waiting outside the operation theatre, a contractual nurse at the hospital came out of the operation theatre and handed over the child to the family of the woman who was yet to undergo the C-section.The nurse realised her mistake soon after returning to the operation theatre and rushed back outside to tell the family that it was not their child, leading to a ruckus by the family holding the infant. Also Read: 2 arrested for rape and murder of 2-year-old in MP“A three-member inquiry committee was constituted on objections raised by the relatives. The committee arrived at the conclusion that the woman who gave birth to the female child (at 11.53 am), operated upon by Dr Shraddha Agrawal, was immediately told about the gender of the baby. The woman too confirmed this before her family and also a police officer. But given the objections raised by her family, a DNA test has been recommended by the committee. The nurse Surekha Wilson has been shifted to another ward,” said an official communication by the hospital.

However, both the women have their babies with them and are breastfeeding them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goof-up-post-delivery-dna-test-to-settle-parenthood-of-2-newborn-babies/story-MPhJBg4gGsKK5LXFyg0GUO.html

Section 144 prohibits the gathering of more than four people.The 19-year-old girl was gang-raped by four men on September 14 and died at the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on Tuesday. The victim’s family members alleged that cops conducted the last rites in the early hours of Wednesday without informing the family members.

02-10-2020||India||Hathras gang-rape case: UP cops barricade village to stop media, opposition from meeting family||The Uttar Pradesh police has deployed scores of personnel in and around the Hathras village where a 19-year-old Dalit woman  was allegedly gang-raped last month that sparked off national outrage at the gruesome crime and has led a barrage of criticism over the woman’s rushed cremation past midnight. She died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was gang-raped at Hathras while she was out to collect fodder with her mother.The decision to seal off the village to prevent entry of opposition leaders and the media is seen as a continuing effort to scuttle the growing public anger over the administration handling of the young woman’s death. Officials had yesterday spoken of a plan to declare the village a Covid-19 containment zone on suspicions that some policemen may have contracted the coronavirus infection.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was detained on the Yamuna Expressway an hour’s drive from national capital Delhi on grounds that he had violated prohibitory orders that barred assembly of more than four people.Also Read: UP cops contradict victim’s statement, say she was not rapedOn Friday, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien reached the district 200 km from Delhi with some party leaders but was stopped 1.5 km from the young woman’s house in Boolgarhi village.

He also alleged that the victim’s father was assaulted by the police and he had consequently, briefly passed out. But the administration wouldn’t let journalists past the barricades.Also Read: First handle UP’s jungle raj, Maharashtra home minister taunts Yogi AdityanathReporters who tried to slip into the village were also stopped by police teams.

Another was seen squatting on the road, demanding to know under which law the police could stop journalists from meeting the family. The police officer said he had his instructions to stop outsiders from entering.District magistrate Praveen Kumar and superintendent of police Vikrant Vir were not available for comments.Praveen Kumar had landed in the middle of a fresh political row after he was seen in a 22-second video, possibly leaked by the victim ‘s family, where the official is telling the woman’s father that the media would not be around forever.“It is we who would stand with you and thus it is your wish if you want to change your statements or not. Do not harm your credibility, else we might also change,” the district magistrate allegedly says in the video.Praveen Kumar didn’t respond to questions on the video but later put out a statement via news agency ANI.“I met with six family members of the victim yesterday and we spoke for about an hour and a half. I met with them again today (Thursday) to see their point of discontent. I deny the negative rumours which are rife about my interactions with them,” Praveen Kumar said, according to ANI.Praveen Kumar and district police chief Vikrant Vir are among the UP officials who have been summoned by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on October 12 to report on the facts of the case. In an 11-page order that took a dim view of the alleged violation of the rights of the victim’s family, justices Rajan Roy and Jaspreet Singh observed that the events after the death of the woman had “shocked our conscience”.The judges have also summoned the Dalit family of the victim so that the court could ascertain the facts and their version of the incidents on the woman’s cremation. The state government has been told to ensure that no coercion, influence or pressure is exerted upon the family members of the deceased in any manner, by anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-gang-rape-case-up-cops-barricade-village-to-stop-media-opposition-from-meeting-family/story-XeHzLFmvP6qthteo6bePMI.html

Last week, Governor Dhankhar had alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee was turning Bengal into a police state. In a letter to the top-most police officer in the state, Governor Dhankhar demanded he be provided with a report on the law and order situation. After the officer failed to reply, the Governor wrote to CM Banerjee, who, he says, questioned his authority to do so.Taking a swipe, West Bengal science and technology minister Bratya Basu sought to know from the Governor as to what he thought about the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Recently, a spate of rape cases have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, with the police action in Hathras to cremate the body of a Dalit woman in the dead of the night without the family’s consent led to howls of protest. “Why doesn’t the governor take a look at the law and order problem in Uttar Pradesh? He constantly criticises the democratically elected government in West Bengal and raises questions. What has he got to say about UP? Ask him if he is trying to become a noirajyapal from a rajyapal (governor)?” Basu told reporters on the sidelines of the event. Dhankhar was standing barely 10 feet away and talking to the home secretary. In Bengali, noirajya means anarchy and pal means protector or custodian in Sanskrit, Hindi and Bengali. Basu, Dhankhar and senior state officials were attending the programme at Gandhi Ghat in Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district. Journalists present at the event approached Dhankhar for his comment on what the minister said. “This is an insult to the sanctity of the Raj Bhawan. As the constitutional head of the state, I will not tolerate this. This government should look at what is happening in the state instead of targeting the Raj Bhawan every day,” said Dhankhar. The BJP targeted the Trinamool minister for disrespecting the Constitution. “He may hold a number of degrees and can be a known playwright but he does not know how to respect the Constitution. This is contempt of the Constitution. Basu has shown disrespect to Gandhi as well,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-about-law-and-order-in-up-tmc-minister-s-swipe-at-guv-dhankhar/story-PCui4fvDgnsqHBZd5d10KN.html

The victim died in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was gang-raped by upper-caste men while she was out with her mother to get fodder.“The PM washes the feet of Dalits before elections but remains quiet when a Dalit daughter of Uttar Pradesh is brutally raped. We will organise a protest at India Gate at 5pm today. The PM will have to give us answers,” he said.The Bhim Army chief had also led a protest at Gate Number 5 of Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday, soon after the victim was declared dead. He urged all members of the Dalit community to take to the streets and demand the death penalty for the culprits. “The government should not test our patience. We won’t rest until the culprits are hanged,” he said.On Wednesday, Azad was put under house arrest by local police in Saharanpur, where he started a “dharna”.Incidents of rapes were being reported in many districts in UP, he said and demanded that President’s rule be imposed in the state. “Hathras, Azamgarh, Bulandshahr, Meerut, Balrampur… every district in Uttar Pradesh is being embarrassed with incidents of rape. The constitutional machinery has failed completely. Yogi Adityanath cannot handle the government. The president should announce President’s Rule as soon as possible,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“I am sitting at my house on a dharna, injustice will not be tolerated. In Uttar Pradesh, Dalits are being meted out with injustice. The DM and the SSP of Hathras who have been protecting criminals and performing inhuman acts have not been removed yet. How can one expect justice from such unworthy people?” he asked in another tweet.Azad reached Delhi along with supporters of his Bhim Army on Thursday.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad-to-protest-against-hathras-gangrape-at-india-gate-at-5pm/story-dNuvvngH4EUppssB99W0FI.html

All you need to know||Amid rising concerns over the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines under development, several participants in the human trial programme of Moderna and Pfizer reported high fever, body aches, headaches and exhaustion. However, these are common for any vaccine shots and not a reason to raise alarm, experts have said.Here are the latest developments of Covid-19 vaccine from across the world1. The clinical trials of Astrazeneca and Oxford University’s vaccine have resumed in Japan after it was halted following Astrazeneca’s acknowledgement of severe illness in two cases. Trials are already going on in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa 2. The United States is yet to allow Astrazeneca to resume its trial in the US.3. No adverse impact of the Astrazeneca vaccine shots has been reported in India. Also Read: Moderna says Covid-19 vaccine unlikely to be ready before US election: Report4. Some participants may develop fever just after receiving a vaccine shot, but that is considered to be a mild reaction, experts have said.5. One participant of Moderna’s trial developed “a grade three fever, which is classified as 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39°C) or above, after receiving the lower vaccine dose”, Reuters reported. Another developed fatigue so severe that it hampered daily activities, but these side effects are staying only for a day.Antisera as Covid-19 vaccineThe Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with a Hyderabad-based biopharmaceutical company has developed “highly purified antisera” by injecting inactivated SARS-CoV2 in horses, which can be a potential treatment for COVID-19. Antisera are blood serum high in antibodies against specific antigens and are injected in humans to help kickstart the immune system to fight specific infections.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-fever-body-aches-common-symptoms-all-you-need-to-know/story-1TKtwrLar3nV5I7ErtzLYN.html

In its notification to the Congress, the Defence Security Cooperation Agency said the proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the US by helping to strengthen the US-India strategic relationship and improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region. The items ordered by India are aircraft consumable spares and repair/return parts; ground support and equipment; Cartridge Actuated Devices/Propellant Actuated Devices (CAD/PAD) fire extinguisher cartridges; flare cartridges; BBU-35/B cartridge impulse squibs. India has also ordered for one spare AN/ALR-56M Advanced Radar Warning Receiver shipset; spare AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser System shipset; ten Lightweight Night Vision Binocular (F5032); ten AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggle (NVG)(F4949); GPS and Electronic Warfare. It is also seeking instruments and lab equipment support; joint mission planning system; cryptographic device spares and loaders; software and software support; publications and technical documentation; personnel training and training and training equipment; contractor engineering, technical and logistical support, and other related elements of programme support. According to the notification, the proposed sale ensures that the previously procured aircraft operates effectively to serve the needs of the Indian Air Force, Army and Navy transport requirements, local and international humanitarian assistance and regional disaster relief. This sale of spares and services will enable the Indian Air Force to sustain a higher mission-ready status fleet, it said. India will have no difficulty absorbing this additional sustainment support, it said, adding that the proposed sale of this equipment and support worth $90 million will not alter the basic military balance in the region. Notification of such major sales is mandatory under the Arms Export Control Act. Lawmakers have 30 days to review the proposed sale. The sale would be executed by defence major Lockheed-Martin. India is one of the 17 countries to whom the US has sold its C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. The Indian Air Force currently operates a fleet of five C-130J-30s. India has placed order for additional six C-130J-30s Super Hercules aircraft. “From the highest landing strip in the world to austere runways almost destroyed by natural disasters, the C-130J goes where other airlifters can’t, won’t or don’t go. It’s a workhorse that’s in operation around the world, flying in every environment and mission scenario required every day and everywhere,” Lockheed says on its website. In the summer of 2013, Indian Air Force performed the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of 16,614 ft. The aircraft was used extensively by the US in Afghanistan and Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pentagon-okays-90-million-sale-of-spares-support-for-c-130j-super-hercules-aircraft-to-india/story-5bg8H2ChL9LuLSe355X9sM.html

Travellers have begun to opt for homestays and travelling to nearby places since the government began easing restrictions imposed on movement to check the pandemic spread, they added. This has reflected in the number of bookings made since September. More bookings were expected as people are slowly moving from essential to leisure travel.Over the years, long weekends have been the most lucrative for the travel industry. While 2020 has had more long weekends compared to 2019, travel had come to a standstill due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 tally surges past 6.39 million, death toll nears 1 lakhAccording to online travel agency yatra.com, there has been a demand for homestays and cottages this weekend beginning with Gandhi Jayanti on Friday. Travellers are preferring holidaying in secluded areas at drivable distances.“In the Unlock [easing of restrictions] phase, more travellers are looking for short-haul destinations having proper safety and sanitisation,” said yatra.com co-founder Sabina Chopra. She added ahead of this weekend, they have seen a 32% increase in booking inquiries and growth in demand for accommodation like homestays, 4-star, 5-star hotels, cottages, etc. She added with customer confidence going up, they expect better demand.Travellers from Delhi were preferring to drive to places like Jaipur, Nainital, Rishikesh, Manesar, Mussoorie and Lansdowne while those from Mumbai were heading to Panchgani, Lonavala, Alibaug, Lavasa and Mahabaleshwar.Goibibo’s chief operating officer, Vipul Prakash, said over the past few weeks, they have noticed a significant increase in bookings for weekend getaways. “Over the coming long weekend, we expect over 40% higher check-ins in comparison to bookings made for weekend getaways in August. Within this segment, over 70% of the bookings are for drivable destinations or to places within 400 km.”Goibibo bookings suggest Goa, Shimla, Mussoorie, Nainital, Manali, Coorg and Rishikesh have been the most popular destinations this weekend.Cleartrip’s corporate strategy head, Aditya Agarwal, said since September, bookings are in the range of 20%-30% of last year levels for Rajasthan and Kerala and around 18% for Goa. “...which signal the return in confidence to travel.” Agarwal said Cleartrip expects this trend to continue over the last quarter. “We saw a substantial increase in traffic volumes on our platform two to seven days prior to the long weekend and therefore this duration contributes to a higher share of bookings. Additionally, we are also seeing an increase in metro to non-metro travel over the long weekend indicating that people have headed back home to spend time with their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travellers-resume-long-weekend-trips-travel-portals-see-40-increase-in-bookings/story-LELgKx5224xiUSpaZBp4MP.html
02-10-2020||India||FIR can’t be quashed on ground of delay, says HC while hearing molestation case||Observing that first information reports (FIRs) cannot be quashed only on the ground of delay, the Bombay high court last week dismissed a petition filed by a Khar resident seeking the quashing of a case of molestation of his minor daughter registered against him.“The FIR cannot be quashed merely on the ground of delay,” said the bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik while rejecting the Khar resident’s contention that there was an inordinate delay in reporting the alleged crime to police and the FIR was registered about five years after the purported incident.He was booked by Khar police in February 2019 on the complaint of the mother of the victim under sections 354 (assault or use of criminal force against a woman with an intent to outrage her modesty) 354A (assault or use of criminal force to a woman with an intent to disrobe her) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 8 (sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and also under relevant sections of the IPC.The woman alleged that her husband used to bath naked with their daughter when she was 5/6 years of age, and also used to touch her inappropriately.The husband had moved HC for quashing of the FIR also on the ground that the allegations levelled against him were utterly false and the FIR was registered at the behest of his estranged wife out of vengeance. He submitted that the child was very comfortable with him and also presented his photographs and videos with the child.Advocate Aditya Pratap, who represented the complainant woman, strenuously opposed the petition. He pointed out that if allegations in the FIR were read in entirety and taken at face value, it disclosed commission of offence, which needed further investigation.He further submitted that the statement of the child under Section 164 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was recorded and unless the statement was tested before the trial court, it would not be appropriate to accede to the prayer for quashing of the FIR.HC accepted Aditya Pratap’s submissions. The bench said that a perusal of allegations in the FIR made it clear that the relevant sections of IPC and of the POCSO Act were “clearly attracted and consequently alleged offences have been disclosed”.The bench added that it could not, at this preliminary stage, go into the veracity of the allegations and examine whether allegations were true or false.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-can-t-be-quashed-on-ground-of-delay-says-hc-while-hearing-molestation-case/story-o3ibVStD7X9Y9BCBIJ0b3I.html
02-10-2020||India||At least 500 Covid doctors have lost their lives, says IMA||At least 500 doctors have succumbed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country so far, according to the updated list of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Friday, which is nearly half of the number of claims either settled or under process of being settled by the government to compensate Covid-19 doctors who have lost their lives due to the viral infection.“Our latest figures say 515 doctors treating Covid-19 patients have been martyred in the country so far. And these are all allopathic doctors that we have identified through our various branches of IMA -- there are 1,746 branches functional across the country. The number could actually be much higher,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, president, IMA.Also read: India set to cross 100,000 Covid-19 deaths todayAccording to IMA database, the doctor patient ratio is 1:194. A majority of doctors (201) were in the age group of 60 and 70 years, followed by 171 killed in the age bracket of 50 to 60 years. Above 70 years of age were 66 doctors, and 59 doctors were between 35 and 50 years of age. At least 18 doctors who died were less than 35 years of age.The government, however, has maintained that there is no central database to provide exact number of doctors who lost their lives on line of duty. The minister of state for health, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, also recently said in Parliament that public health and hospitals came under states, so the Centre wasn’t maintaining any such database.The only record that is being maintained is the number of compensations being processed under government’s insurance scheme for healthcare workers in this pandemic— Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana package.On the Covid-19 media briefing on September 22, the Union secretary for health, Rajesh Bhushan, had mentioned that 242 claims under the scheme had either been processed or were under process.“We are closely monitoring the data under PM’s pandemic response package. There is an insurance cover amounting to ₹50 lakh for all frontline health care workers , and this has recently been extended till March 2021. Under this package, 62 claims have been settled, more than 130 claims are being processed… and above 50 claims that are yet to come from states,” Bhushan had said.Even that number is half of the number published by IMA.“How can the Centre wash their hands of their responsibility. How is it possible that they cannot maintain a database at the central level when you need an Aadhar Card to get tested for Covid-19 through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. How difficult can it get then?” said Dr Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-500-covid-doctors-have-lost-their-lives-says-ima/story-ZNOr9Q2XoSpxEstJTGgYOP.html
02-10-2020||India||Road to Indian envoys’ appointments to neighbourhood countries goes through PMO||With Vikram Doraiswami taking over as the high commissioner to Bangladesh on Monday, it is quite evident that the road to high-profile ambassadorial assignments in the neighbourhood goes through the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).Last week, Rudrendra Tandon went to Kabul to take over as the Indian ambassador to strife-torn Afghanistan. Both Doraiswami and Tandon have served in the PMO as private secretary to the Prime Minister and PMO’s director.While the ministry of external affairs (MEA) will never publicly admit it but the key diplomatic assignments in the neighbourhood are given to foreign service officers with inter-ministerial experience which goes beyond diplomacy. Indian envoys to neighbourhood countries are now rigorously selected and given to those who have big picture experience.The Indian ambassador to Nepal is Vinay Mohan Kwatra, who was joint secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and so was the Indian high commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Bagley. The last Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Besaria had served in the PMO and the current ambassador to Myanmar Saurabh Kumar has served in National Security Council Secretariat, an adjunct of PMO vis National Security Advisor. The only exception to this rule is the Indian ambassador to Bhutan, Ruchira Khamboj, as Indian envoy to Beijing Vikram Misri has significant PMO experience.While the neighbourhood is a top priority for the Modi government, the envoy selection by South Block for the Indian sub-continent has taken a different meaning after Beijing has started posting non-diplomats as ambassadors in South Asia, particularly those having direct links with PLA intelligence or United Front Works Department (UFWD) directly under President Xi Jinping. The current Chinese ambassadors to Islamabad and Dhaka belong to UFWD, while the envoy to Nepal has intelligence background.Although the ambassadorial assignments are at present the domain of senior-most Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officers, a number of India’s key allies post non-diplomat specialists as their envoys to Delhi. At least eight of India’s close allies have posted non-diplomats with expertise in electoral politics, trade and economics as ambassadors to Delhi. They are Kenneth Juster (USA); Ron Malka (Israel); Barry O’ Farrell (Australia); Nadir Patel (Canada); Nilamber Acharya (Nepal); Austin Fernando (Sri Lanka); Saud bin Mohammed Alsati (Saudi Arabia) and Ahmed Abdul Rahman Al Banna (UAE). All these envoys have rich experience and present a wholesome view of the country they represent. If Juster is an expert in trade and commerce, Malka has headed Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and O’ Farrell has served as the Prime Minister of New South Wales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-to-indian-envoys-appointments-to-neighbourhood-countries-goes-through-pmo/story-x15T8gUSTGs08CxiqB114J.html
02-10-2020||India||On Gandhi Jayanti, Congress signals prolonged protests against Modi government||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday invoked Mahatma Gandhi on the Father of the Nation’s 151st birth anniversary to declare that he is not afraid of anyone in this world. “I will not fear anyone in the world … I will not bow down to anyone’s injustice. I will win the untruth with the truth and I can bear all the sufferings while opposing the untruth,” Rahul quoted Gandhi.On Thursday, UP Pradesh (UP) Police had held Rahul along with his sister and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi when they had tried to enter Hathras, which grabbed the headlines following the gang-rape and murder of a Dalit teenager (19) by four upper caste men. Also Read: Hathras gang-rape: Lawyers demand president’s rule in Uttar PradeshRahul’s comment also underlined his intentions about his next round of agitations against the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. He will visit Punjab on Saturday to participate in a few programmes against the newly enacted farm bills that the opposition parties claim will only benefit traders and corporate entities in the agribusinesses.Congress president Sonia Gandhi, too, in her message on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, announced that the party would continue to fight against the farm laws. “The Congress’s agitation against three black (farm) laws will continue. I want to emphasise that this movement of farmers and the Congress will be successful and the farmers will win.” According to Rahul’s aides, Punjab chief minister Amrinder Singh has organised a raft of protest programmes, including a tractor rally, on Saturday. Rahul is expected to participate in a few of those programmes. Also Read: Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Mamata slam UP govt over Hathras gangrapeHis aides said though many state units of the party have requested Rahul to attend their regional protest programmes, a final call on his participation in the upcoming events would be taken after factoring in the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak across the country. On Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh administration had sealed off Hathras and the UP Police arrested Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra.The Gandhis’ visited Hathras amid the Dalit victim’s family members’ allegations that the UP Police hurriedly cremated her at the dead of night at around 2:30 am on Wednesday in a bid to contain the public outcry against the heinous crime.Sonia in her message also spoke about the “injustice” meted out to farmers, labourers and the working class, signalling that the Congress will continue its protests against the Modi government. “Today is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest sympathiser of farmers, labourers and working people. Gandhiji used to say that the soul of India resides in India’s villages, fields and barns. Today is also the birth anniversary of our former PM, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who gave the slogan of ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’,” she said. “But today the farmers and farm labourers of the country are agitating on the streets against the three anti-black laws. The Modi government is crying tears of blood to the donor farmer who grows grains for the country by sweating his blood,” she said. She reminded the public that the Congress has “always made every law with public consent” and before the enactment of the law, “the interests of the people have been kept at the top”.She added: “Democracy also means that every decision of the country has the consent of the countrymen. But does the Modi government believe it? Perhaps, the Modi government does not remember that it was not able to change the ‘Right Compensation Law of the Land’ for the rights of farmers through ordinance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-gandhi-jayanti-congress-signals-prolonged-protests-against-modi-government/story-NHYwf1KdNm9LsHqFoMBEwM.html

I believe that the agitation by farmers and Congress will be successful and farmers will emerge victorious,” Gandhi said in her message in Hindi.Farmers across the country have taken to streets against the three laws, which, they say, will lead to the dismantling of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Congress has been at the forefront of protests against the farm laws. In fact, Gandhi had asked Congress-ruled states to explore ways to ‘bypass’ the three new laws. The Modi government, on its part, has hailed the three laws as ‘pro-farmers’ and ‘revolutionary’. Prime Minister Modi has repeatedly assured farmers that MSP will not be withdrawn.However, farmers have continued to protest, with the northern states of Punjab and Haryana being the epicentres of the stir. In Punjab, farmers have been holding a ‘rail roko’ agitation since September 24.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have thrown their weight behind the protesting farmers.

02-10-2020||India||Covid-19: India set to cross 100,000 deaths today||India will cross the 100,000-mark for deaths due to Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), today.With 1,093 new deaths recorded on Thursday, the death toll due to the highly infectious viral disease has touched 99,824 so far in the country, according to the government data.At least 80% Covid-19 deaths are reported from 10 states, of which nearly 40% deaths are reported from the state of Maharashtra with 394 deaths reported on Thursday alone, followed by Karnataka with 130 deaths. As on date both the states have recorded a total of 37,056 and 9,013 Covid-19 related deaths respectively.The first Covid-19 death was reported on March 12, from south India. Even though the country is reaching 0.1 million deaths in 7 months, India’s Covid-19 death rate is among the lowest in the world. Country’s current case fatality rate, which is the proportion of people who die of a disease among total number of patients diagnosed with the disease, stands at 1.56%. The figure is nearly half of the global CFR that is about 3% at the moment. On average, close to 0.8 million cases are being reported daily from across the country over the past one month, taking the total number of people infected with Covid-19 in the country to date to 6.4 million.First sample returned positive for Covid-19 in India on January 30. Comorbidities, or underlying medical conditions, result in death in almost 70% of the total Covid-19 positive patients, according to the government data.Chronic medical conditions that have been commonly observed in Covid-19 patients include hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, heart disease, asthma, chronic renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low immunity, malignancy, bronchitis and chronic neuromuscular disease among others.Hypertension and diabetes are the two most common comorbidities that lead to the disease progressing to severe levels among covid-19 patients.Fever, cough and sore throat are the most common three symptoms that Covid-19 cases experience, followed by breathlessness.“Fever and cough are quite common symptoms that Covid-19 positive cases get. There are other symptoms also such as diarrhoea, weakness, breathlessness etc. that some patients complain of,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, department of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-set-to-cross-100-000-deaths-today/story-rkre7Ti3B3pkicnny0a0JN.html

02-10-2020||India||After 61 years, India records two consecutive years of ‘above normal’ rain||Fewer weather stations reported extremely heavy rainfall this monsoon, as compared to last year. But the corresponding figure was higher than in 2017 and 2018, which is in keeping with the trend of a rise in extremely wet weather, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its analysis of the monsoon season on Thursday.Officially, the monsoon season ended on Wednesday (September 30).High variation in rainfall received in each of the four monsoon months since June 1 was unique this year, according to IMD.The IMD data showed that 341 weather stations reported extremely heavy rainfall, measuring above 20 centimetres (cm) this year, as compared to 554 in 2019; and 321 and 261 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Very heavy rainfall, measuring between 11 and 20 cm, was recorded by 2,253 weather stations this year, as compared to 3,056 in 2019; and 2,181 and 1,824 in 2018 and 2017, respectively.The total rainfall recorded this monsoon at 108.7% of the long period average (LPA) is the third-highest since 1990.In 1994 and 2019, 112% and 110% of the LPA, respectively, were recorded. This and the previous monsoon are the two consecutive years with above normal monsoon rainfall since 1958 and 1959, IMD said in its analysis.In June, IMD had forecast normal monsoon rainfall of 102% of the LPA with error margin of +/-4% for the season. Rainfall range of 96% to 104% of the LPA is considered normal and 104% to 110% is considered above normal. India had recorded above normal rainfall of 110% of the LPA last year. “Considering month to month rainfall variation over India, the season is very uniquely placed in the historical record for its distinct and contrasting monthly variation. The rainfall over the country was 118%, 90%, 127% and 104% of the LPA during June, July, August and September, respectively,” IMD said.IMD said that its region wise LPA forecast was off the mark. In May, IMD had forecast 107% of the LPA for north-west India; central India (103%); east and north-east India (96%); and southern peninsula (102%).But, the recorded rainfall over these regions was 84%, 115%, 107% and 129% of the LPA, respectively. “Thus, the forecasts of season rainfall over central, north-east and southern peninsula regions were an underestimate to the actual rainfall, while the forecast for north-west India was an overestimate. The forecast for the second half of the monsoon season (August – September) for the country was 104% against the actual rainfall of 118% of the LPA,” IMD said.“Long range forecast for a four-month period and that, too, for various regions often leads to variation. It cannot be accurate. The longer the period, forecasting becomes trickier,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre (NWFC), IMD.“The all-India average of monsoon rainfall was normal as per definition. However, that doesn’t give much insight into the regional manifestation of the monsoon. This year, the two cyclones during the onset, the low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, and the occasional strong westerlies influenced the monsoon variability. The Arabian Sea temperatures were high throughout the season, enhancing the moisture supply, triggering some of the heavy rainfall events that led to regional floods,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune.Though officially the post-monsoon season has started from October 1, widespread and heavy rainfall is expected over Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal during the next four-five days. Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely in these states. This is mainly due to the influence of a low-pressure area over west central Bay of Bengal, off north Andhra Pradesh (AP) and southern Odisha coasts. Very heavy rainfall is also likely over Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura for the next five days.“Monsoon withdrawal cannot be declared from these regions until rain stops completely. The withdrawal parameters have to be met. It’s difficult to say when the monsoon will withdraw completely,” added Devi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-61-years-india-records-two-consecutive-years-of-above-normal-rain/story-VZXoL0iupT5YCZUBRM9I1L.html
02-10-2020||India||Ready to sell Navy’s former aircraft carrier INS Viraat for Rs 100 crore: Mumbai firm||The new owner of decommissioned warship INS Viraat has sought Rs 100 crore from a Mumbai-based firm which is making last ditch efforts to save the warship from being dismantled and to convert it into a museum.INS Viraat, the aircraft carrier which was inducted into the Indian Navy in 1987 and decommissioned in 2017, was purchased by Shree Ram Group for a sum of Rs 38.54 crore at an auction in July this year.The warship, which is the symbol of India’s rich maritime heritage, reached the ship-breaking yard at Alang on Gujarat coast last week.Since the ship was bought as scrap in an auction, aspiring buyers would also need to procure a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Ministry of Defence to buy the ship now, Shree Ram Group Chairman Mukesh Patel told PTI on Thursday.“I bought this warship just out of my love for my country. Now, a Mumbai-based company wants to convert this ship it into a museum. Since they are also doing it out of patriotism, I agreed to sell the ship to them,” he said.“But, they need to first procure NOC from the defence ministry, without which I can’t re-sell the ship,” he said.Patel also said he first demanded Rs 125 crore and then agreed to sell it for Rs 100 crore considering that the company’s cause is noble.Patel also said it is a limited period offer and he would wait only till next week.“I am told the interested firm is trying hard to get the NOC. But, I can’t wait forever. I will wait for another week. After that, I will start the dismantling process,” he added.V K Sharma, the managing director of Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd, has shown interest in buying the warship.He had earlier expressed confidence of getting an NOC from the Centre so that INS Viraat can be converted into a museum.Sharma had claimed he received support from the Goa government in this patriotic endeavour.“We are trying our best to get the NOC and we are confident of getting it soon. I had personally met Mukeshbhai and we both agreed on a price of the ship,” Sharma said.Viraat, the world’s longest serving warship that was decommissioned by the Indian Navy three years ago, arrived at Alang in Gujarat from Mumbai last week for dismantling.It is the second aircraft carrier slated to be broken down in India. In 2014, INS Vikrant was dismantled in Mumbai.The 70-year-old aircraft carrier, in its earlier avatar, had won the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982 for the Royal British Navy.It weighs about 27,800 tonnes and served the British Navy as HMS Hermes from November 1959 to April 1984 and after refurbishment, was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1987.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-sell-navy-s-former-aircraft-carrier-ins-viraat-for-rs-100-crore-mumbai-firm/story-NHZS2jSooliu9EEuYXyiaN.html

02-10-2020||India||Gene mutation behind different Covid-19 death rates among Indian states, study finds||Variation in a genetic mutation among Indians may be the main reason behind the difference in the death rates due to Covid-19 across various states of the country, says a study that could inform new policies for controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic. An international team, led by researchers at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh, analysed mutations in the gene responsible for the expression of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein on the surface of cells which is believed to act as a gateway for the novel coronavirus into the human body. Recent studies have effectively demonstrated that the ACE2 is encoded by a gene located on the X chromosome. In the journal Frontiers in Genetics, the researchers looked at the frequency of this mutation described as rs2285666 haplotype among various states of India. Their spatial analysis showed that in India, frequency of this haplotype, or a combination of mutations, varied between 33-100 per cent across different regions. The researchers, for the first time, also ascertained a significant positive correlation for the mutation with the lower infection and case-fatality ratio (CFR) among Indian populations. Gyaneshwer Chaubey, Professor at the Department of Zoology, BHU said the variations identified reduce the susceptibility of a person against the novel coronavirus. “If in a region more people with this haplotype will be present, the infectiousness of the virus would likely be lesser,” Chaubey, who led the study, told PTI. For example, he noted that statewise Maharashtra and Gujarat have the lowest frequency of the gene mutation of about 30-40 per cent while the Northeastern region with a 75-100 per cent mutation in the gene has the highest frequency. “People in Western India are more susceptible to the disease than those in Central India or East India or South India or Northeast India,” Chaubey added. The study adds important potential implications to understanding the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in various world populations, said Anshika Srivastava from BHU, who was also a part of the research team. The researchers noted that as far as policies to control the pandemic are concerned, the study suggests a single rule may not be effective in all the states. They also observed that in India as well as in Bangladesh, the tribal populations have a higher frequency of this haplotype than the caste populations. “If we look at casts vs tribals, tribals have higher frequency than the caste groups,” said Chaubey, adding it is likely that the tribal populations will be less susceptible than the caste populations to the viral disease. Additionally, he noted that the virus strains present in India may also be responsible to contribute to the higher death rates, adding that the team is working on the infectiousness of various virus strains present in India in an ongoing study. Since the beginning, it has been hypothesised, and later observed that coronavirus is affecting people differently. In their previous research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, the team analysed the whole genome data of the ACE2 gene from various world populations, focusing on South Asia. They found that Indians were more closer to East and Southeast Asians, whereas from the ancestry point of view, Indians usually remained closer to Europeans than East and Southeast Asians. “This unexpected info helped us to explore more about the mutations and haplotypes present among Indians. We found out that the rs2285666 associated haplotype increases the ACE2 expression,” he said. “In other words this mutation reduces the susceptibility against coronavirus,” said Chaubey. Noting that the mutation among Indians is 60 per cent and 20 per cent in Europeans, Chaubey said this implies that the Indians are less susceptible to Covid-19 than Europeans and Americans. “Surprisingly, we found out that the geographic distribution of this haplotype was highly correlated with the number of cases as well as CFR (death rate),” said Chaubey. “Where frequency of this genetic factor was high, the cases and CFR were less and vice versa,” he noted. Although data have been accumulating, the expression of ACE2 gene variation affecting host susceptibility among the various world populations is not yet known. “Genetically, most South Asians are more related with West Eurasian populations rather than with East Eurasians, whereas for this gene the result is contradictory,” Professor George van Driem of University of Bern in Switzerland, a co-author on the previous study, added. The researchers said there are a few studies on the ACE2 gene by other groups, but all of them have looked at the frequency differences of various mutations, whereas the team has used more powerful haplotype based analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gene-mutation-behind-different-covid-19-death-rates-among-indian-states-study-finds/story-pL7SSvyKyXQa2cMojGcAeP.html

Barricades were put up to stop the Akalis going towards Chandigarh.The SAD leaders wanted to hand over a memorandum to Governor V P Singh Badnore, seeking revocation of the three new farm laws.The Chandigarh administration had imposed Section 144 of CrPC, banning assembly of five and more people at one place.Also Read: To protest farm laws, Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab from October 3 to 5The police wanted only a few leaders to meet the Punjab governor to submit the memorandum but the SAD leadership demanded that all Akali members be allowed.“We detained them (Akali leaders) for a brief period and they were later released,” Chandigarh Senior Superintendent of Police Kuldeep Chahal said.Among the leaders who were detained were Bikram Singh Majithia, Parambans Singh Romana, Daljit Singh Cheema, Manjinder Singh Sirsa and a few others.Sukhbir Singh Badal was leading a ‘Kisan march’ from the Akal Takht in Amritsar, while Harsimrat Kaur Badal was leading another procession from Takht Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda.A third procession was led by senior Akali leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra and Daljit Singh Cheema from Takht Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib.The march led by Sukhbir Badal was joined by the one led by Bikram Singh Majithia, Chandumajra, Jagir Kaur and Cheema and it reached the Chandigarh-Mullanpur border at around 9:30 pm.From there, the police took Sukhbir Badal, Majithia, Chandumajra and Jagir Kaur into preventive custody as they tried to enter Chandigarh.“We wanted to hand over a memorandum to the governor but it is sad he did not meet us. We were lathi-charged which we strongly condemn. It is an injustice. They tried to suppress the voice of farmers,” Sukhbir Badal said.The procession led by Harsimrat Kaur reached the Chandigarh-Zirakpur around 8 pm.When the police stopped the Akalis from going towards Chandigarh, Harsimrat Badal and MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder sat on a dharna on the road. They were later detained by the police.The Akali leadership was taken to the Chandigarh sector 17 police station and released around 10:45 pm.Meanwhile, Akali stalwart Parkash Singh Badal strongly condemned the use of force on “peaceful” Akalis by the Chandigarh Police and said that the “brutal” lathicharge made this a “painful and dark day” for democracy in the country’s history.Last week, the SAD had announced to part ways with the NDA, the third major party to walk out of the BJP-led coalition in the last couple of years.On September 17, Harsimrat Kaur Badal had quit the Union Cabinet after the SAD chief strongly opposed the farm bills in Lok Sabha, claiming the legislations will “destroy” the agriculture sector in Punjab.President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday gave assent to the three contentious bills -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-s-sukhbir-singh-badal-harsimrat-kaur-briefly-detained-over-farm-laws-protest/story-ZDePMWXvOTTJDBSDlBEwuN.html

In a strongly worded order, a three-judge bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud said that a worker’s right to life cannot be deemed conditional on the mercy of the employer or the government and the right to overtime wages and decent working conditions under the Factories Act of 1948 cannot be curtailed citing such grounds.“The notifications (exempting factories from the purview of Factories Act), in denying humane working conditions and overtime wages provided by law, are an affront to the workers’ right to life and right against forced labour…Financial losses cannot be offset on the weary shoulders of the labouring worker, who provides the backbone of the economy,” the bench, which also comprised justices Indu Malhotra and KM Joseph, said.The state cannot permit workers to be exploited in a manner that renders the hard-won protections of the Factories Act illusory and the constitutional promise of social and economic democracy into a paper tiger, the court added.It also alluded to the hardships faced by workers and migrant labourers due to Covid-19 and the lockdown imposed by the government. “The Covid-19 pandemic in India was accompanied with an immense migrant worker crisis, where several workers (including workers employed or contracted with factories) were forced to abandon their cities of work due to the halt in production which cut off their meagre source of income. The notifications in question legitimize the subjection of workers to onerous working conditions at a time when their feeble bargaining power stands whittled by the pandemic,” the judgment said.The labour and employment department of Gujarat had issued a notification on April 17 under Section 5 of the Factories Act to exempt all units registered under the Act “from various provisions relating to weekly hours, daily hours, intervals for rest etc. for adult workers”. The stated aim of the notification was to provide “certain relaxations for industrial and commercial activities” from April 20 to July 19. Another notification was issued on July 20 extending the relaxation until October 19.The notifications allowed factories to increase the daily limit of working hours from 9 to 12 with a 30-minute break after every 6 hours as opposed to every 5 hours before the notification. It also did away with the requirement to give double the wages for overtime work and provided that wages proportionate to the ordinary rate can be paid even for overtime work. The notification was issued under section 5 of the Factories Act, which allows the government to exempt industries from the purview of Factories Act on grounds of a public emergency. Section 5 defines public emergency as one that threatens the internal security of the country whether by war or external aggression or even internal disturbances. Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha and the Trade Union Centre of India had moved the top court challenging the notifications. The apex court held that section 5 cannot be invoked to provide a blanket exemption to all factories citing the Covid 19 pandemic and the contagion cannot be considered a public emergency threatening national security. “The pandemic has put a severe burden on existing, particularly public health, infrastructure and has led to a sharp decline in economic activities. However, it has not affected the security of India, or of a part of its territory in a manner that disturbs the peace and integrity of the country. The economic hardships caused by Covid–19 certainly pose unprecedented challenges to governance. However, such challenges are to be resolved by the State Governments within the domain of their functioning under the law, in coordination with the Central Government,” the court said.Unless the threshold of an economic hardship is so extreme that it leads to disruption of public order and threatens the security of India or of a part of its territory, recourse cannot be taken to such emergency powers, which are to be used sparingly under the law, the court added.The petitioners had argued that Section 5 of the Factories Act provides for exemption only in cases of public emergency and that too for a factory or class of factories and it does not empower the state to provide a blanket exemption for all factories.The court accepted this argument, ruling that section 5 of the Factories Act could not have been invoked to issue a blanket notification that exempted all factories from complying with humane working conditions and adequate compensation for overtime, as a response to a pandemic that did not result in an “internal disturbance” of a nature that posed a “grave emergency.”“We accordingly allow the writ petition and quash the notifications dated April 17 and July 20. We direct that overtime wages shall be paid, in accordance with the provisions of Section 59 of the Factories Act, to all eligible workers who have been working since the issuance of the notifications,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/denying-overtime-wages-affront-to-worker-s-right-to-life-sc-quashes-gujarat-govt-s-order/story-NzFjdRqRR1Ds2GVW1doN1M.html

The lawyers demanded the dismissal of the Yogi Adityanath government and imposition of President Rule, saying that the gang-rape of a Dalit woman and her brutalization amid a spate of crime against women in Uttar Pradesh has tarnished the image of the country and would flatten its progress graph.Also Read: Hathras victim’s father demands CBI probe alleging pressure from cops, administrationThe lawyers sought imposition of President Rule in a memorandum addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind that they gave to District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey.The agitating lawyers reached the district collectorate in a march from Civil Court under the banner of Adhivakta Sangharsh Samiti. During the march, the lawyers raised anti-government slogans and burnt effigies of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, accusing him of having failed in controlling the “soaring” crime graph against women in the state. Addressing reporters after leading the lawyers’ march, the advocates’ body convener Nahar Singh Yadav said the Yogi government has “totally failed in controlling the crime in the state, more so against women”.Also Read| Hathras gangrape: Police stifle protests after forcibly cremating victim“And the police, in turn, try to eliminate evidence in haste to hide the soaring crime graph as happened in the case of the gang-rape of the Dalit woman in Hathras who was forcibly cremated overnight by police,” said Yadav.“The gang-rape of the Dalit woman and her brutalization amid a spate of crime against women in Uttar Pradesh has tarnished the image of the country and would flatten its progress graph,” he added.The advocates’ body also Samiti demanded an impartial probe in the case under the supervision of a retired judge of the high court or the Supreme Court.“The case should be transferred in the fast track court of any other state,” said Yadav, adding the government must provide protection to the rape victim’s family.Also Read: No gathering permissible around India Gate area, says DCPThe lawyers’ body also demanded a government job, a house in Delhi and a compensation of Rs 2 crore for the Hathras gang-rape victim’s family.

In Aligarh, SP workers lodged a protest when they were stopped from moving towards Boolgarhi village in Hathras on Thursday. The SP workers were stopped on way to the village. They blocked the Agra-Aligarh road for an hour and were arrested by police which cleared the roadblock.  Congress leader Upendra Singh, along with others, moved from Agra towards Boolgarhi village in Hathras but were stopped at the border.The Valmiki (Dalit) community remained on strike in protest against the Hathras incident.“In the Hathras incident, the manner in which the BJP government delayed medical treatment to save some of its people and also postponed filing the FIR, has angered the families across the country...Instead of protecting the government through its spokespersons and through WhatsApp messages, it should get the matter investigated through the Supreme Court sitting judge,” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi. The woman, who was gang-raped on September 14, died in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday where she was brought on Monday from Aligarh Muslim University Medical College. A senior Uttar Pradesh police officer on Thursday said the forensic report has revealed that the woman was not raped. Meanwhile, yet another Dalit woman died in Balrampur district after two men raped her.BSP chief Mayawati on said, “In the wake of the law and order situation in the state and the flood of crimes against women, the central government should replace Yogi Adityanath with some ‘kaabil’ (capable) person and if this is not possible, president’s rule should be imposed in the state.” West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and said, “If a crime takes place, action has to be taken within 72 hours, as we have done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-mayawati-mamata-slam-up-govt/story-3m9YFmtxIhUlbXISj1LmXM.html
02-10-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Science published a paper based on one of the world’s largest contact tracing exercises on Wednesday. The study, covering 85,000 primary cases, was conducted in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu by a team of researchers led by Ramanan Laxminarayan of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy. The study tracked the spread (or non-spread) of the infection in around 575,000 contacts of the 85,000 to come up with some really interesting findings. HT reported those findings on Thursday. Still, given the magnitude of the exercise – I’d take any study with a sample as large as this one seriously – and the fact that it answers some very basic questions about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), some of the findings bear repetition in this dispatch. 1) Not everyone infected with the Sars-CoV2 virus, which causes Covid-19, passes it on We have known this for some time – but anecdotally. Previous instalments of this column have referred to the fact that not everyone who comes in contact with an infected person gets infected (or not every infected person passes the infection along; essentially, two ways of looking at the same event), and of how the majority of infections are caused by so-called superspreaders. The Science study quantifies these. For instance, it found that 70.7% of the 85,000 index patients (or primary cases) did not pass it on to any of their contacts, including close ones living in the same household. The reasons for this aren’t known. WATCH | Covid update: Germany flights cancelled; New York’s positivity rate rises2) Some of those infected with the Sars-Cov2 virus pass it on to far too many people These are the superspreaders referred to above, and the study found that 8% of the index patients were responsible for 60% of secondary infections. This means that around one in 12 people infected by the disease has a chance of becoming a superspreader (we still do not know why, although it is likely to be a combination of physiological, social and environmental factors). If only there was any way of identifying potential superspreaders… But here is where the study begins to get interesting. We have known all along that there are risks involved in coming in contact with an infected person, or being seated next to one on a long flight. The Science study quantifies these too. This is the kind of information actuaries could use to construct a risk matrix for daily activities. 3) The secondary attack rate – an index patient passing on the infection to a contact – is 10.7% If we were playing jeopardy, the question to this answer would be: What is the risk of a person contracting Covid-19 when exposed to someone already infected with the virus? And this too is in the case of “high-risk contacts”, according to the study – people who have had close physical and social contact with the infected individual, and without masks or other protective measures. For low-risk contacts, this probability is 4.7%. 4) The secondary attack rate is the highest for those sharing conveyance with an index patient for at least six hours – 79.3% This makes rail and (medium-duration) air travel the most risky. Most daily interactions outside the house (including in the workplace) fall under the study’s definition of low-risk criteria, something that should reassure those of us who have already returned to offices. Interestingly, while studying instances of like-infecting-like, the researchers found that “enhanced transmission in similar pairs” were the highest among children below the age of 14 and senior citizens over the age of 65 – findings that could have a bearing on school-opening strategies and also explain why care- and old-age homes in some parts of the world were ravaged by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-TaexGwXb8o41S1iocQdYgM.html
02-10-2020||India||4 months on, Govt to name members to SC/ST panel||The national commissions mandated to safeguard the rights of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and sanitation workers have been headless for months because the Union government is yet to appoint new office bearers to steer the three bodies.The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are constitutional bodies and the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis (NCSK) was constituted as a statutory body by an Act of Parliament. NCSC has been headless for the past four months; the top positions have been vacant in NCST and NCSK for longer. The term of the NCSC team led by its chairperson, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former MP Ram Shankar Katheria ended in May. Its vice-chairperson L Murugan has since been appointed as the president of the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit. BJP’s Nand Kumar Sai’s term as chairperson of NCST came to an end in February. BJP Gujarat leader Manhar Valjibhai Zala’s term as the chairperson of NCSK ended in April. A government functionary aware of the details said no meetings have been held to discuss potential replacements to head the constitutional bodies that have the powers to investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the Constitution. NCSC and NCST also have the mandate to inquire into specific complaints with respect to the deprivation of the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. “While the state governments and the Centre take action against atrocities against Dalits; the intervention of the commission is necessary and reassuring in case there is any laxity in probes or registering complaints. The commission also follows up with ensuring compensation is paid to the victims,” said a former NCSC functionary, requesting anonymity. Two recent acts of sexual assault and violence against Dalits have been reported from Uttar Pradesh -- an alleged gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras on September 14, who died in a New Delhi hospital on Tuesday; and the death of 22-year old Dalit girl from Balrampur on Wednesday, after being raped and brutalised. This is not the first time that NCSC has been without a chairperson. After the term of PL Punia as its chairperson ended in October 2016; Katheria was appointed to the constitutional body only in May 2017. Bhalchandra Mungekar, a former Rajya Sabha MP from the Congress, said, “...the formation of the commission is a statutory obligation. Their annual reports are tabled in Parliament along with the action taken reports by the government. Insensitivity to issues confronting the schedule castes is contrary to the {government’s} slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.’ SCs are the most deprived sections not only economically but also socially, culturally, educationally and politically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-months-on-govt-to-name-members-to-sc-st-panel/story-HiouWUrauAl1e4v6JpIHlM.html

This is the second case of electrocution in the state in a week. Amarjeet Rawat, in-charge Raipur police said the deceased identified as Rajveer Singh, was a labourer. “Around 6 pm, we got information that one labourer had died due to electrocution. We immediately rushed there and came to know that he had gone to urinate near an electric where he got electrocuted and died on the spot,” he said. Rawat said the deceased hailed from Moradabad in Uttara Pradesh and used to work in Dehradun as a labourer. “We have sent the body to the mortuary. Post mortem of the body will be conducted on Friday,” he said. Rajneesh Aggarwal, chief engineer Garhwal zone of Uttarakhand Power Corporation Ltd (UPCL) said he has directed superintending engineer (SE) of the area concerned to submit a report to him by Friday. “The SE has himself gone to the spot and by morning he will apprise me regarding what actually happened there and what led to the electrocution of the labourer. Based on his report, further action will be taken in the matter” On September 25, a man was electrocuted when a high-tension wire fell on him in Haldwani area of Nainital district. On September 27, taking cognisance of the incident, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat ordered an inquiry into the matter. Following the inquiry, the state government on September 30 issued orders for suspension of five officials of UPCL for dereliction of their duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-electrocuted-in-dehradun-while-urinating-near-electric-pole/story-bSiCuLimJMBGbOSuV3DatI.html
02-10-2020||India||Hathras gangrape: Police stifle protests after forcibly cremating victim||The Uttar Pradesh administration sealed off Hathras and the UP Police arrested Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra after scuffles with party workers on Thursday, as protests escalated over the alleged gang rape and murder of a woman whose family said she was forcibly cremated in the dead of the night to scuttle growing public anger.The former Congress president and his sister, who is also the general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, were on their way to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, where the administration enforced restrictions against public assembly of five or more people and barred the entry of media persons.Watch: Rahul & Priyanka Gandhi Vs UP cops over march to Hathras; duo arrestedThe Congress has sought chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation over the Hathras incident, as have several other rivals of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said on Thursday that Adityanath must be replaced or the Centre should put the state under President’s rule. Also Read: ‘Media will go, we’ll still be here’: Top official on visit to Hathras familyMeanwhile, UP cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh accused the Congress of “politicising the incident”.On the Yamuna Expressway, roughly an hour’s drive from the national capital, a Congress convoy was stopped by the state police, forcing Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and their party colleagues to walk. A group of policemen attempted to physically stop them, resulting in scuffles with party workers. At one point, Rahul Gandhi fell to the ground as a policeman attempted to stop him from moving forward. Video footage showed a messy scuffle, with, at one stage, the policemen pushing Gandhi and later body tackling him.

The party leaders, who were arrested at 3.40pm, on the Yamuna Expressway, were taken to a facility at the Buddh International Circuit close by before being driven back to the national capital, accompanied by UP Police. The two were later booked for violating provisions of the epidemic diseases act that is in place for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.The BJP called the Gandhis’ attempt to visit Hathras “political tourism”. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the suspects arrested for the alleged gang rape and murder would be punished. “The probe teams are carrying out the investigation, but I think there should not be political tourism...,” he said.The woman was allegedly raped and brutalised by four dominant-caste men on September 14 when she had gone to the fields in her village to gather cattle fodder. Left partially paralysed and admitted for treatment in the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College of Aligarh Muslim University, she was shifted to New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital when her condition did not improve. She died on Tuesday morning.Police on Thursday, however, contended that there was no rape — and referred to the first charge sheet filed in the matter that did not mention rape — contradicting a statement given by the victim in the Aligarh hospital days before she died. Conflicting videos did the rounds, increasing the murkiness around the crime (a young woman’s death, at the least), and highlighting efforts to spin the narrative. Anger has mounted since the predawn cremation of the woman on Wednesday that her family said had been forced by the Uttar Pradesh authorities. Protests took place in Hathras, where the police were deployed in strength. Elsewhere in UP and in major metropolitan cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, political party workers and ordinary citizens held demonstrations for a second consecutive day on Thursday.Priyanka Gandhi alleged that the police used “lathis” on Congress workers and that many of them were injured. “The sticks of an egotistical government cannot stop us. I wish these lathis were used by this police while standing in defence of Hathras’s Dalit daughter,” she tweeted in Hindi.Rahul Gandhi was seen asking the UP Police under which law he was being stopped and insisted that he would proceed alone towards Hathras to meet the rape victim’s family, given that section 144, which prohibits large gatherings, had been imposed. “Can you tell me under which law can you stop me from marching towards Hathras? I want to go alone to Hathras and on what basis can you arrest me,” he asked, to which police officials replied that he had violated section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for disobeying orders promulgated by the government during the Covid-19 pandemic. Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police of Gautam Budh Nagar, said section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) had been enforced in the district. “Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and about 50 party workers were booked under section 188 of IPC (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). They were released on personal bond in the evening,” he said. Kumar said the police used mild force to disperse the crowd and denied there was a lathi-charge.Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, BSP‘s Mayawati and Trinamool Congress’s Mamata Banerjee lashed out at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Condemnation also came in from the chief ministers of Kerala and Punjab, while protests were held by cadres of SP, in addition to those by Congress workers, across multiple cities in Uttar Pradesh. In Aligarh, SP workers lodged a protest when they were stopped from moving towards Boolgarhi village in Hathras on Thursday. Azad Samaj Party chief and Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad too demanded President’s Rule in Uttar Pradesh, saying the constitutional machinery in the state failed to curb crimes against Dalits. Azad said he has started a “dharna” at his home in Saharanpur where he is put under a “house arrest”, which was ordered by the local police on Wednesday.The Dalit activist was accompanying the family of the 19-year-old woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped in UP’s Hathras, to their home but was detained midway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-stifle-protests-after-forcibly-cremating-victim/story-IxbvcTnsIjATUd4rU8TBbO.html

Simple hurt constituted the highest proportion of total crimes against Scheduled Castes (28.89%), and rape of SC women made up 7.59% of the total registered crimes. Activists said the figures pointed towards the vulnerability of SCs.“Every day, nine Dalit women are raped in this country, this just shows the total lawlessness in this country!

What can we expect from a state that has the highest crimes against Dalits?” asked Beena Pallical of the National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights. Raja Bagga, a senior officer at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, pointed out that police filed charge sheets in 78% cases of crimes against SCs nationally. “Abysmal charge sheeting rates of 34% and 49% in Jharkhand and Rajasthan respectively is a reflection of how the police investigates caste atrocity cases. The most curious case is of Rajasthan where the police in 2905 cases ( 40% of the 7374 cases under investigation) of crimes against SC submitted a final report, i.e closed the case as false,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-reported-25-of-crimes-against-scs/story-13sLTLV0JXhI0vJnGqFaOP.html
02-10-2020||India||Hathras case: Cops contradict victim’s statement||The Uttar Pradesh Police cited forensic reports on Thursday to deny that the 19-year-old Dalit woman, whose death and forced cremation sparked nationwide outrage, was raped, contradicting statements by the victim and her mother. Additional director general (ADG) of UP police, Prashant Kumar, said forensic examination revealed that the woman, who succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on Tuesday, was not raped. WATCH | Hathras horror: UP cop cites forensic report, says no rape“The samples did not have sperm and thus makes it clear that no rape or gang rape took place with the girl,” he said. Hathras district magistrate Praveen Kumar also denied gang-rape charges. Experts pointed to lapses in the medical examination procedure, which occurred eight days after the alleged rape, and said it violated national and international guidelines that say the scrutiny must be done at the earliest in cases of sexual assault. Also Read: Hathras gangrape: Police stifle protests after forcibly cremating victim“For India, guidelines laid down by the Union ministry of health and family welfare say the medical examination must happen within four days of the assault. However, internationally, countries also collect samples up to seven days. After seven days, chances are usually bleak of finding any evidence of consequence,” said a senior forensic expert from a government hospital on condition of anonymity. Activists said the rape allegations notwithstanding, the murder of a young Dalit woman needed to be strictly punished. “The death of the girl points to the impunity enjoyed by the Thakur caste in the region. The strictest punishment is needed in this heinous case,” said Sumedha Boudh of the Rashtriya Dalit Mahila Adhikar Andolan. The woman, who hailed from the Valmiki caste, was allegedly gang-raped by four men from the Thakur caste on September 14. She was first moved to the district hospital in Aligarh, where her statement was recorded on September 22, and finally shifted to Delhi on September 28.

Also Read: Rahul Gandhi, sister Priyanka detained; not allowed to march to Hathras to meet UP woman’s familyOn Thursday, Safdarjung hospital issued the woman’s death summary and autopsy report, which mentioned strangulation, cervical injuries, sepsis and cardiopulmonary arrest as the final diagnosis. The private parts showed healed tears and wounds, said the postmortem report. Citing a report by Agra’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Kumar said some people misrepresented the facts to disturb social harmony and create caste violence. “Police took immediate action in the case and now we will identify those who tried to disturb social harmony and law and order,” he said. Also Read: Under fire for supporting actors, Ramdas Athawale to meet Hathras victim’s familyKumar said the woman in her first statement to police didn’t mention rape initially. The case FIR filed at Chandpa police station on September 14 also initially mentioned attempt to murder, and sections concerning rape were added eight days later. On Thursday, unverified videos showing the mother and the daughter making these statements did the rounds as the battle of narratives heated up. But the victim’s family pointed to statements by the woman in hospital and her mother that alleged rape. In a declaration recorded before the magistrate on September 22, the woman named all four men -- Sandip Singh, Ramu Singh, Ravi Singh and Lavkush Singh, who have been arrested – and said she was raped by them. “She said she was afraid to leave the house because she was harassed for six months by the men,” said a person who was present when the statement was being recorded.Also Read: Govt may declare Hathras village a Covid containment zone, says DMThe statement of the mother, also recorded at the same time, mentioned that the upper-caste families had been hostile to them for years. The victim’s grandfather had, in 2001, filed cases against the families of Ramu and Sandip of criminal intimidation, hurt and under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. That case was settled in 2015. These declarations, experts said, should be treated by police as important pieces of evidence. “The dying declaration is the most important piece of statement. Such a statement made in front of a magistrate is enough to land a person in jail for life,” said former UP director general of police Vikram Singh. Lucknow-based legal expert Rohit Kant said when the woman alleged rape in her statement before death, then all FSL and postmortem reports became irrelevant. “The victim’s word should be given priority,” he said. At the village, a three-member special investigation team visited the family and questioned them while authorities imposed prohibitory orders and barricaded all entry points. Earlier in the day, local police said three constables on duty in the village had displayed Covid-like symptoms and that the entire area may be categorised as a containment zone (something that would effectively make it off limits to visitors) but by evening the Hathras chief medical officer said no such zone had been set up at the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-cops-contradict-victim-s-statement/story-ZZLwQAdckGVk2jZAWcAmyL.html

The bail application in that case will come for hearing on October 13,” Santanu Barthakur, counsel for Gogoi, said.The leader of Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), Gogoi was arrested on December 12 last year for allegedly inciting violence during the anti-CAA stir. He was later handed over to NIA and a court here sent him to 10 days custody of the agency on December 17. He was taken to New Delhi the same day for questioning.Gogoi was brought back to Guwahati on December 25 and has been in judicial custody ever since.The Gauhati high court, in July, granted him bail in connection with three separate cases filed by the Assam police for inciting violence during the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anti-caa-stir-nia-court-gives-bail-to-akhil-gogoi/story-9Bz1Xj3hhz7elMK4ymfYiI.html
02-10-2020||India||How Covid-19 has gripped India’s urban centres||In the first six months of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, three cities – Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai – were the main urban epicentres of the disease. But a massive spike in cases in Bengaluru through September has propelled the southern city to the second spot ahead of Mumbai and Chennai. While one in every seven cases in the country can be traced to just these four metropolitan hotspots, they have fared much worse in terms of death – one in every five deaths in India has been in these cities. A look at four factors that explain how the pandemic has gripped India’s urban centres.Cases still rising alarmingly in Mumbai and BengaluruDelhi remains, by a large margin, the country’s worst-hit city (279,715 infections as of Sept 30), but it appears to have started bringing under control its daily case trajectory for the second time. At its peak (so far), the seven day average of daily cases in the city touched 4,174 on September 17.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todaySince then, this number has dropped to 3,275 (Sept 30). Bengaluru, meanwhile, saw a massive spike in cases in the past few weeks and is now the city with the second highest number of cases in India.In Mumbai, the case trajectory has touched new highs in September, and appears to be rising still. Chennai is the only city among the four metros that has seen a big drop from its peak – average daily cases have dropped 40% from the peak recorded in early July.Mumbai’s CFR significantly worse than othersBy a large margin, Mumbai has been the country’s worst-hit city in terms of deaths due to Covid-19. As on Wednesday, out of the 205,268 infections reported in the city, 8,929 people have lost their lives — the highest number of deaths of any city. This also translates to a case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases – of 4.3%, again the worst among the metropolitan cities listed here. Chennai has reported 3,207 deaths from 167,376 cases till Wednesday. While it has the second-worst CFR (2.6%), in absolute numbers it has the lowest deaths among these cities. In fact, in terms of total deaths, Pune has more fatalities than Chennai and Bengaluru. The average CFR across the country is 1.6%, Bengaluru (CFR of 1.3%) is the only city that has so far performed better.Bengaluru’s active cases alarmingly highActive cases is a statistic that does not paint a good picture for Bengaluru. The IT hub (47,145 active cases as on Wednesday) has 43% more active cases than Delhi (26,908), which is on second spot. To be sure, Bengaluru’s case outbreak is a lot more recent than other metros listed here, and the daily recoveries are yet to catch up to the spike in cases.Watch | Covid update: Germany flights cancelled; New York’s positivity rate rises Active cases – those still under treatment – is a key metric because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in any region. It is calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally. With 26,663 active cases, Mumbai is close on the heels of Delhi. Pune (16,545 active cases) is the city with the fourth-highest number of active cases in the country , ahead of Chennai (11,323).The district of Pune (57,298 active cases) is the one with the highest number of active cases in the country, followed by Bengaluru and Thane. Out of the seven districts with the highest number of active cases, five are from Maharashtra – a statistic that highlights the sheer magnitude of the outbreak in the worst-hit state in the country.By districts, Pune worst-hit by a large marginWhen looking at the country’s worst-hit districs, we see Pune is country’s worst-hit region with 293,064 confirmed cases as of Wednesday. Delhi with 279,715 total infections comes close . Most major metropolitan cities in the country are districts by themselves – with the exception of Delhi, which consists of 11 revenue districts, but has been taken as a single unit as the state government does not release district-wise data. Similarly, district wise breakup of cases was not available for some states such as Telangana and Assam.One out of every four cases reported in the country can be traced to the 10 worst-hit districts. The four metropolitan cities — Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Chennai — all feature in this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-has-gripped-india-s-urban-centres/story-KK9AzPfHqQD6augurJ90uO.html
02-10-2020||India||A review of economy in 1st half of FY 2020-21||The first high-frequency economic indicator released in October has brought good news on the economic front. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing clocked a value of 56.8 in September. This is the highest reading in over eight-and-a-half years, according to IHS Markit, the agency that conducts the survey. September is the second consecutive month PMI manufacturing has been above the neutral threshold of 50. The revival in August and September is in keeping with an improvement in the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) during the period. NIBRI improved from around 70 to above 80 between July and September. These improvements notwithstanding, experts maintain that the economy continues to face significant headwinds on the road to sustained growth revival. While the September quarter GDP numbers will only be released in November, other high frequency indicators will give a better picture of the economy in the next few days. PMI manufacturing rose to a record 56.8 in September. A PMI value above 50 signifies expansion in economic activity. Average PMI manufacturing in the quarter ending September was 51.6, a sharp rise from the average value of 35.1 in the June quarter. The revival in PMI, however, has not been able to prevent job losses – on account of the difficulty in hiring workers as well as social distancing norms for the coronavirus disease, leading to a reduction in the workforce – and employment fell for six consecutive months. “While uncertainty about the Covid-19 pandemic remains, producers can at least for now enjoy the recovery”, said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. PMI revival need not translate into actual growth in manufacturing. “The improvement in PMI for September was expected and corresponds to the Unlock process that is prevalent in the economy. While the PMI at 56.8 does reflect significant improvement over August and the other preceding months, it does not present a picture on the year-on-year numbers which will be out when the IIP {Index of Industrial Production} numbers are announced, which will be in the negative zone”, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at CARE Ratings. Also Read: September’s GST revenue best of this fiscal as business activity picks upExperts advise caution in reading too much into PMI numbers. “PMIs are a sluggish measure and managers end up comparing the current month to the last few months rather than just the last month, bringing in some inertia. As such, PMIs may not be ideal for tracking turning points”, a research note by Pranjul Bhandari and others from HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Private Ltd pointed out in July. Recent statistics support this argument. For example, the index of eight core sector industries contracted (on an annual basis) 8.5% in August compared to 8% in July. However, PMI manufacturing improved from 46 in July to 52 in August. As rising Covid-19 infections cloud consumer and business sentiment, investment demand remained weak. According to the capital expenditure database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), both new investment announcements and investment projects paint a grim picture. New investment announcements (by value) contracted by 82% in the quarter ending September, the highest since June 1996, the earliest period for which data is available. Annual contraction in the value of investment projects completed recovered from its all-time high of 72.9% in the June quarter, perhaps a result of the unlocking of the economy. Yet, it saw the second highest contraction of 62.9% in the September quarter. Also Read: India’s fiscal federalism crisis is not the pandemic’s creationIn another development on the capex front, cumulative central government capital expenditure in the current fiscal year fell below last year’s levels in August after having remained high until July. According to figures released by the Controller General of Accounts(CGA), which works under the ministry of finance, total capital expenditure in April-August was Rs 1,34,447 crore against Rs 1,36,176 crore in the same period last year. With state finances confronting a crunch, capex by state governments is unlikely to keep up with last year’s levels. In an interview to HT, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she was open to the idea of a second fiscal stimulus. While the Atmanirbhar Bharat package announced in the month of May was to the tune of 10% of India’s GDP, its fiscal component was much smaller, at just over 1% of GDP. To be sure, there is little clarity on how the centre will finance a second stimulus. CGA numbers show that all revenue heads except union excise duties had lower realisations than last year until August. The government has kept its borrowing limit for 2020-21 unchanged at Rs 12 lakh crore, a figure which was decided in May. At least two set of numbers will be required for greater clarity on the nature of the ongoing economic recovery. The first is PMI services (to be released in the next couple of days) for September. The second set of numbers, which should have been released on October 1, are the trends from Reserve Bank of India’s bimonthly forward-looking surveys, especially the consumer confidence survey (CCS). Also Read: Retail inflation grew at 6.7% in AugustPMI services has contracted for six consecutive months now. The service sector has a bigger share in both output and employment than manufacturing. Unless there is a broad-based revival in services, aggregate demand would continue to remain tepid. The fact that the latest Unlock guidelines announced on Wednesday have allowed resumption of most economic activity except international flights should give a boost to normalisation of service sector activity. Whether the tailwinds from Unlock will be overpowered by headwinds from infections remains to be seen. With rising cases of Covid-19, weakness in labour markets and continuing economic uncertainty, consumer behaviour might have shifted towards increasing precautionary savings. Consumer sentiment on key metrics such as the current economic situation, employment and spending on non-essential items had plummeted to an all-time low in July. If the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting had not been postponed from Tuesday to Thursday, the results of the consumer confidence survey would have been out on Thursday. The CCS numbers will indicate whether consumers will go out and spend during the coming festive season or save as much as they can for fear of worse times ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-review-of-economy-in-1st-half-of-fy-2020-21/story-P0P6edDmsT29FHThv4XQjI.html
02-10-2020||India||Rs 7,800 crore border network system cleared by govt||The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has approved the creation of a secure communication system for the army at a cost of Rs 7,800 crore, a significant move that will enhance network coverage in forward areas including the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) and provide a major boost to the operational preparedness of the army “especially keeping in view the current operational situation at the LAC,” the defence ministry said on Thursday. Separately, the ministry inked a Rs 409-crore contract with a private company for the first time to supply a million hand grenades to the army to replace a World War-II vintage design currently in use, in what will provide a boost to the Make in India initiative, officials said. Also Read: ‘No war, no peace in Ladakh,’ says IAF chief RKS BhadauriaWatch: India made laser-guided anti-tank guided missile successfully test-firedThe CCS cleared the long-pending proposal for establishing the Army Static Switched Communication Network (ASCON) Phase IV, with the project to be implemented by Indian Telephone Industries Limited --- a public sector firm under the department of telecommunication, ministry of communications --- under a Rs 7,796-crore contract signed on Thursday. The communication network will be functional in three years. “The project will provide better survivability, responsiveness and high bandwidth in any operational scenario and enhance the communication coverage of network closer to the International Border, Line of Control and Line of Actual Control,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The army had been pursuing the project for a few years to upgrade its communication facilities in remote areas. Also Read: China’s resurrection of 1959 LAC claim may be first step. India preps for falloutThe network will extend the high bandwidth communication to the remote operational areas in central and eastern sectors and enhance communication reach to the forward locations in the western border too, officials said. The statement said the project would augment the army’s communication network in sensitive operational areas and provide a major boost to its operational preparedness, especially keeping in view the current situation at the LAC, where India and China have been locked in a border row for more than five months and both sides have made arrangements for the long haul in the eastern Ladakh theatre. Also Read: India moves terrain-hugging Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range to defend LACExperts welcomed the move to set up the network. “The ASCON Phase IV has been in the offing for quite some time now and it’s good that the government has approved it now. It will provide modern communication facilities and enhance the army’s network coverage in different sectors,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). The project marks a significant communications technology upgrade. “The project is a strategic and theatre area communication network which will upgrade the existing Asynchronous Transfer Mode Technology to Internet Protocol (IP)/Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Technology. Optical fibre cable, microwave radio and satellite will be used as the communication media,” the statement said. The ASCON Phase IV project is expected to provide a boost to the local industry as it has an indigenous content of almost 80%. It will involve several activities including execution of civil works, laying of optical fibre cable and tower construction, and generate employment in remote border areas, the statement said. “The project is also a big opportunity for the public sector to showcase its capability and provide impetus to the Indian economy and will be a step in the direction of achieving the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” it added. In another move expected to provide thrust to the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat {Self-Reliant India), the defence ministry signed a contract with Nagpur-based private firm Economic Explosives Ltd (EEL) for supplying 1 million multi-mode hand grenades to the army. These will replace a World War-II vintage hand grenade design being used by the army, the ministry said in another statement. EEL will deliver the new grenades over two years. The multi-mode hand grenade has been designed by the Chandigarh-based Terminal Ballistic Research Laboratories (TBRL) --- a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory --- and will be produced by EEL. “This is a flagship project showcasing public-private partnership, enabling ‘AtmaNirbharta’ in cutting edge ammunition technologies and accomplishes 100% indigenous content,” the statement added. Multi-purpose grenades figure on the list of 101 types of weapons and ammunition whose import India will ban progressively over the next five years. The government published the negative import list in August to give a push to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7k-cr-border-network-system-cleared-by-govt/story-FpII48duUnzHNa7OCGEbKL.html
02-10-2020||India||Satyagraha in South Africa||A young lawyer of 24, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi arrived in Durban in early 1893 to serve as counsel to a local merchant. In June that year, he was asked to travel to Pretoria which required him to first travel to Pietermaritzburg and then take another connection.On the train, Gandhi was seated in the first-class compartment when a white man entered the compartment, recoiled at the sight of a brown man, and summoned railway officials. Gandhi was ordered to go to the van compartment as the officials harshly told him that “coolies” were not allowed in the first-class compartment. Gandhi resisted, producing his ticket and refusing to budge , only to be pushed out of the train, his luggage tossed at the station after him, in Pietermaritzburg.Also read: Gandhi: The chronicler“It was winter and the cold was extremely bitter. My overcoat was in my luggage but I didn’t dare ask for it lest I should be insulted again, so I sat and shivered,” Gandhi later wrote in his autobiography, The Story of My Experiments With Truth.This incident is almost universally described as the moment of the Mahatma’s political awakening. And yet, his travails didn’t end there.Gandhi continued his journey on the next day, but when he made it to Charlestown and had to take a stagecoach, he was made to sit with the coachman on the box outside because the white conductor and passengers wouldn’t have it otherwise. A scuffle ensued with the conductor soon after and Gandhi was beaten up; the blows stopped only after some other passengers intervened.Today, if the world views Gandhi as a civil rights icon who freed India and birthed a unique form of political protest that reverberates even today, much of it is owed to South Africa, and the humiliation that sparked his political awakening there.Contested legacyAnd yet, his views and writing as a young lawyer in a nation torn by apartheid continues to be the most bitterly contested part of his legacy with a growing cohort of activists and academics coming to see Gandhi as not liberating but as a racist who looked down on local residents.Gandhi’s time in South Africa came into sharper focus on the eve of his 150th birth anniversary last year when the Johannesburg City Council debated a motion to remove his name and statue from the city centre.The motion — along with leaders of the Rhodes Must Fall movement, which has demanded the removal of statues and memorabilia connected to the English colonialist Cecil Rhodes because of his racism — said Gandhi was prejudiced in his treatment towards Black South Africans, routinely used the pejorative term Kaffirs and viewed Indians as being superior to them.Also read: When Gandhi stood trial for sedition“Ours is one continuous struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness,” Gandhi told a meeting after spending three years in South Africa.The petition — brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party — acknowledged that Gandhi undertook efforts to understand the local people and that his views changed in latter years.“In this view, Gandhi is branded as a“reformed racist”, who despite having positively transformed and shed his early prejudice against Africans— does not deserve to be forgiven,” wrote Eric Itzkin, the author of Gandhi’s Johannesburg: Birthplace of Satyagraha, in the Hindustan Times.In some ways, this reconfiguring of Gandhi’s history is not new. In India, academics and Dalit activists have for long questioned his views on untouchability and said his clashes with Dr BR Ambedkar underlined his problematic views on caste.But many others studying Gandhi have called for a more nuanced debate on the matter. Writing in the Hindustan Times, Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie, a senior professor at the history department of the University of the Western Cape and the great-grand-daughter of Gandhi, noted that the debate on social media ignores the changes Gandhi went through in subsequent years when he sought to travel third class in trains to get a taste of what Africans experienced.In defence of GandhiShe pointed out that Indian Opinion — a newspaper Gandhi started — published news about African grievances, restricted land rights and daily discrimination. Gandhi’s final campaign in 1913, which drew Indian women to become passive resisters for the first time, was inspired by the struggle of African women against the Pass laws (which stipulated that Africans in urban areas had to carry a Pass on their person or face prosecution).Itzkin noted that Gandhi’s time in Johannesburg from 1903 to 1913 was a formative period during which time he developed the philosophy of satyagraha.In his landmark speech to the Young Men’s Christian Association, delivered in Johannesburg on May 18, 1908, Gandhi spoke of his vision of an inclusive, multiracial society in South Africa: “If we look into the future, is it not a heritage that we leave to posterity that all the different races commingle and produce a civilisation that perhaps the world has not yet seen?” In his article, British historian David Arnold noted that Gandhi’s time in South Africa was marked by his faith in the empire and its sense of justice. And yet, it didn’t stop him from demolishing the moral authority of the empire in his 1909 book Hind Swaraj.“There was nothing moral about railways or Western-style colleges and hospitals. There was nothing moral about people starving; about taxing salt; about the violence that underpinned the Raj. Gandhi punctured the moral balloon of British rule in India and it never recovered from that spectacular deflation,” he wrote.In South Africa, too, many now say it’s important to see Gandhi’s whole persona, his early missteps and his later contribution — a fact underlined by the massive loss of the EFF motion, 226-20. And, of course, none other than Nelson Mandela, who was inspired by Gandhi, also defended him.Itzkin wrote that Mandela was aware of the racist statements made by Gandhi when he was young but in an article in 1999, argued that the Mahatma must be forgiven those prejudices, and be judged in the context of the time and circumstances.“We are looking here at the young Gandhi, still to become the Mahatma, when he was without any human prejudice save that in favour of truth and justice,” Mandela wrote.After all, as Dhupelia-Mesthrie noted, who can claim at 45 to be the same person they were at 24?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mk-gandhi-s-south-africa-days/story-7sBXEutMT6dt95XLAFWINL.html
02-10-2020||India||Gandhi: A determined chronicler||Growing up in the princely state of Porbandar, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s older brother, Laxmidas, did not imagine that the youngster, who did passably well in his studies and exhibited a love for theatre, would ever become a journalist. The best he hoped for was that Gandhi would study enough to become a barrister and a diwan of the state. For a while, it was touch and go, as Gandhi himself pointed out in his autobiography, My Experiments With Truth, that he wrote many years later. Fate, however, had other plans for the young MK.After training in law and clearing the London bar, Gandhi turned his sights to South Africa, then a British colony. He migrated in 1893 to work for the offices of Dada Abdulla and Company. His own experience with apartheid, the system of racial segregation institutionalised by the colonial authorities against the Black and other non-White populations (including brown-skinned Gandhi) was a rude awakening for the 24-year-old.Also read: Gandhi and his worldviewIn 1903, he started Indian Opinion, which “regularly published news about African grievances about restricted land rights and daily petty discrimination and commended African achievements,” his great grand-daughter, Uma Dhupelia-Mesthrie, a professor of history at the University of Western Cape, pointed out in an essay that she wrote for the Hindustan Times as part of the Gandhi: 150 Years On series to commemorate the sesquicentennial birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation. But Gandhi was always more than a journalist. He fought for freedoms large and small, and the news journals that he started and/ or edited through his 78 years — six in all, including Harijan, but he was a prolific writer and his pieces appeared in many places, including in this paper — served to amplify his deeply held beliefs. “Gandhi used Indian Opinion to mobilise readers, to educate them about an ethical and moral lifestyle and to highlight the harsh conditions of indentured workers on the estates and mines. His thoughts on what constituted good journalism, one free from advertisers, began to crystallise in this period. He also used the paper to establish his own leadership of the movement. It is this Gandhi and the man who went on to lead India’s liberation struggle, who would inspire generations of South African resisters,” Dhupelia-Mesthrie wrote.It was in South Africa that Gandhi gave up his flourishing legal practice; established the Phoenix Settlement where he lived with wife Kasturba and four sons, Harilal, Manilal, Ramdas and Devdas, along with other Indian settlers, and from where he published Indian Opinion; and formulated campaigns of Satyagraha. Gandhi left the running of the paper to the trustees of Phoenix farm (Manilal was one of its longest serving editors) when he returned to India in 1915, touching down in the port city where he once dreamt of becoming a solicitor while walking the corridors of the Bombay high court.Young IndiaIt didn’t take too long for Gandhi to start newspapers in India. As his grandson Gopal Krishna Gandhi wrote for the Hindustan Times series, “Young India (YI) was to become, for the duration of its lifetime (1919-1932), English-educated India’s premier thought partner.”“The year it was founded in was, for India, a year of rage. The draconian Rowlatt Act restricting civil liberties in the name of the First World War, followed by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and what came to be called “The Punjab Wrong”, were the chief concerns of this weekly of eight very thin pages. Its editorials made it, literally, a page turner in India’s public life of the time,” Gopal Gandhi wrote.The same year, in August, Gandhi had already started a Gujarati weekly called Navajivan, true to his belief that the majority of India lived in the villages and did not speak a word of English. If the messages of Satyagraha, Civil Disobedience, Hindu-Muslim unity — all central to Gandhi’s activism in the freedom struggle — was to reach them, vernacular press was the way to go. Young India, however, was started to reach out to “Educated India”, and to readers especially in the Madras Presidency. The paper, which worked on a subscription-only model — Gandhi did not want “advertisement soiling its pages” — went on to attain a circulation of 1,200 copies in its initial few weeks (it cost an anna per copy); by 1922, it had reached a weekly sales figure of 40,000.Also read: MK Gandhi’s South Africa daysThe paper went on to be edited by other stalwarts of the freedom struggle: Shoaib Qureshi, a son-in-law of Mohammed Ali, the Khilafat leader, C. Rajagopalachari, George Joseph, J C Kumarappa and Jairamdas Doulatram.“It became more than a thought-partner, a thought-maker and thought-changer.“Educated India” became an eager student of Young India,” Gopal Gandhi wrote.This is not to say that Gandhi held a very high opinion of the state of the Indian press at the time.In an April 1924 piece for Navajivan, he wrote: “Dr. (MA) Ansari [a Congressman] writes to say that those [north Indian] papers regard it as their duty to… spread false rumours, to calumniate each other’s religion and thereby to vilify each other. It seems this has become a means of increasing the circulation of their papers. How to stop this infection from spreading has become a big problem.” Power of the editorialThis also probably explains why, speaking at the inauguration of the Hindustan Times in September 1924, Gandhi remarked that seeing the conditions in the country at the time, he would stop the printing of all newspapers except Young India, if he could. “Every word and sentence published in the paper should be weighed.There should not only be no untrue statements, but no suggestio falsi or suppressio veri,” he told the small crowd that had gathered for the inauguration of the printing press of the Hindustan Times. Eight days later, the first edition was taken out, with each letter painstaking hand-pressed. Gandhi knew the power of a strongly worded editorial. In February 1943, when the British released a pamphlet, Congress responsibility for the Disturbances, 1942-43, over the 1942 Quit India resolution, Gandhi — then imprisoned at the Aga Khan palace in Poona —responded with a letter, several pages long and exhaustive in its defence of the call for political freedom. The letter was published in seven instalments in the Hindustan Times. Gandhi was a prolific writer and chronicler. Ramachandra Guha, author of two definitive Gandhi biographies offers a glimpse of it in his essay, A biographer’s journey: In search of the Mahatma, in which he wrote: “The Collected Works are indispensable to any scholar of Gandhi. In writing my own two-volume biography of the Mahatma, I found more than half-a-dozen nuggets in this capacious and lovingly curated collection. However, I knew from the beginning that I had to go much beyond this printed series of books. The Collected Works had all the known letters that Gandhi himself wrote; but virtually none of the letters that he received or responded to. Then there were the thousands of letters written about Gandhi by his contemporaries and critics, which I wanted to study as well.”Tridip Suhrud, who recently published a critical edition of Gandhi’s autobiography and authored The Diary of Manu Gandhi: 1943-1944, also wrote about the various people who have written about MK Gandhi over generations. In his piece titled Essential Reading on MK Gandhi, he wrote that the most authoritative writer of Gandhi was Gandhi himself. “But of course, the best on Gandhi is Gandhi himself. His autobiography is a text for those seeking an ally in troubled times; Hind Swaraj continues to exasperate readers, new and old alike; his idiosyncratic Key to Health remains his best selling book. For all those who have leisure, volumes of his collected writings are highly recommended,” Suhrud wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gandhi-the-chronicler/story-7Y5IyZtIAcQfeyOuot7D2I.html

Though several countries have opened their skies for international flights, there are several checks and balances. India and the UAE are part of an air bubble agreement, which allows airlines of both the countries to carry passengers. But Dubai has imposed several additional conditions on Indians flying to Dubai.On September 18, Dubai authorities suspended all Air India Express flights temporarily for 15 days for allegedly carrying coronavirus positive patients to the UAE city twice. The ban was lifted a day after. The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority also penalised Air India Express to bear all medical and quarantine expenditures of the Covid-19 positive patients who have been ferried to Dubai.Test from these labs not validThe authorities in Dubai has also specified four Indian labs whose test results are not be considered valid. It has asked Air India Express to reject negative RT-PCR test reports of these labs: Suryam Lab, Jaipur; Microhealth lab, Kerala; Dr P Bhasin Pathlabs (P) Ltd in Delhi and Noble Diagnostic Centre, also in Delhi. #FlyWithIXAttention Passengers travelling to Dubai! pic.twitter.com/uxPAmsA60U“The certificate must be in English, if no in Arabic.

02-10-2020||India||More outrage, protests after Hathras victim’s cremation||The hurried cremation of the Hathras gang-rape victim was meant to suppress protests and chief minister Yogi Adityanath must resign, opposition political readers said on Wednesday, while also demanding the case be shifted outside of Uttar Pradesh. The slugfest intensified after the family of the 19-year-old Dalit victim alleged that they had been forced by UP police to perform her last rites in the stealth of the night. The police said they had the consent of the kin. Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the people of the country are sad and angry over the gruesome incident and said the “Nirbhaya of Hathras did not die but was killed by a cruel and insensitive government and its administration”. WATCH: Hathras horror: ‘Cars can overturn in UP’ says BJP leader; Congress slams Yogi“What kind of justice is this? What kind of a government is this? You think you can do anything and the nation will sit and watch. Never, the nation will speak against your injustice. On behalf of the Congress party, I demand justice for the family. India belongs to everyone. Everyone has the right to live with dignity. The Constitution has given us this right. We will not allow the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] to break the country and violate the Constitution,” the Congress president said in a video message. Also Read: Resolve the Hathras rape case swiftlyCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanded the resignation of the chief minister, who said he had formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the September 14 gangrape, in the course of which the woman was brutalised by four men.Tagging Adityanath, Priyanka Priyanka, who oversees her party’s Uttar Pradesh unit, tweeted: “RESIGN. Instead of protecting the victim and her family, your government became complicit in depriving her of every single human right, even in death. You have no moral right to continue as chief minister.” @myogiadityanath RESIGN Instead of protecting the victim and her family, your government became complicit in depriving her of every single human right, even in death. You have no moral right to continue as Chief Minister. 3/3In another tweet in Hindi, she alleged that at 2:30 am on Wednesday, UP police forced the family to cremate the body.मैं यूपी के मुख्यमंत्री जी से कुछ सवाल पूछना चाहती हूँ- परिजनों से जबरदस्ती छीन कर पीड़िता के शव को जलवा देने का आदेश किसने दिया?पिछले 14 दिन से कहां सोए हुए थे आप? क्यों हरकत में नहीं आए?और कब तक चलेगा ये सब? कैसे मुख्यमंत्री हैं आप? pic.twitter.com/Q2qPcDXDTT“I was on the phone with the Hathras victim’s father when he was informed that his daughter had passed away. I heard him cry out in despair. He had just been telling me that all he wanted was justice for his child. Last night the victim’s father was robbed of the chance to take his daughter home for the last time and perform her last rites,” she wrote. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi joined his sister in attacking the BJP government of Uttar Pradesh. “A daughter of India is raped-murdered, facts are suppressed and in the end, the right to perform the last rites is also taken away from the victim’s family. It is insulting and unjust,” he tweeted in Hindi. Members of Dalit groups and activists alleged the police was actively prohibiting them from agitation. “The whole world is watching how the government and the police together cremated our sister in the absence of her family. I have been taken into custody and put under house arrest in Saharanpur; but we will continue to fight,” said Chandrasekhar Azad, chief of the Bhim Army that had led protests outside Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital on Tuesday.The Samajwadi Party also tried to organise a march to the CM’s residence, but the police stopped the group too with a lathicharge. In New Delhi, around 80 Left activists were detained when they tried to stage a protest outside Uttar Pradesh Bhawan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-outrage-protests-after-hathras-victim-s-cremation/story-sOAFiYcn5SAaEsDDFHCsSO.html
02-10-2020||Editorials||The BJP faces a challenge||In Indian states in general, and Uttar Pradesh (UP) in particular, the political formation and the social coalition that wins an election and assumes power controls the thana, that lowest administrative police unit that has the maximum interface with citizens. If you are in power in Lucknow, you decide who will be the police officials in charge of these local police stations. If you come from a strong caste-based political stream or have loyalties to your caste group, it is likely that those in charge of basic policing will either be from the same caste group — or be more responsive to members of the politically dominant caste at a particular juncture. The logical corollary of this is that those who belong to castes outside the favoured coalition of ruling castes will find it harder to access justice.The shocking Hathras episode is but a reflection of this corrosive linkage between political power, State functioning, and social dynamics. When it was the Samajwadi Party in power, Yadavs dominated the administrative structure — and the local thana was seen as primarily a Yadav bastion. When the Bahujan Samaj Party was in power, Dalits — traditionally excluded from power structures — had greater access to local police. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins elections on broad Hindu identity-based mobilisation — this means that Muslims have almost no representation politically, which limits their access to State institutions. But given the heterogeneity within the Hindu fold, a BJP-led administration is not just exclusivist vis-à-vis Muslims, but ends up shifting power in favour of some Hindu castes over others.Indeed, this was the BJP’s perpetual stumbling block in creating its desired united Hindu vote. Over the past six years, the party has attempted to become a more inclusive Hindu formation, which embraces all castes, and moves beyond its traditional upper-caste orientation. Not only have Dalits voted for the party in large numbers, it also has the highest number of Dalit public representatives and has sought to give them space in the party structure. But as its rule in UP has consistently shown, the attempt to expand constantly collides with its traditional upper-caste orientation. The Yogi administration is seen as partial to Thakurs; there appears to be a clear bias in police functioning; and other social groups get marginalised. Hathras is not just a human tragedy and an administrative failure of the UP government. It is also a political failure of the BJP. It must recognise that harmony among castes isn’t possible without justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-bjp-faces-a-challenge/story-99FdYcbk6cBLLbP7BzLYAL.html
02-10-2020||Editorials||Why Indian-Americans turn blue||Indian-Americans remain among the bluest of voting groups in the United States (US). This is less about their views of Narendra Modi or Donald Trump than the social profile of the community. Indian-Americans are among the best-educated and economically successful US immigrant groups and share the ideology and viewpoint of most middle-class professionals in that country. The most recent Asian American Voter Survey confirms what previous studies have shown. Even when compared to other Asian American groups, such as Chinese and Koreans, Indian-Americans are the most likely to support the Democratic Party and its candidates. Just 16% of them identified as Republicans. There would seem to have been a shift toward the Right over the past four years. Possibly this is attributable to the bonhomie between Mr Modi and Mr Trump. It may also signify the economic rise of Indian-Americans and the tendency of the wealthy to become politically more Right-wing. Mr Trump receives a higher favourability rating among Indian-Americans than the only 18% vote share he received from them when elected in 2016. But the president could shed more support in the coming weeks. It is important not to overestimate the influence of events in India on Indian-Americans political views. Their attitudes towards racism, immigration, health care, gun control and the role of government in society are among the most liberal among all US ethnic groups. In the end, this should be seen as further evidence of the remarkably successful integration and assimilation of the Indian migrant into the fabric of US society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-indian-americans-turn-blue/story-lhDKVSgOYFQ4myRyo1j0aO.html
