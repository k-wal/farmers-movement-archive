18-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai breathes cleanest air this year, AQI at 156||The city breathed its cleanest air this year on Monday as winds blowing from the sea cleared up pollutants in the air. An overall air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator — of 156 was measured, which was in the moderate category. This beats the lowest AQI recorded this year of 162 on January 16.The city's air quality had remained in the poor to very poor category since the beginning of the year owing to low temperatures. On January 8, the AQI was the worst at 317 (very poor).However, with the onset of westerly winds, the air has cleared up by the weekend but became poor on Sunday when an AQI of 252 was measured.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as 'good'; 51-100 as 'satisfactory'; 101-200 as 'moderate'; 201-300 as 'poor'; 301-400 as 'very poor' and above 400 as 'severe'.“Air mass has formed in the ocean and wind blowing from the sea is cleaner than the air from landmass. Winds blowing from the north and west have cleared the air of pollutants. The air quality is expected to remain in the moderate to poor category,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Of the 10 locations measured, only Navi Mumbai recorded 'very poor' air with the AQI being measured at 351.Temperatures, meanwhile, increased. The Santacruz weather station recorded a minimum temperature of 20.2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees above normal. The Colaba observatory of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 21.8 degrees Celsius, which was 3 degrees above normal.Santacruz reported a maximum temperature of 31.6 degrees Celsius, which was 1 degree above normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 29.4 degrees Celsius and was 1 degree below normal.“The sky was somewhat cloudy on Monday. Parts of Maharashtra can expect a winter spell towards the middle of the week,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-breathes-cleanest-air-this-year-aqi-at-156-101610993427900.html

18-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Transport Undertaking staffer held for taking ₹1 lakh bribe||The vigilance department has arrested an employee of Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) for taking a bribe of ₹1 lakh.As per the complainant, CTU senior assistant Jai Bhagwan demanded ₹1 lakh from him to speed up his work.In November last year, the complainant had moved an application to surrender his bid for dormitory and rest house at Sector 43 ISBT as he was not getting sufficient customers due to the Covid-19 restrictions and was finding it difficult to pay the rent.However, Bhagwan demanded money to expedite the surrender of bid and providing the complainant with his security deposit.The complainant had already paid ₹50,000 and on Monday, while paying the remaining amount, Bhagwan was caught red-handed at the CTU office in Industrial Area Phase 1.A case has been registered against the CTU staffer under Prevention of Corruption Act by the vigilance department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-transport-undertaking-staffer-held-for-taking-1-lakh-bribe-101610993365273.html
18-01-2021||Chandigarh||Lack of symptoms, late detection led to widespread Covid infection in Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony, says study||A research study on the widespread outbreak of Covid-19 in Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, has shown that dense population coupled with a huge number of asymptomatic infections, which also led to late detection and delay in isolation of patients, resulted in the high number of virus cases in the locality.The colony had emerged as one of the biggest virus hotspots in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh with Chandigarh ranking fourth in the number of cases per million in the last week of May 2020.The research study was conducted by Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, and also appeared in the journal of primary care and community health states.As per the findings, the index case (patient zero) was living in a densely populated and low-income settlement where physical distancing between the individuals is not possible and had high number of community contacts. This, along with asymptomatic infections, was responsible for the late detection and delayed isolation of cases leading to the widespread outbreak, the study states.Major hotspot The index case was a 33-year-old who worked as an operation theatre attendant at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, and was diagnosed for Covid-19 on April 24. Till June 1, 222 out of 293 (76%) of the city’s Covid cases had surfaced from Bapu Dham alone. The number of cases in the area touched almost 300-mark even when the strict lockdown was in force.While the authorities scrambled to control the spread, a team of experts from PGIMER was formed to visit the area and suggest steps to contain the virus. The team at the time had suggested the identification of superspreaders and active surveillance for the detection of cases in the area.‘The superspreader’ The index case had a total of 11 family contacts, of which 8 were household contacts and the other three were his relatives who were staying in a different house, but had visited him.In all, he had 125 contacts, of which 65 were community contacts and 60 were from the workplace. A total of 34 community contacts and six workplace contacts were positive for Covid-19. Therefore, in total, 49 Covid infections had direct or indirect contact with the index case, qualifying him as a “superspreader”.Researchers have claimed that this case remains the first reported case of documented Covid-19 superspreader with an unusually high number of secondary infections.Another limitation was that 10 community members belonging to three families, who were contacts of index case, were only screened and not tested by RT-PCR. Moreover, in the case of asymptomatic contacts who had tested negative at first, repeat testing was not done between Day 5 and 14. Repeat testing in such cases is recommended, as it is difficult to assess the last date of exposure in and the limited sensitivity of the RT-PCR test.The researchers have suggested preventing such super-spreading events in the community, besides highlighting the need for behaviour change communication emphasising early reporting to a health facility if a person develops influenza-like-illness symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lack-of-symptoms-late-detection-led-to-widespread-covid-infection-in-chandigarh-s-bapu-dham-colony-says-study-101610993364184.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Government agencies observe Road Safety Month||To prevent road accidents and improve safety for commuters, government agencies in the district started observing Road Safety Month on Monday. The district administration, along with Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority(GMDA), National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) and city traffic police, in partnership with Raahgiri Foundation, will organise a number of activities to improve road safety till February 17 as notified by the ministry of road transport and highways. NHAI officials will be visiting major road intersections and project sites in the city and take measures to improve road safety. Shashi Bhushan, NHAI project director, said that inspection of project sites and intersections on national highways would be conducted. Street lights, reflector tapes and jersey barriers would be installed wherever needed. “Starting this month, traffic safety measures would be initiated and these would continue throughout the year. We will hold camps for truck drivers to check their vision. Awareness camps will be held at nearby schools and educational material will be distributed” he said, adding that preventing road accidents was a priority for the authority. Referring to a recent accident at Sirhaul toll plaza, in which a person was killed, Bhushan said that adequate measures were taken but they have decided to take more such steps to prevent accidents. “Improving road safety is an evolving process and we are working with the district administration to improve road safety,” he said. A statement issued by Raahgiri Foundation read that the Gurugram traffic police and administration has planned a series of activities to engage the public of Gurugram to raise awareness towards traffic rules and general road safety. These activities will involve zero-tolerance drives, digital campaigns and public activities. During this time, GMDA and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will be working on creating safer streets for all commuters. The first step towards it is redesigning nearly 25km of streets and improving road intersections. In the first week of the month, the focus will be on Golf Course Road where zero-tolerance drives will be carried out at Bristol Chowk and other intersections, the statement read. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/government-agencies-observe-road-safety-month-101610992820711.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Haryana Police deploys 500 personnel ahead of farmers’ rally on Republic Day||Haryana Police on Monday deployed 500 personnel on the borders connecting Rajasthan, Nuh and Gururgam, after protesting farmers announced that they would join the tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day. Hundreds of farmers have been protesting at different sites on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, including Sangwari Chowk, in Rewari city; Masani village near Dharuhera, and at Shahjahanpur border in Rajasthan. They are protesting against three new farm laws, which were passed by the Central government last September. The protestors have visited nearby villages and requested farmers to get their tractors to join the rally. Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said, “We have decided to move to Delhi and hold a tractor rally on Old Delhi Ring Road on Republic Day. We have called all the farmers of Nuh, Gurugram and Rewari to join us a day before the rally at the Gurugram border. There are more than 1,000 farmers in Nuh who own tractors and have agreed to extend their support ,” he said. Nehra also said the while the police are not allowing the tractor trolleys in groups to move but they are not stopping single tractors from crossing either. So, we have decided to move one by one, he said. Ram Krishan Mehlawat, the Rewari president of Rashtriya Kisan Union, said that more than 3,000 tractors will gather in Delhi from Gurugram. Women and children will also take part. “We have requested the heads of more than 300 villages to support our movement ,” he said. The police said units of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Rapid Action Force (RAF), Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) and Haryana Police have been deployed at the border areas to control the situation. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said that they will not allow any tractor to cross until January 26 as they are aware the protestors are planning to gather in Delhi and using alternative routes to cross the stretch. “We have increased the deployment and more than 500 personnel have been deployed at the border and on the Expressway to monitor their movements. We have successfully controlled the situation so far and will ensure that their movement is restricted,” he said. Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “We are keeping a close watch on protesters’ movement and will not allow them to enter Gururgam district jurisdiction. The teams are on high alert and we are managing the traffic situation to ensure that no congestion is reported from the national highway. We have deployed enough force on the highway so that daily commuters are not affected by the ongoing protest.” Ten police control room (PCR) vans and 12 motorbikes have also been patrolling the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway to resolve traffic snarls, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-police-deploys-500-personnel-ahead-of-farmers-rally-on-republic-day-101610992820077.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Wazirabad residents launch protest against construction of crematorium||After failing to get any response from the authorities, the residents of Wazirabad village have launched a protest to oppose the move by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran(HSVP) to develop a large crematorium adjacent to their village. The residents said that the sit-in protest, which they started near the proposed site on January 15, will continue indefinitely and the agitation will intensify in the coming days if the government does not listen to themMore than 100 villagers were seen sitting at a makeshift tent near the site under the aegis of Wazirbad Sangarsh Samiti on Monday afternoon. The protesters said that if the need arises they will also bring their families to the site as the crematorium was likely to negatively impact their daily lives. Apart from them, locals from 10 neighbouring villages have also come forward to support their demand of shifting the crematorium. Sitting at the protest site, locals alleged that hundreds of acres of land owned by Wazirabad residents was acquired by government to develop HSVP sectors and private residential colonies by developers, and that it was unfair that a crematorium was being forced on them. The locals also said that they have approached the district administration and their elected representatives but have got no response. “The non-responsive attitude has forced us to come out on the streets. We are very distressed by this development as our land was used to develop this entire area around Golf Course Road but now the government wants to develop the cremation site near our homes and workplaces. There is another site available in Sector 54. The crematorium can also be developed near Faridabad Road close to the Aravallis away from residential areas,” said Rajpal Kalu, a member of the Sangarsh Samiti.The protesters said that life of village residents particularly those living in Wazirabad Ki Dhani would be negatively affected once this facility comes up. Manoj Bohra, a village resident, said that instead of building a huge facility, the HSVP should develop smaller crematoriums sector-wise. “The private developers should provide their own land for this purpose. The HSVP officials and the government should take a sympathetic view,” he said. Locals said they feared that once this crematorium came up, Wazirbad, which was one of the largest villages in the area, would only be known for cremations. “Trees on the site have been uprooted. The crematorium will cause air pollution and lead to heavy traffic congestion,” said Manish Wazirabad, a resident, adding that they are now planning to approach the Gurugram MP Rao Inderjit Singh and chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to get this project shifted. The protest is also getting support from political parties and on Sunday, senior Congress leader Captain Ajay Singh Yadav, JJP district president Rishiraj Rana and other functionaries visited the protest site. “The crematorium should be shifted and the Congress fully supports the villagers. The government should take a flexible approach in this matter,” said Yadav. HSVP officials, however, said that the under-construction facility would be eco-friendly and use only gas and electricity for cremation. Also the facility, which is being developed by a private developer under corporate social responsibility funds would be operated and maintained by the authority. “The cremation ground would be eco-friendly and it will serve the people along Golf Course Road. All issues raised by locals such as pollution and traffic would be addressed. The decision to shift the site can be taken only by the government,” said Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wazirabad-residents-launch-protest-against-construction-of-crematorium-101610992642344.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Requirement for health certificate a deterrent, say parents||Parents of children studying in private schools in the city said that the requirement of obtaining a medical certificate, clearing students of any Covid-19 symptoms, was acting as a deterrent in attending classes. They said that schools could have screening mechanisms on campus to reduce the hassle of parents and students who wanted to avoid hospital visits in Covid times. The certificate is part of the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by the education department for physical classroom sessions in schools.Dilip Srivastava, father of a class 10 student, said that he had received a mail from his son’s school asking students to appear for special sessions ahead of the boards with the medical certificate being a pre-requisite. “Instead of expecting hundreds of students to visit different facilities to get medical certificates, why can’t schools hold screening camps on the campus itself? Parents are being compelled to visit hospitals in the middle of a pandemic for this certificate,” said Srivastava. He said that he had informed the school that the requirement of a medical clearance was a hassle. “Other parents are also facing similar challenges. For now, I am not sending my son to school,” he said. Kavita Malik, mother of a class 10 student, who got a medical clearance done, said that some parents were unsure about the medical screening mechanism. “I got clearance done at home but there are some parents who are not confident about the certificate. They are panicking at the prospect of visiting health facilities for getting a clearance,” said Malik. Several private schools in the city have recently initiated doubt-clearing and practical sessions this month. Voluntary visits to schools for such sessions were initiated by the Haryana government in September followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. While most government schools saw students turning up for these sessions, private schools had largely continued with online classes. In November, the Haryana government decided to shut schools till November 30 amid a spike in Covid-19 cases among students. Government schools reopened from December 14 for students of classes 10 and 12 and from December 21 for classes 9 and 11. Classes are continuing since then.Rashmi Malik, principal of Salwan Public School, Sector 15, said that the requirement of a medical certificate was indeed acting as a deterrent. “Parents are uncomfortable about visiting medical centres for the certificate. It’s becoming a task, especially for those parents who don’t have a family doctor. Doctors are suggesting a Covid-19 test for the certificate which is creating confusion,” said Malik.In response to concerns from parents, the school is accepting a virtual certificate. “We have informed parents that they don’t need to get a Covid-19 negative report. We have suggested online consultation and will be accepting a virtual certificate that clears students of Covid-related symptoms,” said Malik. Nidhi Kapoor, the principal of Euro International School, said that the school had seen 50% turnout on Monday in classes 9 to 12. She said that the strength is expected to increase in the coming days as more students get a medical certificate. “If the process is easier, more parents will be motivated to send children to school. The requirement of the document could possibly be a reason behind parent’s hesitancy,” said Kapoor. Deputy district education officer Kalpna Singh said that the health clearance was being sought to ascertain the recent medical history of the student prior to school visits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/requirement-for-health-certificate-a-deterrent-say-parents-101610992641372.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Class 7 student of private school in police cross hairs over threatening emails sent to girl students||The police are probing the involvement of a class 7 student of a prominent private school in the city, in allegedly threatening to kill his classmates in emails sent to at least two girl students on January 5, senior police officers said on Monday.The investigation in the matter, which was reported to the DLF Phase 1 police station by the school on January 6, has now been handed over to the Cyber Crime police station. Investigators said they have identified the boy who had allegedly sent the emails, but are yet to question him or record his statement.Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao said the police are yet to register a case. “We have recorded the statements of the victims and their family members and they have requested strict action,” he said.Rao said the boy was tracked down on Monday through the IP address of the computer from which the emails were sent. “A classmate’s mother had recently died by suicide and the students were distressed about it. They all were discussing their emotional feelings and how painful death is. The juvenile took advantage of the weak moment and planned to play a prank on his classmates,” Rao said.The parents of the boy have been informed and are in a state of shock, Rao said. He said that the parents of the girls, who were the recipients of the emails, have been restless since they were informed about it.The general manager (administration) of the school said that they had complained to the police and have been following up the issue with them since. “The moment we receive the name and IP address of the student, we will take strict action against the culprit,” he said.“You 2 girls are weak, just like that brat (mentioning the name of another girl student). I am back. And this time I will kill everyone,” read the first purported email.“Who should I kill first. I will let you decide. Answer in 1 hour or I will kill (mentioning the name of another girl student) first,” read the second one, sent a few minutes later, at 3.53pm, as per an investigator.Rao said that children are misusing internet these days without realising the impact it will have on others. “We have been asking schools to organise sessions for students on the usage of internet and to spread awareness on dos and don’ts but even the schools are not taking this issue seriously. Such incidents can spoil the future of a child who might have sent these emails for fun. The families of the victims go through a lot dealing with such malicious and threatening emails,” he said.he school, in the complaint to the police, had said, “The nature of emails is threatening towards these children of our school and we are complaining the matter to your office for further action. One fo the e-mails has been sent to multiple students of class 7 and has disturbed parents and students. We consider this as a safety and security concern and would like this to be further investigated(sic).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/class-7-student-of-private-school-in-police-cross-hairs-over-threatening-emails-sent-to-girl-students-101610992641869.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Pilot dies in collision while returning home late Sunday||A pilot of Indigo Airlines was killed in a road accident in Sector 114 late Sunday, when the car he was driving was rammed by a speeding truck-trolley that was moving on the wrong side of the road. According to the police, the collision took place around 12.20am when pilot Anmol Verma, 38, was returning to his residence in Sector 109 from the airport. The police said that the injured pilot was rushed to a private hospital and that his car was completely damaged due to the impact. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “The truck driver was driving on the wrong side and there was a massive head-on collision between the two vehicles. The pilot, who was driving, had sustained severe injuries and rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries within an hour. The front portion of the truck was also damaged.”The police said the driver of the tractor-trolley abandoned his vehicle and escaped on foot. He was yet to be arrested on Monday evening. The truck has a registration number of Gurugram. “We have received a complaint from Captain Pankaj Kaushal, a friend of the deceased, and have registered a case. The truck driver will also be nabbed soon. The pilot died of excessive bleeding and head injuries,” said Rao. The pilot’s body was handed over to his family after a post-mortem examination. Kaushal, the complainant, said that he received a call around 12.30am from a passerby who had witnessed the accident and had called him from Verma’s mobile phone. “By the time I reached the spot, he had been taken to the hospital. He had moved to Gurugram a few months ago, along with his wife. They were blessed with a baby boy three months ago. He lived in Delhi for 25 years before shifting to the city,” he said. A case under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304B (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the Bajghera police station against the truck driver on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/pilot-dies-in-collision-while-returning-home-late-sunday-101610992640921.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Technical glitches on CO-WIN platform continue on day two of vaccination drive||Issues with Co-WIN (Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network) application — designed to streamline the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines — continued to persist on day two of the ongoing inoculation drive. Officials at nearly all vaccination sites in the district said that they were unable to access the beneficiary data on the platform on Monday and had to resort to keeping a manual record of individuals receiving the vaccine and then updating it later on the platform. “We are facing multiple issues. In some cases, the beneficiaries are not receiving automated text messages despite being registered on the Co-WIN, so we have to call them up personally and remind them to take their shot. At some sites, vaccination officers are unable to log in, or the portal is too slow even if they are able to login,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. “Officials at the state level are aware of the issue. They will discuss it and get back to us by Wednesday. If not, then we will have to change our strategy for the next round,” Yadav added. He did not comment on whether the glitches in the app have directly impacted the Gurugram’s coverage of the vaccine, which did not meet its target for Monday. Out of the target of inoculating 4,836 people, authorities could only vaccinate a total 2,881, thereby managing to meet slightly over 59% of its target. Health department staff at multiple vaccination sites in the district said they had anticipated that issues with Co-WIN — which were first reported on Saturday — would not be resolved in time for Monday’s drive. “We came prepared with the printouts of beneficiaries. Administering the vaccines has actually been much faster today since we aren’t dealing with the app,” said Dr Pankaj, who only gave his first name and is in charge at a session site in Palam Vihar in Sector 9. However, according to a medical officer at a session site in Wazirabad, maintaining a manual record of data is not feasible. “It may be faster at the point of care because the scale of the drive is still small. These issues will cause a lot of confusion when the drive is rolled out on a larger scale. There is also room for error in recording people’s details manually, so we have to be extra careful. This will ultimately mean more work for us,” said Dr Ashima, who also gave only her first name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/technical-glitches-on-co-win-platform-continue-on-day-two-of-vaccination-drive-101610992640485.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Covaxin has few takers on second day of vaccinations in Gurugram||Only 35% of the 436 healthcare workers for whom Covaxin vaccine was allocated attended the vaccination drive on Monday, which was much lower than the average total turnout of around 60%. According to the district health department data, only 154 healthcare staff, mostly comprising sanitation staff and other housekeeping employees, received the jab.Doctors and senior medical experts said that there is no concern regarding the safety of Covaxin and that beneficiaries should not hesitate to take it.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “The acceptability for Covaxin will steadily increase in the coming weeks. Overall, the footfall remained low as vaccination messages from Co-WIN app did not reach the beneficiaries timely. It is advised that people not have doubts about the safety of Covaxin.”Even during the first day of the drive on January 16, healthcare workers were thrown off by the consent form that they had to sign to receive the Covaxin vaccine. Only 39 healthcare workers were administered Covaxin on January 16, at the Palam Vihar vaccination site.On Monday, Covaxin vaccine was allocated for beneficiaries at the Cloudnine, W Pratiksha, Park, and Metro Hospital session sites.At W Pratikhsa Hospital, only 25 of the 105 beneficiaries turned up till 3pm. Primarily, it included sanitation and housekeeping staff, said Fazil Ahmed, the nodal officer of the vaccination site. “In the first round, healthcare workers like housekeeping staff or sanitation staff had been taken up. Many employees have quit their job in the past, so they cannot be counted. In the next round, it is likely that doctors will be included.”Even at Cloudnine Hospital, the footfall remained low. A couple of doctors opted out of the vaccination after enquiring about the vaccine being provided. Of 110 healthcare workers, 62 received the jabs. At the site, doctors who withdrew from taking the jab said that they have reservations as Covaxin is still in its trial phase. A hospital employee privy to the matter said that those who received vaccine jabs were mostly housekeeping staff.A healthcare worker, requesting anonymity, said, “Since I have been planning to conceive, doctors have advised me to not to take Covaxin as it would delay the process by at least three months.”As beneficiaries remained apprehensive, a few doctors at Cloudnine Hospital came forward for the vaccination and said that they have been constantly following up on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. “The vaccine is completely safe. One should not question the credibility of the vaccine, especially when AIIMS-Delhi director Randeep Guleria took the Covaxin jab on the first day. People should not be nervous in taking the shot for it is safe,” said an anaesthesiologist at Cloudnine Hospital, who took the vaccine shot.Doctors at the Max Hospital on Monday offered to take up vaccinations with the Covaxin vaccine for the next batch of healthcare workers. Babita Jain, head of department, paediatrics, Max Hospital, who was at the site, said, “It is a killed vaccine constituting inactivated virus. It should be preferred, for it hardly has any implications.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covaxin-has-few-takers-on-second-day-of-vaccinations-in-gurugram-101610992640054.html

On Monday, the state health department, for the sixth time, revised the testing cost and fixed separate rates for samples given directly at the lab and those collected from residences.Samples collected in private hospitals or accredited diagnostic labs certified for Covid-19 testing will now cost ₹499, while the charge for home collection price has been capped at ₹699. Until now, one had to pay ₹700 to get tested at a private facility, whereas the cap was set at ₹900 for the home collection service, as per the rates fixed in the first week of December 2020.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Testing charges are reduced based on the rates of the RT-PCR kits, which has been constantly declining.”The state health department, for the first time, slashed the RT-PCR testing charge on June 16, 2020. From ₹4,500, which was the upper limit for the RT-PCR charges fixed by the Indian Council of Medical Research in March, the testing cost was brought down to ₹2,400 in June. It was reduced to ₹1,600 on August 29, further to ₹1,200 on October 2 and ₹900 on October 29.The costs of other tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the body, such as antigen test ( ₹500) antibody test ( ₹250), TrueNat ( ₹1250) and CBNAAT ( ₹2,400) continue to remain the same. On Monday, as per the district health bulletin, over 2164 RT-PCR tests and 181 rapid antigen tests were administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rtpcr-tests-to-cost-rs-499-in-gurugram-101610992580535.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||Only 60% of beneficiaries show up for Covid-19 vaccination, hesitancy remains||A total of 2,881 healthcare workers in the district were vaccinated against Covid-19 on Monday, on the second day of the ongoing nationwide immunisation drive. This accounts for 60% of the health department’s targeted coverage for the day, which was set at vaccinating 4,386 healthcare workers, across public and private sectors.Officials said that the individuals who did not get vaccinated on Monday would be able to do so on January 21.The majority of the day’s inoculations took place at private hospitals, where a total of 2,007 frontline healthcare staff, of 3,301 beneficiaries pencilled in for the second day, were vaccinated. “In private facilities, we have met 70% of our goal for the day. Some shortfall is to be expected as we are still in the early stages. It will take some time for people to accept the vaccine,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, Gurugram.Singh said that vaccinating private-sector workers proved to be easier on Monday, since individuals are being administered the vaccine at their place of work. “If you work at a private hospital, you can come to the booth, take the shot and then can carry on with your day. Most public health workers, on the other hand, are getting vaccinated at session sites that may be some distance away from their assigned duties or homes. So, they have to take the time out to go there,” said Singh.Among public sector beneficiaries, only 874 showed up for vaccinations on Monday, against a target of 1,535 beneficiaries. “About 60% of the day’s target was met at public session sites. We will be reaching out to all those who did not come, for whatever reason, and urging them to take the vaccine later this week,” said Dr Singh.He added that the drive would be extended to at least nine sessions sites in the district on Thursday, as they did not meet their targets. Dr Singh, however, did not comment on reasons for this.“The state authorities will review the situation and we will implement what is decided,” said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram’s chief medical officer.Although Yadav did not comment on vaccine hesitancy among ASHA workers and National Health Mission (NHM) staff, who are first in line for the shot, at least two senior health department officials directly involved in the vaccination drive said that more steps are needed to ensure public trust in the vaccines.“On Monday, again, we had to call in people who were scheduled to take the vaccine on Thursday, to get closer to the target. In a few instances, some healthcare workers have provided incorrect contact details and we were unable to notify them. This needs to be addressed, but we have all been extremely busy with delivering the vaccines,” said one of the officials cited above, requesting anonymity.Private facilities, too, admitted to a degree of vaccine hesitancy among their staff.Arpita Mukherjee, vice president, operations, Max Hospital, said, “Our proactive engagement with frontline workers before the vaccination helped in achieving 60% target... Many employees did not turn up as they might be confused, not sure of early vaccination.”A total of 195 workers were vaccinated at Max Hospital on Monday, against a target of 335 people, most of whom work in diagnostic labs.Spokespersons for Paras and Columbia Asia hospitals in the city confirmed that 76 and 55 staffers, respectively, were vaccinated on Monday (against targets of 100 people). At Fortis Hospital, 150 out of 200 people targeted received a shot of the vaccine, marking a 75% coverage, while 300 beneficiaries were vaccinated at Medanta.The spokesperson for Medanta did not reveal how many were targeted for vaccination on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/only-60-of-beneficiaries-show-up-for-covid-19-vaccination-hesitancy-remains-101610992580944.html
18-01-2021||Gurugram||21 beneficiaries report adverse events following vaccine jab in Gurugram||As many as 21 healthcare workers complained of adverse effects after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine jabs on Monday, said health department officials.Most of them complained of nausea and anxiety, followed by mild fever and pain at the injection site. All of them had been given the Covishield coronavirus vaccine and none of them had to be hospitalised, said officials.One person visited the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 due to high blood pressure while those who reported a fever were given paracetamol, said officials.On the second day of the vaccination, which was held across 45 vaccination sites, including both government and private facilities, 2,881 health care workers took the jab. Of these, at least 2,727 were inoculated with the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine, while 154 received the Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine. Health department data shows that there has been no case of adverse events from the Covaxin jab yet.Across the state, 51 cases of adverse events due to Covishield have been reported so far, with Gurugram accounting for 21 of them, as the district has been allotted the maximum number of vaccines in the state.“In the majority of the cases, vaccine beneficiaries reported of nausea, anxiety or mild fever,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Many complained of uneasiness while sitting in the observation room for 30 minutes, whereas, in a couple of cases, vaccine beneficiaries reported side effects after reaching home.Giving further details, Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer, said, “There were two cases in which the health workers reported high blood pressure. In over four cases, the beneficiaries had a mild fever, while a couple of them reported pain at the injection site.”Singh said, “Some beneficiaries experienced discomfort within a few minutes of receiving the Covid-19 vaccine shot. In private hospitals, affected people were treated there itself, while in case of government facilities, those who had symptoms approached the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM),” said Singh, adding that one of the vaccine beneficiaries reached Civil Hospital in Sector 10, after reporting of high blood pressure. Those who reported fever were given paracetamol, he said.Every session site has been linked with the Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) centre, which mostly comprises hospitals or nearby urban primary health centres. “These are minor adverse events for which people should not be scared or have doubts about the efficacy of the vaccine,” said Yadav. Going by the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition, an AEFI is an untoward medical occurrence following immunisation, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. Officials said that the state health department has been apprised of the adverse events reported in both government and private vaccination sites. “Details were updated on Co-WIN as well as sent manually. Supervisors from the health department were present at the sites and reported the matter immediately,” said Singh. Before the vaccine launch, the district health department constituted an AEFI committee, as per the central government guidelines, comprising of senior doctors in the fields of neurology, cardiology and pulmonology to monitor the adverse events after inoculation. “All these cases will be discussed in the AEFI meeting in the near future,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/21-beneficiaries-report-adverse-events-following-vaccine-jab-in-gurugram-101610992580085.html
18-01-2021||City||Congress decides not to name chief ministerial candidate in Kerala just yet||The Congress Party has decided not to project the chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming assembly elections in Kerala for now and has decided to give top priority to youth and women while selecting candidates.Talking to newsmen in Delhi after a meeting with the party high command, senior leader A K Antony, who hails from the state, said the priority is to win the elections with a comfortable majority and all leaders will work united to ensure this.“We have to win back Kerala. The party never projects any leader before elections but there will be a strong CM after the poll,” he said adding that the high command has given clear instructions to field new faces and give more representation to women.The party had summoned three top leaders of the state - former CM Oommen Chandy, state president Mullapally Ramachandran and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala - to Delhi to discuss the recent local body election debacle and formulate a fresh strategy for the assembly elections due which are due in April-May.Also read: 'Masterstroke' - Mamata Banerjee brings Nandigram back in focusAfter the recent setback of local body polls, many allies have asked the party leadership to bring former CM Oommen Chandy to limelight and give him more responsibility but he was quite reluctant and batted for opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. Many feel Chandy leading the campaign will fetch the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) more dividends. The party has also decided to form a 10-member panel to supervise elections in the state.“We have formulated a new strategy to win elections in Kerala and all leaders will work to achieve this,” said party general secretary in charge of organisation KC Venugopal. Three senior leaders also said the UDF was in a strong position and the local body setback was temporary. Leaders have been strictly told to go beyond their factions and that winnability should be the sole criteria while selecting candidates. Going by the central leadership's directive, many veterans will have to make way for young leaders.The party's central leadership was quite upset with the recent poll outcome and rushed AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar to the state twice where he met many including leaders of allies. Several leaders had questioned faction feud, differences among top leaders, selection of candidates and the party’s understanding with the Welfare Party, a political outfit of Jammat-e-Islami in north Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-decides-not-to-name-chief-ministerial-candidate-in-kerala-just-yet-101610991298060.html

Now, he will be leading the Azad group, comprising former Akali leaders who have resigned in his support, in the upcoming municipal elections. Kulwant had earlier left SAD ahead of the first MC House elections in 2015 after denial of party tickets to his loyalists. He became the mayor with Congress support and later went back into the Akali fold in 2017. HT talks to him about his past tenure, flip-flops and future plans:Why did you decide to part ways with SAD and contest elections independently? First of all, I did not speak anything against the party, but they still expelled me. As far as contesting the elections independently is concerned, all former councillors and local SAD leaders wanted that and they took the decision to do so under my leadership. SAD gave you the ticket for the Lok Sabha elections from Fathehgarh Sahib in 2014? You still ditched them. Why?I want to make it clear that I owe everything to the party. You show me any statement given against the party. Will you join hands with SAD or Congress after elections? It is too early to say anything, as I am still in a shock over my expulsion. Our main motive is development of the city, which we will do by all means. One thing that you wished to do as the mayor in your last term, but could not? I always wanted Mohali to be most beautiful in the tricity. I tried my level best, and to some extent, we achieved it. Another aim was to provide better basic amenities to all residents. Did you face any challenge from other party councillors in your last term? I should appreciate that all 50 councillors of Congress, SAD and BJP never opposed any development agenda for the city, and rather supported me. In the next term, we will be taking the city to new heights. Your relationship with Punjab cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu always remained strained. Your comments? There are political differences with the local MLA, but not personal. Also, the people of Mohali know as to who carried out development works in the city in last few years. Look at the roads and parks under the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/i-did-not-leave-sad-they-expelled-me-says-former-mohali-mayor-101610990180237.html

The ₹500 crore ambitious project will have jobs reserved for women at different levels, health programmes exclusively for them and priority water connections in women’s name besides subsidies. “The Gender Action Plan was crucial in getting the European Union’s nod for around ₹100 crore for the project,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL). The CSCL will get about ₹400 crore loan from the French Development Agency and around ₹100 crore grant from the EU to execute its project. After approvals from both, the project is currently awaiting signing of agreements between these agencies and the Union ministry concerned. “The EU was impressed by the project’s gender-sensitive approach to improve suitability, sustainability and reach of water services by focusing on and involving gender dimensions in the facility’s design, implementation and management,” said Sharma. As per the CSCL proposal, nearly all administrative posts under the project will be filled by women. Overall, the minimum female participation will be at 33%, particularly in the social development unit. At least 50% new meters are proposed to be allotted in the name of women from economically weaker section and low income groups. Additional subsidies and incentives will also be given to them. “The project also incorporates imparting of livelihood skills to women, such as making candles, incense sticks, low-cost sanitary pads and other such products. It also aims to provide help in creation and strengthening of self-help groups in project influence area, especially in rural areas and rehabilitation colonies, with a primary focus on women,” said Sharma.

18-01-2021||Chandigarh||Process for senate polls initiated, Panjab University tells HC||Panjab University has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that it has initiated process to hold senate elections, which are pending since August. However, the varsity also said that at the same time, it is actively considering governance reforms in view of the National Education Policy 2020, according to which the senate is to be replaced with a board of governors.PU’s response came on a plea of seven former senators, who had moved the HC in December, seeking senate elections. They had also accused the varsity of delaying the polls at the behest of the ruling dispensation at the Centre. The university has told court that it has sought permission from six state governments — Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan — where polling booths of different constituencies have to be set up. It also said that the Punjab Vidhan Sabha speaker has been requested to elect two members from among themselves to the senate, being one of the electoral constituencies. However, PU added that the National Education Policy contemplates structural reforms at every level, including higher education, and the varsity, its chancellor and central government are actively seized of the matter of governance reforms. The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the Vice-President of India (who is also the university chancellor), two are nominated from the Punjab assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected. The four-year term of the previous senate ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled in August last year, these were postponed twice by vice-chancellor Raj Kumar due to the pandemic.The one-year term of the syndicate, which is PU’s executive body and elected from among the senators, also ended on December 31, leaving the varsity without a governing body. ‘Plea grounded on political considerations’“...the entire petition is grounded on political considerations, with a view to stall the smooth working and transition of the university to become compliant with the National Education Policy 2020,” the varsity has told court, adding that “vested interests” must not be permitted to “abuse” the extraordinary jurisdiction of the HC on an issue such as this, it being a policy matter.PU has also underlined that the senate polls were deferred due to Covid-19 outbreak on the advice of the Chandigarh administration and requests from the staff members and faculty.The varsity has further argued that as the term of the elected members has expired, there exists absolutely no locus standi with the former senators to demand polls. It has also questioned how the petitioners did not make the central government a party to the matter. The former senators had made Raj Kumar a respondent in the matter. However, the V-C has taken exception to it, arguing that only the registrar should have been made a party. The V-C has also informed the HC that he tried to convene a syndicate meeting through online mode at least twice, but the members did not turn up. The matter will now be taken up on January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/process-for-senate-polls-initiated-panjab-university-tells-hc-101610989940618.html

18-01-2021||Pune||PMC’s sets January-end deadline for Katraj-Swargate BRTS; PMPML unsure||The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) has claimed that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has still not been able to carry out improvement works on the Katraj-Swargate Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) stretch despite writing a letter last month. As a result, the public transport body is unsure of starting service on the 5.5 kilometre stretch soon. The PMC officials and city mayor Murlidhar Mohol however, have expressed confidence to restart the service by January end while claiming that most civic work will be completed by then. According to PMPML officials, the essential work of signal synchronisation, CCTV installation has not been done yet while doors of bus stops are also still not in place. “We want to start (service on BRTS stretch) as soon as we can, but the work is still going on. The PMC is doing the required work. I can’t say when it will be completed,” said Satish Gavhane, BRT Manager in PMPML. According to Gavhane, the work of signal synchronisation, door installation is going on. “The CCTV hasn’t been installed yet. The door of Panchami bus stop has been put in place while remaining things are still yet to be done,” said Gavhane. Mohol had earlier stated that the Swargate-Katraj BRTS corridor will be open from January 1, 2021, however, the PMPML refused to restart service saying various safety-related work needs to be done. Mohol on Monday admitted that the delay has been caused by work-related to the opening of BRTS corridor. He expressed optimism that the corridor could be opened in the next eight to 10 days. “In December, we had conducted a meeting of all the concerning authorities and Corporators in that area. Our assessment was that the corridor could be opened from January 1 but some work was left to be done and it could not be completed. So, the corridor could not be reopened. But now most of the work is almost done and I am optimistic that the BRTS corridor will be opened in the next eight to 10 days,” Mohol said. The PMC officials maintained that that the civic work is almost done, and the remaining work is expected to be completed in the next 8-10 days. “Regarding civil work, only fitting of the bus stop doors are remaining to be installed. The process of manufacturing the doors and fitting has been going on simultaneously. We will finish this work in next the next eight to 10 days. The work regarding signal synchronisation and CCTV installations are under the electrical department,” said Vijaykumar Shinde executive engineer, PMC. Officials from the electrical department remained unavailable to respond. This is not the first time that the civic officials have failed to meet the deadline to open the BRTS corridor.

18-01-2021||Pune||Pune rural stays with NCP; all parties claim victory in Maharashtra||In Western Maharashtra, most of the senior leaders of all parties received a setback in the gram panchayat polls while in Pune district, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) managed to win 500 of 752 gram panchayats. In the region, gram panchayat election results threw a mixed picture with each political party claiming victory. As the elections were fought without political party symbols, data related to individual party results in five districts did not arrive until the time of going to press. In western Maharashtra, there were different types of combinations in panels. In some areas, Congress and NCP contested polls joining hands with BJP. NCP and BJP have also formed panels and contested polls at few places though, in a majority of the gram panchayats, Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress fielded common panels to prevent votes from getting divided. One such combination was in Kolhapur’s Khanapur village where BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil suffered a setback. Even as BJP joined hands with NCP and Congress and fought elections, Shiv Sena managed to win six of nine seats. “I thank the media for taking my village on the global level. While we managed to get three of six seats in Khanapur, the BJP has bagged maximum seats across the state,” Patil said in Mumbai while addressing a press conference. Ganesh Bhegade, Pune district president of BJP said, “We received victory on 200 gram panchayats. We won a maximum number of gram panchayats in Maval, Indapur, Shirur, and Khed talukas.”In Baramati taluka, which is a stronghold of Sharad Pawar and his family, the NCP won 48 of 50 seats until evening. In Satara’s Karad, former chief minister and Congress MLA Prithviraj Chavan suffered a setback with BJP winning 11 out of 13 seats. At the same time NCP leader and cooperative minister for state Balasaheb Patil succeeded to retain seats in the North Karad area. In Sangli, Shiv sena, NCP and Congress-Mahavikas Aghadi won a majority of gram panchayat seats. The panel of Mahavikas Aghadi is ahead in Sangli Taluka. In Sangli’s Mhaisal taluka, BJP defeated the panel pitted by NCP’s Maharashtra state president Jayant Pawar’s nephew. BJP won 15 seats whereas NCP got only two seats in Mhaisal. In Ahmednagar, BJP senior leader, and former minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil panel has got defeated in Loni khurda gram panchayat elections. For the last 20 years, the Vikhe-Patil panel was winning elections in this area. On the other hand, NCP MLA Rohit Pawar panel has defeated BJP senior leader Ram Shinde in Chondi gram panchayat polls. Emotions run high but police prevent celebrations The Ganesh Kala Krida Manch near Swargate was one of the counting centres for the gram panchayat polls where votes from 45 gram panchayat in Haveli taluka was counted. The police and district administration had issued orders of no celebrations and procession during the counting day, which dampened the spirit of supporters of winning candidates. As the candidates and their supporters went inside the counting centre, the anxiety of the others could be seen rising. As time went on, they anxiously waited for updates from inside. If candidates from their panel won, there were loud cheers. However, disappointment was visible on the faces of other panels. Ideal village of Hiware Bazar sees elections after 30 years At Hiware Bazar in Ahmednagar, polls for the local body were held after 30 years as some people decided to contest elections instead of allowing others to get elected unopposed, a tradition the village has observed for three decades. The hamlet has also won the ideal village award on multiple occasions. Popatrao Baguji Pawar, who has been the sarpanch of village, recorded victory of his panel with a 7-0 margin. In 2018, his contribution to transforming an impoverished village was recognised with the Padma Shri Award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rural-stays-with-ncp-all-parties-claim-victory-in-maharashtra-101610986579110.html

Although doctors are sure that the symptoms were not severe and both are stable, the nurses have been kept under observation as per the central government protocol. At least 300 incidents of “adverse effects” following immunisation were reported from the district, as of Monday evening. Senior health officials confirmed that two nurses have been admitted, one to Pune’s Sassoon General Hospital and one to Naidu hospital. Both are in their early 30s and were vaccinated with Covishield. One is from Daund’s sub-district hospital and one is from Mulshi’s Manchar sub-district hospital. Dr Sangram Dange, superintendent, Daundh hospital, said, “She took the vaccine at the centre at 11 am and then about two hours after taking the vaccine, she felt some loss in sensation in the upper regions of her hand. She was referred to Sassoon for further treatment and observation. She has undergone an MRI, but exact diagnosis is awaited. She is rapidly improving. As per preliminary information, Sassoon doctors have ruled out the causality of the vaccine in her case. She is under observation and her sensations have improved, almost back to normal levels. She is under close monitoring.” In the second case, a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “There are no serious symptoms per say, and the female nurse who was vaccinated at Mulshi, experienced weakness and is currently stable. The woman was admitted to PMC’s Naidu hospital just as a precaution.” A total of 303 AEFI have been reported in the district; 80 from rural Pune, 11 from PMC and 203 from PCMC. Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad said, “We have been tracking each of the 1,800 vaccinated persons continuously and anyone showing even minor symptoms is being immediately given the best of medical care. Even in this case, as soon as she complained of discomfort she underwent an MRI and was referred to a tertiary care facility. It is important to be noted that younger people are reporting more incidents of AEFI which could possibly be because of their stronger immune systems.” Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head of the microbiology department at Sassoon, said, “It is very natural for the body to react to any foreign antigens. These reactions are caused by macrophages, antigen presenting cells or what is commonly called the body’s defence system, which produces a substance called Interleukin-1 (IL-1) The body’s immune system takes up the newly introduced cells and galvanises the whole immune system and at that time secretes the IL-1 and motivates the whole body to fight against the newly introduced substance.”Dr Karyakarte further explained, “It raises the body temperature, it makes you feel less hungry, because the body wants to divert all its attention to this new foreign body. It also tries to take out the amino acids in our muscles so that they could be used to rapidly form new cells which could lead to body ache. Young people could react more because their immune system is good and the nature of reaction depends, person to person. It completely depends on the IL-1.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-cases-of-adverse-reaction-to-vaccine-reported-in-pune-dist-101610986520099.html

These doses are being administered to healthcare staff and frontline workers in the first phase of the inoculation drive being carried out across the country.Dr Suresh Jadhav, executive director, SII, speaks to Steffy Thevar on how they delivered the vaccine in the shortest possible time and about the plan to deliver it to other countries.Is there any communication on further purchase order from the Centre or any requests from other states in India?Currently, we have 90 million doses stocked at our facility ready for dispatch. We have a purchase order for about nine million doses from Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) for India which would be dispatched in the next couple of days. The demands made by other countries would not hamper the demand supply for the Indian market. SII would be exporting Covishield to Brazil. Which other countries are likely to get the vaccine and how much?The work on export of vaccine to Brazil will begin likely by month-end and about two million doses is likely to be sent. Currently, the stock is at our cold chain storage which would be sent once things are finalized. Some of the other countries which would also get the vaccine include mostly neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka and also Morocco. Depending on the demand we will be sending about 0.5 million to five million doses to each of these countries. The exports would begin by the end of this month. What has been the costing strategy for Covishield, which is still one of the cheapest Covid vaccines in the world?The costing strategy for any vaccine or for any product in that matter is if there is more requirement then the cost is brought down. In our case we could supply the vaccine in the shortest possible time as the infrastructure was ready. We had the laboratory ready as our expansion plan of other products was underway. Due to Covid-19 the other products got delayed and we could use the available infrastructure for the mass production of Covishield. Multiple mutations regarding the Sars-Cov-2 have been reported in recent days will the vaccine be effective against these mutations We can safely say that Covishield is effective against the currently reported mutations. Be it the mutations reported from the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa and even India, our study has found that the vaccine would work as effectively against the virus as it did for the previous strain. This is corroborated by multiple international laboratories too. As of now we can say that the current reported mutations will not alter the efficacy of the vaccine, but for future mutations we cannot say for sure. What special arrangements were made during the past ten months to prioritise vaccine mass production?Our staff was working in full strength in three shifts whenever needed. The government also approved working permission for us since we manufacture life saving drugs. In the given circumstance the Drug Comptroller of India permitted us to manufacture the vaccine even before it could be made available for marketing. This was something unusual as it does not exist in the Indian laws. We got special permission as per the situation, but this was not the first time that vaccines have been manufactured in such a large quantity within a short time. Such emergency decisions were taken during H1N1 and Ebola where vaccines were administered to people from affected areas within months.Some are hesitant to take the vaccine and there are few cases of minor adverse effects. Your comments.Minor adverse effects are natural. We already have had about 60 per cent people who have come forward to take the vaccine which is a good percentage. People would always be hesitant towards any new vaccine or injection at the first time, however, under clinical trials thousands of people across the globe have already been administered with the vaccine. India is a prime example of how vaccines helped eradicate diseases from the world. For example in case of smallpox, India reported the last case in 1970 and by 1979, World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the eradication of smallpox from the world. Also, in 2011 Indian reported the last case of wild polio and just a few years before that we were reporting the highest number of polio cases in the world. With successful vaccination drives, India can lead the world in eradicating another virus which will need people’s support. Apart from Covishield, which other vaccine candidates is SII manufacturing currently?We are also manufacturing Covovax, full length recombinant Sars-Cov-2 glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine adjuvant with Matrix M from Novavax Inc, COVIVAXX, RBD VLP display vaccine from SpyBiotech, SII Covac measles viral vector based technology from University of Pittsburgh and COVI-VAC, Live Attenuated Vaccine (Codon de-optimized) from Codagenix.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sii-to-dispatch-covishield-to-multiple-countries-by-monthend-101610986459573.html

In the district, vaccination will takes place at 31 centres, while in the city, eight centres will offer the inoculation. Authorities have now decided to call 120 people in, each day for vaccination, instead of the earlier figure of 100. “We witnessed that around 80 per cent of those who registered showed up on January 16, the first day of vaccination. In the light of this, we increased the number to 120 from January 19, in the hope that at least 100 health-care professionals will turn up,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO of Zilla Parishad. “We have seen that many beneficiaries were not able to come due to work hours. And so we will be calling and scheduling healthcare workers to come and take the vaccine,” said Ayush Prasad. On January 16, 1,802 healthcare workers were vaccinated at 31 centres across Pune district. Prasad added that of these, 302 beneficiaries showed mild symptoms. “That is about 9 per cent showed a mild reaction, post vaccination, in 72 hours,” said Prasad. “Of the 302, 300 showed some post vaccination reaction. They were administered medicines and kept under observation for four to five hours. These reactions are a natural response of the body. However, two beneficiaries, one from Wagholi and one from Daund showed a severe reaction and are still under observation. They are doing okay, however, just to be sure they are kept under observation. The cause of the reaction is not due to the vaccination,” said Prasad. In the first round of vaccination on January 16, 438 healthcare professionals received the jabs of the 800 targeted in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Whereas 456 people out of 800 received the vaccination in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). And in rural Pune, 908 healthcare professionals were vaccinated out of 1,500 targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-drive-to-resume-in-punr-from-today-101610986459014.html

The move has come as a big relief to the poultry traders in the state.The order to lift the ban was issued after chief minister Yogi Adityanath approved a proposal to this effect on Monday, sources said.On January 10, the UP government had issued a circular declaring the whole state as a “controlled zone”, putting a ban on import of all kinds of live birds, including poultry, into UP from other states till January 24.The ban was put in view of avian influenza (bird flu) cases being reported from neighbouring states, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab. The government was supposed to review the ban after January 24 and take a call depending on the situation.“We have withdrawn the earlier ban order midway with immediate effect on Centre’s advice,” principal secretary, animal husbandry, Bhuvnesh Kumar said.The order also quoted a report by the director, animal diseases, to make a case for lifting the ban. According to that report, the department took 2,811 swab and 1,013 serum samples and also examined 43 dead birds during a statewide surveillance till January 15. “But only 11 (0.54 per cent) samples were found to be positive which is very low,” the order said.Also read: Tandav makers say sorry after a torrent of criticism over web seriesThe Centre’s advisory, according to sources, said that not only there was no evidence of the avian influenza virus spreading from birds to human beings but the virus is also destroyed at 70 degree Celsius temperature and there was no risk from eating well-boiled eggs and meat.“Moreover, while emphasising the need for lifting the ban, the Centre also said the virus in UP was mostly affecting wild birds and poultry birds were not hit, barring sporadic cases,” sources said.The Centre saw the poultry import prohibition as a knee-jerk reaction to the situation.Sources, however, added the ban was lifted mainly due to financial losses it was causing to people engaged in the poultry business in UP as well in states from where poultry birds are imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bird-flu-scare-relief-for-poultry-business-as-up-lifts-ban-on-import-101610985295614.html

Speaking at the annual monsoon e-workshop and national e-symposium on “Cloud and Precipitation Processes” on Monday, DS Pai, scientist and head, climate research and services, IMD, Pune, said the three models will be used by the weather department to ensure that the predictions are more detailed and accurate. Pai said the three models will forecast monsoon based on various factors. “A multi-model ensemble (MME), the Nigam model developed by professor Sumant Nigam and his team from the University of Maryland, US, and MME forecast based on calibrated rainfall forecasts obtained through principal component regression models of different observed climate variables prior to the monsoon season will be used to forecast the weather system in 2021,” said Pai. Pai said that various models have been used to forecast rainfall during the southwest monsoon in the last decade. “For 2020, southwest monsoon forecast by models were indicating heavy rainfall. However, the seasonal rainfall was relatively less, but near to normal. Expect for July 2020, the rainfall predicted by IMD was underestimated in most months. However, we upgraded the forecast. We observed weak La Nina conditions likely during the late monsoon of 2020. This affected the rainfall system and we were able to forecast that correctly,” said Pai. He said that the weather department has several models which are rainfall calibrated and some predict in a particular way. “The deficiency of one model can be fulfilled by other models. For example, in 2020, 102 per cent of rainfall was forecasted, but the observation was 109 per cent. Such discrepancies can be avoided by using a multi-model approach for forecast,” said Pai. Pai said that 2020 did not see a single monsoon depression, but only excess monsoon with many low pressure systems. “There are two reasons to this. One was that the system formed was very close to the coast and entered into land very quickly. Second is that the easterly jet was very strong which did not allow any system to develop,” said Pai. Jet streams are strong winds that can push air masses around and affect weather patterns, according to the weather officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imd-to-use-three-models-to-better-weather-forecasts-101610974332554.html

According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), it will take three-four months to understand the effect of vaccination on the daily caseload. However, citizens must follow Covid-related precautions for the next six months at least, officials have said. On Saturday, BMC started vaccinating the city’s healthcare workers. In Phase-2 of the vaccination drive, frontline workers will be immunised. BMC expects that the chances of potential silent spreaders among these two categories will go down, once the first two phases end. However, vaccinating these two groups will be a long process, and the virus will come under further control only after more population gets immunised. “It will be very premature to draw a relation between the declining cases and the start of the vaccination process. On Saturday, we gave the first dose and the second one will be given 28 days later. It will take 14 more days after the second dose to develop antibodies. Hence, vaccination is a very long process. For three-four months, there will be no downward trend that can be attributed to the vaccination drive. For the next few months, wearing a mask, washing hands and social distancing are the best practices to fight Covid-19,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.On Saturday, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had told reporters that citizens should not lower their guard despite the start of immunisation. “Citizens will be required to wear masks for at least another six months and follow hygiene and social distancing,” he said.BMC plans to vaccinate 130,000 healthcare workers in Phase-1 of the vaccination programme. “After three months, we will be in a situation where at least 1.30 lakh would have been vaccinated. But this number is very small to conclude that the daily caseload will come down. The more we vaccinate, the more we will control the spread of the virus,” said a BMC official.In the second phase, frontline workers such as police personnel, civic officials etc will be immunised. The third phase will target citizens aged above 50 as well as those suffering from comorbidities. “Currently, Mumbai has the capacity to store 10 million vaccines, and we can vaccinate 15,000 people every day at our current capacity. But this number can go up to 100,000, if private institutions are involved in the vaccination,” said Chahal.On Saturday, 1,926 health workers were vaccinated till 5pm, said BMC. A total of 200 staffers, including 80 vaccinators, conducted the process and no untoward incident or adverse medical reaction was reported among the vaccine beneficiaries.Officials were forced to suspend the vaccination drive due to glitches in the CoWIN app. “The drive is halted till Monday as the Centre is trying to fix the glitches in the CoWIN app used for the registration of vaccine beneficiaries. Once the glitches are resolved, we’ll be intimated about resuming the process by the state,” the official said.Meanwhile on Sunday, the city reported 531 cases, taking the tally to 302,757. The toll surged to 11,244 after seven new fatalities were reported. The fatality rate is 3.85%.The recovery rate stands at 93.7% after 283,845 patients have been discharged after Covid-19 treatment. There are 6,779 active cases in Mumbai.Dharavi, one of the former hot spots that has shown signs of drastic improvement, recorded only 10 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking its tally to 3,890 total cases, of which 3,559 patients have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccine-here-but-don-t-let-guard-down-mumbai-civic-body-101610970793026.html

A Will can be drawn up through a lawyer. A Will is executed by ensuring signature of testator in the presence of the two witnesses.Step 2It would be beneficial if a Will is registered and properly stamped as it helps in ensuring proper execution. Registration of the Will happens at the office of the sub-registrar. One must submit address proof, photographs and witnesses to sign the will.Step 3Once the Will is drafted, a witness should accompany the person to the registrar for registration. Once it’s registered, it can be kept in safe custody with a lawyer or in a bank locker. If you select a registrar to safeguard your will, put will in a sealed cover.Step 4In case you want to revise or modify certain clauses in your Will, it can be done through Codicil, a document enlisting the amended parts of the will. It is then attested by the testator in the presence of two witnesses and kept along with the will with the registrar.Step 5If the person whose Will is with the registrar dies, any person may apply for the opening of the cover containing that will. The registrar will only open the cover after confirming that the testator is dead. The original will remain in the registrar’s custody. “Execution of a Will makes it easier for your family to sort everything out. It is especially important if you have children who depend on you financially, or if you want to leave something to people outside your immediate family,” says Avinash Pathak, advocateNOTE: A Will may be revoked or altered by the owner at any time prior to his/ her death. Registration of the will is not mandatory, as under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, it’s considered to be a personal choice of the testator. However, it’s advisable to register it, if its contents are to be abided by after the person’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-steps-to-creating-and-registering-a-last-will-testament-101610969532864.html

18-01-2021||Other||Monday Musings: Should the police act or not? When the law is made to order||Earlier last week, many in Pune began receiving phone calls from the police seeking personal details, such as address and photo id. In some cases, police personnel even visited homes to collect the photo ids and other documents. All this was part of an exercise by the police against those caught violating curfew-related norms during the Covid- induced lockdown. The police have already clarified that they are in process of filing chargesheets, and for this, details such as photo id, residence address and phone numbers of those who violated orders are being gathered. These are offences police lodged mainly during March, April, May and June, when Pune, along with other parts of Maharashtra were under strict lockdown. In Pune, as many as 28,000 people have violated rules such as not wearing masks, stepping out of home during curfew orders, and keeping shops open beyond deadlines. The police action caused an uproar with many crying that the move is unnecessary when the law enforcement agencies have not been effective in dealing with criminals. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) jumped into the fray and wrote to home minister Anil Deshmukh – he belongs to the same party – with a request to intervene and ask the Pune police chief not to go ahead with the action. The NCP’s intervention came after some of the civic activists, who otherwise ask for transparency, honesty and accountability from every government agency, expressed unhappiness against the police action. Is this the first instance where police are being asked not to pursue cases? In the past, governments have on multiple occasions approved withdrawal of police cases filed during political and social agitations. The latest being the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s decision on December 31, to take back cases between November 2014 to December 2019. Most of these cases are related to the Maratha protests as well as the Aarey agitation against the Metro carshed. Earlier, the Fadnavis government had cleared similar cases between 2005 and 2014. Among the key cases in which the government made a plea in the court seeking withdrawal was one against Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe and Uddhav Thackeray’s personal assistance Milind Narvekar. Both, among others, were booked for hatching a conspiracy allegedly to create law and order problem in Pune during a bandh called by Shiv Sena in 2010. Maharashtra, of course, is not the only state to have withdrawn cases. In all the protests from 2005 and 2019, where the government has decided to withdraw cases, there was violence too, making the common citizen suffer. The spate of withdrawal of criminal as well as non-criminal cases against politicians, their workers and the aam aadmi point not just to the subverting of the rule of law, but also indicate the overpowering stranglehold of the political establishments. In the latest episode involving cases against common citizens, police have invoked Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, provides penalties for disobeying any regulation or order made under the Act. These are according to Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code under disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant. Any move to take back cases registered lawfully for any violation only undermines the legitimacy of state, an absence of which can lead to chaos. During lockdown, when people were roaming the roads without purpose, police came under criticism for inaction. Now that the police are trying to take cases filed against those violating the norms to their logical conclusion by filing chargesheets, they have once again come under criticism. While any withdrawal must be “with the consent of the court”, the court itself has to see that the withdrawal is to meet the ends of justice and not for an improper reason such as political expediency.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-should-the-police-act-or-not-when-the-law-is-made-to-order-101610968215511.html

A Border Security Force (BSF) official said though the public will not be allowed, a decision is yet to be taken on whether the coordinated parade with Pakistan will be held this time or not. The joint parade was held on Independence Day last year when the pandemic was at its peak. Since the Covid-19 outbreak last March, only the flag-lowering ceremony is conducted at sunset on the Indian side of the border. India and Pakistan had suspended the entry of spectators in view of Covid-19 though the neighbouring country re-opened its border for spectators in October. Since then, Pakistan Rangers have been holding their daily military parade and ceremony. “Due to the coronavirus pandemic, no spectator will be allowed to enter the joint check post (JCP) at Attari this Republic Day. But we have yet to decide our programme, including the parade ceremony, to celebrate the day on the border,” said a senior Punjab BSF official, requesting anonymity. Another BSF official at the JCP said though the programme for Republic Day is yet to be received from the authorities, the parade is expected to be held. He said the celebration may be on the lines of the one held in August when the beating the retreat ceremony was held without spectators. The live musical band performance was also conducted on Independence Day. The BSF and Pakistan Rangers have not been exchanging sweets on special occasions at the border since India abrogated Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. The troops at Attari-Wagah border had last exchanged sweets on Eid-ul-Fitr and on Republic Day in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-spectators-at-attari-border-on-republic-day-amid-covid-pandemic-101610967372864.html

The SIT named Saini as an accused in a supplementary chargesheet filed in the court of judicial magistrate Ekta Uppal. The court has summoned the accused for hearing on February 18. Saini was named an accused in the Kotkapura police firing case on October 10 last year. The move comes three days after the SIT, led by inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, filed a chargesheet against Saini and IGP Paramraj Singh Umranangal , who is under suspension, for the 2015 Behbal Kalan firing. FOUR CHARGESHEETS AGAINST SEVEN ACCUSED With this, the SIT has filed four chargesheets, including three supplementary ones against seven accused. The seven accused comprise six police officials and a former Shiromani Akali Dal MLA in the Kotkapura case. The first chargesheet was filed against former Moga senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma in May 2019. The second in June 2019 in which six people, including former SAD MLA Mantar Brar, Umranangal, former SSP Sharma, ADCP Paramjit Singh Pannu, then Kotkapura DSP Baljit Singh and then Kotkapura SHO Gurdeep Singh Pandher, were named as accused. In the third chargesheet, the Ranjit Singh panel report was made a part of the SIT’s chargesheet. 22 CALLS BETWEEN SAINI, UMRANANGAL ON OCT 14, 2015 The SIT had claimed in the previous chargesheets that when the firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan took place on October 14, 2015, at least 22 phone calls were exchanged between Saini and Umranangal. The SIT claimed that its investigation had found that Umranangal was in constant touch with Saini and after getting directions from him, he told the then SSP Sharma and others to use force on the protesters. According to the chargesheet, the police action on protesters was the result of a conspiracy hatched by politicians and senior police officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-sit-files-chargesheet-against-punjab-ex-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-in-kotkapura-firing-case-101610960952057.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||It is voluntary, don't accept it: Delhi HC on WhatsApp's privacy policy||The Delhi High Court on Monday said accepting the new privacy policy of social messaging app WhatsApp was a "voluntary" thing and one can choose not to use or join that platform if one did not agree with its terms and conditions."It is a private app. Don't join it. It is a voluntary thing, don't accept it. Use some other app," Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said to the petitioner, a lawyer, who has challenged WhatsApp's new privacy policy which was slated to come into effect in February but has been deferred till May.The court also said that if the terms and conditions of most mobile apps are read, "you would be surprised as to what all you are consenting to"."Even Google maps captures all your data and stores it," the court said.The court further said it could not understand what data would be leaked according to the petitioner and since the issue requires consideration, it will be listed on January 25 due to paucity of time on Monday.The central government also agreed with the court that the issue needs to be analysed.  WhatsApp and Facebook, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohatgi, told the court that the plea was not maintainable and many of the issues raised in it were without any foundation.They further told the court that private chat messages between family and friends would remain encrypted and cannot be stored by WhatsApp and this position would not change under the new policy.The change in policy would only affect the business chats on WhatsApp, they said.The petition, by a lawyer, has contended that the updated privacy policy violates users right to privacy under the Constitution.The plea has claimed that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp allows full access into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government.Under the new policy, users can either accept it or exit the app, but they cannot opt not to share their data with other Facebook-owned or third party apps. The lawyer appearing for the petitioner claimed that the option not to agree with the new policy was given to users in European nations, but not in India.

18-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A (mid-air) walk to remember||Open sky. Nobody. Just you and your solitude, and a quiet walk mid-air.Footover bridges are among the most escapist places of a city, especially when suspended in places that don’t appeal to crowds during certain times of the day (outside the rush hours, for instance). Like the one streaming out of exit 3, in Old Faridabad metro station. That facility for pedestrians remains deathly quiet during noons when you can hear the air rock its metal body with a hissing sound.But no bridge in the entire National Capital Region can match the haunting feeling experienced here on the footbridge spanning over the Signature Tower Chowk in Gurugram.This afternoon, the crisscrossing roads and flyovers are punctuated with cars and bikes, but the long bridge seems detached from the world. The escalators are still. The staircase is painted over with shifting patterns of daylight and shade. Up on the bridge, the sound of traffic has acquired an interesting character. Rather than being an irritant, it now fascinates, as if a classical music composer had weaved together a myriad of dissonant noises into a rhapsody dedicated to the chaos of modern life.As the breeze blowing along the bridge sweeps the fine gravel and sand from their hideouts, they drift haphazardly, making scratchy noises on the metal flooring on settling down.Now, the view.The 1pm sky is without its customary mist or fog, and so clear that one could as well paw the blue out of it. Far off distances seem within grasp while the nearby high-rises are scattered like packs of socially-distanced stalagmites. Directly below, a labourer is digging the ground, his face is bent downwards but the yellow helmet glints in the sunshine.The bridge overlooks the highway to Jaipur and also to an underpass, whose long curvy skylight, before it disappears into the ground, looks like a python lounging under the winter sun.On returning to the earth, the bridge again seems remote. Now a man enters its empty corridor. From the pavement below, he is looking like a small ant moving across a tablecloth. He suddenly stops, takes out what appears to be his mobile, and stretches out the phone-holding arm, probably clicking a full-body selfie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-mid-air-walk-to-remember-101610920250656.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||DDA asks residents for input on Delhi’s Master Plan 2041||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has sought suggestions from the public for the city’s new vision document, Master Plan of Delhi-2041.The move comes months after the DDA and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been roped in by the DDA to prepare the MPD-2041, held a two-month-long public consultation last year.A senior DDA official said that this is being done to ensure maximum participation from the public before the draft of MPD-2041 is prepared. “People can give their suggestions and share their ideas about what kind of the city they want Delhi to be. The idea behind this exercise is to get maximum participation,” said the official.DDA on January 6 also tweeted along with a link of the form for suggestions from the public, “Be a part of RE-INVENTING DELHI! DDA is preparing Delhi’s next Master Plan for 2041. Being a resident of Delhi, click on the link below & aid in creating a vision for your city that will steer the next master plan. 5 statements! 10 minutes of your time!”In the form, DDA has asked people about the issues they face currently which they want to be addressed in the next vision document. The land-owning agency has also asked people to list five important things they must address to ensure planned and sustainable development of the city. DDA officials say that no deadline has been set for the exercise so far.From rampant commercialisation due to mixed land use to poor implementation of MPD-2021 to frequent amendments in the plan to regularise “illegal” developments, Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) say that the next master plan should take into account “ground realities” and provide solutions to local problems.In the last 14 years, when mixed land use was allowed in Delhi, RWAs say it has led to commercialisation of residential areas.Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-I, said, “It has destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods. Today, safety and security has become our utmost concern due to rampant commercialisation of residential areas. We don’t know who is entering our areas. It has destroyed the social fabric. Our top priority is that residential, industrial and commercial areas should have dedicated space. Safety and security of residential areas should be maintained.”BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA joint front, said, “Apart from mixed land use, the new Master Plan should also focus on making the city roads more pedestrian friendly. There is an urgent need to find a solution to the problem of traffic congestion.”While RWAs want the problem of rampant commercialisation to be addressed, traders’ associations in the capital want planned commercial spaces and a permanent solution to the problem of sealing.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, “Development of commercial space has not kept pace with the city’s growth. DDA should assess the requirement for commercial space and plan accordingly. There is a need to provide planned commercial spaces in the city and also protect present businesses from sealing and demolition action.”NGOs and experts working for the welfare of under-privileged people in turn want the DDA to reach out to these people also so that they can have a say in the plan.Shalaka, coordinator of ‘Main Bhi Dilli’ campaign (a collective of individuals and organisations working on creating awareness about the MPD-2041), and member of Indo-Global Social Service Society (IGSSS), a voluntary organisation, said, “It is good that the DDA is reaching out to people. But there is a need to organise mass outreach programme so that people living in unauthorised colonies and slum clusters also get a chance to give their inputs. They will not be able to fill-up the form online.”While the DDA is asking people to give a broad vision for the city, citizens want an issue-based discussion on various aspects of MPD-2041.Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs in the city, said, “There are several components of MPD which require detailed discussion. The DDA should have issue-based discussion with people on mixed land use, transportation, redevelopment, development of unauthorised colonies impact on plotted developments. There should be a provision to audit. We should know what all has been achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dda-asks-residents-for-input-on-delhi-s-master-plan-2041-101610919598522.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Search for an affordable house lands 19 in fraud net||Sometime around November 2018, Dr. Shivali Seth, a Delhi-based dermatologist, came across a newspaper advertisement regarding an affordable housing scheme being launched by a private developer in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla. The developer claimed that the scheme was under the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) land pooling policy.“Since the advertisement had the DDA’s name and the scheme was lucrative and affordable, I invested R12.37 lakh, after my name figured in the list of people selected in the lucky draw. I did some basic online and physical verification of the real estate developer and the proposed site which threw up some red flags. Two months later, I found out that the housing scheme was fake with no DDA connection at all. All my hard-earned money was gone,” said Seth, a single mother.Pushkar Rawat from Uttam Nagar, who worked in a private company, said he took loans and invested ₹7 lakh in 2018 in a similar proposed housing scheme in Dwarka, after getting reference from a relative. But he sound found himself cheated, when in November he read about the fraud and the arrest of the company’s two office bearers by Delhi Police.“The company’s office is closed and its executives who processed the flat’s booking and payments have switched off their phones. I am paying nearly ₹6,000 every month as interest for the loan I had taken. I lost my job during the lockdown and am struggling to pay the loan interest and make ends meet,” said Rawat.Owning a house in Delhi is a dream for many. But like Rawat, Seth and thousands of home buyers, this dream turned into a nightmare after being duped by various developers and promoters, who allegedly tricked them into investing in different housing schemes by fraudulently using the DDA’s land-pooling policy, which is yet to become operational.In the last one and a half years, Delhi Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) has registered 19 cases of cheating and fraud against various developers and housing society groups. So far, EOW has arrested 13 officer bearers of four companies – Revanta Multi State CGHS Ltd, Aerocity Dwarka, Rudra Welfare Society, and Eminent Officers Welfare Society. Three of the four arrested office bearers of Revanta group are now out on bail, at least three EOW officials probing these cases said.“The fraudsters had launched web portals and various types of electronic advertisements were being sent to attract homebuyers and dupe them in the name of allotting flats. It was also revealed that a Nigerian gang was also involved in duping people, through online transactions, in the name of the DDA’s land pooling policy. A special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the cases,” said one of the officers.The DDA had notified its land pooling policy for the first time in 2013 and later in 2015. But it is only in 2018, the land-owning agency started work on it. Currently, the DDA is in the process of getting land owners in 95 urbanised villages to come together to pool their land. So far, DDA says 6500 hectares (approx.) of land has been pooled. DDA officials say that they are yet to start planning for its use.Joint commissioner of police (EOW) OP Mishra said that even as the land pooling policy planning was in the early stage, various builders and promoters have grabbed this as an opportunity to exploit the situation by luring in and duping innocent flat buyers. They often promised flats in Dwarka, Chhawla, Najafgarh and Rohini under the scheme.“They raised huge amounts for advance bookings in the name of registration and allotment,” he said.By the time the DDA could learn about this fraud in 2014-15 and begin issuing public notices to warn people to stay away from “any illegal offer of registration of plots or flats under the land pooling policy”, many real estate firms set up their offices in Delhi, mostly in Dwarka and its neighbouring areas, and hundreds of home buyers had already invested their money in various housing schemes, which only existed on “attractive brochures and papers”, the EOW officials said.Officials said the DDA began receiving complaints from cheated homebuyers in 2018 and the authority contacted the EOW, which by then had also received similar complaints. After preliminary verification, the first case was registered in December 2019 against the Revanta Group, which alone had duped more than 4,000 homebuyers of over Rs450 crore, said the officials.“The company offered flats in L-Zone Dwarka under the DDA’s land pooling policy, even though the authority had not allotted any land for any housing project there. The company’s founders purchased lands in Dwarka at very high rates – R10 crore per acre against the circle rate of R53 lakh. Land facilitation agencies were incorporated and direct land deals with farmers were avoided to siphon off the funds. One of the members sold his own land posing as a farmer,” said Mishra.The joint CP said that the company hired facilitation agencies and paid them around ₹115 crore for bringing homebuyers by contacting them through phone calls, text messages and emails.When contacted, founder member and former president of Revanta group Satender Maan (out on bail) said, “We purchased 48 acres of land using the investors’ money but the problem began when the DDA reduced the floor area ration (FAR) and we informed investors that they will either have to pay more money for the extra land or would get reduced size flats. Many filed police complaints and civil suits. After registering the case, the police freezed our bank accounts and we could not progress in our project.”When contacted regarding the frauds, the DDA released a statement and said, “DDA has time and again cautioned home buyers and investors against fraudulent practices by some developers and societies to lure people into buying houses under the false pretext of land policy. Any person interested or being given promise of any land or apartments under any land pooling scheme, must go through the instructions and details about the scheme on DDA’s website so as to safeguard their interests and avoid any trap by fraudsters floating and advertising false and fictitious land pooling schemes. DDA is again requesting the aggrieved persons, who have invested in the name of fraudulent land pooling schemes, to approach the EOW and file formal complaints against the fraudsters.”EOW officials said that there are many victims of similar frauds. “We are doing campaigns to make people aware of this land pooling policy frauds and come forward to file their complaints, if they have been duped,” added Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-search-for-an-affordable-house-lands-19-in-fraud-net-101610919106466.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||‘No Car Sunday’ organised in Connaught Place||Scores of Delhiites, including youngsters, gathered in Connaught Place on Sunday morning, cycling and walking, with a message for people to ditch their private vehicles for a day.The campaign called, ‘No Car Sunday’, which was first started by a group of teenage environment activists as a local initiative to discourage neighbours from using their cars for one day of the week to help reduce vehicular emissions in the national capital, has now become a multi-city campaign that was organised on Sunday in Mumbai, Bangalore and Lucknow.The initiative is now being backed by Fridays for Future (India chapter), Let Me Breathe, Vrikshit Foundation, My Right to Breathe and Extinction Rebellion (India).Sixteen-year-old Aditya Dubey, who was among the youngsters who started this campaign, said that this was initiated to encourage public participation to send out the message that every citizen of the country can contribute to making the environment cleaner for the coming generations.“I am an asthmatic myself and I know how difficult it is hundreds like me in Delhi to just exercise our basic right to breathe. Things only get worse for us during the winters. We all know the contribution that vehicular emissions make to the rising pollution in the country and our small contribution can go a long way in reducing that,” said Dubey.Many youngsters like Dubey came out to the streets of Delhi with the same message, coaxing the adults to start using more sustainable modes of transportations such as cycles, public transportation or walking as much as possible.Participants stood with posters reading, “clean air everyday’, ‘this is my space to walk’, and ‘reclaiming my right to breathe’. The participants cycled and used the Yulu bikes from central Delhi’s Shivaji Stadium metro station as a symbolic gesture to reclaim the streets for cyclists and walkers.The Delhi government has also introduced a similar concept in 2015, calling it ‘car free day’ where in some roads of the city private vehicles were not allowed to ply for selected days. The concept, however, was not sustained.Bhavreen Kandhari, environmental activist, who is also backing this campaign, said that this initiative by children and young adults is a wake-up call for adults to start doing their bit for the environment.“We are planning to increase the ambit of this campaign and want that the government should also take interest and get involved in this initiative that has been taken up by children of this city. Today (Sunday) when we took the campaign to the streets we saw that there was a great appreciation and acceptance to this concept,” Kandhari said.She also said that while the ‘No Car Sunday’ was being encouraged because it is easier for people to avoid using the vehicles on a weekend, people can choose any convenient day when they would not take their cars out.“We are privileged and many in the city own multiple cars, but there are the less privileged ones who are the direct victims of air pollution that is aggravated by our vehicular emissions. We need to do this for them, and for all of us,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-car-sunday-organised-in-connaught-place-101610918794843.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||Govt to work on enhance teacher training and cutting dropout rates: Manish Sisodia||The first seven-day international education conference held by the Delhi government concluded on Sunday with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia announcing that moving forward, the state government would work on enhanced teacher training, strengthening school management committees (SMCs), working on an interactive curriculum, and cutting dropout rates.“We are already working on forming a new curriculum and new state board. We also want to examine students graduating from our schools and see what their thoughts are on caste, creed, religion, gender biases, corruption, honest governance and environmental issues. After working on foundation, the question is on how to work on the mindset of students,” the education minister said.While referring to the issue of students dropping out, Sisodia said, “Struggling children who leave the system to pick up jobs outside is where we need to figure out how skill training can come into play, and how we can provide support to them.”The week-long conference saw 22 education experts from India and other countries including the United Kingdom, USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Canada. The final day of the conference also saw Andhra Pradesh education minister Audimulapu Suresh highlighting reforms initiated by their government and extending an invitation to the Delhi education team to visit Andhra Pradesh.“In Andhra Pradesh, in the past 19 months, we allocated 16%-18% out of our total budget to the education department to show our commitment,” Suresh said, while talking about the key reforms in the southern state, including bilingual textbooks from classes 1-6, improved monitoring and regulatory mechanisms, and incentivisation of SMC participation through ‘parent committees’.Sisodia said, “Education ministers from all states should work together to create better systems for India. I would like to learn from Andhra Pradesh on how regulation and autonomy manifest on the ground through state-level legislation, especially the reformed structure of Anganwadi workers.”Some of the key takeaways across panel discussions during the week included the link between political will and educational reforms, building inclusive administrative tools to support teacher training, and moving away from ‘heavy content-based syllabi’ to a reduced interactive curriculum.During the course of the conference, setting up cadre of specialist teachers, collaborative professional development, shared lesson-planning, and providing teachers with agency and autonomy along with increased interaction with parents were suggested as key measures for improvement of school education and teacher training.“Our focus will now be on further bridging the gap between SMCs and parents by increasing parent participation. The ownership parents have showcased in the past few years has been a positive change for us,” Sisodia said.The Directorate of Education officials also presented their findings on the low class 9 pass percentage. “Though there was progressive decline in the pass percentage (55.96%) from 2013-14 onwards, the results have been improving from 2016-17 and went up to 64.49% in 2019-2020,” the government said in a statement.Rajesh Prasad, principal secretary (education), said the national capital was “a fertile ground” to implement the National Education Policy 2020. “Lots of aspects from NEP are already covered in Delhi’s education reforms. It is now time to focus on interactive teaching rather than carrying on examination-oriented teaching and rote-learning to transform the educational landscape of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-work-on-enhance-teacher-training-and-cutting-dropout-rates-manish-sisodia-101610918101525.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||BJP MCD councillor Aarti Yadav joins AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in a statement on Sunday said that a current councillor of the municipal corporation of Delhi (MCD), Aarti Yadav, has joined the party from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Yadav had won the 2017 municipal polls as an independent candidate and joined the BJP, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019Yadav, who is the councillor of ward no 49 in southwest Delhi’s Kapashera, said on Sunday, “I want to work for the people in my ward and I can see opportunity to do good work only in the AAP. There is too much corruption in the BJP.”The AAP’s MLA Atishi said, “Aarti Yadav, along with former councillor from the same ward, Anil Yadav, have joined the AAP. We welcome them. Several leaders of the BJP are fed up with the corruption of the BJP-ruled MCDs. To contribute towards development-centric politics, they are joining the AAP.”The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.BJP-Delhi spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. Her (Yadav’s) switching allegiance at regular intervals reflects that she is not interested in public service but she is on a lookout for some sort of political power. Moreover, such political switching of loyalty ahead of municipal elections by power seekers is nothing new. The BJP is not worried about this.” Delhi will go to the municipal polls in 2022.While the AAP is in charge of the city government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-mcd-councillor-aarti-yadav-joins-aap-101610917387952.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||246 new Covid-19 cases in Capital — positivity rate hits another low||Delhi on Sunday recorded 246 new cases of Covid-19 — the lowest since May 9 when 224 new cases were recorded – and eight more deaths, according to the state government’s daily health bulletin.“We can comfortably assume that the third peak in Delhi is over. It is even better now that the vaccine has arrived. However, I still urge people to continue wearing masks and take all necessary precautions against Covid-19,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press conference on Sunday.The city, on Sunday, also recorded a positivity rate of 0.36% which, health officials said, is also the lowest so far.Sunday’s health bulletin recorded 67,463 tests, of which 40,102 were conducted using the RT-PCR method believed to be more accurate in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The other tests were done through rapid antigen kits, which dish out quicker results, but are known to be far less accurate than RT-PCR tests.So far, 632,429 people in Delhi have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since the first case was recorded on March 2. Of these, 10,746 have died.On Saturday, 4,319 people in Delhi were vaccinated across 81 centres in the city, as India began the world’s largest Covid-19 immunisation programme. As many as 8,100 healthcare workers – the top priority group for vaccination – were supposed to take the vaccination on the first day in Delhi. The drive in the city will resume on Monday.“It is a good thing that the vaccine has arrived at a time when Delhi is witnessing a low number of cases. However, people must not let their guards down at this juncture, even after vaccination which acts as an additional shield against potential infection but does not negate all chances. People must continue to wear masks, adhere to social distancing norms and take other precautions,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/246-new-covid-19-cases-in-capital-positivity-rate-hits-another-low-101610915496515.html
18-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 check-ups helping in early diagnosis of cancer||As Mumbai records a spike of Covid-19 infections, the pandemic seems to have given an unexpected advantage to those diagnosed with the infection: many have reported being diagnosed with cancer at an early stage during Covid-19 check up, thus allowing them to get treated sooner than they might have otherwise. Dr Avneendra Prasad, 66, contracted Covid-19 in August. While undergoing CT scan, doctors observed a lump in his chest. In the beginning, doctors believed it to be a reaction of the virus and administered antibiotics. But when the size of the lump didn’t subside, they performed a biopsy which confirmed it as a malignant tumour. On October 30, he underwent surgery at the Asian Cancer Institute (ACI). Soon after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in March last year, a chest CT scan was made mandatory for all symptomatic Covid-19 patients; all symptomatic patients admitted to a hospital or Covid Care Centre had to undergo one.“At present, I am on chemotherapy. But I am thankful that I contracted Covid-19 and got diagnosed at an early stage, or else my chances of survival would have been very low,” Prasad, a resident of Powai, said. According to Mumbai Cancer Registry, on an average, Mumbai records around 14,000 cases of cancer every year. And while there is no data available for how many were diagnosed early due to CT scans, city doctors whom HT spoke to said the numbers were sizeable. “Most cancers get detected at a late stage where the chances of recovery reduce. But with this coincidental diagnosis, these patients are getting the opportunity to start their treatment at the earliest,” said Dr Rajat Bhargava, head of the radiology department, Fortis Hospital, Mulund. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we are diagnosing five to 10 Covid-19 patients with cancer. The most common among them are breast cancers. We have also caught lung, kidney and blood cancer among Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Neemish Kamat, senior consultant, radiology department, Nanavati Hospital.A CT scan uses X-rays to make detailed cross-sectional images of a body. Instead of taking one or two images like a regular X-ray, a CT scanner takes many pictures and a computer then combines them to show a slice of the part of the body. It is considered more effective than the routine X-rays. Covid-19 patients are being diagnosed with undetected cancer of the lungs, which is tricky because the symptoms are difficult to separate from that of the pandemic. “Some symptoms of Covid-19 resemble lung malignancies. So, it is quite complicated to identify cancer in an infected person. The rule of compulsory CT scan has proved to be a boon for such patients,” said Dr Suhas Vilasrao Aagre, medical and hemato-oncologist at ACI who treated Prasad.Other types of cancers have also been caught during Covid-19 treatment: breast, bone and kidney, among other types.A 47-year-old based in Kurla was completely unaware of the spread of the cancer in his kidney and lungs, till he was diagnosed with Covid-19 in July. During a chest CT scan, doctors at Global Hospital, Parel, found a malignant tumour in the middle of his lungs and further discovered that he had kidney cancer.“When we ran his chest CT scan, we found the tumour. Then to check if the cancer has spread further, we found out that his kidney had also turned cancerous. Now, the patient is under immunotherapy. It was a completely coincidental diagnosis which left the patient shocked,” said his treating doctor, Dr Pradeep Rao, director, urology and renal transplant, Global Hospital, Parel.Due to coincidental diagnosis of cancer at an early stage, many patients are getting a new lease of life. “This coincidental cancer detection during Covid-19 treatment highlights the need to undergo regular health checkups, especially those with smoking habits or with a family history of cancer,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-check-ups-helping-in-early-diagnosis-of-cancer-101610915586742.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||Health care workers in Delhi who skipped vaccine shot to be allotted another slot||Health care workers in Delhi who do not receive a Covid-19 vaccine shot despite being registered to get a dose will be allotted another slot, senior government officials said, as the administration looks to build confidence and minimise purported hesitancy among residents of the national capital.“We have to work on building confidence. Those who do not turn up at vaccine centres in the first phase despite being registered will get another slot. However, we are yet to decide whether that window for healthcare workers should be accommodated before vaccination starts for frontline workers or after that,” said a senior official in the Delhi government who did not wish to be identified.The official, who asked not to be named, said a health care worker’s name would be removed from the priority list, if they miss the second slot.With the vaccination drive launched on Saturday, around 8,100 healthcare workers in Delhi were slotted for the first day of the jabs. However, of these, just 4,319 (around 53%) turned up at the 81 vaccine centres in the Capital. Around 240,000 healthcare workers in Delhi have been registered for the first phase of the drive, which will resume from Monday.“The turnout figure in Delhi for the first day is at par with the rest of India. But the number is likely to increase in the days to come. The government is making its best efforts to ensure that,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press conference on Sunday.According to data compiled from states by HT, 200,297 people across the country were vaccinated on Saturday, against an estimated 300,000 who were slated to receive their first dose of either the Covishield or Covaxin jab.After healthcare workers, the vaccine will be given to front line workers, which include police officers, fire officials, home guards, sanitation employees, school teachers and employees of several agencies and departments that were engaged in Covid-19 management. Delhi has an estimated 600,000 front line workers, and the registration process for this category is underway.The government will this week intensify its awareness drive to allay concerns regarding vaccination, said a second senior government official.“Starting Sunday, all registered vaccine candidates will get a call from the district surveillance teams. The caller will try to engage with the candidate over potential risks, concerns and try to allay fears, if any.”Currently, candidates receive text messages informing them of the date and time of the scheduled vaccination, as well as the location of the respective centre.The second official said the government has also asked agencies and departments to start conducting group-counselling for their staff – largely frontline workers — to ensure they are ready to receive the vaccine when their turn arrives.A senior doctor from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), who asked not to be named, said, “There are some who are extremely excited about the vaccination drive. However, some others would like to wait and see what happens, and some who prefer to avoid getting immunised at the moment. The fears especially revolve around potential adverse effects — both short and long-term.”On Saturday, Delhi recorded 51 instances of minor adverse reactions such as mild fever, rashes and swelling at the site of injection, while one recipient — an AIIMS staffer — suffered a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, after receiving a dose of Covaxin. The staffer was admitted to hospital on Saturday, and discharged on Sunday, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria confirmed.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College, said, “With time, more people will turn up. Efforts are being made on several fronts to ensure confidence building and reduce hesitancy. For counselling drives in the days to come, the government can also take help of people who have been vaccinated and engage them in group discussions with potential candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/health-care-workers-in-delhi-who-skipped-vaccine-shot-to-be-allotted-another-slot-101610914958453.html
18-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Want govt to focus on education sector’, says Anand Gupta||It’s been 10 months since Anand Gupta, 26, left his hostel room at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai complex, shortly before the nationwide lockdown was announced in March 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus.A second-year Masters student in development studies, Gupta and his batch mates vacated the hostel and returned home after classes ended in March, planning to come back by May to take the exams that were suspended in light of the lockdown. But the en-masse transfer of classroom lectures and teaching online upended his plans.Gupta is now stuck in his ancestral village on the outskirts of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh with no clear path ahead. Internet connectivity in the village is poor, making it more difficult for him to follow lectures, amid uncertainty over when he would be back in a physical class.“Many of us are stuck in villages where 4G network is very scarce so attending regular online lectures online turned into a nightmare for many of us,” said Gupta.Many of his friends were forced to miss important class work as the mobile network connectivity is not enough to stream lectures every day.He lives with his parents and two siblings and usually attends lectures on his phone, but adds that connectivity problems are hurting his studies. “It has been an uphill task for me to tackle,” he said.Gupta said he is acutely aware of the digital divide in the education sector, quoting the recent recently released Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2020), “The ASER survey highlighted only 11% children had access to live online classes during days of lockdown, painting a very tragic picture. Loss of income for people in the low-income strata of the society directly affected the future of children in the society,” he added.Across India, Gupta’s problem is shared by millions of school and college students who went to their homes in rural districts after the lockdown was clamped on March 25. But poor internet penetration meant that they couldn’t attend all lectures, missed exams or waited for months for certainty on test schedules, results and job placements.Gupta says the digital divide distresses him personally because it puts his future in jeopardy. “Online lectures are like seeing the Taj Mahal on website or visiting it on virtual reality platform of Zoom. Physical lectures are more like going to Agra and visiting the Taj Mahal,” he added.A study published in International Journal for Community Medicine and Public Health in September 2020 found 51% of college and university students in India had symptoms of depression and another 37% had that of anxiety because of irregular classes, increased financial stress of families and disturbed sleep.Gupta wants to continue higher studies, and claimed that in the last few months, money paid by the government to doctoral students has been irregular, and that many students in the higher education sector were also suffering from erratic payment of money from central or state government bodies. As a Masters student, he doesn’t receive any fellowship money.For the Union budget, Gupta wants the government to regularise payment and hike the fellowships. “Fellowship money is what many research scholars survive on, in some cases, their families too. This budget should also focus on timely payment of fellowship money and if possible, higher remuneration as well,” said Anand.Gupta also hopes that the Centre focuses on the education sector, which gets roughly 4.6% of the Gross Domestic Product in spending, to help students adjust to the new normal of online classes and examinations||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/want-govt-to-focus-on-education-sector-says-anand-gupta-101610913227679.html
18-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools to open for classes 10 and 12 from Monday||From masks, sanitisers, and physical distancing markers to thermal scanners and sensor taps, schools in the national capital have taken several measures to ensure that the return of class 10 and 12 students to the campus after 10 months is smooth and safe. Schools in the national capital had been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While most government schools in the capital are reopening for board students on Monday, several private schools said they would reopen later once the online pre-board exams are over and parental consent for return of students has been acquired.Madhulika Sen, education advisor at Tagore International School, said, “The notice was issued with only five days in hand. Our online pre-board exams are currently underway and will only be completed by next week. So we will use this time to implement all protocols, speak to parents for their consent before reopening in February. The syllabus has already been covered and we will have time for revision and practicals. Students are likely to be called three days a week initially with no more than 15 students per room which is one-third of the original capacity of our classrooms.”Last week, the Delhi government allowed all public and private schools in the national capital to call students of classes 10 and 12 back to the campus from January 18 for pre-board preparations and practical work. The schools have been asked only to call students with the consent of the parents and follow all the Covid-19 precautions.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday held a review meeting with officials from the education department on the matter. “Everyone is excited and a little nervous at having Class 10 and 12 students back in schools from tomorrow for practical/counselling. All preparations – sanitizers, masks, and social distancing measures – are in place,” he tweeted.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School which has over 300 students appearing for class 10 and 12 boards this year, said, “We will reopen sometime later this week as are waiting for parental consent slips to form the batches. Thermal scanners and oximeters are present in the school along with sanitisers and emergency masks for those students who need it. Sanitising machines have also been installed on every floor. Class hours have been reduced from six hours to two hours and initially, we will only be calling 50 students to school from both classes to ensure parents and students both feel comfortable. Only 10 students will be allowed per laboratory with at least three staff members to ensure supervision.”Teachers and principals in the national capital have been concerned about practical classes and offline doubt-clearing sessions for students since the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced dates for class 10 and 12 board exams last month. Board practical exams will begin from March 1 and written exams will be conducted between May 3 and June 10.BP Dhyani, principal of a Delhi government school in Trilokpuri, said they are all set to reopen Monday with masks, sanitisers, and physical distancing markers in place. “Through existing WhatsApp groups, we had asked children to bring a signed copy of consent form to school on Monday. We have also made arrangements to keep printed copies of the form ready in case any parent wants to sign it tomorrow after coming to school. The students who could not arrange school uniforms this year will be allowed to come in their home clothes. The idea is to facilitate their learning for upcoming board exams. With teachers deployed for Covid-19 duty, that too might be a challenge,” he said.Schools will also hold orientation programmes and put up posters and notices detailing the Covid-19 guidelines. “We will hold orientation sessions reminding students of little things like opening doors using elbows, keeping their masks on at all times and carrying pocket sanitisers. Parents have also been asked to pick and drop their children as per the specified schedule. Teachers have also designed and put up posters on Covid-19 safety guidelines as well. We have installed web-cams in our classrooms to ensure that classes can be live-streamed for those who choose not to attend offline classes,” said Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, which has over 400 students appearing for their class 10 and 12 boards this year.Geeta Gangwani, principal of Bal Bharati School in Rohini, which will reopen later this month once their pre-board examinations are over, said they will have daily orientation for students. “We have also prepared a presentation for parents which focuses on how children should behave before entering school, while being in school, and after they leave school. Exhaustive training of support staff will also be undertaken in the coming week,” she said.The school has installed sanitisers, fogging machines, thermal scanners, and disinfectants which will be sprayed in-between batches. “The students will be here only for three hours and we will have to disinfect the area before the other batch comes in. We have also installed taps that can be operated by feet in washrooms. Physical distancing markers have been put up between classrooms and washrooms. Teachers will ensure that children are not gathering anywhere, including washrooms and will be checking the queues in the corridors before excusing the child,” she said.Richa Sharma, principal of The Sanskriti School, which is reopening Tuesday, said they will have seven students per laboratory, which has a capacity of 30 students. The school also sent consent forms to parents of those students who were being called to school as per their roster. “Each batch will have a teacher and attendant to ensure that physical distancing is followed at all times. A task force has also been formed which is supervising entry-exit protocols, cleaning, managing consent forms among other things.”Trisha Kakkar, a class 12 student at The Indian School, said, “My parents have allowed me to return to school and I am really excited about it. Along with practical lessons, we will be able to see our teachers and interact with them one last time as this is our last year of school. Though we won’t be able to do much because of Covid-19 protocols, returning to school will have a positive impact on us and will only motivate us to study harder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-to-open-for-classes-10-and-12-from-monday-101610912633094.html

Leader of Opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema said a delegation of the party MLAs would meet state election commissioner Jagpal Singh Sandhu on Monday to demand free and fair elections. There were apprehensions of rigging by the ruling party to win the elections as this government had nothing for the people, he said. Announcing that the AAP would fight any attempt of the ruling party to rig the elections, Cheema said that like the previous SAD-BJP government, there were fears of misuse of the government resources by the Congress to influence the local body polls. He appealed to voters not to come under any pressure from the government. “Choose the right and honest candidates in the elections to exercise the voting right independently,” he appealed to the people. 129 candidates named for 10 local bodies The AAP, which is contesting the elections on its symbol, announced the names of the party candidates for 129 wards of 10 municipal bodies, including Ajnala nagar panchayat, Dasuya municipal council, Khanna municipal council, Kothaguru nagar panchayat, Kurali municipal council, Lalru municipal council, Patran municipal council, Patti municipal council, Samana municipal council and Hargobindpur municipal council, according to state unit chief Bhagwant Mann. He said that crores of rupees were being swindled in municipal corporations and municipal committees.

18-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to inoculate its citizens four days a week||day after the vaccination drive kicked off in the state and the country , the Maharashtra government on Sunday sought resolution of the technical glitches in the CoWIN app, while saying its next vaccination session will start from Tuesday. The state had late on Saturday put its drive on hold for two days. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the state will carry out inoculation four days a week, as per the guidelines from the Centre.The CoWIN platform assists programme managers, while conducting vaccination sessions. Data of the beneficiaries is populated onto CoWIN and the session allocation, details of vaccination to the beneficiary, information about the next dose will be captured and communicated digitally. On day one, the state faced technical issues with the app, which initially did not send out automated messages to beneficiaries to arrive at vaccination centres. Besides that, senior officials said the app was functioning slowly, hampering the pace of the programme, leading them to go for offline data collection.However, the health department on Sunday refuted claims that the drive was suspended after CoWIN developed glitches. The department said no vaccination session was planned for Sunday. “There is no suspension of the immunisation drive in the state. We are going by the government of India guidelines, which has said only four sessions in a week. It is shut tomorrow [Monday] for rectification of technical glitches in the CoWIN app,” said Tope, who was on a visit to Osmanabad said.Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said, “At some place sessions [which includes identification, vaccination and observation steps] were not created, so beneficiaries could not be selected. Initially, messages could not be sent. Today, we had a video conference with the Government of India. They have not given any timeline for issues to be resolved. They have just said that it will be done. We explained to them what issues we faced.“Not just Maharashtra, other states, too, faced technical issues. They [Centre] have asked us to continue with vaccination wherever it works online. Where it is not possible, they have asked us to go ahead manually. We can collect vaccination details through Google Sheets. When apps start working, we will upload on the app.”There was a lot of time being taken in the session steps to go ahead, probably due to load on the server on the first day... Not just Maharashtra, but other states too have complained that the app was lagging. Yesterday, we took the permission to do [immunisation] offline, but the go-ahead came quite late in the evening.”With the go-ahead for offline entry of data, the state is expected to start the vaccination process again from Tuesday. Patil said that the Centre is insistent on online process, but has given a nod for offline as well, where app is not working or there is no internet. “Vaccination is equally important than app and data collection. People should get vaccinated and the programme will go on. We will start the vaccination process by Tuesday. We will do it four days a week because we do not want to hamper our routine immunisation work,” Patil said.The health minister, meanwhile, sought the addition of a module in the CoWin app to add the data of the remaining people in the first phase of inoculation. In a meeting held via video-conferencing with union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Tope also sought the technical issues in the app to be sorted out.“In the first phase of vaccination [in the country], 30 million people are frontline workers, 1 million are health workers, and 260 million are senior citizens, and people with co-morbidities. The data collection for the third category has not started yet as there is no module in the Co-Win app. I have asked for inclusion of this module in the app at the earliest so that we can start uploading the data on the app and subsequently intimation can be given to beneficiaries in time,” Tope said.The health minister said that he also reminded the Centre to send the remaining 750,000 doses of the vaccine. “Maharashtra still needs 750,000 doses, which I sought to be delivered in the next few days. I am confident that the Centre would provide them soon,” he said. The state had sought 1.75 million doses and has got around 1 million so far.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Sunday added 3,081 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 1,990,759. The state now has 52,653 active cases in the state. Maharashtra also reported 50 fatalities in the state, pushing the toll to 50,438. Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 531 fresh infections, taking the city’s tally to 302,757. The city recorded seven fresh fatalities, taking the death toll to 11,244.Of the 50 deaths reported on Sunday, 21 occurred in the last 48 hours and eight in the last week. The remaining 21 deaths are from the period before last week.Sunday also saw 2,342 recoveries which took the total recoveries to 1,886,469. The recovery rate in the state stood at 94.76%. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 62,901 samples, while so far the state has tested 13,806,387 samples and has an overall positivity rate of 14.42%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-inoculate-its-citizens-four-days-a-week-101610911812046.html
18-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Principals worry about Class 10 students as schools remain closed||As schools in the city remain closed for physical classes until further orders, principals are concerned about Class 10 students who are set to appear for their board exams this year. “Since schools have remained shut for the past several months, students have not got enough practice of writing papers. We were hoping that if schools begin, we could conduct some offline sessions with the students, to prepare them for the exams,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association.As per Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) order issued on Friday, schools in the city will remain closed and only board exams can be conducted as per the schedules of respective boards. Schools, however, said that students want to write their prelim exams in the offline format. “It will help them understand the paper pattern that was introduced newly last year. We are worried that students who are already weak might suffer, as they will not get the needed guidance offline,” said a teacher from a civic body school. Most schools have conducted their unit tests and semester exams online this year. Many were awaiting guidelines on the conduct of prelims. They are now hoping that the government allows them to conduct prelims. Mahesh Palkar, education officer of the BMC said, “Only examinations that are prescribed by the board will be permitted in schools. If the board declares that schools can conduct prelims and lays down guidelines for the same, we will allow them with necessary precautions.”Barring Mumbai, schools in other parts of the state reopened for students of Classes 9 to 12 from November 23. On Friday, the education department announced that Class 5 to 8 can begin offline classes from January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-principals-worry-about-class-10-students-as-schools-remain-closed-101610909946269.html
18-01-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University semester exams likely to be conducted online||The examinations for students of odd semesters in Panjab University are likely to be conducted online.The matter was discussed in a committee meeting on Saturday, which was attended by varsity officials and principals of affiliated colleges. Almost all the members agreed that the examination should be held online. The varsity is, however, yet to take the final call.Last year, PU had conducted the semester exams for final year students online due to the pandemic. Despite deliberations, PU has not been able to decide on the mode for over a month now.PU controller of examinations Jagat Bhushan said, “Most likely the semester exams will be held online. We are waiting for approval from the vice-chancellor.”The development comes after inputs and suggestions were invited from college principals regarding the modalities of conducting the semester exams earlier this month. During the meeting, other modalities were also discussed including time duration and paper set up.The semester examinations for undergraduate and second-year postgraduate courses are likely to be held from the middle of February, and the semester examinations for first-year postgraduate batches is likely to be held in the second week of March.Students of PU teaching departments as well as affiliated colleges have expressed concerns over the inability of the university to take a call.A varsity official said, “Maybe another meeting will be held in the coming days and the final decision will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-semester-exams-likely-to-be-conducted-online-101610909826266.html

More than 15,000 people have downloaded the mobile app, Smart Bike.Under the PBS, residents can rent cycles to commute through the city for ₹5- ₹10 for half an hour. They can also avail annual membership with one-time payment.“We have received a positive response from city residents. People have travelled more than 35,000 km on the cycles of PBS, which has saved 11,617 tonnes in CO2 emissions. The cycles have been used for an aggregate of 4,840 hours,” said NP Sharma, chief general manager, CSCL.The well-thought out location of docking stations, quality of cycles, city-wide network of cycle tracks, now night lighting being made available on these tracks, and higher awareness levels among residents can be credited for the success of the system, said Sharma.1,250 cycles, 155 docking stations by MayIn the next phase, by May this year, 1,250 cycles will be added and dockets will be increased from 25 to 155.Currently, the 25 docking stations are spread across prominent locations in the city such as Rock Garden, High Court and Sukhna, PGIMER, Sectors 17, 22, 34, 35 and 43. In addition to these, “we will also introduce docking stations near people’s houses like adjacent vacant spaces near milk booths. This is expected to give further boost to the usage of the cycles,” added Sharma.Of the 225 bicycles currently available, 100 are pedal-assisted electric bicycles (e-bikes). Learning from the usage pattern in the first month, the number of e-bikes will be increased to 75% in the next phase of installation.In total, 5,000 bicycles will be provided in the city along with a network of 617 docking Stations spread throughout the city giving last mile connectivity to the users. “This size of the project will make it India’s largest and densest PBS network. The project will be developed in 4 phases of 1,250 cycles and 155 docking stations each, within a time span of 18 months, having the features of pedal assisted e-bikes along with the charging facility at the docking stations,” said Sharma.All the bicycles are provided with GPS-enabled locking arrangement and will be monitored by a Command and Control Centre having 24x7 facility of helpline for users.

18-01-2021||Delhi||AIIMS guard who showed severe allergic reaction to vaccine released from hospital||The 22-year-old security guard who was admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, after receiving a Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Saturday, was discharged on Sunday.“He is stable and has been discharged,” confirmed Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, Delhi.He was the only severe reaction reported in Delhi on the first day of the national vaccine roll-out. Anaphylaxis causes skin rash, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and shock, if not treated promptly.The hospital had been administering Covaxin that is developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research.According to doctors at AIIMS, the security guard had complained of uneasiness, palpitation, headache, and developed rash after 10-15 minutes of having been given a shot. He was moved to the icu, and remained under observation of specialists for a day before being discharged on Sunday evening.In all, Delhi reported 51 minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection, or fever on day one of the Covid-19 vaccination drive.A senior NDMC official, who asked not to be named, had said that two cases of mild AEFI (adverse effects following immunisation) symptoms were reported at Charak Palika Hospital. Two of the hospital’s health care workers who took the Covid-19 vaccine in the afternoon, had reported slight tightness in the chest during the observation period.“They were immediately attended to by the AEFI team and kept under observation. They felt normal within half-an-hour and were discharged. There is nothing to be worried about AEFI cases, as such symptoms are normal to occur after any vaccination,” the official had said.As per the Covid-19 vaccination operational guidelines, a recipient of the vaccine would need to be kept under observation in a separate waiting area at the vaccination site for at least 30 minutes, to monitor their health condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aiims-guard-who-showed-severe-allergic-reaction-to-vaccine-released-from-hospital-101610907954351.html
18-01-2021||Mumbai||Explain why disabled student not admitted for medical course: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Union of India (UoI), National Medical Commission (NMC) and the state, to respond to a petition filed by a student with a non-dominant amputated upper limb, alleging discrimination after she was not allowed to pursue a medical science course on the grounds of her disability. The aspiring student has claimed that in the past students like her have got admitted to such courses, hence the denial to her was arbitrary. The matter will be heard on January 20. A division bench of justice SC Gupte and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the petition filed by Anita Shinde, was informed by advocate Gaurav Bansal that his client had appeared for the 2020 National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and had secured 60.64%, hence applied for admission to the undergraduate (UG) medical course under the person with disability reservation. Bansal submitted that as per a 2019 notification of the Medical Council of India, Shinde who has an upper limb disability was deemed to be eligible for admission. Bansal submitted that though the commissioner of the Disability Welfare Commission had directed the Disability Assessment Board, which termed Shinde to be ineligible for admission to the UG medical course, to consider the disability of the petitioner with necessary assistive devices and thereafter make the decision, the board had not paid heed and refused her admission to a seat in the medical course. Aggrieved by the discriminatory conduct of the board and denial of a seat she had approached the HC. Shinde’s petition further pointed out that the NMC had issued a notification in 2019, which enumerated technical standards that disabled students had to fulfil to be eligible for admission to a medical course. The petition states that as the notification was based on outdated standards which were being followed in the USA in 1979, the standards mentioned in the notification did not align with existing standards and hence the notification should be set aside. After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know the stand of the UoI, NMC and state and asked them to respond within a week and posted the hearing of the petition on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/explain-why-disabled-student-not-admitted-for-medical-course-bombay-hc-101610907665023.html

Officials privy to the preparations said only 25,000 people will be allowed to watch the parade on Rajpath compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the event. They said only 4,000 people from the general public will be allowed. Rest of the spectators will be VVIP and VIP guests.Spectators need either passes or tickets to watch the parade. Also, nobody will be allowed at the free standing areas, located near the boat club and at India Gate lawns where thousands gather each year to watch the grand parade.Also, only those above the age of 15 years and below 65 will be allowed to watch the parade, officials said. In order to ensure social distancing, bleachers or stands along the Rajpath have been replaced with chairs. The new norms have been laid down in view of the coronavirus pandemic, a senior Delhi Police officer said, requesting anonymity.This year, the main parade consisting of the marching contingents from the three arms of the defence forces, weapon systems and groups from the paramilitary, will conclude at the India Gate, instead of going up to the Red Fort. However, the tableaux will be allowed to go up to Red Fort grounds.Another officer, privy to the developments, who wished not to be named, said the decision of not taking the parade up to the Red Fort and restricting it within the New Delhi district will help containing movement of the participants. This will also prevent overcrowding of people on the route from India Gate up to the Red Fort, he said.“The New Delhi district will be sealed and entry tickets or passes will be checked on the periphery of the New Delhi districts. Some of these check points fall at ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Aurobindo Chowk and near Ranjeet Singh flyover. Someone visiting the parade will have to show their ticket or pass along with their identity proof having the same name as on the ticket or pass issued. Tickets and passes that are issued in the visitor’s name will not be transferable,” the officer added.Deputy commissioner of police, Eish Singhal, who is the Delhi police’s spokesperson, explained the security has been set up in multiple layers – the outer cordon, middle cordon and inner cordon. People will be allowed from the outer cordon under strict watch where pickets and check points will be set up. Here, people will be stopped for random checking. However, only those with Republic Day tickets or passes will be allowed through the inner cordon.The size of the marching contingents from the armed forces and the paramilitary will be smaller. These squads will only have 96 participants compared to 144 in the ordinary courseIndependence Day celebrations were also hit by the pandemic this year, with fewer VIPs attending the event the Red Fort.“Thermal screening will be conducted at all entry points and for those running temperature be isolated immediately in resting booths where a doctor and paramedic staff will be stationed,” the officer said.Sanitisers, face masks and gloves will also be made available at the venue, the officer added.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital said, precautions being taken are necessary. “The guidelines are necessary in view of the pandemic. Such mandates are required to contain the spread of the virus. Government must have decided the restrictions on number of visitors based on these factors. It is advisable that people watch the Republic Day celebrations on their TV sets this year,” Kishore said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rday-parade-to-be-curtailed-only-4-000-from-general-public-to-be-allowed-on-rajpath-101610904905515.html
