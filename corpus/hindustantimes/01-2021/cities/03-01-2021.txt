It aims to verify the progress made on a city’s sanitation through direct responses from citizens.“Last year, MC could not encourage the residents for wider participation in the survey. Only 3.19% of the population gave feedback,” said Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations.RESIDENTS’ COMPLAINS POUR IN MC has pressed into service over 100 new garbage collection vehicles after taking over door-to-door garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30. But, residents complain teething problems continue to plague it.“MC vehicles are not visible and waste is being picked up by private collectors only in most areas of the sector,” said Naresh Batra, president, Sector 18 Resident Welfare Association (RWA).Harish Chhabra, secretary, Sector 29 RWA, said the situation was similar in Sector 29 as well. “Informal garbage collectors collect the waste before MC vehicles arrive,” said Sanjay Malhotra, a resident of Sector 23.In some sectors, both MC and informal collectors are on job. “Some private collectors are also coming to pick up waste, apart from the MC vehicles,” said RS Gill, president of the Sector 8 RWA.In Sectors 7, 15 and 16, the civic body is faring better. “MC vehicles are visiting regularly. Waste is being collected by MC helpers from all storeys, as per the earlier practice. New system is moving well,” said Dr Madhurima Sharma, a Sector-16 resident.GARBAGE HEAPS PILE UPHitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said, “For the last five days, due to the strike by a section of garbage collectors and sanitation workers, no garbage is being picked up from houses or streets in southern sectors (sectors beyond Sector 30). The situation is worsening with each passing day.”In Sector 45, residents have been forced to arrange private vehicles. Rajat Malhotra, president, Sector 45 RWA, said, “With garbage piling up on streets and at people’s homes, we had to take this step.”MC commissioner KK Yadav could not be reached for his comment.HOW TO GIVE CITIZEN FEEDBACKThe survey is open from January 1 to March 31Feedback can be shared either through the “SS2021 VoteForYourCity” app or “Swachhata-MoHUA”Survey is also available online at “www.swachhsurvekshan2021.org” and “www.mygov.in”, besides at 1969 Swachhata HelplineAdults who have been residents of Chandigarh for at least six months can give feedbackOne mobile number can be used once for submitting a response||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hiccups-still-plaguing-mc-s-garbage-collection-system-in-chandigarh/story-KDN0wYEgNDQV8ODSLo3UmM.html
03-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccine: Maharashtra waits for Centre’s plan amid cost doubts||Maharashtra is waiting for the Centre to roll out its Covid-19 vaccination programme plan after the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) on Sunday approved emergency use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech vaccines. While the state has already prepared its plan to vaccinate over 30 million people in the first three phases, however, it is not yet clear whether the vaccine will be free for all. Chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said they are assuming that vaccines for health workers and frontline workers will be free, but they don’t know what is going to happen later.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state vaccination task force, said the first person in the country is likely to be vaccinated between January 7 and 14, but doesn’t know when Maharashtra will be able to get the stock.Meanwhile, the state on Sunday recorded 3,282 cases, the 18th day of fewer than 4,000 cases, pushing the count to 1,942,136. The toll reached 49,666 after 35 casualties were reported, of which 20 were in the past 48 hours, five were in the past week and the remaining 10 deaths were from before last week, health officials said.Also read: DGCI nod for Covid-19 vaccines: Doctors give thumbs-up, but flag minor issues“We have completed our preparations. Priority of people has been set by the Centre, according to which health workers, frontline workers and later people with comorbidities will be given [vaccine] shots. We have also completed registration of both health workers and frontline workers, infrastructure is ready and staff has been trained. We have also completed a mock drill now,” the chief secretary said.We are assuming the vaccine is going to be free for heath and frontline workers, but when it comes to the general public, we are awaiting clarity from the Centre,” he added.Dr Joshi said, “Maharashtra will have to await further instructions from the Central government. The Centre will be procuring them first, which is likely to happen from next week. After that, they will be distributing the stock among various states. Then, according to the plan made by the Centre, the first group to be vaccinated will be health workers, then followed by frontline workers. The state government will have to work in close coordination with the Central government for both procurement as well as its distribution to various vaccination points and administering it to the first group of people.”According to Dr Joshi, DGCI has made three observations first, the approved vaccine of Serum Institute of India for emergency use. Second, Bharat Biotech’s vaccine has been approved for clinical trials, which will not be based on double blind study. Now people will be given actual shots during the trial and everyone will be monitored post vaccination. Third one is, Zydus Cadila vaccine, which also got approval for phase 3 trial. “It means, in all probability, Covishield will be the first vaccine to be used for starting the first phase. I am expecting that the first person to get vaccinated will be between January 7-14, but when Maharashtra is going to get the stock is yet to be cleared.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state administration is fully prepared and they are waiting for the Centre’s plan for the vaccination drive.“We are waiting for a communication from the Centre on the vaccination programme. The approval for Serum Institute of India’s vaccine is only for emergency use and is also subject to the consent of the patient, which means no one else would be held responsible for any health complications, if any, post vaccination,” Tope said.According to the state’s plan, the vaccination drive is going to be held in three phases meant for priority groups — health workers; frontline workers; people above 50 years of age and those with comorbidities below the age of 50. Of total, 8 lakh, around 7,58,000 health workers from the private and public sector have been registered.Mumbai has clocked 581 cases on Sunday, taking the count to 295,241. Of them, active cases are 8,961. The city has reported only three deaths, which is the lowest single-day toll since March 30. The toll has reached 11,135.Also read: 68 UK returnees found Covid positive in Maharashtra but not with new strainNone of the international passengers who have arrived in Maharashtra are yet to be found infected with the new coronavirus strain found in the United Kingdom (UK).

Refusing to budge from their stance, however, they said they will resurrect the protest sites and will continue to camp there till their demands of recalling the three new laws, and a new law on minimum support price, are accepted by the government. Thousands of farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand have been on protest at UP Gate in Ghaziabad since November 28, and the Chilla border and the Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida since December 1. They arrived in hundreds of tractor-trolleys and put-up myriad tents over the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway. However, heavy rain played spoilsport. “Although we had ensured that the entire block of our camp is fully covered, rain water swept in and a number of our bedrolls, blankets and even ration items were drenched in water. We have now asked for about 400 more bedrolls and even more blankets, as wet blankets and bedrolls will lead to health complications,” said Ravneet Kaur, the in-charge of the women’s camp at the UP Gate site. “However, people are still coming in despite the adverse weather. We estimate that the gathering will swell further and we will have to take up additional arrangements,” she added.At the Noida protest sites, one major tent each at both the protest sites collapsed. There were no injuries but the farmers lost their shelter.“The weather has already been troublesome and the rain further aggravated the situation. It is not comfortable for us but this will still not stop us from protesting. We took shelter in the Dalit Prerna Sthal building and despite the weather, more supporters came to join us today from a youth faction and a teacher’s union from Agra,” said SK Giri, national spokesperson, Lokshakti.The farmers used makeshift plastic wraps to cover their food supply and valuables. But they were adamant that the weather in no way will dampen their spirits.“A farmer is used to the cold and rain. We are used to finding shelter under trees and sleeping under open skies. The weather is not an issue for us,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, Bhanu faction.They were also joined by a group of farmers travelling from Barabanki for support. The protestors had already been provided 20 waterproof camping tents courtesy of the Hemkund foundation on Saturday.“There was water-logging in our tents but we were protected from the rain because of the new tents. Our protest will continue and nothing will deter us from our goals. Our fire pits had been drenched but they are back to being operational now. A farmer is very resilient. We are used to hardships,” he said.Volunteers at UP Gate said that the drain pipes of the expressway flushed rain water to the last carriageway, and this affected their camps and even food items stocked in temporary tents covered with tarpaulin. “We need about 100 more tarpaulin sheets for covering our tents, as it is likely that there will be more rain in the coming days. Our stocks of rice, sugar and wheat flour also got spoiled due to the rain. So, we need more of fresh supplies. However, we are battling the odds and will not go back till our demands are met,” said Gurjeet Singh, another volunteer from Udham Singh Nagar (Uttarakhand). “Saturday night, a three-year-old girl staying with her mother developed health complications due to adverse weather and we rushed her to the nearest hospital, where she is recuperating and is stable. So, such weather will affect our people but we are committed to stay put and carry on our fight,” he added. The most affected portions of the protest site were the “fauji tents” (soldier tents) which are generally constructed in the shape of a hut with the use of bamboo sticks and tarpaulin. “We have about 200-250 ‘fauji tents’ and many of these faced a huge water inflow, which has drenched our bedrolls, blankets, clothes and daily items. However, we are trying to get more bedrolls and blankets. Till that time, the occupants will adjust in tents which are not affected or are less affected,” said Vikramjeet Singh, a volunteer at the UP Gate. The dais, which sees daily speeches by leaders at UP Gate, was almost out of order due to heavy water-logging but the eleven farmers, who keep up the 24-hours relay fast, were present at the dais and continued their fast on Sunday. “Due to the situation which unfolded due to the rain, cooked food supplies came in from several villages. The langars at the UP Gate site started but a bit later than usual, as priority was to cover up the food supplies which were stocked in tents and to save them from water,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “However, farmers are used to these kinds of conditions and everyone came forward to help each other out. The priority is to get more coverings for the tents to protect them from the water. On Monday, we have the next round of talks scheduled with the government and everyone is looking forward to it,” he added.Police said that the weather did not cause any injuries or accidents in Noida.“They are being provided with all amenities. The law and order situation is being maintained. The traffic is affected due to the road closure but it has been moving consistently through diversions via the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway for the past few weeks,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-protests-heavy-rain-hits-up-gate-noida-sites-but-fails-to-dampen-spirits/story-AIG4zXHC9TuBmVou8yL1dP.html

The prime suspect, Bilal Malik, had led the attack after the 25-year-old woman, who is pursuing a course in fashion designing, had refused to marry him as he was already married to someone else, said Amit Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara).The officer said that the other three contract killers — Mohd Salam, Mohd Kamil, and Mohd Sahil — had joined him after being offered Rs 4 lakh for the hit.Police said the 25-year-old lived with her two sisters and their 47-year-old mother — who worked for the BSES — in Mansarovar Park. She told police she was in a relationship with Malik for six-seven years, until August last year when she decided to break up with him after realising that the relationship couldn’t continue as Malik was already married.But Malik allegedly wanted to marry her despite being married. “He had been pressuring me to marry him and threatened to harm me if I refused,” the 25-year-old told police in her official complaint.On November 30, Malik allegedly landed up at her house and insisted on marrying her but was turned down.He allegedly left the house and returned with the other suspects in tow. They later took the woman’s younger sister hostage at gunpoint and locked the house from inside.“Having no other choice, I agreed to accompany Malik. But he shot me in my cheek. When my mother tried to save me, another man shot her ,” she alleged.The survivor’s mother sustained a gunshot wound in her neck and wrist and was declared brought dead at a hospital. The suspects all managed to flee.Having tracked the suspects for weeks, the police finally received a tip-off and nabbed Malik with a pistol and five bullets from the Loni-Bhopura Road in East Delhi on Saturday. At his instance, the three other suspects were also nabbed.Police said that Malik, 26, has a wholesale garments business, and is a resident of Ghaziabad. He has a criminal past and had been involved in a theft case and another under the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-nabbed-for-mansarovar-park-killing-after-a-month/story-IzPTiuxAzjrgtHxDFu728H.html

Once complete, this will be Delhi’s widest fountain in a public place. “More than 75% of the work has been completed and we aim to finish the project by March. We are in now the last leg of the project, and plumbing and concreting-related work are underway,” said the official, who asked not to be identified.The NDMC had planned the project in May 2018 and then proposed to dismantle the iconic steel sprouts to make space for a water fountain. The Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC) rejected the proposal, after which the NDMC re-worked the design and decided to retain the sprouts.The project was supposed to be completed in two years, but was delayed due to the pandemic, the NDMC official said. “It will be the city’s biggest cascading fountain, with a circumference of 90m,” he said.The lawns, where the fountain is being built, are located on either side of Aurobindo Marg near AIIMS flyover. Another NDMC official said the landscape around the fountain and eight sprouts will also be improved with the help of decorative lights and varieties of flowering plants. “It will be the responsibility of the agency that will be hired through the tender, which was issued on December 18. The agency will also be entrusted with the maintenance of the area around the fountain,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/work-on-fountain-on-fountain-near-aiims-flyover-nears-end-ndmc-officials/story-Mpd1CGKS2rDVJ61auYHg2L.html

I was standing on the outer edge so half of my body was under the debris,” said Krishan Pal, the son-in-law of a 65-year-old man whose last rites were being performed when the roof of a Muradnagar cremation ground collapsed, killing at least 24. The incident took place around 11.30am at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground when around 50 to 60 people were attending the cremation rituals of Jai Ram, who had died on Saturday night, the police said. Many of the families and the injured said they were rescued after hectic efforts that lasted till 6pm on Sunday. “I could hear everyone crying for help. I was trying to attract the attention of people standing nearby. Then, I almost fainted as I felt that all my energy was lost,” Krishan Pal added.Krishan Pal was brought to MMG District Hospital on Sunday evening with severe injuries to his head and legs. His wife, Poonam Pal, said their son Ashwini (18) and son-in-law Nishant Azad (27) were also severely injured. “My father died around 10pm on Saturday and all our relatives and neighbours were at the cremation.

In a flash, around 50 people simply disappeared under the debris. I stood there dumbfounded. My brother was also buried under the debris. His two minor children are now waiting for him at home,” Kumar said. Manish Tyagi, a resident who was one of the first responders, said he could hear cries for help from beneath the debris.“The construction of the roof was completed around two to three months ago and there were hardly any pillars supporting the structure. So when it collapsed, the whole roof came down in one go,” he said.The district administration roped in earthmoving machines as well as the civil police and teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). “We despatched our teams around 12.45pm on Sunday. Before we reached, the administration and locals had started rescue operations.

This made it difficult for officials to contact the controller and get details of the number of students that appeared and remained absent for the exam. Deputy DEO (secondary) Charanjit Singh said, “The show-cause notice has been issued to the in-charge for negligence and changing the controller without taking permission.” Tandon has been asked to submit a reply via email by Monday. If he fails to do so, the report will be sent to the higher authorities to take action against him. As many as 4,104 students took the Punjab State Talent Search Examination at 26 examination centres in the district on Sunday. Around 1,457 students (26%) failed to turn up. Of the 5,561 expected students, 2,098 of Class 8 and 2,006 of Class 10 appeared. The exam was held between 10am and 1pm.The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) had earlier postponed the exam due to administrative reasons. Rajinder Kaur, district education officer elementary-cum-secondary, checked four centres – Government Senior Secondary School, Jagraon (boys), Government Senior Secondary School, Jagraon (girls), Government Senior Secondary School, Raikot, and Government Senior Secondary School, Bassian. “The test was conducted smoothly at all examination centres in the district,” Kaur said.The examination is conducted annually to provide financial help to deserving students from Classes 8 and 10 of government schools and is aims to prevent them from dropping out due to financial constraints. Those who crack the test get Rs 200 every month till they complete Class 12.Lovepreet Kaur, a Class-8 student,of Government Senior Secondary School, Gurm, said, “The paper was easier than the National-Means-and-Merit Scholarship exam.

03-01-2021||Gurugram||Biker injured on Golf Course Road||A man riding a motorbike on Golf Course Road was severely injured after a fellow biker rammed his vehicle into his. Although the incident took place on December 29, the case was registered on Saturday after the victim gained consciousness, said the police. According to the police, Lakshit Grover, a resident of Vipul World in Sector 48, was out on a trip his biker friends. The group was on their way to a hotel on Golf Course Road for breakfast around 8.30am. The victim was riding a Ducati and was about to take a U-turn, when a fellow biker, who had picked up speed, hit his motorbike. The victim fractured his leg a result of the accident. His fellow riders fled the spot after the accident. The police said the victim was rushed to a private hospital where doctors informed that his right leg was severely fractured. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that Grover had allegedly asked the suspect to drive carefully but he refused to listen to him. “The victim alleged that the suspect had intentionally hit him. He had also exchanged his motorbike with another rider allegedly with the intention of hitting the victim,” he said. Goel said the suspect is a Delhi resident. A case under sections 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others),338 (voluntarily causing hurt)) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Sector 53 police station has been filed. On the other hand, the suspect, who has joined investigation, denied the allegation that there was any personal enmity between the two. He said that even he had suffered injuries and that he had never threatened Grover nor abused him. The suspect’s statement was recorded by the police. The case was registered on Saturday after the victim was deemed fit to record his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/biker-injured-on-golf-course-road/story-MzgIiTp66MypwcjhiTG1pI.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||10 days of fewer than 100 daily Covid cases||With 71 cases of Covid-19 reported on Sunday, the number of new daily infections in the district has now remained fewer than 100 for 10 consecutive days — the longest such spate in at least five months. In the week ending January 3, Gurugram reported 442 new cases, it’s lowest seven-day aggregate in at least seven weeks, while reporting just one death (the lowest weekly toll in over two months). Sunday was also the sixteenth consecutive day that the new daily recoveries outweighed new daily positives, with 105 more recoveries.Authorities said the prevailing situation has given them a much-needed respite from the mid-November peak, when cases peaked, prompting authorities to increase the reserved bed capacity for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals, for the first time since May. The continued reductions in mortality and positivity rate are allowing authorities more bandwidth to gear up for the impending vaccine roll-out, health department officials said.“We are now in the worst of the winter season, which is when we were anticipating another upward spike in cases. Fortunately, that has not happened. To reach the first peak in June, it took us about four months since our first case. The second peak came much quicker, towards August-end. Then by mid-October, the growth rate was showing signs of a third wave. So, if there is going to be a fourth wave, we would have started seeing an indication of it by now,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, Gurugram.With fewer active patients to monitor, fewer tests to conduct and decrease in contact tracing, department officials said they have adequate resources to prepare for the impending vaccine roll-out. “In mid-November, we were burdened by the sheer volume of cases, but now that the active caseload is low, we have been able to divert resources where needed, so that health workers were duly registered as beneficiaries, vaccine sites were identified, vaccinators being trained and so on,” Sharma said.Emphasising the extent of the slowdown in new cases, Sharma cited testing data over the past two weeks. While there has been a 22% dip in the number of samples tested in the last fortnight, the positivity rate (both daily and weekly) has remained between 2% to 2.5%. This is the third consecutive week that the positivity rate has remained below the WHO’s recommended threshold of 5%. “We have not yet seen such a consistently stable positivity rate in the history of the epidemic in Gurugram. This indicates that the spread is slow enough for our health response to also be stable and organised,” Sharma said.The total number of active patients in the district stands at 828 (down from 1,059 a week ago). Of these, 742 are currently under home isolation, while 82 are in hospitals. Another four active patients are under observation at district Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/10-days-of-fewer-than-100-daily-covid-cases/story-KEnfOLmO5lFvJdpu2yTZBL.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||Two held for forging road tax receipts||The Regional Transport Authority (RTA) of Gurugram on Saturday arrested two men from the border, at the Sirhaul toll plaza, for allegedly collecting entry road tax from commercial vehicles and issuing forged receipts.The suspects were identified as Lalit and Johny. Two more of the group have been identified and all four of them are from Mohna in Ballabhgarh of Faridabad, said officials. Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA said that the incident came to their notice when a road tax slip produced by a commercial vehicle operator did not match their records and seemed to be forged. “The teams checked the slip and brought him to my office. We were shocked to find that a gang was issuing fake RTA road tax slips to commercial drivers and duping the government,” she said. Aas Mohammad, the cab driver, of Palam in Delhi, during a check on November 19 at Iffco Chowk, produced a slip, which also had a QR code, but did not match with the department’s record when scanned, said officials. Mohammad was penalised Rs 20,000 and he appealed to the officials to look into the matter as many drivers were being duped by the criminals. Yadav said that teams started conducting more checks and found that many such fake online road tax certificates were being produced, causing a loss to the state. “I have been quietly following this for over 10 days getting surprise checks done and identifying these frauds. All we knew initially was that someone comes in a private car occasionally and indulges in this fraudulent business. A taxi driver gave me information,” she said. Yadav said it took 10 days to identify the vehicle and on Saturday, they found two of the gang members selling the fake slips from a car near Ambience Mall. “One of them was sitting with a laptop on a rear seat and his system was connected to a printer. He was printing fake slips from inside the car and was duping drivers posing as RTA officials,” said Yadav. A team led by sub-inspector Praveen Kumar, along with the RTA officials, reached the spot on Saturday and arrested them. The team also recovered fake slips, the laptop and printer from their possession.Yadav said during a preliminary probe, they found that the suspects used to con the drivers into believing them to be RTA officials. A case under sections 420 (cheating),467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the DLF Phase-3 police station. The extent of their operation and the estimated loss the government is yet to be calculated, said officials. They said that at least 60 fake slips were issued every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-held-for-forging-road-tax-receipts/story-mihUauqU0ANmMRtcG7BRTI.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||Dry run for Covid-19 vaccination to be held on January 7||The dry run for administering the Covid-19 vaccine will be held in Gurugram on January 7, according to the district health department officials. Three vaccination sites, including two urban and one rural, have been chosen to carry out the demonstration of Covid-19 vaccination mechanism in the district. The drive has already been conducted at the state headquarters in Panchkula on January 2. It was a part of the nationwide mock drill conducted at 285 vaccination sites across 125 districts to test the mechanism that has been set up to ensure a smooth roll-out of Covid-19 vaccination.In Gurugram, the mock drive will be conducted at three locations – the urban primary health centres in Wazirabad and Bhangrola, and a government senior secondary school in Basai Enclave. “Wazirabad and Basai Enclave are urban areas, while Bhangrola is rural,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.He said that in each of the sites, the dry run will be carried out on 25 healthcare workers, who are already registered on the Co-WIN platform. A team of four vaccination officers and a vaccinator will demonstrate how beneficiaries will be registered, vaccinated and checked for adverse events in separate rooms as per the chalked-out plan. “On Monday, the state health department will hold a meeting with the district officials regarding the dry run and share their learnings as they have already conducted the drive. Through the activity, we will check the end-to-end planned operations, cold-chain points, and tracking of beneficiaries on the digital platform, Co-WIN, which provides real-time information related to Covid-19 vaccination,” said Singh, adding that the teams will also check how vaccines from cold -chain points will be carried to the vaccination sites.“There are 37 cold chain points and a regional vaccine storage warehouse in the district. Our focus will also be on transportation of vaccines to these sites at their designated storage temperature. For this, people handling cold chain points will also be a part of the meeting,” said Singh.Once the vaccine is rolled out, over 32,000 health care workers in the district are likely to get the vaccine jab in the first phase. Over 286 vaccinators have already been trained and 181 sites have also been identified where the vaccination will be given once rolled out. The health department earlier this week sought additional manpower of 1,430 people who will be deployed as vaccination officers 1,2, 3 and 4 at the session sites having a waiting room, a vaccinating room and an observation room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dry-run-for-covid-19-vaccination-to-be-held-on-january-7/story-sRh9q3MiVmjzYnVWQdebrI.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||Two booked for stealing ₹2 lakh from friend’s house||Two men were booked for allegedly stealing ₹2 lakh from their friend’s house in his absence in Sector 55 on December 29. A case was registered on Saturday after the victim returned home and found his almirah ransacked, said the police. According to the police, the victim, Jaikrit Singh of Palam Colony in Delhi, was living in a rented apartment in Sector 55. He is a real estate agent by profession and had befriended many locals for the sake of his business. The police said during the course of his work, Singh became friends with the suspects. Singh said his friends often visited his house and, on December 29, they broke into the house during his absence. “They jumped off the boundary wall and reached the balcony by climbing a car, which was parked in the parking area. I was shocked to see this on the CCTV footage and even tried calling them up. But their number was switched off,” he said. The victim told the police that the suspects knew that ₹2 lakh was kept in the almirah. However, they were not aware that CCTV camera was installed so they jumped into the house and were captured by the camera. Singh informed the police and complained against the suspects, who are residents of Gurugram. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that a case under Section 380 (theft) was registered against the two men. We are yet to arrest the suspects . “Teams have been formed and their call details are being scanned to track their location,” he said. The police are checking their credentials to see if they are involved in any other criminal cases, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-booked-for-stealing-2-lakh-from-friend-s-house/story-OmtSkoQSL7U6gNHl9l2MMM.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||Rain plays spoilsport in Gurugram on Sunday||The city received a light but prolonged spell of rain on Sunday, which served to clean the air, even as temperatures continued to rise. The minimum temperature on Sunday settled at 11.4 Celsius degrees.Waterlogging was also reported from several areas, but officials said that they easily managed to clear the situation in a short duration as only isolated spots were affected.The rainfall started around 6am on Sunday and continued till late afternoon. However, the automatic weather system in the city failed to record the amount of rainfall received.Several areas of the city also reported power outages and voltage fluctuations since 4am. However, most of the issues were resolved and power restored to the affected areas by the evening.Air quality improvesAs per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, thunderstorm with hail can be expected on Monday, with the temperature expected to rise further over the next few days. The wet spell is expected to continue till January 5, after which cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely to set in again from January 7 onwards at isolated places in the state, as per IMD’s bulletin.While the minimum temperature of the city rose by two degrees to settle at 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday from 9.5 degrees Celsius the previous day, the maximum temperature was 16.8 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD’s Palam observatory in Delhi. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the city’s temperature on Sunday. The Palam observatory, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 10 degrees Celsius and 18 degrees Celsius, respectively.Prolonged showers in the first half of the day on Sunday brought about a significant improvement in air quality, with Gurugram recording 260 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin, indicating poor air. This was down from 376 the previous day, which was in the upper end of the very poor category of the AQI.However, Delhi, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad all continued to record very poor air on Sunday as well. Manesar, which typically records cleaner air than Gurugram, saw an AQI of 288 on Sunday.Experts said that winds originating southeast, of speeds between 15 and 20kmph, may have played a more influential role in Gurugram than in other parts of NCR. “What is emerging as a clear trend is Gurugram’s favourable geographic position, where it enjoys favourable meteorology to a greater extent than other major NCR cities,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from east-southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed 10-18 kmph, generally cloudy sky, light to moderate rain/thunderstorm accompanied with gusty winds (20-30 kmph) and possibility of hailstorm at isolated places on 04.01.2021.”.A blanket reduction in air pollution is expected across NCR on Monday, with AQIs across the region predicted to range from the lower end of the poor category to the upper end of moderate category.WaterloggingAccording to officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), waterlogging was reported from areas such as Mayfield Gardens, Palam Vihar, Sector 10 A, Kadipur Road, sectors 27, 28, 47, 49, and 50.MCG’s chief engineer, Raman Sharma, said that since the rains were scattered and generally of low intensity, localised waterlogging took place only for a short duration and that they had to install motor pumps or use suction machines in only four locations.“The rain was of low intensity and scattered. Hence, heavy water accumulation did not occur on the streets or roads. Rainwater receded from stormwater drains in a short time. Only in four locations, such as Kadipur Road and Sector 10A, we needed to install motor pumps to drain out rainwater to the nearest drainage outlet or use suction pumps to clear the choked lines,” said Sharma.Power outageSeveral localities in the city were affected by power cuts on Sunday, including parts of Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Sector 49, DLF Phases 2 and 3, Sector 23, Sector 52 and Sector 56, among others. While power supply to most areas had been restored by evening, residents complained that outages had begun as early as 4am, lasting well into the afternoon.Ravi Pathak, a resident of Ashok Vihar Phase 2, said that his neighbourhood had gone without power for over 12 hours on Sunday. “The power went off around 4am and all day, I tried calling the power department’s helpline number, but to no avail. After a point, I was unable to even call the department as my mobile phone turned off. The connection was restored only at around 8pm on Sunday,” said Pathak.In other parts of the city, residents also complained of receiving murky water. “Whenever it rains heavily in my area, we start receiving totally murky water. I have raised this issue with the authority concerned, but not received any answer,” said Bhaskar Kotwal, a resident of Sector 4.Shiv Sekhri, another resident of Sector 4, raised similar concerns. “This has been a recurring issue throughout the year. The water is not even fit to bathe with,” he said.KC Agarwal, chief engineer, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. Multiple junior officials, including executive and superintending engineers, also declined comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rain-plays-spoilsport-in-gurugram-on-sunday/story-MbIMb5L82E9yhAUBN7IryJ.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG terminates the services of contractor after complaints of animal cruelty||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) terminated the services of a Jhajjhar-based contractor hired for catching stray dogs, following numerous complaints of animal cruelty by residents and a report by Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). In the MCG’s notice to the contractor, the civic body has stated that complaints such as non-performance of duties, cruelty towards stray dogs, and misbehaviour with citizens were received against the contractor. However, since the contractor did not resolve the matter and change its way of operating, stop cruelty against stray dogs and submit a satisfactory response to the civic body, despite having been served four show-cause notices, its services were terminated with immediate effect, the notice read.Chetna Devendra Joshi, representative of AWBI in Gurugram, said that she had been alerting MCG officials about the discrepancies and also raising concerns of residents with them that prompted the civic body to take action.“There were many discrepancies in the work of MCG contractor. The previous contractor had agreed to capture and sterilise a dog for around ₹950. The Jhajjar-based contractor had agreed to do the same for ₹630, which raised suspicions. This is because general anaesthesia, used in sterilisation, costs nearly the same amount. Upon further investigation, the AWBI found more issues in the selection process,” said Joshi.Joshi said, as per the rules introduced by the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) for municipal corporations across Haryana, the eligibility for a contractor engaged in capturing stray dogs includes a minimum experience of three years, sterilisation of 3,000 dogs, and a recognition by AWBI. She said that the contractor did not meet any of the listed eligibilities. “When we raised these matters along with the videos of cruelty in the capturing process, as recorded by residents of Gurugram, MCG took cognisance of this matter in October and subsequently served four notices to the contractor,” said Joshi. The treatment of MCG outsourced contractors and workers with regards to stray dogs has been a cause of concern with residents. A two-minute-long video circulating on social media in April 2020 showed around a dozen men, some of them armed with wooden sticks and iron pipes, trying to grab stray dogs, stuffing them into gunny bags, and piling them into a tractor-trolley in Sushant Lok-1. This led to the MCG terminating the services of an outsourced sanitation worker with immediate effect.Coincidentally, the previous contractor’s licence was also terminated in February 2020 after MCG received several complaints of mistreatment of dogs from residents.“The AWBI had submitted a report that the contractor was not following the norms as per their rules and regulations. Upon verification and after giving ample time to the contractor to contest the same, a report of MCG’s findings was submitted to the commissioner for further action. The MCG commissioner has subsequently terminated the services of the contractor,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-terminates-the-services-of-contractor-after-complaints-of-animal-cruelty/story-kl9zlPLy3PHZfw6p1HaCZN.html

Panipat police have registered a first information report (FIR) under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unidentified person(s) as the district social justice and welfare department officials alleged that ineligible people were added to the list of beneficiaries by tampering with the official website of the department.In the police complaint, district social welfare officer Satyawan raised the issue and demanded action against the officials and people involved in the alleged scam. He alleged that pensions of around 110 ineligible persons were approved on October 21 last year by misusing the official ID and password of the department. He claimed that the accused allegedly used different IP addresses to add these ineligible beneficiaries. “Officials of the department have access to the data and have the right to give approval to new beneficiaries after the completion of verification of all documents, but some unknown people allegedly accessed the website and documents of ineligible people were approved within hours,” the district social welfare officer alleged in the complaint.The accused have used five different IP addresses and the approval was granted between 9.17pm on October 21 and 12am October 22, 2020. The officer also provided the details of IP addresses and ineligible beneficiaries to the police and sought action against the accused. The FIR in the case has been registered under sections 420, 463, 465, 467, 468, 470, and 471 of Indian Penal Code and a probe has been launched.District social welfare officer Satyawan said the pensions were not disbursed to these ineligible beneficiaries as the officials managed to detect the irregularity within days they were inducted.

03-01-2021||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Big challenges for municipal corporation in poll year||Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is set for its mayoral election as mayor Raj Bala Malik’s stint comes to an end after a ‘zero’ year in which hardly any contentious matters could be resolved or projects completed because of the Covid lockdown and continued restrictions. The year 2021 is also significant with MC elections slated for December, making this the last mayoral stint of the current Bharatiya Janata Party dispensation.Malik’s tenure saw the end of the decade-old logjam over the Japyee waste processing plant, as the MC finally took over. However, after the Covid-19 lockdown, spending cuts and revenue losses put Malik in the firing line as she was unable to get additional funds from the UT administration.The 200% water tariff hike announced at one point almost proved to be Malik’s undoing as her own party members urged her to roll it back even as she appeared to be in two minds about implementing it.Now, as she gets ready to leave, Malik, however, will have the satisfaction of knowing that the waste segregation system has been kickstarted with trucks rolling out to collect trash, covering the entire city by January this year.The sewage systems are also being upgraded.In an election year, therefore, the new mayor will have to deliver on the BJP’s promises to catapult Chandigarh among the top Smart City bracket, which looks to be a huge challenge, given the circumstances. His or her key result areas will include:Improving the waste management system: The waste processing plant at Sector 25 is not working at full capacity with MC again planning to invite private players to upgrade and maintain it, a move which previously had disastrous consequences.Improving performance in Swachh Survekshan: Continued poor performance remains a challenge even as Chandigarh failed to break into the ranks of the top 10 cleanest cities Resolving funds crunch: With revenues drying up in a zero year MC’s financial crisis is deepening even as adequate grant in aid is not flowing in from the administration Poll positionWhat should Chandigarh MC’s agenda be in an election year?What should be the new mayor’s priority areas to catapult Chandigarh into the top Smart City bracket?

Sargam Bansal, a Punjab Engineering College (PEC) student, who scored 99.17 percentile said, “This year CAT was a different ball game altogether with surprises on account of both number of questions and timing. So the key was to have faith in your preparation and not to be unnerved by the unknown”. Among males, Kshitiz Garg with 99.61 percentile, pursuing engineering from PEC, credited his success to building a strong foundation and taking mocks regularly.Himani Garg from Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College with 99.05 Percentile, reflected on her ability to identify doable questions as her mantra for success.Hirdesh Madan, director of coaching centre Bulls Eye, said, “Interestingly there are a good number of girls in the toppers’ list this time. “I think in 2021 there will be a rise in the number of CAT aspirants as last year’s numbers were adversely affected by Covid-19, which left students confused about career prospects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cat-2020-chandigarh-tricity-students-shine/story-iPunaCOTnIeMcNYjuEyEuN.html

On December 4, a woman and her teen daughter lost their lives after a sand-laden tipper hit their two-wheeler at this blind curve near Mata Gujri Gurdwara in Sector 70. Following this, Kaler inspected the spot and prepared a report, which has been submitted to the chief engineer of Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). “I have suggested installation of mirrors and reflectors besides construction of speed breakers at the spot. We also observed that crash barriers installed by GMADA have broken and illegal cuts have been made, where commuters take U-turn, risking their lives,” he said. GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said he has received the report and the staff is working on it.According to data provided by the Mohali police, Airport Road saw around 200 fatal accidents in 2019-20, with 17 of them at this S-curve alone, which has been tagged as a black spot. The curve had to be constructed after a gurdwara refused to give up land for the road. Former executive engineer NS Kalsi said it is possible to straighten the road by constructing a new stretch on government land in Sector 77 opposite the existing curve. “When the road was being constructed, we had warned GMADA that the curve will prove fatal, but to no avail. Now, it is one of the most accident-prone spots in Mohali,” he said. In April 2019, Punjab traffic advisor Navdeep Asija, after conducting a three-dimensional safety audit using drones, had revealed major flaws in the design of Airport Road, and stated in is report that it is not pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-traffic-sp-submits-report-on-making-airport-road-s-killer-s-curve-safer/story-AXZyaZh5gYKticEqhd8XrI.html
03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Pandemic blues hit Raj Bala Malik’s term as Chandigarh mayor||Covid-19 pandemic overshadowed the one-year term of Raj Bala Malik as the Chandigarh mayor, which ends on January 8. It gave her little chance to prove her mettle.However, her tenure started on a solid note. Unlike 2019, when a rebel candidate fought against the BJP nominee, this time around the party stood united behind her.Next came, the ending of the decade-old logjam over the Japyee waste processing plant, as the MC finally decided to take it over. But, March onwards, pandemic woes hit the MC. Lockdown, spending cuts and revenue loss put Malik’s working style under the scanner, particularly her ability to arrange additional funds from the UT administration. In the coming months, her relationship with the party soured. She came under severe criticism for poor condition of the city roads, water tariff hike and sanitation workers’ strike.At personal front, Malik tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be hospitalised.Weakened within party, targeted by public, oppnAfter the pandemic, all MC General House meets went virtual. In October, BJP councillors, led by the party’s state chief Arun Sood, demanded a physical meet. Malik had just been discharged from the PGIMER, and going against the party, she again called a virtual meeting. In response, all BJP councillors, except one, boycotted it.“There was simmering tension between Malik and Sood. At a time when BJP leaders were publicly criticising MC officials, including the commissioner, Malik was considered to be giving more heed to their advice over her own party decisions,” said a party insider, requesting anonymity.Right on cue, Congress and resident welfare associations also started gunning for the mayor, holding her responsible for the hike of nearly 200% in water tariff. At the same time, MC officials were advising her in favour of the hike, sounding alarm over ₹100 crore losses. In the end, Malik went with her party and a rollback was announced.Meanwhile, despite having dedicated funds for road repair and maintenance, the works couldn’t take off. First, the pandemic lockdown was attributed as the reason. Then, the monsoon was blamed, and thereafter, onset of winters became the culprit. Leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla even labelled her as the, “biggest failure” among all city’s mayors. Things, finally, started looking upIn the last phase of Malik’s term, the MC finally started the long-pending door-to-door collection of segregated waste, though teething problems persist.“The upgrade of five sewage treatment plants has also started, and material recovery stations started to come up. Several of the MC’s integrated online services were launched,” said Malik, defending her term.Her fellow BJP councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu said: “Despite the pandemic, many development works and pending infrastructure projects were started. Even though, at times, there were differences between MC officials and the party, Malik ensured that these differences were ironed out.”BOXReport cardAs Raj Bala Malik’s one-year stint as the Chandigarh mayor nears end, HT looks at various highs and lows during her tenureHIGHSMC took over the waste processing plant and started its upgradeDoor-to-door collection of segregated waste kicked offSeveral of the MC’s integrated online services were launchedLOWSCouldn’t effectively manage differences between party and MC officialsTenure plagued by water tariff hike row and sanitation workers’ strikeThe condition of various roads in the city remained poor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pandemic-blues-hit-raj-bala-malik-s-term-as-chandigarh-mayor/story-Ap2ksua11RjwCfvtmVmPFN.html

03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Amid fears of rebellion, BJP to announce name of Chandigarh mayoral candidate on last day of nominations||Even as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s central leadership makes last ditch efforts to have a consensus candidate for the Chandigarh mayor’s post, internal party rifts over the issue are threatening to come out into the open.Continuing with its four-year tradition of last-minute announcement of its nominees for the post of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, the BJP will declare the names on Monday, the last day of filing nominations.“The tradition came into works in a bid to dissuade councillors to go against the party’s decision. In 2019, the strategy failed to stop a rebel candidate from standing up against the party’s nominee. However, this time around, the party is hoping that last-minute declaration would not give such a chance to anyone,” said a senior leader, on the condition of anonymity.BJP national general secretary and state party in-charge Dushyant Gautam had met all 20 party councillors on Wednesday. On Sunday, too, he continued to hold parleys with the local leadership to avoid any chance of a rebellion. “With no consensus candidate being agreed upon by the councillors during their one-on-one meeting with Gautam, they were asked to suggest two names each for the three posts. Their resumes were also taken,” said a councillor, who didn’t want to be named.Winning candidate might need just 13 votesThe fear of a 2019-like rebellion remains a possibility this year too as a section of councillors have expressed unhappiness over the prospects of party state chief Arun Sood getting the nomination. “This year, the concern over rebellion has been heightened. There is a possibility that the winning candidate might need only 13 votes to get elected,” said another councillor.The 26 elected councillors and the city MP, who is an ex-officio member of the House, vote in the mayoral polls. The winning candidate needs 14 votes. In 2020, BJP candidate got 22 out of the 27 votes. In 2019, with cross-voting taking place, the BJP candidate could get only 16 votes while the rebel candidate got 11.“This time around, the lone Shiromani Akali Dal councillor is set to boycott elections in support of the farmers’ stir. Last year, he voted for the BJP. Also, due to poor health, councillor Hira Negi and MP Kirron Kher are likely to miss voting. So, the magic mark could be reduced to 13 as only 24 councillors are expected to vote,” said the senior leader. “The party is also hoping not many councillors would want to go against its decision for the fear of losing their ticket for the House elections later in the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-fears-of-rebellion-bjp-to-announce-name-of-chandigarh-mayoral-candidate-on-last-day-of-nominations/story-2Y6Dj3k7fu5pHRV8GWSKuK.html

While the poultry farmers’ association is trying to play it down, the authorities have sprung into action and collected samples to know the reason behind this “high mortality”. The report is expected on Monday.Dr Anil Kumar, deputy director, animal husbandry and dairying department, Haryana, said: “There are 80-90 lakh poultry birds in over 110 farms located in Barwala belt. So far, over 1 lakh birds have died in 10-20 poultry farms.”A team of experts from the department visited the farms on Saturday and collected 80 samples besides five carcasses, which have been sent to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar.“We are expecting the report by Monday,” said Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, deputy commissioner, Panchkula, who held a meeting with Dr Anil Kumar on Sunday evening to take stock of the situation. Ahuja said the deaths have been reported from farms in Garhi Kotaha and Mouli villages.‘Don’t panic, viral infection suspected’Though the exact reason is not known, experts are suspecting it to be some viral infection.“The mortality is on the higher side and there could be a few stress factors. First, it could be the winter season. But as the infection has spread to over 1 lakh birds, we are suspecting it to be some viral infection,” said Dr Kumar, adding that so far, there has been no report of any poultry worker getting infected. “So, most likely, the infection is not the one that is transmitted to humans,” he said.Meanwhile, Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association, which has already suffered huge losses due to Covid-19, suspect extreme cold to be the reason behind the deaths.“There is nothing to worry. There are nearly 1 crore chickens, of which just a lakh at 10-15 poultry farms have died. This is not a big number. It happened because of extreme cold or Ranikhet disease,” said Darshan Kumar, president of the association. He said the sales have not been impacted so far, and accused the villagers of blowing the issue out of proportion. Dr Anil Kumar said: “I cannot recall the last time when these many birds had died. However, we are not suspecting anything worrisome for human health at this moment. There is no need to panic. We are awaiting reports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-lakh-chickens-die-mysteriously-in-panchkula-s-barwala-poultry-belt/story-Ci2yq8gmgQkdLbU9fVnMvI.html

MoUs signed for implementation of 850 MW Ratle HEP and 930 MW Kirthai-II HEP; execution of Sawalkot HEP (1856 MW), Uri-I (Stage-II) (240 MW) and Dulhasti (Stage-II) (258 MW),” J&K’s directorate of information and public relations said in a tweet.“The MoUs signed today to attract investments worth Rs 35,000 crore for Jammu and Kashmir power sector and would ensure 24-hour power supply to the public,” said L-G Manoj Sinha.He said in the last 70 years, J&K was able to generate only 3504 MW energy. “But in the next four years, we will generate 3,498 MW additional electricity to ensure energy security of the region,” he said.“The 19 distribution and transmission projects inaugurated today would enhance the ease of living here, in addition to playing a significant role in industrialisation and employment generation in J&K,” the L-G said.Despite a number of power projects by NHPC in J&K, the region often reels under darkness, particularly in harsh winters owing to the deficit in local power production and supply. The nascent industrial sector in J&K also faces losses due to the unreliable power supply and distribution system.RK Singh, quoted by official twitter handle of J&K government, said the national average of electricity in rural areas is 20 hours and in urban areas is 22-23 hours. “J&K too will reach the milestone if the pace of development is kept same. We will provide every support to J&K. Locals to be trained and given employment in NHPC ventures,” he said.“J&K to see a new dawn of energy sufficiency and thereby development in all sectors. The mega hydro power projects will not only generate employment but also increase the per capita income of J&K,” said Dr Jitendra Singh.The L-G added that J&K is taking a quantum leap from power deficit to power surplus in the next four years.“For uninterrupted power supply, this is the most significant move by the J&K administration. Clean, affordable and reliable energy is the key for industries, businesses and society to grow. Our vision is to effectively harness hydro energy resources of J&K with a goal to double the energy generation by 2024,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-to-be-power-surplus-after-mous-with-nhpc-admn/story-iAZqlLEhqEDpOtfn8TuVrM.html

If anything wrong is found with the encounter, it will be rectified.”Party spokesperson Altaf Thakur also confirmed Koul’s statement.Three youths Zubair Ahmad (24) of Turkawangam, Shopian; Ajaz Maqbool (22) and Athar Mushtaq (17) of Putrigam, Pulwama, were killed in an encounter with the police and army at Lawaypora, Srinagar, on December 30.While the police and army have said the trio was killed in exchange of fire at Hokersar-Lawaypora, their families have rebutted the claim of security forces and said the youths were civilians. Athar was a Class 11 student, Aijaz was pursuing graduation while Zubair was a skilled worker, according to their families and the trio had been home a day before the killings.Almost all the mainstream political parties in Kashmir have raised questions over the encounter after the claims of the families.However, the police have rejected these claims while promising to probe the case from all possible angles. “Background check also reveals that Aijaz and Ather Mushtaq, both overground workers of militants, variously provided logistic support to terrorists. Antecedents and verifications too show that both were radically inclined and had aided terrorists of LeT (now so-called TRF) outfit,” police have said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/have-asked-admn-to-probe-srinagar-encounter-bjp/story-ysHQ3kBAfj51z5ILHG92gI.html

A penalty of Rs 25,000 was also imposed on him.Kumar is also the main accused in the infamous Gudiya case where a 16-year-old girl of Kotkhai was murdered after being raped in July 2017.The incident dates back to 2014 when Kumar attacked the woman with a billhook knife when she was grazing cattle in the forest area. On seeing the woman alone, the accused assaulted the woman and when she resisted, he snatched the billhook knife from her and attacked her, said additional district attorney Ekalaya Singh. The woman suffered grievous injuries in the attack. She was found unconscious in the forest by her relatives who later called for the emergency ambulance services. She was hospitalised to the civil hospital in Sarahan and later referred to the regional hospital in Nahan.Police had recorded statements of the woman after she was discharged from the hospital. Kumar was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for the rape and murder of a Class 10 girl who was found dead in the Halaila forest in Kotkhai on July 6, 2017, two days after she was reported missing.The CBI had arrested a 25-year-old lumberjack identified by DNA testing who allegedly raped and killed a 16-year-old girl in Kotkhai near Shimla, exonerating six people arrested by Himachal Pradesh Police in the case.The rape and murder of the schoolgirl led to widespread protests in the state and when one of the six suspects arrested by the state police, Suraj Kumar, died in custody, allegedly after he was severely beaten, protests intensified and led to the case being transferred to the CBI. The probe was divided into two parts. One pertained to the custodial death of one of the six suspects arrested by state police and the second focused on the rape and murder of the girl.In the case of the custodial death of Suraj Singh, the agency charge-sheeted nine policemen including an officer of the rank of inspector general, charging them with murder, wrongful confinement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/key-accused-in-gudiya-rape-murder-case-gets-life-term-for-murder-bid/story-g6QLTfjZkqoq50A42yqCWI.html
03-01-2021||Bhopal||‘Strict law to be enacted against stone-pelting, vandalism’: CM Chouhan||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Sunday there would be a strict law to deal with the crimes related to stone-pelting and damage to public and private properties in Madhya Pradesh.“Stone pelters are enemies to the society whoever they may be. Stone pelting is not a simple crime which may cause loss of life, create an atmosphere of fear and terror and result in stampede and chaos. There will be a rule of law in Madhya Pradesh. Such criminals are not petty criminals. They will not be spared”, said chief minister responding to questions from journalists on certain stone-pelting incidents that took place in Malwa region during Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and associated organisations’ public awareness rallies in December last week ahead of its donation seeking campaign from January 14. The CM added, “There is no strict punishment for such a crime so far. We are going to come with a strict law to deal with such crimes. But there is not just the crime of stone-pelting only. Many a time, trouble makers damage the public property, set it afire and damage private properties too, like someone’s shop is set afire or any other private property is vandalised. This is an unpardonable crime.”He said democracy has allowed people to express their views peacefully but no one should indulge in arson, stone-pelting and vandalism.“That’s why the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has decided that there will not only be stringent punishment for the crime regarding damage to properties but also penalty will be realised from such persons for such a crime. If need be, such persons’ properties will be confiscated for realisation (of penalty) and compensate the damage,” he added.Also read: Won’t go back till laws are repealed, say farmers before 7th round of talks“I have already issued instructions to authorities regarding the new law and work is going on on the same. Soon, there will be such a law,” he told journalists.There were incidents of stone-pelting on VHP and associated organisations’ public awareness rallies in Ujjain on December 25 and in Indore on December 29. FIRs against about 100 persons were lodged from both sides and several accused were arrested. Provisions of the National Security Act (NSA) were invoked against six accused in Ujjain who were allegedly involved in stone-pelting. House of one of the accused allegedly constructed illegally was razed in Ujjain in a joint operation of district administration, police and the civic body, as per the police and administration authorities.Reacting upon the CM’s announcement, state Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Any strict law against stone-pelting is a welcome step but the CM should also have spoken about the crime about taking out religious rallies without permission, barging into the shrines of a particular religion, coining provocative slogans against the religion, vandalising the particular community’s properties including shrines as were witnessed in Malwa region recently. Is this not a crime in the eyes of the CM? Will he make a provision for stringent punishment on such crimes also?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/strict-law-to-be-enacted-against-stone-pelting-vandalism-cm-chouhan/story-MKIUWe59tjjgzbxv383aLN.html

He is kicked in the face and slapped by the personnel.The incident took place on Saturday, the police said.“Prima facie, one police constable, and some BRO personnel were involved in this incident,” said Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh.The Atal Tunnel has been witnessing a heavy tourist influx after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated it in October last year. However, hooliganism and the unruly behaviour of tourists are leading to law-and-order problems, particularly for tribal commuters who travel between Manali and Keylong on a daily basis.A group of unruly tourists, in an inebriated condition, created a chaotic situation inside the tunnel while the cops on duty were busy rescuing the tourists who were stranded beyond the north portal of the tunnel after vehicles got struck on snow-laden roads. ““Numerous incidents of tourists dancing with loud music inside the tunnel have been reported to the police, also they don’t keep a check on the speed limits,” said a police official.Five occupants in the vehicle from Haryana were drunk and consuming hookah and danced inside the tunnel with loud music. The occupants consumed hookah and had parked the vehicle in the middle of the road which led to a traffic jam. An average of about 1,700 vehicles enters the tunnel from the south portal and approximately 1,600 exits from the south portal on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-police-orders-after-video-of-cop-beating-man-in-atal-tunnel-goes-viral/story-MiR7ZrZZ4iCmnuiu9AxcXI.html

03-01-2021||Patna||‘Don’t need anybody’s offer’: JDU chief on rejoining Grand Alliance||Amid growing voices from the RJD to the JD(U) to rejoin the grand alliance (GA), Janata Dal (United) national president RCP Singh said his party was a strong entity in itself and does not need support from anybody, giving a rebuff to the opposition party. “The JD(U) exists on the strength of its leader and does not need any offer from anybody. We have not put any application seeking support from anybody,” he said, in an oblique attack on the RJD. Singh was speaking to reporters after attending an event to mark the birth anniversary of social reformer and educationist Savitribai Phule in Patna. Incidentally, the JD(U) president’s remarks, to underline that his party was not giving any weightage to the RJD’s feelers to cross over to the GA, comes a day after former deputy chief minister and BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad was calling up his party MLAs from paid ward at RIMS, Ranchi to engineer defections. The senior BJP leader’s attack on the RJD chief could be seen in the context of RJD leaders asking the JD(U) to cross over to the RJD-led GA and former minister Shyam Rajak’s recent claim that around 17 JD(U) MLAs were in touch with the RJD. Also read: Won’t go back till laws are repealed, say farmers before 7th round of talksThe RJD’s pitch to offer JD(U) to realign with the GA has gained momentum in last few weeks after there was a bit of strain between JD(U) and BJP following the Arunachal Pradesh episode where seven JD(U) MLAs switched to the saffron party.However, chief minister Nitish Kumar, in the last few days, has rubbished theories of any rift within the NDA and also asserted his party was intact. That apart, in his tweet, Modi also said the JD(U) and BJP, having a friendship for over two decades, had witnessed a bad patch because of elements jealous of the bonhomie between the two old allies but the phase passed off. Besides, he also said, the opposition is feeling restless when the people’s mandate has once again been given to the NDA. On its part, RJD state spokesperson Mritunjan Tiwary said today that senior BJP leader Modi was in the habit of making all sorts of allegations against RJD chief. “Modi’s allegations against RJD chief Lalu Prasad of trying to destabilise the government by promoting defections are all baseless. The NDA should first keep its own house in order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/don-t-need-anybody-s-offer-jdu-chief/story-kGUolFUaIwZXMi3wR573wK.html
03-01-2021||Dehradun||AAP’s debate challenge: Uttarakhand min says politics serious subject, not theatre that AAP wants open debate||Amid the ongoing debate challenge politics between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader and Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and Uttarakhand urban development minister Madan Kaushik, the latter has written a four-page open letter to Sisodia in which he has called him a “tourist politician to Uttarakhand”. Kaushik released the letter on social media on Sunday in which he also attacked the AAP government in Delhi by alleging it of “duping” people of Delhi in its seven-year rule”. Kaushik’s open letter has come in response to Sisodia’s letter dated December 31 wherein he had invited Kaushik for an open debate in Dehradun on January 4 on the development works done by the BJP government in its three and a half years of tenure. Kaushik in his letter stated, “Uttarakhand welcomes crores of tourists each year. It doesn’t have any problem in welcoming a tourist politician like you.”Replying on Sisodia’s debate challenge, he said, “As far as the debate challenge is concerned, any of our leader, minister or even a small party worker is ready for it anywhere. But Sisodia should understand that politics is a serious subject and not any theatre show that he wants with the open debate.”Also read: Farmers, govt hopeful of positive outcome day before 7th round of talksAttacking the AAP, he termed it as a party with a “migratory” mindset. “Everyone in the country knows about it. Sometimes their leadership tries to leave Delhi and head to Uttar Pradesh and then it tries for chief ministership of Punjab. Now they have turned towards Uttarakhand. However, people of our state are very aware and believe only on development-based politics and not AAP’s hope-selling politics due to which people of Delhi are suffering,” said Kaushik.Citing Sisodia’s challenge to list five development works in health, education, power, water, employment and others, Kaushik alleged that “AAP’s Delhi government has failed on all these fronts but it is asking Uttarakhand’s BJP government which has done several hundred works on these fronts.”“In education, the AAP government promised to open 400 libraries in Delhi but not even 1/4th have been set up. Also, it has falsely praised itself by supplying water for only two hours a day in many areas. Their Mohalla Clinics have also been locked, on which they thump their chests. There is also a constant dropout of children from government schools in Delhi. On the other hand, if Sisodia checks the works done by us, he will know the reality,” said Kaushik. He also took a jibe on Sisodia’s letter which stated the year 2020 instead of 2021 as the debate date. “It just shows how much he is serious with facts and figures. He should first do proper homework and check the facts before coming for a debate.”On Kaushik’s letter, AAP Uttarakhand president SS Kaler said, “If Kaushik doesn’t come forward for the debate on Monday, it will show that there are no development works to show. We will then go among people to expose this government. This will enable people to look for themselves at development claims while voting in the next assembly elections in the state in 2022,” said Kaler.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/tourist-politician-uttarakhand-minister-madan-kaushik-s-dig-at-manish-sisodia/story-skrbg3oD2jKr9R2gEdtcUM.html

Now it does not seem feasible with 50 per cent occupancy and with no eatables allowed inside the theatre. Fourteen theatres within Pune district, as well as 520 theatres in Maharashtra, are suffering with no business at all. If we were to open now, it will be double the cost for us, besides maintenance, which is not a good idea.”The notification also states that no eatables will be allowed inside the cinema halls/ theatres/ multiplexes/ drama theatres.Deepak Kudale, ex-president of the association, said, “There are limited films that are being screened and none that could get us a good audience. Besides, even with 50 per cent occupancy, we are getting low audience numbers as they are cautious and prefer to wait for the vaccine.”Multiplex Owners Association’s Arvind Chaphalkar, said, “We opened screens, but there are only few films running and even with 50 per cent occupancy, we get only 10 to 15 per cent audience. We are thinking of shutting down the multiplexes again if things don’t turn around. We have been hearing about 100 good films in the pipeline for release, but I guess distributors are also waiting for 100 per cent occupancy to release them.” Chaphalkar owns the Citypride multiplex in Kothrud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-rules-put-single-screens-in-permanent-closure-territory-cinema-owners/story-qsfp4RRUG2UmQHS1bFLYLO.html

03-01-2021||Chandigarh||To revive Kangra art, serve it on a plate||Kangra or Pahari art is thought to have originated in the 18th century in Guler, a hill state in the Himalayas, after a family of Kashmiris trained in the Mughal art style settled there. Soon, as they mixed with other local artists, a new art form emerged. Portraits of royals of the Mughal court or love scenes were replaced by paintings of Radha and Krishna, immortalising their divine love.Today, the fading Kangra art form is being revived through Project Srijan, an initiative by the local administration, which was launched in the Rait block of Kangra district in October this year, to provide ideation and marketing support to artists of Kangra style.Those specialising in the Guler and Basohli styles of painting and are known for their traditional black pottery, have been roped in to revive the era of Ras Nayikas and Krishna Ras.“From the detailed vegetations depicted in Kangra style to the beautiful yellow backgrounds of the Basohli style, we have continually been working with artisans to develop new products with Kangra style paintings,” says Latika Sehajpal, block development officer, Rait.The exorbitant costs of the paintings led to a disconnect between art and the masses. “Digital paintings have also taken over the market of hand-painted art forms,” adds Sehajpal.Kangra administration takes initiative to create affordable objet d’art with prints of the art form at affordable costs. “We have developed the paintings on glass plates, wooden stands, slates, and small glass framed paintings in an affordable range of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3000 and do not compromise on the beauty and detailing of the paintings,”she says.More innovations are being worked out. Earthen clay plates are being created in collaboration with experts in black pottery from Dharamkot village near Dharamshala.These plates are then painted in Basohli and Guler styles.Black pottery is an ancient technique of pottery and is done in only a few pockets of India, including Nizamabad (Uttar Pradesh) and Longpi (Manipur).“More products are being developed to revive painting styles and are being procured by government offices as ideal gifting options. A new marketplace in Dharamshala is also being finalised for providing brick and mortar outlets to these products,” says Sehajpal.The project now covers bamboo and cloth painting artisans to develop products such as bamboo fruit trays, outdoor decor and wall with traditional bamboo products.“In 2021, all these products will be sold online through Instagram,” said Sehajpal.The products are on display at an exhibition in Shimla.For financial assistance to artisans under this project, Sehajpal says two schemes, the Mukhya Mantri Gram Kaushal Yojana (MMGKY) and National Rural Livelihood Mission, have been dovetailed.Under MMGKY, a batch of five students learning each art form – Basholi, Guler and black pottery – has been started this year.

He added that the state government is awaiting the report so that they can decide if water can be drawn from the reservoir for irrigation and drinking purposes for Pune.The state government is planning to allot Mulshi dam water, currently being used by a private company for power generation, for drinking and irrigation purposes. A committee was constituted by the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government to explore the same. On Friday, Pawar during his programme in Pune, asked the committee to submit its report and also asked the private company to go slow on power generation since there is adequate supply of electricity in the state. Pawar said, “During the previous government, the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had appointed a committee to study the Mulshi dam contract with the private company. Right now, the dam’s water is used for hydro electricity generation. I am following up with the committee and have instructed them to submit the report as early as possible, so that the state government can take a decision on it.” Pawar was speaking during the inauguration of the Bhama Askhed project, which will meet the water requirements of 10 lakh people living in the eastern parts of Pune.“India currently has surplus energy. The water is needed more for drinking and irrigation purposes. There is always a conflict in Pune district over the issue of water. Despite having Mulshi dam in the district, water is not being used for drinking. We think water from Mulshi dam should get to the Pune city and district,” said Pawar.Pune district has not been drawing water from the Mulshi dam. The Mulshi dam water is controlled by a private company, which utilises the water for hydroelectricity generation. The hydropower project located in Mulshi was established in 1927. Pawar said, “I met the officers from the irrigation department and instructed them to submit the report early.” Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis who was also present during Friday’s function, said, “We need to treat water as a precious commodity. Pune’s population is increasing and various industries are located in and around Pune city. We need to properly plan the usage of water.” The officer who is heading this committee was not available for comment despite repeated attempts. Meanwhile, BJP’s state unit president Chandrakant Patil has also appealed to Pawar to sort out Pune city’s water problem permanently given that civic limits will have 23 more villages soon and city’s population will increase by 5 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/deputy-cm-ajit-pawar-asks-committee-to-submit-report-on-mulshi-dam/story-mZ6nuFY9Ed9kLCnOTAuHuO.html

03-01-2021||Pune||Key to conducting exams during a pandemic is micro-planning: Shakuntala Kale||Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has declared the dates of Class 10 and 12 examinations. Manasi Deshpande spoke to former chairperson of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE board) Shakuntala Kale, who retired from the post on December 31, about the planning and execution of the SSC and HSC examinations in Maharashtra and her experience in fulfilling the responsibilities during the pandemic.MSBSHSE board has just completed the re-examinations of SSC and HSC. What are the board’s plans for the regular SSC and HSC examinations to be conducted this year?It will depend on the situation as we move ahead this year. If the current condition (related to Covid-19 cases) continues then it will be possible to conduct exams in April-May. The board and its staff now have the experience of conducting exams during a pandemic, as we have successfully completed the re-examinations. We had set protocols for these exams - only 12 students in a block instead of 25 to ensure physical distancing, students were only allowed to take a pen and writing pad inside the examination hall, a mask was compulsory, thermal scanning was done at the entrance and all the examination centres were sanitized before the examinations. The board had provided financial aid to schools for this process. The key is micro-planning. Has the board decided the format of the question papers?If this situation persists then examination could be conducted in the routine format.What difficulties did you face in preparing and declaring the results of examinations conducted in 2020? How was it overcome?HSC examination was over before the lockdown and a SSC question paper was cancelled. But the challenge was to evaluate and then consolidate lakhs of answer sheets as there was transportation problem during the lockdown. We worked really hard to make this happen. When our evaluators, moderators could not reach us, the board reached out to them. Since you took charge of this responsibility, what was the most challenging task you had to face?As the head of this office, there are several responsibilities. Every year more than 17 lakh students appear for the SSC examination and more than 12 lakh students appear for HSC examination. It is a challenging task to conduct these examinations on schedule and declare the results on time. But in the last 55 years since the establishment of the board this year’s situation was unique. We never had to face such a challenge before. However, with the support of my team and everyone’s cooperation, we overcame the hurdles that came in our way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/key-to-conducting-exams-during-a-pandemic-is-micro-planning-shakuntala-kale/story-0u7GzHv1GWMJad4eosxwPI.html
03-01-2021||Pune||Pune civic body introduces “plug and key” garbage processing units||Currently when locals are protesting against setting up a garbage processing plants in their area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has come up with a solution of “plug and key” units to save time and money.The new units installed on vehicles with different types of mesh attached with a conveyor belt will segregate dry garbage. Post segregation of garbage, the residue will be sent to scientific landfilling in Uruli Devachi garbage depot which is permissible as per National Green Tribunal (NGT) order.The civic administration claims that it is the first kind of mobile project in the city, which the PMC has brought in at Ramtekadi.Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “The project will save time, money and minimum manpower. There will be no civil work to set up the plant. It will start just to plug and key and the processing will be done on machines. We need only fuel to run the machine.”Madhav Jagtap, deputy municipal commissioner, solid waste management department, said, “The project will run on two mobile vans. It doesn’t require much land like other garbage processing plants.”“At present, we cannot dump garbage at Uruli garbage depot as per NGT order. So, we will segregate the garbage and use it for different purposes. The contractor will make refuse-derived fuel (RDF) from the residue of garbage,” he said.At present, the PMC is facing resistance from locals in three major garbage processing plants which are located at Sus, Ambegaon and Keshavnagar areas. Residents are opposing a plant due to bad odour and filth. Besides that, PMC doesn’t find open space to set up garbage processing plants within the city as well as out of the PMC limit. Even the government is not keen to give land to PMC. The government had allotted land to the corporation in Pimpri-Sandas area in Pune district. It is a forest department land. However, it has not been handed over to PMC for more than five years now.The PMC standing committee approved a project on December 29 expediting the process as there is 45,000 metric tons of garbage laying without processing at Hadapsar.Officials said, “The mobile processing plant - also referred to as “plug and key” as it can be moved anywhere and make applicable - requires a small piece of land. The unit will be running in Ramtekadi industrial area on PMC’s land. “Sanket Jadhav, junior engineer, solid waste management department, said, “The process is used in the mining industry to segregate material of different size. On the machine, there are different types of mesh attached with a conveyor belt which segregate dry garbage. It requires only 15,000 square feet of land to segregate garbage. After segregation of garbage, the residue will be sent to scientific landfilling in Uruli Devachi garbage depot which is permissible as per NGT order.”“At present, the contractor will use two machines for garbage processing. It is a pilot project which will run for two months and after that, a proper tender will be floated,” he added.Requirement for conventional processing plantThe civic body requires 2 to 2.5 acre of land to set up 200 metric ton conventional processing plant and it also needs a 1,000KVs electrical connection. PMC is awaiting permission from the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MSPCB) to run the project. The overall time is around eight months to start the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-civic-body-introduces-plug-and-key-garbage-processing-units/story-ohEOg1EPnrO6ye8gAP7PLP.html
03-01-2021||Pune||Only 28% Pune schools submit Covid precautionary report ahead of reopening||Till Saturday, only 28 per cent schools in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits have submitted comprehensive precautionary details ahead of school reopening from January 4. Moreover, only 32 per cent of parents have given consent letters to send their children to school from January 4.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) stands firm on their decision to reopen classes for students studying in 9 to 12 next week. Officials said that as schools reopen, more students will start attending. Suresh Jagtap, additional commissioner, PMC, said that of 529 schools in the PMC limits, private as well as PMC run, about 150 school managements have submitted their preparatory measures so far. “Some of them are still submitting their reports. The details will be available by January 3. Moreover, only 32 per cent parents with the PMC have given consent to send their children to school from January 4,” said Jagtap.He added that so far we have received 2,835 consent from parents whose children study in Class 9 12 in PMC-run schools. There are a total of 8,759 students in these classes, said Jagtap.He further added that over 80 per cent teachers from PMC-run schools have been tested for Covid-19 so far. “Teachers from one of the schools tested positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection, but they have been asked not to come to the school. The schools have also been sanitised,” said Jagtap.“We had meetings with the headmaster and teachers’ association who have also supported us. Though there are some parents who are scared because of which the consent letters are less. But we are hopeful that more parents will agree as schools restart,” said Jagtap.He further added that some parents have transferred their children to Pune rural schools as they have started offline classes.Shivaji Daundkar, education officer with the PMC, said that around 80 per cent teachers have been tested for Covid and all tested negative.It is mandatory for teachers to undergo Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT PCR) test before the reopening of schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/only-28-pune-schools-submit-covid-precautionary-report-ahead-of-reopening/story-Q6WAJxjy6Gizg7Ub5ev6sL.html
03-01-2021||Pune||No technical glitches, fully prepared for vaccination, says Pune admin after dry run||The administration successfully completed its first dry run for Covid-19 vaccination wherein the software and the technical part involved in the vaccination process was put to test. The officials involved said that there were no technical glitches observed during the dry run.The dry run was conducted in three sites at district hospital Aundh, primary health care centre, Maan and at the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-run Jijamata hospital.After the dry run conducted the administration has now said that now they are fully prepared to administer vaccines for health care workers under the first phase.Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, district civil surgeon, Aundh district hospital, said, “The dry run was to assess the preparedness of the administration in terms of the technical preparation. It is similar to the election process and includes the observation room. We have to verify the beneficiary’s Aadhar number and check if the name is enrolled on the app, then administer the vaccine and also update the daily doses used.”A few doctors, however, said that the vaccination process might get delayed as it takes more time to verify the details and update the COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application.Co-WIN is an upgraded version of the Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), an indigenously developed platform in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.One of the health officers from PMC said that the technical part in the vaccination drive is time-consuming and unnecessary. The office requesting anonymity said, “It is futile to update the data of each beneficiary and also vaccinating those as per scheduled appointment instead of a first come first serve basis. If someone misses their appointment then they have to reschedule their appointment which is a tedious process. Also, all the details have to be updated regularly on the app after every vaccination which will be technically difficult in case of thousands of beneficiaries.”The state government in its letters to all district administrations wrote that the dry run was conducted to ensure physical verification of all proposed sites for the adequacy of space, logistical arrangements, internet connectivity, electricity, safety among others. Each session site must have separate entry and exit in a ‘three-room set-up’ (waiting room, vaccination room & observation room) with adequate space outside for awareness generation activities.A total of 1.10 lakh health care workers in the district are eligible for vaccination in the first phase out of which 89,000 have registered on the Co-WIN application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-technical-glitches-fully-prepared-for-vaccination-says-pune-admin-after-dry-run/story-01TMTGvRwnPA0YwHvcGUUP.html
03-01-2021||Pune||Yourspace: Fitness, family top new year’s resolution list||I have been thinking for the entire 2020 that I will get in shape by losing weight and it was my top resolution for that year. But I could not do anything during the 12 months. This year, I am planning to “exercise more” and “stay fit and healthy”. It’s easy to say that it is enough to start an exercise and follow a strict diet programme, but the real challenge is to start implementing it in real life and give steady results which will be easy to stick to in the long run. Also this year, I will extend the previous resolution by switching to a healthier diet and avoid junk food. I think that a strong determination and some basic tips from experts will help me slowly develop healthier eating habits and fit body for 2020 and beyond. It is indeed a major embarrassment when people pay attention towards one’s bulging tummy. It will be hard to follow, but I am going to act on my resolution without fail.Shweta GhuleTo devote more time to self-careMy resolution for 2021 is to do physical exercises and wake up before everyone else in the house in the morning. It is a tough task. I can never achieve and I am not physically fit. I am not strong enough to be a gym person or an early morning walker who goes for long strolls. All I know and am confident is that I will definitely try to become a better personality by personal grooming and maintain my body for 2021. I believe that individuals must resolve to love their self and accept themselves as they are and work passionately towards their goals of self-improvement. One should always be positive and put the best foot forward for self-improvement. One must take charge of emotions and see people you love getting emotionally attached to you. I resolve to devote at least two hours for myself in the mornings and evenings. I had decided to take it up last year, but again the plans were put on hold. I regret to have lost last one year in rumination.Radhika MhaskeTo stop wasting and become more productiveI believe that resolutions are often made to do away with bad and useless activities which occupy our lives during the entire year. The useless activities that consume time by way of unproductive behaviour and yield nothing are to be erased and replaced with new activities that never go in waste and bring productive changes in the personality of a person. It’s very hard to avoid unwanted activities that kill our time and take a major chunk of lifetime. As a student, time is the most precious thing which I want to use for my growth and development. If I waste time then my life will be wasted. My resolutions are to get up earlier in the morning, getting organised, learning something new each passing day, exercise regularly, be more assertive, eat healthy food, enjoy every moment of life, proactively help others specially the poor and needy people, stop wasting time and doing hard work for achieving success. In order to attain my resolutions and goals which are the same as last year, I will bring many changes in my daily life. The same opportunity I missed a year ago due to laziness. One of the biggest cause of killing time is excessive use of social media, specially Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, email and YouTube. This year, I will limit the time I spend on social media and ensure that my new year resolutions see the light of the day.Michael DorairajTo be a better family memberI will respect elders and avoid pressure of college friends to indulge in negative activities like smoking and drinking. I would also try to have healthy food and stick to a fitness regime. I would choose to watch good films online and devote time for studies for my university exams. This year, I will attend motivational talks and avoid negative persons. I will seek parents’ guidance when I face any difficulty. I would try to control my anger and engage in constructive work. Many students don’t do house works and I am one of them. I will not become a messy housemate and commit myself to help parents. I will wash dishes after meals and clean kitchen. A clean house makes us at ease, and help to prioritise work and deadlines. This is the best way to help our family members happy.Shantanu BhilareTo spend more time with near and dear onesIn 2020, I want to get involved with volunteering, a chance I missed. I will help my local community and make a difference to the people around me. I may not get paid, but dedicating time and skills to different projects will help me to gather skills one would do in a paid job, and more. Volunteering is an experience which changes your personality and makes you a better person. I would like to slow down my life, because it has become too busy, leaving me with no time for reflection, introspection and communication with my family and friends. Sometimes it seems like my nearest and dearest people receive too little attention and care from me, so this gap will be filled and I will spend more time with my parents and near and dear ones. I would like to state that I will not keep waiting for New Year resolution and will realise my plan in the present .It is not necessary to wait for the new year in order to change your life, because some alterations can and must be done immediately to change your dull and monotonous life.Neha SinghChange does not follow a deadlineMy new year resolution is to not have a New Year resolution at all. If there is anything my past failed resolutions have taught me, it’s this: Change doesn’t follow a deadline. It’s a mindful and gradual process that one needs to invest in over time. So, if someone really wishes to make a change in their life, they need not wait for the New Year. It can happen anytime. Change comes from within so listen to your heart, put your mind to it and make a gradual shift towards your goal.Aditi Roy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-fitness-family-top-new-year-s-resolution-list/story-kImPTMHEKdVxFlFZTEpdlL.html
03-01-2021||Bhopal||Shivraj Singh Chouhan inducts 2 new ministers in MP Cabinet||In the first expansion post state Assembly by-polls, held in November last year, two new ministers were inducted in Shivraj Singh Chouhan Cabinet on Sunday. Tulsiram Silavat (66) and Govind Singh Rajput (67) were re-inducted days after they had to resign from the Cabinet in October last year since they had completed six months in their respective offices without becoming members of the state Assembly. Silavat and Rajput, both loyalists of senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, won the by-polls on BJP tickets with impressive margins. While Silavat’s victory margin was more than 50,000 votes from Sanver Assembly constituency in Indore district, Rajput won Surkhi seat in Sagar district with a margin of more than 40,000 votes. Governor Anandiben Patel administered the oath of office and secrecy to the two ministers at Raj Bhavan premises on Sunday afternoon in the presence of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. With the induction of two ministers, Chouhan cabinet now has 31 ministers, including Chouhan and there are still four ministerial berths vacant. The 31 ministers include 24 cabinet ministers and 7 ministers of state. Congress was prompt to attack the chief minister after the cabinet expansion. State Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “The cabinet expansion has proved once again that Shivraj Singh Chouhan is not a strong (majboot) but a hapless (majboor) chief minister, who inducted those imported in the BJP but left out more than 12 committed BJP leaders, who deserve to be in the Cabinet. He seems to be under tremendous pressure that despite having four vacant ministerial berths, he had to ignore the claim of several senior BJP leaders.” Also Read: MP farmer and his son found dead in suspicious circumstancesState BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai responded by saying that the Congress should first look inwards. “It would have been better if the Congress leaders would have spoken about the composition of the then Kamal Nath cabinet. Nath had neglected and insulted several MLAs who deserved to be in his cabinet. Insult to senior party leaders was one of the major reasons behind the resignation by 22 Congress MLAs, including six ministers from the state assembly and later their joining the BJP in March. The exodus didn’t stop there. Three more Congress MLAs resigned in July and joined the BJP. The fact is that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan gave respect to the deserving MLAs by inducting them in his cabinet,” Bajpai said. The Chouhan government strengthened its majority in the 230-member state assembly by winning 19 of the 28 seats in the by-polls in November last year.The BJP has 126 members in the assembly.Earlier, Chouhan had expanded his cabinet on July 2, 2020 with 28 new ministers including 20 cabinet ministers and eight ministers of state. Twelve of the 28 ministers were ex-MLAs, who later contested the by-polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/shivraj-singh-chouhan-inducts-2-new-ministers-in-mp-cabinet/story-WNgBtrq6bQjmAdRy0c3u1L.html

03-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi BJP launches drive against AAP over corporation funds||The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday held a “public awareness” campaign to inform people that the Delhi government owes the three municipal corporations ruled by the party Rs 13,000 crore and demanded immediate release of this fund.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, along with MPs and other senior leaders, held a protest at the booth level, and distributed pamphlets informing people about how the corporations are unable to pay salaries and pension to its employees. Gupta said, “We want to tell people of Delhi that the government is not releasing the pending dues worth Rs13,000 crore to the corporations.” After the mayors and BJP councillors called off their protest outside Delhi chief minister Arvind kejriwal’s residence in December, the BJP has said that they will continue the protest in a different form.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that this protest was part of the BJP’s continuous campaign to demand its dues from the government. “The corporations have been facing huge financial problems and the government has turned a blind eye to their demands. On Sunday, our leaders and party workers protested at the booth level and will be going from door-to-door to distribute pamphlets to inform people how the government owes the corporations Rs 13,000 crore.”Khurana said that the party aims to connect with five million people during its campaign.Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has denied the allegations. The party has in the last few weeks accused the BJP of a 2500 crore scam in the civic bodies. In a statement, the AAP said, “Due to the rampant corruption of the BJP ruled corporations in the last 15 years, today they have no other way of spreading a lie regarding the AAP government. The claim that the AAP govt owes an imaginary Rs 13,000 to the corporations is a mere drama by the BJP. Citizens of Delhi gave BJP the responsibility of the MCD so they were supposed to take care of the sanitation of Delhi; they did not perform their duties but made MCD a den of corruption. AAP has run the Delhi government in profit and if the citizens of Delhi give us the responsibility, we will do the same in the municipal corporations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-launches-drive-against-aap-over-corporation-funds/story-27ioDbjgr7dVMPO7X7InVJ.html

The bird flu (Avian Influenza) caused by the virus H5N1 is contagious and fatal. In March 2020, the death of dozens of crows due to Bird Flu was reported from various parts of Bihar, which sparked fear among the residents amid the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

The guidelines are followed and dead animals are buried.” He said that over 75 samples have been sent from various places for testing. Chief wildlife warden, ML Meena, said the department has sounded an alert and field staff is asked to be more vigilant.

03-01-2021||Delhi||Rains, waterlogging cause inconvenience to farmers protesting at Delhi borders||Waterlogged tents, soaked firewood and blankets, and cold conditions -- farmers camping at Delhi borders in protest against new farm laws had a difficult morning on Sunday due to overnight rains. The continuous downpour led to waterlogging at agitation venues and waterproof tents did not help much, according to the protesters. Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, who is a member of Sankyukt Kisan Morcha, said farmers have waterproof tents but they cannot protect them from biting cold and waterlogging. “The situation is very bad at protest sites due to rain which has caused waterlogging. There is so much cold after the rains, but the government is not able to see our misery,” he said. Gurwinder Singh, who is camping at Singhu Border, said there is waterlogging at some places as civic facilities are not up to the mark but asserted that the weather will not dampen the spirit of farmers who have been protesting for over a month. “Despite facing several problems, we will not move from here until our demands are met,” he said. According to a MeT Department official, heavy rainfall was reported in areas across Delhi and minimum temperatures have increased due to clouding and easterly winds. “Safdarjung observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 9.9 degrees Celsius, an increase of 6.7 degrees with 25 mm rain. Palam observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius with 18 mm rain. Rain with hail storm is expected until January 6,” the official said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for more than a month, demanding repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other two issues. Bharatiya Kisan Union Ugrahan leader Sukhdev Singh, whose Union is leading the protest at Tikri border, said arrangements made by farmers to brave the cold weather are not helping much because of rains and subsequent waterlogging. Veerpal Singh, a protesting farmer, said their blankets, clothes and wood are soaked.“Our clothes are soaked due to waterlogging caused by rains. Besides, we are facing difficulties to cook food as rain water has also soaked firewood. We do have an LPG cylinder but not everyone here has it,” he said. Dharmveer Yadav, who is camping at Ghazipur border protest site, said farmers will not move an inch from their agitation venues.“We are ready to face any problem, be it heavy or storm, but we will not leave this place in any condition until our demands are met,” Yadav said. Rainwater also entered camps at Burari ground and the protesters were seen draining the water out and rearranging their belongings to prevent from soaking in water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rains-waterlogging-cause-inconvenience-to-farmers-protesting-at-delhi-borders/story-mgYy5hEVNy6pll8gwlWAaK.html

Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora, who visited the spots said, “The primary aim to conduct the dry run was to exercise end-to-end testing of Covid-19 vaccination rollout so as to identify the challenges, which will further help in formulating detailed plans for actual implementation of the rollout and also to provide confidence to programme managers at various levels.”“The dry run will also help monitor and review the preparedness at the district and block levels and gather empirical data,” he added.Panchkula chief medical officer Dr Jasjeet Kaur said: “At every centre, a team of five members will do data entry, take old history of the person, will download the app, administer vaccine and keep the patient under observation for 30 minutes.”She said that the systems were in place and most likely, they will receive the vaccine by month-end.Another dry run has been planned across Haryana on January 7. As per guidelines issued by the Government of India, the Covid-19 vaccine introduction will span over a year with multiple groups being included sequentially, starting with health-care workers (HCWs), followed by frontline workers like municipal and sanitary workers, state and central police force, civil defence and armed forces. Next will follow the population above 50 years of age and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities.Dr Jasjeet said that there were nearly 6,000 HCWs and frontline workers in Panchkula who will be vaccinated first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-vaccine-dry-run-conducted-in-panchkula/story-kNbgzWcP6DlMO6pXVKCegN.html

A sensitive, responsive govt would never let this happen!” Gehlot had tweeted.The Rajasthan government will also launch a week-long campaign ‘Kisan Bachao-Desh Bachao’ on Tuesday under which ministers, party workers and public representatives will visit villages in the state demanding the rollback of the three laws.The farmers and the Centre will sit for the seventh round of discussions on January 4. Leaders of the farm unions have warned to intensify the agitation at Delhi’s borders if the demands are not met.The farm leaders have said that protests will begin from January 6 for two weeks if the laws are not repealed by the government. “This is our ultimatum. If all issues are not resolved and our demands not met by Republic Day, then we will start entering Delhi. The government is saying that 50% of the demands have been met. But the government has shown no signs of meeting our biggest demands,” farmers’ rights activist and Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/gehlot-pilot-to-lead-protests-against-farm-laws-in-jaipur/story-sLaNdiN6mnpGWVBBoTaRuI.html

Heavy police force was deployed to control the protesters, but farmers removed the barricades with the help of tractors and reached near the residence of Dhanda.They have been demanding the resignation of Dhanda to support their ongoing agitation against the three agriculture laws. Earlier, the protesters had reached the residence of Kaithal MLA Leela Ram Gurjar and demanded an apology from him for his alleged statement likening the protesting farmers to terrorists. “We have come to the residence of MLA Gurjar to ask him to find out the terrorists amongst us,” the farmers associated with BKU (Charuni) said. They also threatened to boycott them if they failed to support their agitation.“We had voted for them so that they could raise our voice, but they failed. Now, we demand the minister and the MLA to resign from the BJP to join our protest and we will ensure their win again,” the protesters said.Kaithal superintendent of police Lokender Singh said the situation was under control as the protests ended peacefully. He said that no FIR has been registered against any farmer. This is the second such protest in Kaithal in the past one week. The Kaithal police had booked around 100 unidentified farmers for threatening Kamlesh Dhanda and JJP MLA Ishwar Singh and blocking their way on December 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-anganwadi-workers-protest-outside-bjp-leaders-houses-in-kaithal/story-OwG65FBrK5BPrxYnjssPaN.html
03-01-2021||Mumbai||30 million people to be vaccinated by August in Maharashtra||Maharashtra is all set to roll out its Covid-19 vaccination drive, said state authorities, after a dry run was held in 12 facilities across four districts on Saturday. The state government has trained 18,000 vaccinators, set up 4,200 centres, 3,145 cold chain systems and will vaccinate more than 30 million people in three phases till August this year. Meanwhile, the state has not found any person arriving from abroad infected by the new strain of coronavirus found in the United Kingdom (UK). State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state machinery was all set. “The dry run was conducted successfully. The [dry] run helped the people involved to understand the set- up required for vaccination. Each vaccination facility will have an observation room and an information cell to ensure proper awareness and will take care of any complications during the drive,” he said.According to state government estimates, 30 million people will be covered in the vaccination drive’s first three phases meant for priority groups —health workers; frontline workers; people above 50 years of age and those with comorbidities below the age of 50. Of them, 800,000 are health workers from the private and public sector and 758,000 of them have been registered so far. The registration of the people in other categories is being done by their respective departments at the district and corporation level. Once the vaccination drive is given a go-ahead by the Centre, the vaccination of these categories will be done and is expected to take six to seven months. “The vaccination centres at primary health centres at the taluka level and hospitals at district level will have batches of 100 people each. Multiple batches could be vaccinated daily at these centres. There are no guidelines issued by the centre so far for the vaccination of other categories of the population,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission. According to an official, the vaccination of the remaining categories of the population is expected to be undertaken after these three phases. “However, we expect the Centre to allow the vaccine to be sold in the market for vaccination through private health care machinery,” said another official from the health department.Maharashtra, meanwhile, reported 3,218 new infections, taking the tally to 1,938,854 and toll to 49,631 after 51 new deaths on Saturday. The state has been clocking fewer than 4,000 cases for the past 17 days despite the projection of authorities of a spike in cases in the last week of December and first week of January. With the addition of 593 new cases and seven deaths, Mumbai’s tally touched 294,660 and toll was pushed to 11,132. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.56%, while the recovery rate stood at 94.64% as 1,834,935 patients have reported to have been recovered so far. State has 53,137 active patients in various Covid-19 facilities. Pune, the second-most affected city in the state, saw no deaths for a second consecutive day on Saturday. The cases in Pune city dropped to 250.Meanwhile, the state has so far not found anyone with the new variant of the virus found in the UK among the international passengers who had tested positive during a special drive. Till Saturday, 68 passengers who arrived in Maharashtra from UK between November 25 and December 22 tested positive during the state’s special drive taken to trace them. 62 samples had been sent to NIV, Pune for genomic sequencing. 29 of them are from Mumbai, 13 from Pune, 7 from Thane, 9 from Nagpur, 2 each from Nashik, Aurangabad, Raigd and Buldhana and one each from Nanded and Washim.For the vaccination drive, the government has set up 27 storage facilities at the block level, 34 at district level, one each at division level and a central facility at the state level. “It is like any other vaccine like BCG, pulse polio for us. Once the go-ahead is given by the Centre, the vaccine will be distributed through these storage facilities to the vaccination facilities at primary health centres and district hospitals, medical colleges for actual vaccination,” Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-million-people-to-be-vaccinated-by-august-in-maharashtra/story-s60ErmI1oHqIJjnW6az8fO.html
03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Summon me for law and order, not my officers: CM to Badnore||Taking exception to Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore summoning the state’s chief secretary and the director general of police (DGP), chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday said he (the governor) should have sought a report on law and order directly from him, as he also holds the charge of home department. On Wednesday, Badnore had summoned the two officers to the Raj Bhavan seeking a report on the law and order situation after at least 1,500 mobile towers were vandalised across the state. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan had met the governor on Friday, with DGP Dinkar Gupta meeting him on Thursday. Joining issue with the constitutional head of the state, the CM said he (Badnore) was responding to the malicious and politically motivated propaganda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The BJP’s falsehoods on law and order collapse are a tactic to divert attention from the issue of farm laws and the farmers’ agitation,” he claimed. He added that the BJP was indulging in a vicious game-plan to undermine the peaceful agitation of the farmers by terming a few minor incidents of damage to mobile towers as a law and order problem. “These damaged towers can be, and are being repaired, but what about the lives of the farmers lost in the bitter cold at the Delhi borders, where they continue to fight for their rights, amid total apathy from the BJP-led government at the Centre?” the CM questioned, expressing shock that not a single BJP leader had expressed concern over deaths of protesting farmers, some of whom had committed suicide. Amarinder also slammed the state BJP leadership for adding fuel to the fire, with their irresponsible statements, in an already surcharged atmosphere that the draconian farm laws had triggered. Instead of slandering farmers with terms like ‘Naxalites’ and ‘Khalistanis’, the BJP should press its central leadership in the Union government to heed the voice of farmers and revoke laws threatening their livelihood, he added. Terming it as ‘unfortunate’ that the governor had bowed to these antics of the BJP, the CM observed that it had taken just a day for the former to react to the party leadership’s complaint of purported law and order collapse in Punjab. “This is in sharp contrast to the prolonged delay in sending to the President the State Amendment Bills, passed by all political parties (barring the BJP) in the Vidhan Sabha, for assent,” he pointed out.Responding to Amarinder’s statement, Punjab BJP general secretary Subhash Sharma said, “The CM should not behave like a Maharaja. He should respect the constitutional head of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/summon-me-for-law-and-order-not-my-officers-cm-to-badnore/story-4CQYRt2nL0aj7RzTLMjm1N.html
03-01-2021||City||Irregularities detected in appointments made under NHM in Panipat||Contractual appointments under National Health Mission (NHM) in Panipat have come under scanner following the detection of “irregularities” in the hiring made in 2019.The matter came to light when an applicant raised the issue with the authorities concerned and an internal investigation by the city magistrate followed. Now, the state director of NHM has written for the cancellation of dubious recruitments.It is worth mentioning here that the recruitment for 64 posts of GNM (general nurse and midwives), ANM (auxiliary nurse midwives), and PPM coordinator were conducted by the local health authorities on contractual basis in 2019. However, few days later, an aspirant Ranbir Singh, who had applied for the post of PPM coordinator, filed a complaint on the CM window on January 24 last year, alleging irregularities and favouritism in the recruitment.Reacting to the complaint, the department concerned ordered an inquiry under Panipat city magistrate and in the investigation report, it was highlighted that improper procedure was adopted by the selection committee. Director, NHM, Haryana, has written to the Panipat chief medical officer, seeking cancellation of doubtful recruitments and details of the members of selection committee and selected candidates, who have been given the benefits under local area weightage.As per the letter, complainant Ranbir Singh alleged that there were irregularities in the marks fixed for the local candidates as the local area weightage. According to him 20, 15 and 10 marks were fixed for the candidates as per their location, but the selection committee gave 20 marks to all candidates, which he said was a clear violation of the guidelines laid by the government.Also, it was found in the investigation that documents of one of the selected candidates were also questionable as he had furnished residential proofs of both Panipat and Karnal districts.Complainant Ranbir Singh also said that the letter written by the director, NHM, Haryana, was enough to prove the irregularities and demanded that an FIR be registered against the members of the selection board, besides cancellation of the entire recruitment.Director, NHM, Haryana, has sought a list of those candidates, who were given 20 marks for local area weightage and cancel their recruitment with immediate effect and submit the report to his office.The director has also written to the director, general health, for disciplinary action against members of the selection board of Panipat district. Panipat chief medical officer Sant Lal Verma confirmed that he has received a letter from the office of director, NHM, Haryana. He said the matter will be investigated as the recruitment took place even before his appointment in Panipat. “I will look into the matter and will submit a report to the director,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/irregularities-detected-in-appointments-made-under-nhm-in-panipat/story-oBOLgLXqv4e7Eje47vkQJI.html
03-01-2021||City||AAP’s Haryana chief likely to join as physical training instructor||The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP’s) Haryana chief, Naveen Jaihind, who had withdrawn himself from active politics in February last year after his wife Swati Maliwal, Delhi Commission For Women’s chief, announced their divorce, is now mulling joining the Haryana government as a physical training instructor. The Haryana Staff Selection Commission had published the result for the 1,983 posts of physical training instructor in October 2020, and Jaihind had made the cut.Jaihind, who has yet to join service, said he had appeared for the written test at a Kurukshetra centre in August.“I had applied for the post many years ago before joining politics. I appeared in the exam just to check my knowledge and was confident enough to crack it. I was a critic of the BJP government, but this recruitment drive was conducted in a free and fair manner. I am still pondering whether to join this job or not. I have no interest in returning to politics now,” he added.He said he has four months’ time to make a decision in this regard. On being asked about the reports of him calling Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar after the exam’s result, Jaihind said he doesn’t know who is spreading such rumours.“I am devoting my time on meditation and workout. I am away from social media and neither reading newspapers nor watching TV,” he added.A holder of master’s degree in physical education from Maharshi Dayanand University, Jaihind was planning to join as director of physical education, but couldn’t during the Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government.Jaihind, who enjoyed close proximity with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, was made the AAP’s Haryana unit convener in 2016 after the suspension of Yogendra Yadav over his anti-party activities. The party had declared him the chief ministerial candidate for the 2019 assembly elections in Haryana, but he chose not to contest. The 39-year-old leader contested the parliamentary elections from Faridabad and forfeited his security deposit as he polled only 11,112 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-s-haryana-chief-likely-to-join-as-physical-training-instructor/story-EZ9eXT0lnmrfwEisLSuaWO.html
03-01-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay researchers’ artificial intelligence model to identify malaria parasites||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), in collaboration with three hospitals in the country, have used proteomics technologies and made artificial intelligence based-models that can help in differentiating the two major species of malaria parasite — P falciparum and P vivax— for better malaria diagnosis.The artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of the two species of malaria parasite based on the changing trend of proteins in human blood. Funded by the department of biotechnology, Government of India, their study and findings were published in the journal Communications Biology – Nature, in November last year.As part of their project, the researchers collected blood samples from patients with severe and mild cases of falciparum malaria, vivax malaria, and dengue, as well as from a healthy group of people. These samples were collected from Medical College Hospital, Kolkata, a P falciparum endemic region; Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, a P vivax endemic region, and Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Mumbai, a P vivax endemic region.Read more: Covid-19 measures lead to dip in seasonal ailments in MumbaiThey comprehensively analysed all the proteins from the blood plasma and quantified and identified the human proteins. Having identified these proteins, the researchers compared their amount in mild and severe cases of falciparum malaria, vivax malaria, and dengue.“Malaria cases in India are contributed majorly by the malaria-vulnerable population, which includes workers at construction sites in malaria-endemic regions – regions without a proper drainage system, leaving standing water for days to facilitate mosquito breeding – and people without awareness of the harmful effects of the standing water in their localities during the malaria season. The major issues at the time of disease are quick diagnostic aids which can tell about the causative agent of the disease,” said Shalini Aggarwal, research fellow, department of biosciences and bioengineering, IIT-B, who was part of the study.The standard method for diagnosing malaria is using a microscope to examine blood samples of suspected patients to spot the parasites. However, it may not help in the prognosis of the infection. Other ways of diagnosis include rapid diagnostics test (RDT) and nucleic acid amplification (NAA).“In the case of malaria, P falciparum, P vivax and other species are not differentiable by using RDTs and ideally need an expert eye along with intensive work of looking at 100 fields of blood smear using microscopy, the gold standard for malaria diagnosis,” Aggarwal added. “In malaria season, the number of cases is high, resulting in an increased burden on clinicians for manual diagnosis. Hence, if the diagnosis along with timely progression prediction from non-severe malaria to severe condition before the development of clinical manifestations is made for clinicians, then the treatment can be specific and efficient,” she added. Currently, the researchers, under the guidance of Sanjeeva Srivastava, professor, department of biosciences and bioengineering, IIT-B, are working on a diagnostic kit prototype. “The kit can be used to compile these panels of proteins for diagnostics and prognostic purposes. Once this prototype is ready we will compare the kit with the currently used RDT kits. As our study involves a panel of proteins, it will help in the reduction of false-positive and false-negative results,” added Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-researchers-artificial-intelligence-model-to-identify-malaria-parasites/story-0I8qWAiyMkrx3QMAKrIDEI.html

This will be made possible as work on the fifth and sixth railway line corridors between Thane and Diva railway stations is expected to be completed this year. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) has completed the work of laying 17 of the 20-km-long tracks for the additional railway lines between Thane and Diva railway stations.After the completion of the railway lines along with the segregation of outstation trains at Kalyan yard, 100 new local train services are likely to be introduced between CSMT and Kalyan station. The girder-placing for a flyover at Mumbra, required for the construction of the railway lines, has been undertaken by MRVC and will be launched by the second week of this month. The work for the flyover is expected to be completed by February.“The work on the railway lines between Thane and Diva stations is nearing completion and we’re aiming to complete it by June. Work on 31 minor and three major bridges, platforms and foot overbridges are also being completed,” said a senior MRVC official. After the completion of laying of the tracks and construction of the bridges, MRVC and CR will undertake blocks to connect the railway lines with Thane and Diva suburban railways stations.“A detailed planning will be done to undertake power blocks and termination of train services, which will be required to connect the fifth and sixth railway lines,” said a senior CR official.

03-01-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan water pipeline fault hits supply for 45L people||Around 45 lakh residents of several areas in Bhiwandi, Thane, Mira-Bhayandar and 34 villages in Bhiwandi taluka, faced irregular water supply on Saturday as the main pipeline of the Shahad-Temghar Water Supply Authority (STEM) located at Shahad, Kalyan got damaged in the morning. The pipeline repairs were completed by 7pm on Saturday and the supply was expected to resume late at night.The 305MLD of water supply from STEM to these places remained shut for the day.STEM officials said that the pipeline burst occurred due to the regular power failure in the premises since Friday.“The pipeline is 30 years old and it could not take the load when there was constant power failure that led to the burst. We supply water to cities like Thane, Bhiwandi, Mira-Bhayandar and also 34 gram panchayats that have around 45 lakh residents. The entire supply of 305MLD of water was stopped due to the incident,” said Sanket Gharat, general manager, civil works, STEM.“The repair work was completed by Saturday evening and accordingly the local civic bodies were informed to resume the supply late in the night,” added Gharat.An MSEDCL officer, not wanting to be named, said, “There was a power failure to the STEM due to a broken conductor on Friday night. The line was restored later on after repair work.” A total of six engineers from STEM and 20 labourers arrived at the spot for the repair works on Saturday morning.As per the officials, this particular 1,850mm diameter pipeline is located near the Ulhas river that is adding hurdles to repair the pipeline.The STEM supplies 122MLD of water to the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) and 75MLD of water to the Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) and 11MLD to the 34 villages.The STEM officials claimed that replacing the 30-year-old pipeline was already under way in phases. “We have already completed the work of replacing the 2km pipeline. The development plan for the remaining 10km is also ready. It will be taken up soon,” said Gharat.Following the incident, the TMC managed the water supply in the city with 210MLD of water by zoning.Vinod Pawar, deputy city engineer, TMC, said, “Due to the incident, 122MLD of water was less in our system on Saturday. We had to manage with 210MLD water through zoning by equally distributing it to all areas. The entire city received a reduced water supply for six hours.”In Bhiwandi also, the supply was affected in various parts of the city with no water supply on Saturday morning.The areas affected were Kamatghar, Dhamankar Naka-Patel compound, parts of Shanti Nagar, Narpoli, Raojinagar, Ashok Nagar, Chavan Colony, Navi Vasti, Bala Compound and nearby areas.LP Gaikwad, water department officer of BNCMC, said, “The water supply to these areas was completely shut for the day due to the disruption.

In case of emergencies our two water tankers were ready to supply water.”A resident of Bhiwandi Kharbav, one of the 34 villages, advocate Bhavesh Pawar, 28 said, “This was not the first time the water pipeline of STEM damaged and caused water shortage. Every day, we get less water and on Saturday there was no supply. How are we supposed to store water for daily use?”Another resident from Kamatghar, Bhiwandi, Jayesh Lokhande ,37, said, “We came to know in the afternoon about the pipe burst and that there won’t be any supply. We had to depend on the small stock of stored water and buy drinking water from outside as there was no fresh water supply.”PIPELINE BURST IN KALYAN A valve of a pipeline at Birla College Road in Kalyan (W) damaged after a vehicle hit it on Saturday morning.

He has been allegedly staying illegally in India for around a year after his visa expired. According to police, he was residing at Turbhe in Navi Mumbai.Gahie is allegedly a major supplier of cocaine in Mumbai’s western suburbs. “We are checking his call data records to trace other persons from whom he took the supply of cocaine. It appears that he is directly in touch with some customers, but we are also checking if any drug peddlers were in touch with him,” said Datta Nalawade, deputy commissioner of police, ANC.ANC units across the city were instructed to keep vigil in their respective jurisdictions on New Year’s Eve. Accordingly, officers of the Bandra ANC unit were on patrol when they noticed Gahie sitting in his car, parked near Diamond AWWA Hostel in Santacruz (East).The police team conducted a search of the accused after he hesitated to answer their questions. “We found cocaine in his possession,” said police inspector Anil Wadhwane of the Bandra ANC unit.The seized cocaine is of pure quality, and Gahie revealed that he was supplying drugs for almost six months. Police are now inquiring about his other source of income and what he was doing in the city earlier.A case has been registered against the arrested accused under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and he was produced before a court and remanded to police custody till January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/foreign-national-arrested-by-mumbai-police-with-cocaine-worth-50-lakh/story-ix39P0bRNSW6g3TISzd2cP.html
03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Migratory birds continue to die, officials shut HP’s Pong wetland||With the inexplicable death of migratory water fowls continuing to rise in Pong Dam Lake, authorities have closed the wetland to both locals and tourists. Over 1,000 birds of different species have mysteriously died since the first deaths were reported on December 28. Preliminary postmortem reports have ruled out poisoning. Forest minister Rakesh Pathania had ordered a probe into the matter soon after the dead birds were found. Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati, who issued an order to cease all activities, said, “Samples have been sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly and Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, to ascertain the cause of the birds’ death. The possibility of a disease cannot be ruled out.”In case the birds are found to be suffering from a contagious disease, preventive measures will be taken in and around 10km of the reservoir, as per protocol, he said, adding that since the disease may also be dangerous to animals and humans, no people or livestock will be allowed in and around 1km of the wetland till further orders.Around 9km area around the lake has been designated an ‘alert zone’, which will be strictly monitored. Chief conservator of forest (wildlife), north, Upasna Patyal said, “The field staff reported the sudden death of four bar-headed geese and one common teal in Fatehpur area of Pong on December 28. Next day when the staff surveyed the wetland area more than 400 birds were found dead. The number has now crossed 1,000. Members of other species such as the shoveler, river tern and black-headed gull were also found dead.” Patyal said, “The birds were seen acting strangely before their deaths. They were not able to take the flight, despite having healthy wings. They tried to flap but died a little while later.” She said over 20 samples had been sent for testing to different labs, including the Wildlife Institute, Dehradun. The reports will take a few days to arrive.The Pong Dam Wetland—an International Ramsar Site— hosts more than 1 lakh migratory birds of over 100 species, that fly thousands of kilometers from the trans-Himalayan Region and Central Asia in winter every year.The Pong Dam Lake, constructed on the Beas river in 1960, was declared a bird sanctuary in 1983 and given the status of the wetland of national importance in 1994. In 2002, it got the status of a Ramsar site.Last year, 1.15 lakh birds of 114 species were spotted on the wetland. The bar-headed geese are most plentiful in Pong. Other prominent avian visitors include the northern pintail, the Eurasian coot, the common teal, the common pochard, the northern shoveler, the great cormorant, the Eurasian wigeon and the ruddy shelduck.The fortnightly census conducted on December 15, recorded around 57,000 migratory birds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/migratory-birds-continue-to-die-officials-shut-hp-s-pong-wetland/story-UGOFoemLxmdZr8S0vvqmdO.html

03-01-2021||Mumbai||Medical college admissions: Almost 90% vacant seats after common rounds are in institutional quota, reveals data||The seat vacancy list across medical and dental institutes in the state was released on Friday, revealing that almost 90% of the seats left after the common admission rounds are under the 15% institutional quota. These seats are not up for grabs in the stray vacancy round scheduled to take place in the coming week.“Since the admissions deadline has been extended by two weeks to January 15, this stray vacancy round is being conducted to re-allot the vacant seats to interested candidates. However, unlike the first three common admission rounds, the stray vacancy round will be conducted physically at the institute level and not online,” stated a notification released by the Medical Council Committee (MCC) on Friday.MCC conducts counselling for 15% all-India quota (AIQ) seats, all deemed institute seats as well as admissions to central universities. The stray vacancy round is conducted at the institute level, for which the list of eligible candidates is forwarded by MCC to the respective institute. “In the stray vacancy round, a list of eligible candidates for both all-India and state institutes will be uploaded on the MCC and state CET (common entrance test) websites soon. Interested students will then have to apply to respective colleges/universities of their choice,” states the notification.Every year, maximum seats that go vacant across medical and dental institutes remain in the 15% institutional/management quota. Experts believe that this trend continues year after year, especially because of the high fees charged for seats under the institutional quota.“As per the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA), private college managements are allowed to charge up to five times the fees of a regular seat, for seats under the institutional or NRI (non-resident Indian) quota. This is the main reason why such seats have no takers and end up being returned to the respective colleges after common admission rounds,” said an official from the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-college-admissions-almost-90-vacant-seats-after-common-rounds-are-in-institutional-quota-reveals-data/story-SHkMX41UN6xXQaN3kDoaQO.html

03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: The song of the road to Delhi plays on||Sung loud and clear in this winter season in Punjab are songs of protest, resistance and also celebration. The singing star of the farmers’ protest is 1984-born Kanwar Grewal, born in a Bathinda village and Punjabi University (Patiala), alumnus, who gained recognition as a Sufi singer. His songs have set the beat for the agitation with lyrics sung with conviction from the stage on Delhi’s Singhu border. His two songs which have taken the shape of anthems of the protest are: Faslan da faisla kissan karange (The decision on the harvest will be done by the farmers) and Pecha pai gaya Centre naal (The fight is with the centre). The latter takes its lyrics from the imagery of kite-flying and calls out to the farmers to fill trolleys and move on for the Centre has to be confronted.The support of the people coming to the protesting farmers on the roads leading to Delhi from the Punjab and Haryana borders is growing phenomenally every passing day with more people joining in with enthusiasm and bravado. Perhaps such enthusiasm has not been seen since the times of the struggle for freedom which brought Independence to the country in 1947 but not without Partition and unprecedented migration in world history for the regions of Punjab and Bengal.It is interesting to note how the substance of the songs has changed with the wave of dissent that has swept through the bread basket of the country. Punjabi songs had fallen into stereotypes over the past decades glorifying violence, alcohol, and gender bias in which the Punjabi woman was reduced to nothing but a sex symbol. This wave of dissent seems to have shaken the people from shedding decadence and moving to struggle. Significantly, the struggle is not just of the dominant macho landed class of the Jats, but it is being supported by the Dalits and several sections of the Punjabi Hindus too. The protest which is taking the shape of a movement has with it the Left-wing groups which were largely at odds with the militancy movement with Khalistan as its goal. Gender roles too have changed as one finds women at the helm of affairs playing leadership roles. The intellectual elite cutting across regions too are with the new wave and so also people from the fields of arts and literature.Coming togetherWriter-journalist and Dalit activist Des Raj Kali, who often rides out on his motorcycle to the protest sites, says that this struggle of the farmers has filled many of the fissures that existed in Punjabi society. “In Punjab today, the farm labour, Dalits, intellectuals and women have come forward to join the peaceful protest started by the farmers,” he adds To a great extent the Dalits have supported the struggle disenchanted by the dishonour shown to the Constitution of India, framed by none other than Dr BR Ambedkar, the saviour of the downtrodden victims of caste prejudice. “At one of the rallies, I saw something that came as a surprise. A Jat was sitting there with a book by Ambedkar on his lap.”New concernsThe other very noticeable earnest role is that of the youth in the protest. The slogans say it all. One finds banners and posters stating clearly: “We are farmers not terrorists”. Poet Sushil Dusanjh, an active executive member and former general secretary of the Kendri Punjabi Lekhak Sabha (the central literary cadre of the Communist Party of India with branches all through Punjab), says:”The young are making a clean break with the violent communal past for it brought no good to Punjab. This is a wave that is carrying with it our progressive poets, artists and performers. It is indeed a protest with poetry and not guns.”Amen! Sushil is penning poetry that describes the lot of the farmers and their struggle using idioms from Punjabi folk songs: Jat khet vich kharha puchhe rab nu, Dahne mere kaun lai gaya, Jinde meriye! (Standing in the fields the farmer asks, Who has robbed me of my grain, O’ my love!).The other slogan that the protest has brought us which goes straight to the heart is the condemnation of drugs contrary to the stereotyping of Punjabi youths as cocaine addicts in a Bollywood film Udta Punjab. The poster cries out: “Udhta Punjab Nahi, Padhta Punjab,” indicating that ours is not a stoned Punjab but a literate Punjab. All protest sites have libraries aplenty and the young are actually reading books as they camp there, artists are doing on-the-spot paintings and tractor trolleys have been put together to create a makeshift cinema hall to screen inspirational films in Trolley Talkies.Women have been hailing the protest and visiting the borders piled in jeeps and cars. Heartening to know that some even deserted friends and families in groups to be with the protestors on New Year Eve and raise the toast of hot ginger tea in cold and foggy weather. Among them was Chandigarh’s much-admired activist-psychiatrist Simmi Waraich, who drove her women friends all the way to Singhu on Thursday.What will be the course of this protest well begun? City’s author-activist Ranjit Powar, another one doing rounds of protest sites with women friends, says: “Whatever be the outcome of the farmers’ agitation, it will leave a lasting impact on the minds of the people, even those who have just brushed past it is an episode of solidarity, self-discipline, women power, youth energy and sincerity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-the-song-of-the-road-to-delhi-plays-on/story-ah5N1sZKdJJA9aFfPoEgNO.html
03-01-2021||Mumbai||2 held for murder of Mumbai woman at New Year’s Eve party||Khar police arrested two people for the murder of 19-year-old Janhavi Kukreja on Saturday. The autopsy indicates Kukreja, who had attended a New Year’s Eve party with the accused, was beaten to death.Shree Jodhankar, 24, and Diya Padankar, 19, were arrested and charged under section 302 for murder and 323 for assault, on Saturday. “We have arrested the two based on circumstantial evidence and statements of witnesses who attended the party,” said Gahanna Kaberle, senior inspector, Khar police station. Kaberle said the organiser of the party will also be booked. According to the autopsy report, the victim was brutally beaten approximately around 2.30am and the body showed injury marks on her hip and thighs. “These injuries indicate that Kukreja was badly beaten with an intention of killing her,” said an officer from Khar police station. The autopsy lists skull fracture as the cause of death. On Thursday, Kukreja, Jodhankar and Padankar were among 10 people who attended a New Year’s Eve terrace party at Bhagwati Heights in Khar. During the party, Kukreja, Jodhankar and Padankar got into a fight and the police suspect the fight may have been caused by Kukreja accusing Jodhankar of cheating on her with Padankar. An officer familiar with the investigation said the fight turned violent with Jodhankar and Padankar hitting Kukreja. Khar police investigating the case said that at 2.30am, Janhvi left the rooftop after a heated argument with her alleged boyfriend and the girl he was making out with. However, after allegedly killing her, Jodhankar and Padankar returned to the party, which led the others attending the party to think that Janhvi had gone home.It was not until 6am that the murder was discovered. Officers at the crime scene said that a woman from the building was walking her dog when she saw blood dripping from the staircase. “By this time, the party was still going on and the murder went unnoticed as people used the lift and not the stairs to go up and down the building,” said the officer.When police reached the rooftop, they found alcohol bottles and people in the party inebriated. The organiser of the party then revealed that Jodhankar and Padankar fought with Kukreja. Police are also probing whether drugs were being consumed at the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-held-for-murder-of-mumbai-woman-at-new-year-s-eve-party/story-wMTgObvk62Lo5mj9Vs5bqJ.html
03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati: Vax, lax & detox of Resolutions 2021||Gosh! It’s that time of year again! When Twitterverse is bombarded with New Year resolutions that have an expiry date shorter than some Bollywood careers.Ask Asin or Mallika Sherawat.Like the pixel-ated profusion that greets Tweeple, in the shape of Selfie-ism or Status Update-ism on New Year, there’s this other overdrive narrative – New Year pledges riding ‘high resolution’ or ‘low resolution’.Since #NYWishlists have been done to ‘death’ (as much by the Pandemic as by Willpower breathing its last), it’s best to skip injecting another overdose. Better to leave all injecting to that 2021 Showstopper –The Vaccine.Twitterverse is already overburdened with curious 2021 Wishlists, from a netizen who “will try to understand why I need Nine different email addresses” to another who “will try to work with neglected children – my own” to another digital native who’s pledged to “become even more toxic.”Here are our own wacky wishlists that we would love to see.To Be or Not to Be ‘High Res’Just like there’s a calendar for physically challenged people churned out by a Coimbatore NGO, New Year pledges, too, boast of their tribe of Tweeple – Resolution-ally Challenged.Tweeple who are less challenged qualify as the “High Res” species of the Big Fat Resolution Maker. Even if only for the sake of some rhyming, they may manifest a poetic resemblance to the Idli Maker.They are high on fluff of fulfilling New Year pledges. And like that Idli Maker wherein idlis don’t lose steam to fall flat, this tribe suffers less from withdrawal symptoms – withdrawing from executing Wishlists.

03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Random Forays: New dreams, new hopes, new energy!||The advent of a new year inevitably heralds a sense of rejuvenated enthusiasm in us all, even perhaps in the most diehard of all pessimists. There is something undeniably uplifting about the newness of a nascent year despite its wintry January mornings and chilly, misty evenings. A sense of warmth and bonhomie prevails, even if in these days such warmth is available only on Instagram, WhatsApp, Linkedin and Facebook.Meeting each other for a hot cuppa was, sadly, already an outdated trend before the pandemic. Nowadays it is an even rarer moon when friends are able to get together and celebrate the meaning of togetherness in its true sense. However, time is marching on with all of its unpredictability on display, and we just might go back to rubbing shoulders with our peers and exchanging warm hugs with our dearest friends sooner than later. Who knows?The dawn of 2021 surely means a lot of things for humanity. Firstly, we’ve just emerged from a punishing year, perhaps indicative of a rap on the knuckles from the Almighty, for our largely unseemly behaviour during the past two decades. Secondly, technology and artificial intelligence have connected us closer together as a global family than ever before. The year2021 may well mark the beginning of invaluable partnerships across domains and geographies facilitated adeptly by such high-end connectivity. Thirdly, most people in their middle years have begun to realise that life is not meant to be a slam bang affair. Calmness, meditation, love, family bonding, emotional intelligence, faith and resilience might just turn out to be the key words that the modern human being needs to bank upon in the years to come. And fourthly, people have hopefully understood that leaders of nations and organisations had better show some mettle as well as some sensitivity if they are to continue in the saddle. Learning and moving on is what life is about. There is no place for stagnant minds, no room for lethargic ways. Change is the only constant and our existence is linked to our adaptability as well as our collective conduct as a global population. The nightingale sings mellifluously and with fervour even though it is unsure of the future, basking only in the happiness of the moment. Human beings think too much. We conjure up all sorts of crazy scenarios in the mind which may never come true but which scare the wits out of us, since we keep dwelling on them continually. Worry is a brake, said the saint. Birds and animals live for the day, yet they know how to nurture their young and keep their flock together. Overthinking would do them no good, and it does us no good either!A new year gives us the opportunity to refresh and renew. To reignite and reimagine. It is as if a new innings has begun and however badly we fared in the previous one, we can take fresh guard and buckle down to play the foremost knock of our lives. Indeed, the problems of each year make themselves evident with the passing weeks. And our rejuvenated consciousness begins to feel the burden of uncertainties and setbacks. We start awaiting the next year already, without understanding that the present moment actually presents us with the best chance to make a mark by dint of sheer will power and unflagging doggedness.The elderly tend to look back with missed feelings at the years gone by. Their grandchildren, those bundles of unalloyed joy, bring out their giggles, but many a tear erupts in the old eye at the thought of what life could have been.On the other hand, the young of 2021 are aspirational but under severe pressure from their families to perform or perish. They need to take heart from the roller coaster lives of those who have succeeded before them. A smooth life is not a successful life, said the saint, after all. Only after many setbacks and failures, comes true success.‘Tis the time to renew our dreams, then. The time to look ahead with hope, and move ahead with fortitude and momentum. A time to draw upon the universe’s boundless energy and to shine brighter than ever before.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-new-dreams-new-hopes-new-energy/story-koAMz6Ny9Y57VsGtwSvGkJ.html
03-01-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: The wandering hulk||A printer by profession, Chandigarh-based birder and conservationist Vikas Salil Sharma is an irrepressible wanderer. It was only befitting that chance bestowed upon Sharma’s lens an opportunity to record a rare, wandering eagle from the Eurasian temperate at Lunj near Pong wetland. The White-tailed eagle (WTE) is a distinctive species with a chequered history of persecution and patronage at the hands of humans. For example, in England, the WTE was exterminated to extinction by the early 20th century but has staged a comeback there, like the Gharial in Punjab, via the benevolence of modern reintroduction programmes.A hulk of a bird with a wingspan that can stretch to 2.5 metres and the female’s weight going up to seven kg, the WTE is regarded as the fourth largest eagle in the world. In terms of longevity, the species is notable with one individual surviving 32 years! The large head and a brute of a bill – like a butcher’s menacing, dangling hook – complete the image of a majestic and powerful bird which was regarded as worthy enough for depiction on the coat of arms of European nobilities.Interestingly, Sharma was photographing a group of White-rumped vultures and Himalayan vultures when his sharp eye chanced upon this vulturish-looking eagle perched nearby on a cliff. Migratory eagles such as the Steppe and the WTE often feed on carrion when wintering in the subcontinent. The clever eagles keep a careful watch on vultures and crows to detect the presence of carrion, which amounts to easy food. However, the WTE also hunts live prey by skimming over water and grabbing fish or hunting waterfowl or even robbing prey killed by lesser raptors! Hence, it is found near water such as coasts, lakes and rivers. In Europe, even large Mute swans fall prey to this apex predator. WTEs are devoted couples, pairing for life though on the death of a spouse a replacement is found. “WTEs have a characteristic aerial courtship display which culminates in the pair locking claws mid-air, whirling earthwards in a series of spectacular cartwheels, and separating sometimes only a few feet above the ground or water and soaring upwards again,” states the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in its species profile.Gossip on Wall StreetCreatures of the city gardens endear themselves to observant householders. A spur of the moment photograph taken with a handy smartphone or camera leaves a lasting and fond memory. What would seem mundane to outsiders is a marvel for a householder with an indulgent eye and mind. Squirrels sun-basking on a brick wall at his Kaimbwala farmhouse spurred the imagination of Brig Balwinder Singh Sandhu (retd). The fauji, who headed Project HIMANK in Ladakh building roads and vital infrastructure at Daulat Beg Oldie and Batalik before retirement, is a passionate photographer. “The squirrels seemed relaxed and were indulging in chatter, like mohalla ladies basking in the sun and exchanging notes during a brief breather from household chores. I compared the time squirrels seemed to have for intimate moments and neighbourly bonhomie to the rat race that enslaves humans,” quipped the sprightly Brig Sandhu.*In Chandigarh’s genteel Sector 8, an Asian koel has shed her modesty. Otherwise prone to buzzing off in a flurry of feathers and odd squawks when approached by a human, this specimen has taken a great fancy to sour-sweet Calamondin oranges (narangis) in Mahendar Kaur’s bungalow. An exotic plant that ornaments gardens, the petite oranges are apportioned by ladies for winter marmalade and by discerning gents for home-brewed liqueurs. The lady of the house indulges this robber in splendid black robes and flashing ruby eyes. “The koel is unafraid of us and a regular visitor to our plant. She relishes the oranges,” Kaur told this writer. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-the-wandering-hulk/story-wu8KT8yRBaDSkW2cXprQDK.html
03-01-2021||City||Sanjay Raut’s wife to be quizzed: Shiv Sena to put up show of strength outside ED’s Mumbai office||A fresh round of the slugfest between the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which began after the Enforcement Directorate issued a notice to Sena lawmaker Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha early this week, is expected to reach a new level as some Sena leaders are planning a show of strength outside the central agency’s Ballad Pier office next week. The show of strength is being organised on the lines of the one put up by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) during its chief Sharad Pawar’s scheduled appearance before ED officials in September 2019. Shiv Sena has reportedly asked its local leaders from Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nashik, Pune and Thane to assemble party workers and stage a protest outside the ED office on Tuesday. A section of workers and leaders in Sena believe that Raut was being targeted as he was instrumental in snapping ties with BJP and forming the Sena-led government in the state. “There would be no official announcement on this to avoid any legal glitch. [But] the protest is planned to be portrayed as a spontaneous reaction of the workers. Sena works from the adjoining areas have been directed to gather outside ED office on Tuesday morning. It would be similar to the show of strength by NCP when Pawar was summoned,” said a leader close to Raut. However, another set of leaders in the party, were unaware of any such move, and also questioned if using party workers for “Raut’s personal case” was proper. The entire episode of ED’s notice to Varsha Raut has again raked up the face-off between allies-turned-rivals Sena and BJP, as the former alleged that the BJP-led Centre is using central agencies to settle political score. Varsha Raut is expected to visit the ED office on January 5 – the rescheduled date of appearance on her request. The agency summoned her to inquire over the allegations of her links with the transfer of Rs50 lakh from the accounts of Pravin Raut, an accused arrested in connection with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case, which is also being probed by ED. Pravin Raut was one of the directors in Guruashish Constructions, which is a subsidiary of Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL). He has been arrested along with the directors of HDIL for illegally availing loans from the bank. Sanjay Raut said BJP wants to pull down the state government and thus by issuing the notice to his wife, it was trying to put pressure on the Sena, which is the ruling party in the state. “We have been getting messages from BJP leaders here [in the state] that they have prepared a list of 22 leaders from the three ruling parties to book them in various financial cases. Our MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) Pratap Sarnaik [who, along with his relatives, has also been questioned by ED in another case] is one of them. A few state BJP leaders regularly visit the ED office and obtain important documents related to leaders from the ruling parties in Maharashtra. The BJP is playing a dirty game in political rivalry by involving wives and family members of the leaders who speak out against them,” Raut had claimed during a press conference on December 28. Party workers had indulged in sloganeering during the press conference at Sena Bhavan. A banner with the words ‘Maharashtra BJP regional office’ was also put up outside ED office on the same day. Meanwhile, hitting back at the Sena, BJP said the state’s ruling party was playing an emotional card and Raut should answer his and his family’s connections with Pravin Raut. “Instead of attacking us, Sanjay Raut should explain about his and his family’s relations with Pravin Raut and his family. The two families had formed a company called Siddhant Syscon Systems Pvt Limited Co and crores of rupees were transferred to Sanjay Raut’s account. They should first clear the air on these transactions,” said BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. Another BJP leader, Atul Bhatkhalkar, said, “Instead of indulging in the show of strength, Raut should tell ED and the people of Maharashtra the status of Rs50 lakh which was borrowed as loan from Pravin Raut. They should come clear on the questioned transactions and tell people if the loan was repaid,” he said. The Sena and the BJP have been at loggerheads on various issues over the past one year, after the Sena joined hands with NCP and Congress to form the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sanjay-raut-s-wife-to-be-quizzed-shiv-sena-to-put-up-show-of-strength-outside-ed-s-mumbai-office/story-48JCVUkyk7FfAc21SDbhYN.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||DDA puts 1,354 flats for sale in new scheme, Feb 16 last date to apply||The Delhi Development Authority on Saturday launched its housing scheme-2021 putting on sale 1,354 flats that are located mainly in Dwarka, Jasola and Vasant Kunj areas. This includes Rs 2.1-crore three-bedroom High Income Group (HIG) flats, the costliest to be put up for sale till date by the authority, located in south-east Delhi’s Jasola.There are 254 flats in the HIG category located in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini, Dwarka. Of these, 215 flats in Jasola have been put on sale for the first time, while the remaining are those that were returned by allottees in the previous housing schemes. The cost of HIG flats, which are 87.9 sqm to 177.3 sqm in size, varies between Rs69.62 lakh to Rs 2.14 crore. Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA officials are optimistic that the 254 HIG flats in Jasola will find takers. “These are spacious flats, located on the Delhi-Noida border and are well-connected to the rest of the city via Metro and other public transport system. There is a dual piping system as the complex has its own sewer treatment plant. The most important thing is that each flat has two parking slots. The Rs 2.1 crore cost is as per the market rate,” said a senior DDA official. Real estate experts say that the number of property transactions have increased in the past few months as property prices have plummeted due to economic slowdown triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mudassir Zaidi, executive director, Knight Frank, said, “In the past few months, the property transactions have increased despite a slump in the market. While the costs have gone down, there is interest in newer projects, especially in Delhi. As there are not many private housing projects in Delhi, there is a demand for DDA flats. As for the cost of HIG flats in Jasola, it is as per market prices.”Read more| North India, already shivering with freezing temperatures, sees rainfallApart from HIG flats, the DDA has put on sale 757 Middle Income Group (MIG) flats with two and three bedrooms in Dwarka, Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Janahgirpuri and Madipur. Spread over 64.04 sqm to 129.98 sqm, the cost of MIG flats varies between R40.64 lakh to R1.24 crore. Of the 757 flats, 711 are located in Dwarka sub-city—one of the planned residential areas developed by the DDA. There are 291 flats for the Economically Weaker Section and 52 in the Lower Income Group (LIG) category in Dwarka and Rohini.The last date to apply for the scheme is February 16 and senior DDA officials said that the draw of lots will be held in February end or first week of March.Unlike the last housing scheme in 2019, DDA officials said that the scheme will be launched online using the newly developed AWAAS software. The official added that all applications, payments and possession letters will be processed online. “People will have to come to the DDA office just once to execute the conveyance deed,” said the official.A senior DDA official said that people are advised to visit the site and inspect flats before applying for it. “We have provided the contact number of officials who will be present at the site to show the sample flats,” said the official. After three unsuccessful housing schemes, the land-owning agency is hoping for a good response to its new housing scheme as the flats on offer this time are spacious and located in areas which are well connected to the rest of the city.Last year, the DDA had put 18,000 flats on sale, but had to reduce the number of flats in the scheme to 10,294 later, as it didn’t get the desired response. The land-owning agency had received 45,012 applications for its flats, but it could sell only 8,438 flats — 488 HIG, 1,555 in MIG, 5,172 LIG and 1,223 EWS category flats — of which close to 6,000 flats were returned, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-puts-1-354-flats-for-sale-in-new-scheme-feb-16-last-date-to-apply/story-kik5Rxxc3ofN1OpFpi6uhN.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||Met predicts hailstorm in Delhi on Monday||A day after Delhi recorded its coldest day in 15 years, the Capital on Saturday woke up to light rains in several parts, with the minimum temperature rising to seven degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the representative recording for the city.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature on Saturday was 19.5°C. On Friday, the minimum temperature at the observatory had dipped to 1.1°C under the influence of icy north-westerly winds from snow-clad mountains in Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Before this, the minimum temperature fell to 0.2°C on January 8, 2006. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Delhi was on January 16, 1935, when it touched -0.6°C.Read more| Delhi minimum temperature back to normal range due to western disturbanceIMD recordings show that some parts of the city recorded trace to light rain in the early hours of Saturday. The Palam observatory recorded 0.4mm rainfall, while the one at Lodhi Road saw 1.2 mm rainfall. Trace rainfall was recorded at the Safdarjung, Aya Nagar and Ridge observatories. IMD scientists said that the rainfall and increased temperature were impacts of a western disturbance over Delhi and the National Capital Region. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said there is the possibility of more intense rain in Delhi and the National Capital Region over the next three days. There is also a forecast of hailstorm in Delhi on Monday. “The temperature will be around 7-8°C in the coming days because of the passing western disturbance. There is a forecast of some areas in NCR receiving hailstorm on Sunday, but this is expected to hit Delhi by Monday,” said Srivastava. Read more| North India, already shivering with freezing temperatures, sees rainfallAdditionally, the high moisture level in the air after trace rainfall, led to ‘severe’ air pollution in Delhi for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index of Delhi was 443, in the ‘severe’ range. On Friday the AQI stood at 441, also in the ‘severe’ zone. Scientists said the high pollution levels were despite high average wind speeds on Saturday. According to IMD, the average wind speed on Saturday was 15kmph, which is expected to go up to 25 kmph by Monday. The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said ventilation conditions in Delhi will improve on Sunday and are likely to significantly cut pollution, in spite of the temperature and relatively low boundary layer. “With each passing day from January 3 the AQI is forecasted to improve roughly by one category. The AQI will improve to the middle-end of the very poor category by January 3, poor category by January 4 and is likely to further improve to the border beginning end of poor or even to the moderate category by January 5,” Safar forecast said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/met-predicts-hailstorm-in-delhi-on-monday/story-y9mdfqCV6bSqounId4vZdO.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||AAP alleges corruption in renting trommel machines by MCDs, BJP says charges ‘politically biased’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday alleged that the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi engaged in corruption by bringing trommel machines (for clearing the city’s landfills) on rent at a much higher cost than the market rate. The BJP, however, denied the allegation and said the AAP “deliberately” excluded the operational costs of using the trommel machines “to suit its political ambitions” in the upcoming Delhi MCD polls, scheduled next year. Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said the BJP is spending Rs 180 crore instead of Rs.8.5 crore, on the machines used to clear the landfill site located in Bhalswa. “Today the audit report on the Bhalswa landfill has come and it is not a report made by the AAP. It was prepared by the BJP-ruled MCD’s auditor. In every page of this audit report, it has been noted how the BJP ruled MCD has done corruption in the name of cleaning of these landfills,” he said. Pathak said the BJP-ruled MCD has installed 50 machines at the city’s landfill sites to clean and segregate garbage. “All these machines have a contract of five years and for the machines, the MCDs pays around Rs 6 lakh per month. Which means for 50 machines, the rent for 5 years should be around Rs 180 crore. But the report of the auditor claims that the price of the machine in the market is just Rs16 lakh per machine. If instead of paying the rent of these machines, they directly buy them, then it will cost just Rs 8.5 crores. But, the BJP is spending Rs 180 crore instead of Rs.8.5 crores on these machines,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the contracts for the trommel machines are renewed annually and not every five years as stated by AAP leader Pathak.“Also, a trommel machine costs Rs 52 lakh, which can be verified in the market. The MCDs have hired them at Rs 6 lakh per month inclusive of full usage and maintenance expenses. Each machine runs 24 hours a day with a driver and an operator, who work in 3 shifts,” said Kapoor. “This apart, it has oil expenses and maintenance cost which are borne by the supplier company. The company has to provide operative trommels 365 days a year. The operation expenses of each machine runs up to over Rs 5 lakh a month. It will be better if the AAP leaders cross check their facts before making politically biased allegations against the MCDs,” the BJP spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-alleges-corruption-in-renting-trommel-machines-by-mcds-bjp-says-charges-politically-biased/story-ypQ90dBkNYQu3cq16nmIbM.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||70-year-old dies by suicide at UP Gate protest site||A 70-year-old farmer, who was part of the agitation against the farm bills at UP Gate in Ghaziabad, allegedly died by suicide in a portable toilet near the protest site on Saturday. The police said the body of the deceased man was sent to Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, from where he hailed. A post-mortem will be conducted there “Some people found the body in the mobile toilet around 9am on Saturday. Thereafter, the police reached the spot and took away the mobile toilet for forensic examinations… So far, we have not received any complaint,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). This is the second death at the UP Gate in two days. On Friday, a 57-year-old man from Baghpat had died at the spot due to health complications. The police said the 70-year-old left behind a two-page note, written in Punjabi, where he said he wanted his last rites to be performed at UP Gate. Farmer leaders, meanwhile, said the man was allegedly upset about the long movement and the government’s indecision over the demands. Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union claimed 47 people have died so far at various protests sites since the farmers began their agitation against three contentious farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year. “We appeal to the farmers not to act in such a manner as protests or movements are not won by ending lives. They are won by staying alive and leading a collective fight. His cremation will take place at his native village,” Tikait, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-year-old-dies-by-suicide-at-up-gate-protest-site/story-AYq0cCE0PYYLgvxp6pu0XM.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||Staff shortfall, improved internet connectivity among issues identified in vaccination dry run||Additional staff, better internet connectivity, and more time to manage any adverse events — these were some of the issues flagged by the three teams that conducted a dry run of the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Delhi on Saturday. Saturday’s mock drive covered all state capitals, and was meant to assess the governments’ ability and readiness to administer shots to hundreds of millions of people, including many in remote corners of the country.Three centres – a primary health centre in Daryaganj, Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in Dilshad Garden, and Venkateshwara hospital in Dwarka – conducted a mock vaccination drive with 25 identified health care workers as beneficiaries at each centre. At the three sites, the beneficiaries had a government-issued identity card verified, their registration on the government CoWIN portal checked, their medical history taken, after which they were kept under observation for 30 minutes. Additionally, the sites also prepared for an adverse event, and recorded the time it took for patients to get emergency care. Read more| Co-WIN app, test beneficiaries: India to hold dry run for Covid-19 vaccinationCoWIN refers to the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network, which will help both health authorities as well as the public play their respective roles in the immunisation drive.“At our centre, everything went on smoothly for all 25 volunteers. We even practiced taking the patient to the linked Sanjeevani hospital, which is three minutes away, for treatment of any adverse event. The patient was admitted in the emergency department within 15 minutes,” said Arava Gopi Krishna, deputy commissioner (Central). However, confusion over ID proof-checks prevailed at Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where the volunteer beneficiaries as well as the staff were from the hospital itself.“The name-tags of our vaccination officers were not prominently visible, leading to confusion about who was an officer at the site and who was a beneficiary. This has been addressed at our level. However, we have forwarded a suggestion to the state team that additional volunteers be posted at observation areas. People who are feeling fine might try to leave the area if the vaccine officer is engaged with something. We have decided to place a chair there itself with someone, noting the time the shot was given and monitoring the patient throughout the 30 minutes,” said Sanjeev Kumar, deputy commissioner (Shahdara). In addition, there were issues with network connectivity for the CoWIN site that IT teams have been informed about. Read more| Expert panel gives nod to Covaxin for restricted use“We have also suggested that some additional time be allotted for vaccination. Right now, the target is 100 people in seven hours. But if there is an adverse event, the vaccinator (the person administering the shot) will be needed to give immediate first aid and transfer the patient to the hospital. This will take around 30 minutes during which the rest of the activities will stop. So we might need some extra time,” said Kumar. Vaccinators are provided a kit with emergency medicines like epinephrine, atropine, antihistamines, and oxygen to give immediate support in case someone has a reaction to the vaccine. “We have been asked to monitor for rashes at the injection site, fever, breathlessness, seizure, and heart attacks,” said a nurse on duty at GTB hospital. At the Venkateshwara hospital site, the deputy commissioner (south-west) Naveen Aggarwal said there was a need for additional staff in the waiting area for all the paperwork to speed up the process.

In Telangana, the dry run was conducted in three government healthcare facilities and a private hospital in Hyderabad and a government hospital in Mahbubnagar in Telangana on Saturday.

03-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to vaccinate all residents free of cost, says health minister Satyendar Jain||The Delhi government on Saturday said that not only health care and front line workers — as announced by the Central government — but all residents of the city, who are eligible, will get the Covid-19 vaccines for free. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, who inspected the dry run of the vaccination process at a government primary health care centre in Daryaganj on Saturday, said the state administration aims to vaccinate around one lakh people every day once the drive begins. “The Delhi government already provides free medicines and treatment to residents of the city. The vaccine against Covid-19 will also be provided free of cost to the people of Delhi, once it arrives,” said Jain while talking to reporters.Jain’s announcement is slightly different from the one made by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who said the Covid shots will be free for the most prioritised beneficiaries —one crore health care and two crore front line workers. Officials in Delhi’s health department said the government is planning to give the vaccines for free also to senior citizens and those with co-morbidities during the first phase. Read more| Covid-19 vaccination dry run underway; health minister urges people not to pay heed to rumoursThe Delhi government so far has identified 51 lakh people who will be the first ones to get the Covid-19 vaccine shots, as part of the Central government’s “priority category”. Of the 51 lakh people, three lakh health care workers— such as doctors, nurses, paramedic staff and so on — will be the first ones to get the vaccine doses. This will be followed by 6 lakh frontline workers which include police, civil defence volunteers and municipal workers. Next, in line will be 42 lakh people who are either 50 years or above in age or are below 50 years age but have co-morbid conditions.Final lists of beneficiaries in all these categories is still being prepared by authorities, a senior government official said. The Delhi Police have already started sending test SMSes to its personnel, who fall in the second category of those who will be vaccinated, as part of the vaccination program.Jain said the Delhi government has completed all arrangements from storage to administering the vaccines.“We will set up 1,000 vaccination centres across Delhi. Largely, centres will be set up in three types of institutions - government hospitals, private hospitals and dispensaries. The purpose of conducting the dry run today at three different types of centres was to review the system set up in each of these categories. The system in Delhi is flawless,” he said.Read more| Co-WIN app, test beneficiaries: India to hold dry run for Covid-19 vaccinationExplaining about the vaccination process, the state health minister said monitoring stations will also be set up in all centres.“At a time, only 10 persons will be given entry into the centre so that all norms of social distancing are followed. When the vaccination is done, the person will be put under observation for 30 minutes. Every centre has been linked to a nearest hospital. In case any patient shows any kind of discomfort, an emergency room has been set up,” Jain said. Apart from 1,000 centres where people will get vaccinated, the government has also identified and readied 621 vaccine stores, most of which will also act as centres. The list of these vaccine stores, seen by HT, showed that almost all the major government dispensaries, primary healthcare centres, hospitals (both government and private), maternity and child welfare (MCW) centres and polyclinics will be storage and vaccination centres.Delhi Police, on its part, also said that they have chalked out an elaborate plan for smooth transportation of Covid-19 vaccines as they arrive in India. After a recent meeting with the commissioner of police, the operations branch of the Delhi police issued an order apprising its personnel about the arrangements that need to be put in place.Read more| Day 1 of nationwide dry run concludes as two Covid-19 vaccines await final nodThe order, seen by HT, said, “Proper security arrangements at the airport will have to be made. Police Control Room (PCR) vans will escort these vaccines to primary, then secondary and finally to territory stores. All possible assistance by traffic police should be provided. Local police should make round the clock security arrangements at the storage sites.”The document further read that adequate police arrangements by local police should also be made at session sites, where the vaccine will be given and that the Central Police Control Room should promptly respond to any call for help from any of the cold storage point or vaccination session site and pass on the information to the PCR vans as well as local police, traffic police and any other agency, as the case may be. The district deputy commissioners of police have also been told to maintain close coordination with district magistrates in this regard.“Since there will be limited availability of the vaccine in the initial phases, round-the-clock arrangement for the security of cold chain points at all locations will be made. While access to cold chain rooms will be restricted to authorised personnel only, the vehicles carrying the Covid-19 vaccine between districts and states will be sealed before leaving the cold chain point and will be opened only in front of the facility in-charge,” said a senior Delhi police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-vaccinate-all-residents-free-of-cost-says-health-minister/story-ejGpxZOxbCZIhr8EFkTJaM.html
03-01-2021||Delhi||Morning rains compound problems of protesting farmers at Delhi’s borders||After braving bone-chilling cold for days, farmers protesting at various borders near Delhi were greeted by a spell of light rain on Saturday.The spell of rainfall, though not heavy, was enough to cause chaos at the protest venues — turning the roads muddy, making them slippery and causing difficulties for protesting farmers to walk or ride their two-wheelers. The farmers’ agitation entered 38th day on Saturday.As the sun played hide-and-seek throughout the day, scores of volunteers and sanitation workers from Sonepat Municipal Corporation were seen removing the garbage and mud from the streets at the Singhu border.The mattresses on which farmers sit and hear speeches of their leaders near the main stage got wet because of the rain. It delayed the day’s scheduled programmes on the stage. The volunteers had to either remove the wet mattresses or covered them with tarpaulin sheets to make the seating arrangements. The rains mainly caused inconvenience to hundreds of volunteers involved in cooking, serving meals and providing other facilities to the protesting farmers at Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate and Chilla borders. Some of the tents, where meals are prepared and dry ration stored, started leaking and it delayed the cooking process, farmers at Singhu border said.“Cooking meals also became tough as the wooden logs were stored on the streets and many of them became wet. We somehow managed with the dry wooden logs and cooking gas cylinders. But the real problem started when we started serving the meals. The mats on which we fed the people were completely drenched. People had to eat while standing on the muddy roads,” said Sahab Singh from Punjab’s Mansa, who is working as a volunteer at a Langar Sewa at the Singhu border.As the mud on the roads became wet and slippery, farmers said that many of them slipped while walking or riding their motorcycles. Since the elderly farmers, women, and children were the most affected, some volunteers were seen helping them walk around the protest venue, even as some others were cleaning the roads using waters.“To maintain hygiene in the tents being used for cooking, we connected pipes with the water tankers and taps installed at the nearby buildings and used it to clean the muddy streets. The walking space has remained muddy because it is difficult to spray water while people walk,” said Satnam Singh, another volunteer from Amritsar in Punjab.A team of 30 sanitation workers from Sonepat Municipal Corporation were also deployed at the Singhu border for garbage collection and cleaning of roads. The workers said that lack of machines was making their task difficult.“We only have brooms and it is difficult to clean the streets that are filled with mud and water,” said Sonu Singh, a sanitation worker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/morning-rains-compound-problems-of-protesting-farmers-at-delhi-s-borders/story-Yq5a2LynapSh0W0WXVjgeJ.html
03-01-2021||Pune||Pune gets a new arts, culture and performance space||Whether it’s theatre, art, music or other performing arts, Pune is indisputably a hive of activity. With a view to provide a fluid culture space for artists, well-known television and theatre actor Sakhi Gokhale will don the curator’s hat for Aayaam, a concept alternative arts venue, located off Jungli Maharaj road. Aayaam is set to open doors to the city’s art and culture aficionados on January 5. The 1,600 sq ft space is the brainchild of city-based entrepreneurs Sayalee Marathe and Jaydeep Hingne, who are the founders of the jewellery and fashion brand “House of Aadyaa”.Aayaam is a Sanskrit word, which means dimension. Sakhi, creative director and chief curator of Aayaam, said, “The mission of Aayaam is to celebrate the artists of today and invest in those of tomorrow. We have kept the space fluid, so it can be home to exhibitions of homegrown artists, craftsmen from different regions across India, theatre circuits, trunk shows, and book readings, and so on. We also have a well-equipped set-up of projectors and sound systems to enable film screenings.” According to Sakhi, though Pune is replete with small art venues, there is a dearth of places with a “premium” element, located in the heart of the city. For her, a place like Aayaam was missing in the vast culture-scape of Pune. “This city needed a culture centre that was state-of-the-art, and yet accessible in terms of affordability and mobility. Aayaam fits this bill perfectly,” she said.Sakhi has completed her post-graduation studies in curation of contemporary art from London’s Royal College of Art. Ask her about how she plans to juggle between acting and art curation, she said, “I always wanted to study and pursue art curation. That was always my primary goal. However, I am equally passionate about acting. So, I will now devote equal amounts of time for both these careers. Definitely, I would now have to make some critical time management efforts.”Aayaam’s inaugural event would be a 26-day art exhibition (January 5-30) titled “Nayika”, which will showcase artworks, artisanal crafts and jewellery created by renowned artist Shubha Gokhale. “Through ‘Nayika’ we take a closer look at Gokhale’s perspective of women and their various environments. The show will feature some handpicked art from four of her prominent series, Dehaspanda, Padmini, Meera, and Matsyagandha,” said Sakhi. Looking ahead, a range of high-end retail exhibitions, intimate theatre performances, and film festivals are lined up at Aayaam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-gets-a-new-arts-culture-and-performance-space/story-Sh5wtpmyqbSjn7UBXU9rsM.html
03-01-2021||Gurugram||Protesting farmers cross Haryana border, threaten to start hunger strike||Hundreds of farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Jaisinghpur Khera — located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district at the Rajasthan-Haryana border — since December 12, pushed across the border and broke the police barriers on Thursday. Haryana Police allegedly lathi(cane)-charged the protestors, used mild force and released tear gas to stop them. However, more than 20 tractors and hundreds of farmers were able to cross the border and enter Bawal in Rewari. Meanwhile, hundreds of commuters got stuck on the expressway from Dharuhera to Gurugram due to the standoff between the police and the protestors. Shalini Baweja, entrepreneur and resident of Sector 15, said that it took her two hours to reach Kherki Daula toll plaza on Thursday evening after office. The entire stretch was congested and vehicles were forced to move at a slow speed. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that all the seniors officials have alerted their teams, and Bilaspur and Manesar police teams are on alert. Barricades have been put up and extra force has been deployed at all the border points connecting Haryana with other states,” he said. On Thursday, over a thousand farmers from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana reached Jaisinghpur Khera and joined the agitation. The protesting farmers had earlier announced that they would start moving towards Delhi on Thursday, signalling their intent to further escalate the ongoing agitation. Despite heavy police presence and barricading, the farmers broke the barricades and crossed the Haryana border. Satnarayan Nehra, president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said that around 1pm around 20 tractors and hundreds of farmers crossed the Shahjahanpur Kheda border after breaking the barriers. “Rajasthan Police allowed us to cross but Haryana Police started to cane charge. Many farmers were injured in this ruckus. The community leaders have requested the police to let them cross the stretch peacefully and have tried to pacify the protestors. Now, we are currently stationed at Bawal and will proceed after two days,” he said. Tej Bahadur Yadav, a former constable of the Border Security Force, who was earlier sacked from service and contested the election from the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency last year, said that they have been waiting peacefully since December 12. “Now we have to take some action or else we will not be able to join our counter parts near the Delhi border. It has been more than two weeks we are stuck at one spot. We need to reach Delhi to show our strength,” he said.He added, “The number of protesting farmers is still below our expectations. We are waiting for more farmers to join us so that we can block the highway till the new farm laws are repealed. We will go on hunger strike if police do not allow us to cross the border.” Abhishek Jorwal, superintendent of police (Rewari), said that farmers have forcefully entered the district. “We managed to control the situation but few tractor-trolleys have crossed and have stationed near Bawal. The teams are deployed at the stretch and are managing the traffic so that commuters do not face any inconvenience,” he said. Ram Murthy Joshi, SP, Bhiwadi , said that they are not stopping anyone from crossing the Rajasthan border. “There is no issue at our border. However, Haryana Police is not letting them enter into their territory. Our teams are deployed and keeping a close check on any unlawful activity and miscreants,” he said. Farmers at Bawal are protesting on the service lanes where they have stationed their tractor-trolleys, cars and motorbikes. The traffic is being managed by the police personnel, said Haryana Police, adding that although untoward incident has been noted till now, they are closely monitoring the situation and will arrest anyone who will try to disrupt traffic. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September this year. They fear that the new laws will put them at the mercy of the corporations and put an end to the minimum support price (MSP) on important crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/protesting-farmers-cross-haryana-border-threaten-to-start-hunger-strike/story-A9AISEgn4OyaPCVAPQdfoO.html
