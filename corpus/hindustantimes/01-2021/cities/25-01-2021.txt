25-01-2021||Mumbai||Eknath Khadse not an accused as per ECIR: ED informs Bombay HC||The Enforcement Directorate (ED), while arguing the petition filed by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse seeking quashing of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) and proceedings related to it, said that the petition was premature and not maintainable as the report is not a first information report (FIR) and does not declare Khadse to be an accused. ED also submitted that Khadse’s plea to quash future summons was also not valid as investigators needed to question him regarding a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) case against him. The case pertains to the purchase of a plot in Bhosari by Khadse’s kin for ₹3.75 crore, against the prevalent market rate of ₹30 crore. The plot’s ownership was contentious as the industries department acquired it in 1971, but the final award of the plot was not granted, and the owner had not been compensated for it.However, Khadse’s counsel submitted that his client was apprehending arrest for non-cooperation when he would respond to the summons and would choose to remain silent, hence the petition was valid. The counsel also refuted ED’s claim that Khadse was not an accused, pointing out that the ECIR was based on a 2017 FIR, wherein Khadse was named as the first accused. The court will continue hearing arguments on January 28. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by Khadse, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh for ED that the petition was premature and not maintainable. “The ECIR is not an FIR but an internal document for administrative purposes, hence the petitioner is not being considered as an accused by the investigating agency,” said Singh. He further referred to various judgements wherein courts had rejected petitions seeking to quash ECIRs on the grounds that in PMLA cases, interrogation of all persons involved was necessary. However senior counsel Aabad Ponda refuted the submissions saying that if ED was willing to make a statement that they would not arrest Khadse when he went for interrogation, then he would be willing to withdraw the petition. He further added that ED would not make a statement of not arresting Khadse as they intended to arrest him for non-cooperation in the event of Khadse choosing to remain silent and not divulging any information. Ponda further submitted that as his client was in the ICU and there was an obvious threat of being arrested by ED, the petition was not premature and the court should decide on it. After hearing the submissions, justice Pitale sought to know from Ponda to elaborate on how ED would arrest Khadse under section 50 of the PMLA, which deals with summoning a person for interrogation. Ponda responded saying that ED would invoke section 19 of the PMLA in case of non-cooperation and hence the plea for quashing future summons was valid. The court then directed ED to continue its assurance of no coercive action against Khadse till the next hearing on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/eknath-khadse-not-an-accused-as-per-ecir-ed-informs-bombay-hc-101611599236382.html

25-01-2021||Pune||Pune’s Sindhutai Sapkal and Girish Prabhune named Padmashree award winners||The Padmashree awards for the year 2021 were declared on Monday by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and two prominent names from Pune – Sindhu Tai Sapkal and Girish Prabhune, are among the awardees. Sapkal, popularly known as “Mai”, has been working throughout her life for orphaned children, starting and running an orphanage in Pune near Hadapsar. Reacting to the award, Sapkal said, “I am overwhelmed after hearing the news of me being given the Padmashree award. It will certainly help to reduce the hunger of my children at the orphanage. All of them, who have till now, helped, supported and stood behind me strongly - this award is dedicated to them. And to all my children, who are my backbone. I never give up or have stopped my work despite the many obstacles in front of me. This award is for the hunger of my children. I never forgot my past and look forward to work more for my children.” Sapkal added: “There was hunger and fire in my belly, which I realised is there in all my children’s stomach, so I shared my hunger with all and started the work for orphaned children. I remember my father while accepting this award. He always used to tell me to fight the situation rather than cry. I really miss him today.” Sapkal runs an orphanage called ‘Sanmati Bal Niketan Sanstha’ in Manjri near Hadapsar. It has its own building with all the facilities for children, and is run on public donations. In 2010, a Marathi biopic on Sapkal was released in Maharashtra. Reacting to his award, Girish Prabhune said, “For the deprived community I have worked for my entire life and all our volunteers who are struggling for the last 50 years, this award is dedicated to them. And similarly, the Pardhi community. They fought hard for their survival and sent their children, especially the girls, to be educated. It is all because of them all. While accepting this award I am really happy, but at the same time I would like to say that it is all because of all these volunteers who have worked along with me. This Padmashree award is a recognition of my work by the government,” Prabhune started the Punarutthan Samarasata Gurukulam, an NGO in the Chinchwad area for the upliftment of the Pardhi community and their children. Prabhune runs a school and residential facility for the Pardhi children. There are 200 boys and 150 girls from the Paradhi community staying at the facility, based on the “Gurukul” stystem of education. “In 1970 I started my social work and then I came in contact with rural parts of the state. I learnt about the difficulties and issues faced by the Pardhi community. They never give up, is the lesson I learnt from them. Looking at them I changed and developed myself towards social work,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-sindhutai-sapkal-and-girish-prabhune-named-padmashree-award-winners-101611596656660.html
25-01-2021||Pune||State holds public meetings to resolve students’, administration issues||In an attempt to resolve the crisis, Uday Samant, minister of higher and technical education has begun an initiative called ‘public meetings’ to resolve issues faced by students, faculty, non-teaching staff and college administrators. The educational institutes which were closed for nine months due to the Covid-19 pandemic have now gradually began reopening after the unlock process ushered in. However, students, faculty, non-teaching staffers, college administration and universities across the state are facing issues for which they needed to go either to Mumbai at the state higher and technical education head office or Pune at the department’s directorate office. But, the public meetings will now let the educators give an opportunity to resolve their issue in their hometown. The first of its kind program was held at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, where a total of 2,764 issues were resolved of 3,635. While studying or working in the field of education, there are many issues people face which needs to be addressed by the state education department. In order to get their issue resolved, the people in the education sector had to go to Mumbai or Pune. Now, the initiative will provide them with a solution across the state at all state universities. “While conducting these public meetings I will be accompanied by the department’s chief secretary, secretary, director, deputy directors, vice-chancellor of that university and senior officials from Mantralaya. The idea is to meet the public at their hometown and try to resolve their pending issues immediately or as early as possible. Today, we started with the first public meeting in Kolhapur University and there was a great response. Of the total 3,635 pending issues, 2,764 were resolved today,” said Samant. “Similar kind of public meetings will now be organised at other universities in the state. For the Savitribai Phule Pune University, two separate public meetings will be held - one in Pune and the other in Nashik district,” added Samant. Welcoming the decision of state higher and technical education department, Prof Pralhad Keni said, “While working in the field of education everyone right from students, their parents, teaching and non-teaching staff and college administration faces many issues. They want them to be solved immediately, but everyone cannot afford to go to Mumbai or Pune to get their work done. And work is also done after repeated follow-ups, so it is good that minister along with senior officials is taking such public meetings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-holds-public-meetings-to-resolve-students-administration-issues-101611596656139.html

Earlier I used to pay Rs2,500 per rent at a private hostel which runs on coat basis, but now they have increased the rent to ₹3,500.”“It is difficult to pay so much rent along with other necessities like mess service and daily miscellaneous maintenance,” he said.In the last 10 to 15 years Pune has emerged as a hub for competitive exam preparation for students coming especially from rural areas. At least 10 lakh students come from the rural parts of the district to study at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and other institutes every year.Another student Ketan Garje from Yavatmal district said, “I returned to Pune last week with just ₹5,000 in my pocket. My family is involved in farming which has already been affected due to the lockdown. ““The prices of mess service has increased and even snacks like “poha” and “idli” cost more now. Earlier I used to pay Rs2,800 for a two-time meal, now it has been hiked to ₹4,000. I also have to pay ₹3,000 for hostel and if the same situation continues I will have to return to my village,” he said.In Pune especially in the Peth areas, there are many private hostels, paying guest facilities, study centres, private coaching classes, daily food mess and snacks centres which provide necessities for students coming from outside the city limits. Similar is the case near college campuses like Bharati Vidyapeeth, MIT College and D Y Patil in Chinchwad area.Prasanna Temkar, an owner of a mess in Navi peth, said, “For more than six months our mess was closed during the lockdown. We cannot afford to continue giving service at the same cost. So we have increased the monthly mess charges from ₹1,00 to Rs1,800 for one meal a day.”Kuldeep Ambekar, student and president of Students Helping Hand Association, said, “Most of the students who come from villages are already under financial stress and the current situation is worse.”“The university and colleges have not reopened yet and students cannot afford to pay rent at a private facility. The government should make some arrangements for such students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-rise-in-private-hostel-fee-students-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-101611596595512.html
25-01-2021||Pune||Consumer forum directs insurance service provider to pay ₹1.97 lakh compensation||The Pune district consumer redressal forum has directed HDFC Ergo General Insurance to pay ₹1,96,511 with nine per cent interest for wrongly repudiating the insurance claim of the complainant. The forum held that the repudiation of the claim itself is unjust, illegal, improper, hyper-technical and against the guidelines given by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India( IRDA) .By seeing advertisements on television as well as getting information from various sources including online advertisement,the complainant identified as Priti Prashant Shinde was attracted towards the company’s health insurance policy. Priti purchased an insurance policy named, My Health Medisure Classic Insurance Policy, on March 25, 2014, from the website http:// www.policybazaar.com through internet online services. Renewal of the said policy was done on March 25, 2015, after payment of due premium for the period of March 25, 2016, to March 24, 2017. Shinde paid an amount of ₹15,024 towards the premium of the said policy and period and the company issued a premium certificate for the same. Shinde had purchased the insurance policy for her parents (insured/insured person) named as Sandhya Vilas Bhosale (mother, age – 58 years) and Vilas Vasantrao Bhosale (father, age – 65 years) to fulfill their health related needs for the sum insured of ₹2 lakh plus bonus respectively. At the time of sale of the said plan to her, the company had assured facilities, services and benefits provided by company in their proposal form and also assured that if, during the policy period, the insured/insured person shall contact any disease or illness or suffer any injury and is required to undergo treatment by way of hospitalisation in any hospital/nursing home in India or, in any case of domiciliary hospitalisation upon the advice of a duly qualified medical practitioner, the company agrees to reimburse to the insured/insured person or, his/her nominee, expenses related to such treatment reimbursement of expenses covered under this policy subject to the limits prescribed herein, if any and not exceeding the applicable sum insured (including earned cumulative bonus, if any for all claims during such policy period. In addition, the company also offered pre-and-post hospitalisation expenses, ambulance charges, among others.On November 3, 2016, her mother Sandhya Vilas Bhosale sustained injuries due to a fall at her house and on the same day she was admitted at MMF-Ratna Memorial Hospital with complaints of pain in the right hip joint, tenderness over right hip joint. Immediately, the complainant gave intimation about the said incident to the company for cashless facility which was assured by the company in Clause E7 of the policy clause. However, the same was rejected by the company without giving any proper reason. She was operated upon and given surgical management treatment at MMF-Ratna Memorial Hospital , in the network hospital of the insurance company. Due to rejection of claim, Shinde and her mother claimed to have suffered financial loss and the difficulties for arrangement of medical expenses and post hospitalisation expenses in the period of currency demonetisation which created lot of mental agony, physical stress, pains and suffering and hence, the complainant sought relief of ₹4 lakh. The company traversed all the adverse allegations raised against them. “It is a specific contention of the opposite party that the terms and condition of the policy were explained and known to the complainant from the beginning. The policy was issued under utmost good faith. The company denied that, the mother of the complainant, Sandhya Bhosale sustained injuries to fall in her house. It is admitted by the opposite party that the cashless facility claim of the complainant was rejected by the opposite party for the reasons in the said rejection letter. It is the contention of the opposite party that on receipt of the claim from the complainant, it had verified all the necessary documents and after going to the documents supplied by the complainant it was revealed that, “ Admittedly, the policy was issued from March 25, 2014 .However, as stated above, the patient has h/o- arthritis since four years,which is prior to policy inception and the same was not disclosed in proposal form. Hence, the claim was repudiated under the general condition F of the policy. Therefore, considering the specific exclusion clause of the policy, this opposite party vide its letter/mail dated April 22, 2017, rejected the claim of the complainant under general condition F- Duty of disclosure, of the policy terms and condition. The insured must exercise the same duty to disclose those matters to the company before the renewal,extension, variation, endorsement, or reinstatement of the contract,” the company stated. The forum held that the complainant has duly proved that the opposite party wrongly repudiated her genuine claim without proper application of mind and thereby caused ‘deficient service’ and passed the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/consumer-forum-directs-insurance-service-provider-to-pay-rs-1-97-lakh-compensation-101611596596069.html

But the app, which has been downloaded over 100 million times from the Google play store, had raised concerns on issues of privacy of the data collected by government authorities.The app had become a critical part of the government’s orders through the Covid-19 pandemic and its gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions as people were required to have it installed in their smartphones before entering restaurants, cinema halls, metro stations among other public places.Another advocate of one of the respondents said that the order is that the government is directed that they cannot share the data with any private agencies unless there is consent from the user.“The interim order, to the extent that sharing of data with other agencies is concerned, is stayed,” the second person cited above said.In September last year, the National Informatics Centre, which designs government websites, said that it had no information on who created the app or how. It fueled more concerns from activists.“After the filing of an affidavit and the documents as aforesaid, it will be open for the said respondents to apply for vacating the limited interim relief granted as above,” the court added.The petition was filed in Karnataka HC on June 2, 2020.The court also recorded the assurance of the Union government that it would not deny any benefit or services to a citizen only on the ground that they had not installed the Aarogya Setu app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-hc-bars-centre-from-sharing-aarogya-setu-app-data-without-user-consent-101611596229234.html

Kolewadi and Manjri Budruk have given five objections each. The most populated and urbanized village Wagholi has given only four suggestions and objections. While Suz, Konde-Dhawade, New Kopre, Narhe, Vadachiwadi, Nadoshi have given one each and 12 others are general.As per state government notification the process to receive suggestions and objections on the inclusion, began on December 22, 2020, and ended on Friday (January 22).Prashant Khandkekar, deputy regional director, municipal administration, Pune division, said, “We have received 483 suggestions and objections and most of them have expressed objection to the decision of merger. Only four applicants have given positive suggestions and supported the proposed merger.”According to Khandkekar, villagers have expressed concern of increasing property taxes, the uncertainty of getting basic services among others. “Some of them have pointed out that earlier villages which were merged in PMC limits are still not getting basic facilities till date. So, there is no need for the merger,” he said.“Now, we will send a report to the divisional commissioner and schedule a hearing in the coming eight days. After that, we will submit a report to the state government. The government will take final decisions on the merger.”Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) has mentioned in their letter that they are ready to merge in PMC limits. However, the municipal body should provide basic facilities and service in a time-bound programme.On another hand, Nagrik Chetna Manch- a non government organisation (NGO) has suggested that the government will have to provide funds to PMC to provide basic infrastructure in the merged villages. “PMC is already facing problems to provide service to already merged villages. If the government wants to merge 23 villages, they should merge them in a phase-wise manner,” it said.In 2017 when 11 villages were merged in PMC limits, we had received 2,900 suggestions and objections. However, only 265 people were present at the time of the hearing, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-divisional-office-receives-400-objections-to-merger-of-23-villages-101611596475559.html

The coldest day of the winter this month was recorded on January 22 when the city recorded 13.7 degrees Celsius as the minimum temperature. It was 2.6 degrees warmer than normal.“December 2020 was the third warmest December in the last decade with the lowest minimum temperature reported on December 20 at 8.3 degrees Celsius,” as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Though the weather department had predicted a cooler winter this year attributing to the existing La Nina conditions, there has been no cold wave-like situation observed in Maharashtra for December and January so far.As per IMD, winter season is considered to be from December to February, but temperature sees a rise post-January.Pune also has experienced a warmer winter this year with above-normal day and night temperatures.Anupam Kashyapi, head, weather forecasting department, IMD, said that La Nina is related to the cooling of the Pacific waters, while the El Nino is linked to its heating. La Nina conditions this year are favourable for cold wave conditions.“Winter could be colder this season due to the prevailing La Nina conditions. As a result, all the features of winter will be more conspicuous over north India, areas of central India and in pockets of eastern India,” said Kahayapi, But colder winds are elusive in Maharashtra. Explaining that, Kashyapi added that the state gets colder winds from the north which result in a drop in temperature in the state.“However, this time is Maharashtra, the weather was mostly dominated by westerly, southwesterly, southerly wind pattern preventing the northerly wind to penetrate. As a result, there the winter is warmer in our state. With almost no cold wave conditions throughout the state except in Vidarbha region, where cold wave conditions occurred at isolated areas for a few days only,” said Kashyapi.IMD officials said that due to weather systems, the cold is not prevailing for more than one or two days because of which the temperature drop not seen this January.BOX- *Night Temperature *January== Temperature (in Degree Celsius)==Year *Highest night temperature from 2011-2020==20==2013 *Highest night temperature this month==19.7 (till Jan 25)==2021 *Lowest night temperature from 2011 to 2020==5.3==2011 *Lowest night temperature this month==13.6==2021 *DayTemperature *January== Temperature (in Degree Celsius)==Year *Highest Day temperature from 2011-2020==34.4==2016 *Highest Day temperature this month==33.6==2021 *Lowest day temperature from 2011 to 2020==25.3==2011 *Lowest day temperature this month==26.6==2021||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-city-experiences-warm-winter-101611596476154.html
25-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Tractors arriving in groups for rally, officials keep tab on count||Ghaziabad: Amrit Pal Singh, a young man from Ramraj village in Muzaffarnagar, came to the UP Gate protest site on the Ghaziabad-Delhi border along with his group and a tableau for the tractor rally on Republic Day.The group travelled about 150 kilometres and reached UP Gate Monday evening. They said there was no hindrance posed by the police midway. Their tableau shows old equipment which were used by farmers and some of them still continue to be used in the farming sector.“The tableau showcases equipment like hand-pumps, tiller and ‘hal’ (plough), among other tools made of iron. We spent about ₹1.5 lakh to procure this equipment and to get it painted, while about ₹4 lakh was spent on renovating an old vehicle which will pull the tableau,” he said. The farmers have been protesting since November 28 last year at the UP Gate site, which is located on the border of Delhi and Ghaziabad, demanding repeal of the three new farm laws. Their successive talks with the government have ended in stalemates while the government, during the recent round of talks, had offered that it was ready to put on hold the implementation of the three new laws for about one-and-a-half years. However, the farmers did not accept the proposal and the stalemate continues, as they demand a complete repeal of the three laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). As a mark of protest, the farmers have planned to take out a tractor rally on Republic Day in the national Capital.Other groups are also congregating at the UP Gate and bringing in different items to showcase at the tractor parade. Jang Bahadur and his group arrived from Khanjarpur village in Modinagar, and brought along four old traditional carts pulled by as many bulls. He says each of the carts has been painted and is almost half the size of normal carts used by farmers. “I have got these painted and decorated, and spent about ₹30,000 on each. They will be pulled by bulls during the parade. With a one time meal, they can move about 60kms. I have been preparing these carts since the start of the farmers’ agitation and now they are ready to be part of the parade,” Bahadur said. On Monday, the mood at the UP Gate was jubilant as youngsters and farmers at the site were making last minute preparations for the event on Tuesday, with almost all tractors and other vehicles sporting the national flag.However, officials estimated that the gathering at UP Gate swelled to about more than 10-15 thousand as families of protesters and farmers’ groups arrived along with tractor-trolleys. With the arrival of tractors and vehicles, the UP Gate site now spans more than two kilometres. The tractors which are arriving for the event have occupied the NH-9 carriageway and also the UP Gate to Vaishali road. Although the farmers’ leaders claim that the tractors will be thousands in numbers but the official sources from the local intelligence unit said that about 1200 tractors and about 500 other vehicles arrived at UP Gate by Monday evening.The count of vehicles is maintained, and registration numbers are being noted by the police at all entry points.“We have not counted the number of tractors, but they will arrive in thousands and have started from different states. It is also a cause of concern that our vehicles are not being given diesel at petrol pumps and the government is trying to create hindrance. If they think that tractors cannot come here without diesel, they are mistaken,” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “The time to struggle has come. So, the farmers should come out of their homes and protest,” he added.He, however, did not name any place where incidents of fuel being denied to farmers took place, but his supporters were quick to show a social media post in which they claimed that a letter was put up at one of the petrol pumps at Ghazipur district in Uttar Pradesh.The officials at the UP Gate site, however, said that the allegations were unfounded and probably levied to downplay the tall claims about arrival of thousands of tractors, while only limited numbers could arrive by Monday evening. During the tractor march on January 7, farmers at UP Gate had taken to the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) with an estimated count of 700-800 tractors. “We have no information about farmers’ tractors being denied fuel at petrol pumps. There is no such thing happening anywhere. We are continuously reviewing the security and safety arrangements and are in regular touch with farmers’ leaders at UP Gate to ensure that their rally goes on peacefully,” said Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, adding that about 2,000-2,500 tractors are expected to arrive.The officials of the Ghaziabad police said in a statement that during the proposed tractor parade, they will deploy 1,000 constables, 500 head constables, 300 sub inspectors, 50 inspectors, 12 circle officers and six additional superintendents of police, while 400 traffic constables along with 50 traffic head constables, 15 traffic sub-inspectors and five traffic inspectors will be deployed to ensure smooth movement of tractors.They added that six companies of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and one company of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) are already deployed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-tractors-arriving-in-groups-for-rally-officials-keep-tab-on-count-101611596295427.html
25-01-2021||Noida||Tractor rally route key issue for protesting farmers at Ghaziabad’s UP Gate||Ghaziabad: In a development that may create law and order issue during the proposed tractor rally, the farmers protesting at the UP Gate said on Monday that they would proceed to Akshardham in Delhi. However, Delhi Police officials have denied inclusion of Akshardham route to the route plan. The Delhi Police officials on Monday evening submitted a copy of document to the farmers at UP Gate in which they said that they have “no objection” for tractor rally on the three proposed routes and said that the permission is subject to the condition that all the constituents of the ‘Samyukt Kisan Morcha’ shall sign an undertaking having the terms and conditions. While the two routes include rallies to be taken from Singhu and Tikri borders, the third route mentioned in the document is about the UP Gate/Ghazipur border. The route states “Ghazipur border-Apsara border-Hapur Road-Bhopra-IMS College-Lal Kuan-Ghazipur border.” A copy of the document shared by the farmers at UP Gate is with HT. The third route indicates that the rally will head towards Anand Vihar and later to Apsara border from where it will enter the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh in Ghaziabad. The farmer leaders, however, are adamant that they would take out the rally up to Akshardham and then return to follow the designated route. “We have conveyed to the police that we will go up to Akshardham and come back to Anand Vihar and follow the other route. On Tuesday, we will go to Akshardham,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate protest site committee, said, “We have discussed the additional Akshardham route with the Delhi Police. The tractors are coming in large numbers and there is no count.” Officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said that they have not received any official communication from the Delhi Police so far. “Our police officials are in touch with their Delhi counterparts and ensuring that the rally by farmers is carried out peacefully and without any hindrance,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad. Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, did not respond to calls for his comments over the issue. Asked if the Delhi Police has accepted the demands of the farmers at Ghazipur border (UP Gate) to take their tractor rally near Akshardham temple on NH-24, a senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “No such permission has been given. The tractor rally will take a right turn at the Ghazipur roundabout.” The Delhi traffic police on Monday also issued traffic advisory in which they have specified their designated route for the UP Gate farmers. The Ghaziabad officials till late Monday night did not issue any route plan or any traffic advisory ahead of the tractor parade. Instead, the Ghaziabad traffic police reissued the advisory of the Delhi traffic police. The farmers said that thousands of tractors will arrive at UP Gate by Monday night to be part of the proposed tractor parade. “We are taking out this tractor parade to show that farmers love their country, and we will be holding high our national flag during the tractor parade. Every vehicle will have the national flag besides the flag of their respective unions,” Tikait added. Thousands of farmers are on protest at the UP Gate site since November 28 last year and demanding repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws. Their successive talks with the government have ended in deadlock. The document given by the Delhi police officials to farmers at UP Gate mentioned that the permission will be subject to conditions – the permission is limited to holding of tractor rally on the permitted routes only and should not be construed as permission for holding any Dharna, demonstration or sit-in en-route the rally; the organisers shall keep the limit of gathering of participants in rally to 5000 persons along with 5000 tractors; the rally shall be held within the prescribed time limit period from 1200 hours to 1700 hours on January 26 and also ensure that the tractors carry valid docents like registration-certificates, permit, licence, etc., among other conditions. The conditions also include non-usage of any metal rods for flags/banners and wooden stick should not be more than two metres besides the dimension of flag shall be 9 feet x 6 feet or smaller.

25-01-2021||Noida||Tractors being stopped in different districts from coming to Delhi borders for rally, allege farmers||Noida: Unlike UP Gate which where thousands of tractors have been parked for today’s rally, only few tractors could reach Chilla border and Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida by Monday afternoon, with farmers alleging that administrations in various district have adopted coercive measures to thwart farmers’ attempts to reach the protest sites and participate in the tractor parade.Yogesh Pratap Singh, Uttar Pradesh president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Bhanu faction said that the union had planned a massive tractor rally on Republic Day. “We are receiving information from districts such as Lucknow, Agra, Etah, Firozabad, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Meerut that local administrations are issuing notices to the farmers and asking them not to participate in the rally. Fuel stations have been told not to sell diesel to farmers’ tractors. We had planned to convey this message to the chief minister on Monday during his visit to Noida but he preferred to address the Shilp Haat gathering via video conference. We do not think the tractor rally will take place as planned,” he said.“If tractors are stopped in other districts, farmers in Noida will block the Mayur Vihar-Noida road in protest,” he added.The Noida-Delhi road at Chilla border remains closed since December 1 due to the farmers protest.Farmers at Chilla border also showed a letter purportedly issued by Firozabad police in which police personnel were directed by senior officials to keep a tab on local farmers’ movement and stop them from coming to Delhi for the tractor rally. The BKU-Bhanu had a planned 15 kilometre parade from Chilla border to Mayur Vihar flyover, and then to Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway and back. Meanwhile, BKU’s Lok Shakti faction members at the Dalit Prerna Sthal said they have tried to keep the rally low-profile. “We have asked farmers from only Gautam Budh Nagar and Bulandshahr to participate. They will leave the Dalit Prerna Sthal at noon for Chilla border and then to Akshardham and Ghazipur in Delhi. Around 100 tractors and cars will be in the rally. The round trip would be 30 km,” said Rajiv Malik, spokesperson, BKU-Lok Shakti.The Lok Shakti faction has also issued guidelines to the participants to carry national flags on their tractors. They have advised farmers to ensure that unwanted elements do not create nuisance during the rally. “We have also suggested to them to only give lifts to known persons on their tractors. If unknown persons are given lifts, they will have to submit an ID proof,” Malik said. The police, meanwhile, said they still have not received any route maps from the Delhi Police.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said: “We have not received the route map from Delhi Police. Noida police teams will be deployed to ensure enforcement of law and order.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tractors-being-stopped-in-different-districts-from-coming-to-delhi-borders-for-rally-allege-farmers-101611596236041.html

Some visitors were seen taking selfies with it. Some senior police officials and Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) CEO Arun Vir Singh also visited the stall and discussed the project details. In December last year, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had given his approval to the name, design and logo of the proposed airport along the 165km Yamuna Expressway, which will be the second major airport in Delhi-NCR. “Now, the state government will sign the support agreement with the Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) so that the work can be started at the site. It is likely to be signed next month,” said the NIAL chief.The exhibition was part of an event organised to celebrate the UP foundation day. The CM who addressed the event through videoconference said that the Noida airport would be the largest airport in Asia.“We are developing the Noida International Airport at Jewar as the largest airport in Asia. The project was announced 10 years ago. But it’s our government that expedited work on this project. This project will become a focal point of growth in the state,” said Adiityanath.On the occasion, Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from UP, said, “Gurugram saw exponential development because it was near the IGI airport. Now, Noida will have an airport along with world class infrastructure and this region will supersede Gurugram in terms of development.”Swiss firm Zurich International AG, the concessionaire of the airport project, will invest ₹30,000 crore in the project and it gets 40 years to fully develop this project. Under PPP model, the concessionaire will design, build, finance, operate and transfer the project to government after 40 years. The airport will start with two runways by 2023-24 under phase I and it will have five runways on completion to full capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jewar-airport-s-scale-model-grabs-attention-of-people-at-noida-haat-101611596235443.html
25-01-2021||Noida||Development authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar lead industrial growth in UP, says CM||NOIDA: The three industrial development authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar district -- Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway -- has led the industrial growth in Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Monday. The chief minister gave the statement during his virtual speech at an event at Noida Haat in Sector 33A, which was organised to celebrate the state’s 71st foundation day.This is for the first time that a chief minister decided to celebrate foundation day of the state in Noida, apart from the state capital Lucknow. All top officials of Noida, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway authorities were present at the event. Besides the CM, industry minister Satish Mahana and health minister Jai Pratap Singh also joined the event virtually from Lucknow.The CM said that under his regime the industrial development is put on fast-track to create thousands of job opportunities in the state. “I wanted to visit Noida today but due to bad weather, I could not come and had to connect with you virtually. I congratulate you all on UP foundation day. I congratulate the entire staff of Noida for expediting the infrastructure projects,” said Adityanath.“You may have seen the changing face of the district. Noida alone has inaugurated multiple projects having a budget of thousands of crores of rupees. Similarly, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities are witnessing unprecedented industrial growth and investment in the past three years,” said the CM.Officials said that Noida is hardly left with undeveloped land to be allotted for industries. But Yamuna Expressway and Greater Noida authorities are leading the industrial growth story in the state, they said. Between April, 2017 and December 31, 2020, Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway have received investments of ₹10,000 crore, ₹25,059 crore, and ₹14,803 crore, respectively, the officials said. “We have expedited work on all industrial and infrastructure projects to boost growth and create jobs. We are set to come up with an industrial scheme that will help bring in more investments,” said Ritu Maheswahri, chief executive officer (CEO) of Noida authority. Arun Vir Singh, CEO of Yamuna Expressway authority, said, “Since the Jewar airport project has picked up pace, we are flooded with investment offers. We have tailor-made offers for the investors. As a result, Yamuna Expressway has become a favourite area for the international and domestic investors.” The chief minister said that since GB Nagar is the “economic capital of the state”, his government is taking adequate measures to provide comfort to the investors, citizens and other stakeholders.“We have fulfilled the demand for the police commissionerate system in GB Nagar. Safe city schemes with four new police stations were inaugurated today. We have restored trust in the minds of citizens and I congratulate all police staff for this,” said the CM.The CM also started ‘one district one product’ (ODOP) exhibition at Noida Haat. He said that the ODOP scheme that promotes one product in each of 75 districts has contributed tremendously to create opportunities in terms of jobs for 40 lakh migrant labourers, who returned homes during the Covid-19 pandemic.“With central and state schemes, we are creating jobs for the needy to fulfil the dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/development-authorities-in-gautam-budh-nagar-lead-industrial-growth-in-up-says-cm-101611596175461.html
25-01-2021||Noida||78 high-rises in GB Nagar give consent for multipoint power connection||NOIDA: After several rounds of discussions with officials of the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), as many as 78 high-rise residential societies in Gautam Budh Nagar have finally agreed to opt for multipoint electricity connections. According to the PVVNL officials, following the recent notices by the power distribution company to the housing societies seeking details to commence work on providing multipoint connections, 78 out of nearly 400 high-rises have given consent for multi-point connections.The Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) last year had decided to do away with the mandatory 51% consent for multi-point connection.Virendra Nath Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer of PVVNL, said that the list of the societies, which opted for multi-point power connections, has been sent to the discom’s headquarters at Meerut. “The headquarters will finalize an agency that will first convert the supply lines and meters of these societies for multi-point connections. Later, PVVNL will provide connection and supply of electricity, registering all the flat owners under the Jhatpat connection scheme,” he said. Singh further said that as per the existing rule, if a society wants to retain the existing single point connection, they have to give residents’ consent of majority resolution (51%) to PVVNL within 30 days. “In case of no response from the apartment owners’ association (AOA) or builder, it will be considered that the society has given its consent for multi-point connections. All societies which have already submitted their applications can now avail direct connections for their residents. The recent consent of converting the connections given by 78 high-rises will benefit at least 80,000 families,” he said. The chief engineer said that the decision comes after long-pending demand of flat owners paying hefty electricity bills in high-rise societies. “It is being done in accordance with the 13the amendment in the Electricity Supply Code of UPERC in August 2018, which allowed apartment owners to have direct power connection from the discom,” he said. Residents have expressed their happiness at the discom’s initiative of converting societies’ lines to multi-point connections. Raghav Kumar, secretary and treasurer of Apartment Owners Association in a high-rise in Sector 78, said that all the residents must have their say in electricity bills. “I have always supported multi-point connection. After all, the association is for the welfare of the flat owners,” he saidRakesh Kumar Singh of Grihapravesh society in Sector 77 said that the conversion will be a boon for the residents. “We’ve no option than to follow the whims and fancies of our AOA, which indiscriminately charges electricity bills from our prepaid meters,” he said. On the other hand, the real estate association Credai said that the government’s decision of converting single line connection in high-rises to multi-point connections has no meaning. Subodh Goel, secretary, Credai (western UP), said that over 50,000 homebuyers in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts are still waiting to shift into their ready flats as the projects have not been able to install multi-point meters. “The projects were completed two years ago when the state electricity board changed the policy for meters from single point to multi-point. These high-rises were already complete and electric lines were laid with single-point meters. The occupancy of flats has not been issued in the absence of electricity. The issue was brought before UPERC, the electricity regulatory commission has yet not addressed this issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/78-high-rises-in-gb-nagar-give-consent-for-multipoint-power-connection-101611595695452.html

It had said the area was extremely crowded owing to the presence of several small and large corporate offices, banks, hospitals, etc.The petition also said what little parking space Netaji Subhash Place had was not being managed properly. Despite that, DDA was auctioning plots which may lead to more congestion in the area. It sought that a multilevel parking be constructed to accommodate the high footfall.On Monday, the court said no purpose would be served by continuing the interim order as the plots have already been auctioned and the process is awaiting confirmation from the court for completion.On February 19 last year, the court had stayed the release of the e-auction results while asking the DDA to address within six weeks the grievances of the petitioners with respect to parking and congestion.Nath also recorded the submission of the DDA counsel, senior advocate Rajiv Bansal, who assured the court that the issue of parking would be properly tackled and six plots which will be auctioned within a month to be used for the construction of a multilevel parking facility.Bansal also added that if for some reason the agency decides to construct the said multilevel parking on its own, an appropriate project would commence within three to four months.“I bind DDA to the submissions made in court…..,” the judge said in his eight-page order.The court also noted that there was a deficiency of 858 parking slots. It also noted the submissions made by DDA in an affidavit on December 21, 2020, wherein the agency had noted that there was a shortfall of 392 parking which can be adjusted by converting the existing surface parking to stack parking.The petitioners had also contended that DDA had illegally changed the development controls and lifted the height restrictions. They had said earlier the area was a service-apartment plus commercial area and now, the entire area has been converted into a commercial space without caring about facilities and infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-allows-dda-to-declare-results-of-e-auction-of-3-plots-that-was-stayed-for-want-of-parking-101611594795965.html

25-01-2021||Gurugram||Traffic congestion likely due to restrictions, farmers’ protests||Several routes in the district are likely to witness traffic congestion on Tuesday due to the farmer’s tractor rally and restrictions put in place by the police.The Haryana police have allowed farmers to move on selective routes — between National Security Guard (NSG) campus in Manesar and Shahjahanpur on the Haryana/Rajasthan border along National Highway-48 and from Panchgaon Chowk on NH-48 till the Dhansa border in Delhi along the Kundi-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway.A small group of farmers within Gurugram had also sought for permission to travel on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway till Dhaula Kuan in Delhi on their tractors. However, the Gurugram police denied them permission to travel on the national highway, but allowed them to hold a peaceful march within the city’s boundaries on other internal roads.“A small faction of Gurugram farmers was directed to stay away from the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway completely and hold their march on any internal road within the city. It is likely that they will be travelling along the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road, towards the Kapashera border. However, their numbers are few, and it would only result in minor congestion. Regardless, all officials have been deployed at all key points,” said Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Gurugram police.The group comprises fewer than 250 farmers and 50 tractors, according to police officials.DK Bhardwaj, the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gurugram police, said that residents heading from Gurugram towards Jaipur can use Sohna Road and drive towards Alwar to reach their destination and use the same route from the opposite direction, thereby avoiding travel on both these routes.“On one route, tractors have been permitted to travel from Shahjahanpur till the NSG campus in Manesar, from where they will have to take a mandatory U-turn. On the other route, farmers can travel from Shahjahanpur towards Panchgaon Chowk, and then on the KMP Expressway, to Farrukhnagar and Badli. Residents should avoid travelling on these stretches unless necessary,” said.The movement of tractors and farmers on the two designated routes are also expected to result in congestion spilling over to the arterial stretches in Pataudi, Farrukhnagar, and in areas located along the Dwarka Expressway.Bhardwaj said that congestion due to the farmers’ protest is expected between 11am and 7pm.“Permission for travelling along the designated stretches has been provided only after the culmination of Republic Day ceremony. We are expecting the farmers to return to their areas by the evening. Until then, traffic congestion will persist. We have deployed traffic police officials on all relevant routes to assist and direct residents towards alternate routes, if needed,” said Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/traffic-congestion-likely-due-to-restrictions-farmers-protests-101611594437551.html
25-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram shows marked improvement in vaccine coverage||Over 80% of the targeted 6,250 front-line healthcare workers took the Covid vaccine jab in private and government facilities on Monday, as per the data shared by the district health department. The surge in vaccination comes after a consistent dip in the turnout during the weekend, when only about 55% of the beneficiaries showed up. Health officials attributed the sharp rise in the footfall to easy walk-in options for staffers of private nursing homes and clinics. As many as 5,002 healthcare workers took the jab as against the target of 6,250 in 101 session sites. Nearly 80% (4,806 health workers) were vaccinated with Covishield out of the 6,000 targeted beneficiaries at 98 sites. Among them, at least 133 healthcare workers of National Security Guard (NSG) and 150 staff members of ESIC hospital took the vaccine. A total of 196 out of 250 healthcare workers took Covaxin at three vaccination sites. According to chief medical officer, Dr Virender Yadav, the footfall was higher on Monday as doctors and healthcare staff were allowed to get vaccinated at any of the sites. “Besides those who have received SMS regarding vaccination location, we permitted the health workers already registered on Co-WIN to freely walk in at any of the 101 sites to take the jab. The vaccination sites were given access to the complete list of registered beneficiaries instead of the targeted ones as was done in the past few days,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Yadav said he also visited several hospitals to motivate the staff in private hospitals. “Motivation and mobilisation of the health staff are crucial in clearing the hesitancy. Messages were delivered almost a day before the vaccination to clear the doubts,” he said, mentioning that he interacted with medical officers to reach out to their staff. Dr Ajay Gupta, vice president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), who took the vaccine on Monday, said that the doctors turned up in large numbers at various sites. “For doctors who have not been registered or have missed out the vaccination are likely to be covered in the next rounds,” said Gupta. Till now, over 19,485 front-line health workers have been inoculated, which covers almost 53% of the registered staff in the district. To include the remaining staff in the coverage, health officials are likely to finalise the strategy for the coming week as there will be no be no drive on Tuesday due to Republic Day. “The target on Monday was to inoculate majority of doctors and other health staff by setting up the maximum vaccination sites. Almost 50% of the registered front-line healthcare workers have taken the jab due to continuous drive in the last few days. For the next few days, only limited session sites will be set up.” Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said. “On January 27, only limited sites will be set up in private facilities and there will be no vaccination for public health care staff. Further planning will be done on Tuesday,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-shows-marked-improvement-in-vaccine-coverage-101611594436654.html
25-01-2021||Gurugram||No respite from chill as minimum temperature expected to drop sharply||The city got some respite from the cold on Monday morning, with the day’s minimum temperature rising to 8.3 degrees Celsius — up from 6.2 degrees Celsius the day prior. The respite, however, was only momentary as chilly conditions returned during the day. Gurugram’s maximum temperature settled at 16.3 degrees Celsius — down from 19.2 degrees Celsius the day prior.

As per the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) seven-day forecast for Gurugram, the minimum temperature is expected to plunge to about 4 degrees Celsius by January 28 and later rising to about 7 degrees Celsius on January 31. Dry northwesterly winds are likely to pick up pace from January 25 and persist for at least the next three or four days over north India, officials said on Monday. “The recent western disturbance which passed over Jammu and Kashmir last week is now making its way further northeast, and it will continue to have a cooling effect over Delhi-NCR for a few days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi.The IMD on Monday also warned that “cold wave to severe cold wave conditions” may be felt, between January 25 to January 27, in isolated pockets over Punjab and Haryana. The IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius, while a severe cold wave is declared when the minimum drops to 2 degrees Celsius or less.The maximum temperature, on the other hand, is expected to remain between 16 to 17 degrees Celsius until January 28. After this, days are expected to be warmer, with a maximum temperature of 20 degrees Celsius forecasted on January 31. Air quality in Gurugram on Monday improved slightly, settling at 280 (poor) on the CPCB’s daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin.

25-01-2021||Gurugram||Medical institutes in Haryana asked to allay fears regarding Covid-19 vaccine||The state health department has instructed all public and private medical colleges to ensure adequate coverage of Covid-19 vaccines among staffers and residents. Accordingly, senior professors and department heads of various medical institutes in Haryana have been asked to take a more proactive role in dispelling hesitancy regarding the vaccines among beneficiaries and to emphasise their safety and efficacy. An order to this effect was issued by Haryana’s director-general of health services on January 22, requesting authorities to treat the matter as “most urgent”. Addressing the directors of all medical, dentistry and nursing colleges in the state, the order states, “You are hereby directed to give full co-operation to do maximum vaccination to cover 30,000 beneficiaries to make 25th January, 2021, COVID-19 vaccination day a success.” Of these 30,000 beneficiaries to be covered, nearly 9,500 are enrolled with the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences(PGIMS) in Rohtak, where officials said that the response to the vaccine has been underwhelming. Dr Dhruv Chaudhury, nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS-Rohtak, said, “Vaccine acceptance so far has been lukewarm. There is a lot of misinformation circulating on social media, which may be giving rise to undue scepticism. We are not trying to force people to take the shot, but we have to reach out to staffers in a personal capacity so that public trust in the vaccine doesn’t take a hit. The vaccine is our only way to stave off a fresh wave in cases like we are seeing in other parts of the world. It is certainly a possibility in India, too, once natural immunity to the virus wears off.” After receiving the state’s instructions on Friday, senior doctors at PGIMS-Rohtak held a meeting, during which it was decided that all senior professors would “motivate faculty, residents and nursing staff,” as well as employees in housekeeping and clerical departments to come forward for inoculation. In a subsequent order issued on the same day, the director, PGIMS, wrote, “All department heads have been requested to ensure that all of them (staffers) are vaccinated for Covid-19.” Department heads have been tasked with filing the status report in the matter, Chaudhury confirmed. Authorities at SGT university in Gurugram, which is the district’s only full-fledged medical institute, also confirmed that they have received the state’s directive. However, a spokesperson for the institute said that they have not faced much vaccine hesitancy among either medical and non-medical staffers. “I am unable to recall the exact number of beneficiaries, but over 90 percent of them are already vaccinated,” said Dr Umesh Lamba, deputy medical superintendent, SGT University.However, Lamba added that hesitancy is present to a much larger degree among SGT’s 2,300-strong student body — who are enrolled in the departments of medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy, behavioural sciences and naturopathy. “Even though they qualify as health workers, and are at risk of contracting Covid-19 while interacting with patients, students are being very reluctant. Not many have come forward to get vaccinated as yet. Some have even said that their parents are preventing them for taking the shot. Senior doctors have been told to reach out to the students and answer any questions that they may still have.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/medical-institutes-in-haryana-asked-to-allay-fears-regarding-covid-19-vaccine-101611594435411.html

25-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers gear up for rallies to Delhi on Republic Day||Thousands of farmers protesting at multiple locations in Rewari and Dharuhera against the farm laws will carry out a tractor rally via two different routes skirting Gurugram on Republic Day. Another set of farmers who reached the city are also seeking to hold a rally on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, despite being denied permission, and said that they would park their tractors and march to Delhi on foot, if stopped by the police.The march will include farmers camping at Jaisinghpur Khera on the Haryana-Rajasthan border, Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera. Earlier, the tractor rally was scheduled to take place on the outer ring road in Delhi. However, farmer leaders from the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and police officials decided on other routes for the march in light of security concerns. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and several other states have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district since December last year. Another group of farmers is camping at Dharuhera, while farmers from Mewat are carrying out protests at Sunehra-Junehra, on the Haryana-Rajasthan border. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Two different routes have been decided by different farmer groups for the march. The set of farmers marching from Jaisinghpur Khera (Shahjahanpur border) will proceed towards Manesar via NH48 and return. On the other route, protesting farmers from Sangwari Chowk will move towards the KMP Expressway from Panchgaon and reach Dhansa border in Delhi, at the Badli toll.Sanjay Madhav, state convener, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rajasthan, said that farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur would proceed towards Manesar via NH-48. “Around 9am, we will start marching from the protest site with our tractors. We will march till Manesar and return from there. The protest will be peaceful and we do not want any confrontation with the police,” said Madhav. He said that the parade would be a historic one, with the participation of farmers from Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Punjab, among others. Madhav added that around 60% of the farmers will continue their protest at the site while the remaining 40% will take part in the tractor march. Naresh Mehlawat, a protestor from Rewari, said that farmers will start marching from Madan and take the KMP route after Panchgaon. ‘We will move towards Delhi on Tuesday morning and will return in the evening,” said Mehlawat. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that farmers would be marching till Manesar and returning. He said that over 2,000 tractors had already reached Dharuhera. “We will start marching from Dharuhera around 9.30 in the morning via NH-48,” said Sohlot. He said that tractors participating in the march will have tableaux demonstrating the farming practices of different states. Another group of farmers, who arrived in Gurugram on Monday, is seeking to move towards Delhi from Bilaspur Chowk connecting to NH-8. However, police officials said that permission for using this route has not been granted and protesters would only be allowed to hold the march within the city. Satnarayan Nehra, head of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said that farmers who had already reached Gurugram will move towards Dhaula Kuan on NH-8 on Tuesday. “We have arranged 50 tractors from Gurugram and will start gathering at 8am at KMP Expressway, which touches Bilaspur. From there, we will move towards the NH-8. If the police do not allow us, then we will park the tractors on the highway and march towards Delhi from Sirhaul border on foot,” he said. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said the police had given permissions to the protesters and will allow them to cross Kapdiwas border connecting to Gurugram. “After that, the Gurugram police has marked routes and will allow them to reach KMP Expressway from Panchgaon and many will return from Manesar,” he said. Kumar said at least 1,200 personnel of Rewari police have been deployed on the stretch to maintain law and order situation. Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “We have deployed 4,000 police personnel in different shifts, at the borders, KMP Expressway and inside the city to control the traffic movement and monitor the law and order situation. With the high volume of protesters, they have to manage the route until they enter Badli, which is in Jhajjar’s jurisdiction,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-gear-up-for-rallies-to-delhi-on-republic-day-101611594375293.html
25-01-2021||Dehradun||'Good on paper': Saints, experts express concern over Centre's SOP on Mahakumbh||By Sandeep RawatWith about a month left for the Haridwar Mahakumbh in Uttarakhand, the Centre has issued the standard operating procedures (SOP) for the mega event in the holy city. The SOPs include mandatory RT-PCR negative test and medical report on the lines of Amaranth Yatra. However, experts and saints have cast their apprehensions regarding the SOPs saying they are "good on paper but difficult to implement".The Centre issued the SOP on Sunday after the state government approached it for the same on the order of Uttarakhand High Court while hearing a PIL on conducting Mahakumbh amid Covid-19 pandemic. The mega fair will be held from February 27-April 30 with six Shahi Snaans or auspicious baths. The government is expecting one million visitors on normal days while about five million on the Shahi Snaans (royal baths).As per the SOP, the Centre has asked the state government to make it mandatory for all the devotees to carry an RT-PCR negative test report with a 72 hours validity. It also asked all the devotees to get a medical report from a competent medical authority on the lines of Amaranth Yatra before coming to attend the mega event in Haridwar. It has asked the state government to ensure that the aforementioned reports are checked by the mela authorities and not allow anyone without them.Also read: 5 Galwan heroes get gallantry awards, Col Santosh Babu named for Mahavir ChakraSimilarly, it has also asked the state government to discourage devotees aged above 65 years, pregnant women and children under 10 years from attending the event. To ensure the health safety of the health and frontline workers deployed in the Mahakumbh, the Centre has asked the state to deploy only the vaccinated personnel.Saint community raises questionsThe saint community in Haridwar has largely welcomed the SOP, saying that previously, there was uncertainty over organising the Mahakumbh but "now it has been cleared with the Centre's go ahead".Mahant Narendra Giri, national president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, said, "owing to the new strain of Covid-19, safety of pilgrims is important when such a mass scale congregation is being held".Radha Krishna ashram spiritual ideologue Satpal Brahmachari though questioned the mandatory RT-PCR negative report to be brought by pilgrims."Lakhs of people from rural areas across the country arrive for sacred Ganga dip during Mahakumbh. Many come in groups of joint families, neighbourhood, locality and even whole villages. It will not be financially viable for poor people and pilgrims," said Brahmachari.Some saints also suggested that the government can further slash the rates for RT-PCR for Kumbh-bound pilgrims so that maximum number of people can participate in the holy fair which is being held after eleven years in Haridwar.The authorities, however, said that the SOP would be properly analysed and appropriate steps would be taken for its implementation.The authorities said that it is still being analysed if saints ageing 65 years and above should be discouraged from attending the Mahakumbh.Additional district magistrate, Mahakumbh, Lalit Narayan Mishra said, "We are now working on our own plan while analysing the Centre's SOP in which varied aspects will be taken into consideration."Experts flag concernsExperts have welcomed the SOP but have their doubts on its proper implementation in Mahakumbh.Social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who has been keeping an eye on the Covid-19 situation in Uttarakhand since the lockdown in March, said, "On paper, the SOP looks very good but in reality, it would be very difficult to implement"."It would be a very hard task for the state government, especially to check whether the devotees are carrying a negative RT-PCR test report or not along with the mandatory medical report from the health authorities," said Nautiyal.Another expert and state secretary of Indian Medical Association in Uttarakhand, Dr DD Chowdhury, welcomed the SOP and said, "Implementation will remain a challenge. We have to be cautious as more dangerous diseases are likely to come in the future," he saidState government's takeState cabinet minister and government spokesperson, Madan Kaushik, said, "The Centre has issued the SOP after we approached them. We are now working on it to chalk out a plan on its implementation which will be mentioned in our affidavit before the High Court. We are committed to conducting a safe and secure Mahakumbh while making it grand at the same time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/good-on-paper-saints-experts-express-concern-over-centre-s-sop-on-mahakumbh-101611593290319.html

25-01-2021||Lucknow||Dhannipur mosque project to formally begin on Jan 26 in UP's Ayodhya: Trust||The Dhannipur mosque project, which includes a hospital, a museum, a library, a community kitchen, the Indo-Islamic Cultural Research Centre, a publication house, besides a mosque, will formally begin in Ayodhya on January 26.The mosque is coming up in the Uttar Pradesh district pursuant to the Supreme Court verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi case."At a meeting of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), it was decided that Republic Day will be celebrated with the start of the Dhannipur Mosque Project, which includes a hospital, a museum, a library, a community kitchen, the Indo-Islamic Cultural Research Centre, a publication house and a mosque, secretary and spokesperson of the trust Athar Hussain said in a statement on Sunday.He said at 8.30 am on January 26, the national flag will be hoisted on the five-acre plot of the project, which will be followed by plantation of tree saplings by the chief trustee and the member trustees of the IICF.At a virtual meet chaired by IICF president Zufar Ahmad Farooqi and attended by all the nine trustees, the progress of the trust activities, especially the procedural delay in getting the 12-A/80-G clearances under the Income-Tax Act and the proceedings for the opening of an FCRA account, was discussed, the statement said."It was decided to make a formal beginning of the project by applying for the plan clearance from the Ayodhya District Board and start the soil testing process at the five-acre plot," it added.As the focus of the project is to give community service in the area with a determined effort to create awareness on climate change, Hussain proposed that the formal start of the project should be made by planting tree saplings on the five-acre plot of land.As envisaged in the project, a green area, which will have plants from all over the world -- from the Amazon rainforest to areas in Australia that report bushfires -- and from all different geographical regions of India will be developed to create awareness on the imminent threat posed by climate change.Earlier, Hussain had said a mosque measuring 15,000 square feet will be built in Ayodhya's Dhannipur village. It will be of the same size as that of the Babri mosque. The shape of the mosque may be completely different from that of other mosques. It may be square-shaped like the Kaaba Sharif in Mecca, as hinted by the architect, SM Akhtar.The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board has formed the IICF, a trust, for the construction of the mosque on the five-acre plot.The state government has allotted the plot in Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque on the directions of the Supreme Court.After a protracted legal tussle, the apex court on November 9, 2019 ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at a disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The Babri mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by "karsevaks", who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/dhannipur-mosque-project-to-formally-begin-on-jan-26-in-up-s-ayodhya-trust-101611591077226.html

25-01-2021||Pune||₹100-cr Mundhwa jackwell project in Pune fails to deliver adequate treated water to farmers||Pune: Even after four years, the ₹100-crore Mundhwa jackwell has been unable to deliver adequate treated sewage water for agriculture purpose downstream. The jackwell, inaugurated by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) in 2015, is yet to release 550 million litres per day (MLD) water for agriculture purposes. The ambitious sewage treatment project was developed at Mundhwa by PMC to treat sewage water generated in the city and discharge it for irrigation to nearby villages up to Daund. The plan’s purpose was to use treated water for agriculture needs and save water for drinking purposes. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had inaugurated the project on October 1, 2015 which includes a jackwell, a pumping station and a recycling plant. The treated water is released from the plant at Sadesatra Nali area on Pune-Solapur Road for non-drinking and agricultural purpose. The official data released from irrigation department states that sewage water between 21 to 40 MLD per day is released against the mandatory requirement of 550 MLD as per the stated purpose of the project. Experts claim that as a result the remaining demand of water for Pune was fulfilled from dams which has led to a water cut in the city despite heavy rains during the monsoon. Sajak Nagarik Manch president Vivek Velankar who sought information of the project under RTI has demanded strict action against the irrigation department officials alleging failure on their part to lift water at Mundhwa jackwell project. Velankar in his petition to the guardian minister Ajit Pawar stated that PMC has spent ₹100 crore for the sewage water treatment project of Mundhwa jackwell and it was proposed that 550 MLD of wastewater would be released downstream till Daund via baby canal for irrigating agricultural lands. It is the only project of its kind and the project is the complete responsibility of water supply and irrigation department. However, the department is not releasing more than 10-15 per cent water during the past two months, according to the official records. The PMC water supply department claimed that it will supply its citizens 100 MLD additional water, but not providing the mandatory water to farmers is a cause of concern. Tomorrow, the irrigation department officials will oppose release of water for farming from dams saying that the additional water has to be released for Pune during the canal committee meeting chaired by the minister of the department, he stated. “It seems that the irrigation department has no plans for release of either additional water for Pune city or ensure that the treated sewage water is flown forward via canals for irrigation purposes downstream,” he said. PMC water supply chief Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “We release water as per the demand of irrigation department on daily basis. We lift water and release the same in canal and have full capacity to do so.” Another official said that 6.05 TMC of water is to be released as per the agreement. The canal has leakages and is weak. Currently, only five pumps are operational which makes water release a cumbersome task.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rs-100-cr-mundhwa-jackwell-project-in-pune-fails-to-deliver-adequate-treated-water-to-farmers-101611585314483.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Republic Day 2021: Traders’ cheer hinges on a tricoloured dream||At one of the oldest manufacturers of flags in Old Delhi’s Sadar Bazar, Raja Ansari, owner of Bharat Handloom Cloth House, sits pondering over his monthly accounts book. “In over half a century, we haven’t seen such a lull in business before Republic Day,” says Ansari. Wholesalers and traders in Delhi-NCR share that their regular customers aren’t turning up to buy flags and other tricoloured decorative items even though R-Day is around the corner.“Because of the pandemic, last Independence Day also our business was hit, but we continued to pay our employees out of our pocket hoping that Republic Day will help us revive our business. Usually we would make around 3 lakh flags for Republic Day, but so far we have barely sold 2000 flags,” adds Ansari. Rajendra Singh, a Dwarka-based flag seller, shares a similar sentiment. “Until 2019, we usually made 200 flags every day. We are right now barely making 25 to 30 flags. Earlier large flags would be in demand at places such as big campuses; but most public events aren’t happening this year,” rues Singh. Though schools have reopened for class 10 and 12, most of the institutions do not plan to hold events wherein all the students will be required to be present at the same time on their premises, to follow Covid-19 protocols. Traders say that this means that R-Day celebrations in schools will also not be a big affair. Some say the sad bit is that demand for both cloth and paper flags has diminished this time. “As far as I know there are no events in schools, so there are no bulk orders for flags, unlike previous years. Also, most corporates are choosing to have low-key virtual celebrations for R-Day, which is another reason for low sales. Most celebrations have moved online, and hence even orders for paper flags is less; yeh toh pehle lakhon bikte the,” says Vikram Singh, a trader in Sadar Bazar. Even decorative items such as badges, scarves, ribbons, and caps in tricolour theme are not selling that well according to shopkeepers. Mahendra Arora, another manufacturer of flags in Sadar, says, “We keep an assortment of tricolour theme items, but since there won’t be many public events, inki demand nahi hai. People are avoiding meeting in large gatherings, so tricolour caps, ribbons log khareed nahi rahe. So I have had to stop their bulk production because jo do-chaar bik rahe hain woh to purane stock me se hi nikal aate hain. We are not investing in inventory since most customers haven’t placed orders yet.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/republic-day-2021-traders-cheer-hinges-on-a-tricoloured-dream-101611584559948.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Republic Day fervour: Run to salute the spirit of Indian armed forces||To ring in the spirit of patriotism, quite a few denizens have chosen to be part of marathons, this Republic Day, be it physically or virtually. Some marathons are promoting a healthy lifestyle amid the Covid-19 pandemic through runs organised within gated premises of residential societies. “We have 110 runners in our society, and they belong to different age groups. Most of them are participating in the event we have planned for January 26. The run is divided into four categories – 3km, 5km, 10km and 21km. Following Covid guidelines, participants have been allotted time slots starting 5am,” says Sunil Grewal, an ultra runner and organiser of one such event in a Gurugram-based residential society, adding, “For each kilometre covered by a participant, we are donating ₹5 to the Indian Army.” Amid the pandemic, large sporting events have been cancelled across the globe. And marathons too, suffered the same fate. In the new normal, a few fitness enthusiasts have thus taken to virtual marathons, especially on the occasion of Republic Day. “We’ve organised a marathon in the honour of India’s armed forces, albeit virtually. Participants have been recording time and distance using running tracker apps since January 23, and will submit their data on January 26. We will share details, including the e-bib (an electronically developed number used to identify the runner) that can be printed out. This allows the participants to run as per their convenience, and therefore time and place isn’t an issue unlike in a physical marathon. Plus, you can run freely and safely since there’s no crowd, which is why over 1,000 people signed up for it,” says Delhi-based Aman Singh, one of the organisers of a virtual marathon. Denizens taking part in such marathons say they feel mixed emotions of honour and patriotism. “My friends are participating in marathons happening on the occasion of Republic Day,” says Jitin Kumar, a Delhi-based running enthusiast, adding, “Since we can’t have large gatherings and most physical events are on hold, I’ve registered for a virtual run, and even some ride events that my friends and I mutually decided. This way we can celebrate this day together, and it’s another joy to pay homage to our country, and armed forces.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/republic-day-fervour-run-to-salute-the-spirit-of-indian-armed-forces-101611582855996.html

25-01-2021||Pune||State TT championship: Pune’s Pritha starts post Covid game with two titles||Pune: Fourteen-year-old Pritha Vartikar ousted older opponents to defy the age logic. The teenage paddler claimed two titles at the 82nd Maharashtra State Table Tennis Championships organised by Suburban Table Tennis Association in Mumbai. The tournament post Covid era saw some changes — playing with two balls, sanitising the balls after the set and changing side only by left. Though these measures increased the game duration, it did not affect the players’ performance. Though playing her first tournament after 10 months, Pritha played her shots with flair to clinch the sub junior (u15) and junior (u18) titles. She missed her three-in-a-row moment by losing the quarterfinal to Mumbai girl Diya Chitale. It was the first state championship title in the under-18 category for Pritha. “The new rules of introduction of sanitiser, players serving with separate balls and avoid touching the opponent’s ball seemed a bit odd. Even less tables were placed at the arena as part of coronavirus prevention measures,” said Pritha who is number one in the state table tennis association sub junior category ranking. Pritha took time to get into the groove before winning smoothly in the contest and bag the trophy. In the under-15 final, she defeated Ananya Chande from Mumbai (8-11, 15-13, 10-12, 11-5, 15-13, 10-12, 11-6) “The first few matches were tough for me, but later I enjoyed my game. The confidence of winning the u15 title helped me to perform well in the under-18 title,” she said. “It was an easy final as I won it 4-0 (against Samrudhi Kulkarni from Solapur). I will focus on improving performance in the youth (u21) category as well. Along with coach Soumen Saha sir, I will analyse my games on video and work on improvements that need to be made,” said Pritha. “As dates for national and international tournaments are still not fixed, I will continue with route practice,” said Pritha, who is supported by NGO Lakshya.

25-01-2021||Other||Himachal on road to progress from model to number 1 state: Nadda||BJP president JP Nadda on Monday said that Himachal Pradesh has come a long way in 50 years and he is confident the state will continue its journey of progress to emerge as the number 1 state by its 75th anniversary. “We have come a long way and have miles to go. I’m confident the model state will continue this journey of progress under (chief minister) Jai Ram Thakur’s leadership. Changing Himachal is a picture of changing India,” he said while addressing a function in Shimla to mark the state’s golden jubilee celebrations. Urging Himachalis to preserve their cultural heritage, he said: “We have potential in tourism, horticulture and agriculture.” He said the Narendra Modi government had restored the special category status for state and under the 14th finance commission, it got ₹18,000 crore. “Work on the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang Pass was restarted and today it’s strategic from the defence point of view, too,” said Nadda, who represented Bilaspur in the state assembly in 1993, 1998 and 2007. CREDIT ACROSS PARTY LINES “We have seen many difficulties, many achievements. Today, we are a model state. Initially, there were no roads, no health institutions or schools. Today, we can proudly say that we are one of the developed states with a literacy rate of 86% and mortality rate of only 8%,” the BJP chief said. Nadda said people could not forget the contribution of the state’s first chief minister, YS Parmar. “If we have made it as a major category state despite being a smaller one, we can’t forget the contribution of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh,” he said, adding that “similarly former CM Shanta Kumar contributed in strengthening the drinking water supply scheme and also fought the battle for royalty on water.” Nadda remembered the contribution of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal in strengthening the road network under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. “Roads are the lifeline of the state with that has a network of 39,475 km,” governor Bandaru Dattatreya said while presiding over the function. He credited the people of Himachal with overcoming challenges and achieving social and economic goals over five decades through their hard work and determination. “Himachalis have also preserved their cultural and religious identity that sets them apart from the rest of the country,” he said. Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs and Hamirpur BJP MP Anurag Thakur, who was present as a special guest, announced a bulk pharma drug park for the state. He paid tributes to leaders who contributed to making Himachal a model state and urged the chief minister to make a roadmap for the next 25 years. CM PAYS TRIBUTES TO INDIRA, VAJPAYEE Terming the occasion an important milestone, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur remembered former prime minister Indira Gandhi and Parmar for their contribution in the formation of the state. “Parmar gave the vision and guidance to take Himachal on the path of progress,” he said before recalling the role of former chief ministers Shanta Kumar, Ram Lal Thakur, Virbhadra Singh and Prem Kumar Dhumal besides making a special mention of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “If Himachal’s villages are connected with roads today, the credit goes to Vajpayee,” he said, adding that the industrial package and tunnel at Rohtang were also his contributions. He said tourism would be the mainstay of the state for the next 50 years as the industry is growing rapidly. He admitted that air and rail connectivity remains the biggest challenge for the state and work is on in this direction. Union minister Amit Shah, who was to be the chief guest, could not attend the celebrations virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-on-road-to-progress-from-model-to-number-1-state-nadda-101611579974868.html
25-01-2021||City||'No plan to move court against solar scandal inquiry': Oommen Chandy||Senior Congress leader and former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy on Monday said he has no plan to move the court questioning the decision of the state government to hand over the sexual assault case related to the solar scandal to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). He said he was least bothered about the new development.“Let any agency inquire it, I am least worried. Earlier, three police chiefs investigated it and found no substance in wild allegations. The government sat over the case for almost five years and failed to do anything,” he said, adding that the latest move was an election stunt and it will invite more embarrassment to the government.The case pertains to the alleged sexual abuse of Saritha Nair, the main accused in the solar scam, by many Congress leaders including Chandy, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal, MPs Hibi Eden and Adoor Prakash and former Congress MP AP Abdullakutty who is now the BJP national vice-president. In her complaint to the CM, Nair said she was sexually abused by many leaders in return of favours she received from them and she failed to get justice from the local police. The state government decided to hand over the case to the central agency on Sunday.“The ruling CPI(M)had tried its best to implicate me in the case. And it registered a fresh case two years ago with non-bailable provisions. Many advised me to take an anticipatory bail but I did not. My conscience is clear and hands are clean,” said the former CM, who was appointed the head of the party election committee recently. He said CM Pinarayi Vijayan has admitted his failure by lobbing the ball into the CBI's court.Also read: China tries to open new front with Naku La clash, test India’s defence - Experts“In 2018, the government received a setback in the High Court and it did not go to the Supreme Court fearing further trouble. The latest move is just a face-saver for the CM. I don’t see any other importance to it,” he said, adding that the decision to hand over the case at the fag end of the tenure will only expose the government.“People of the state will realise the government’s ploy. It happened at a time when the government is opposing the central agency tooth and nail in many cases, including the twin political murders of north Kerala and the Life Mission project.” He said the government desperately wanted to divert the attention from the gold smuggling and other cases so it dusted out an old cheating case in which the government did not lose a single penny.The solar scandal centred around a fictitious solar energy company called ‘Team Solar’ formed in 2013 by Nair and second husband, Biju Radhakrishnan, who flaunted their contacts with the chief minister’s office and cheated people out of money by seeking investments with the promise of making them business partners or offering to install solar power units. Chandy was then the Kerala CM and had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names cropped up in the case. The government had also constituted a judicial commission to probe the case.Interestingly, Nair was sentenced in at least six cases and is out on bail. In the 2019 parliament elections, she attempted to take on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Kerala’s Wayanad, but her nomination papers were rejected because of her conviction.

25-01-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka CM Yediyurappa makes more changes in Cabinet to contain dissent||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday made more changes within his Cabinet to contain dissent, which threatens to rattle his two-year-old government.In the latest set of changes, Yediyurappa ceded to demands by health minister K Sudhakar who wanted the medical education portfolio restored. Sudhakar, one of the 17 turncoats who brought down the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government and helped Yediyurappa to power, had publicly aired his disappointment after being stripped of the medical education portfolio.Sudhakar had led talks with the chief minister on behalf of other turncoat ministers like K Gopalaiah, N Nagaraju (MTB) and KC Narayana Gowda.

Yediyurappa’s relations with the party’s central leadership have also soured in recent months and dissent within his government further poses a threat to his chief ministerial post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-makes-more-changes-in-cabinet-to-contain-dissent-101611574394406.html

He will cover all the 234 assembly constituencies of the state in a month. During the campaign, people can submit their grievances, which the DMK leader will seal and put in a box to be addressed once the party comes to power. For those who cannot participate, the party has announced a website, mobile number and the Stalin Ani app (Stalin party’s app) to register their complaints.

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Environmentalists begin digital drive against MMR wetland destruction||Ahead of the World Wetlands Day on February 2, environmentalists have kick-started the first green digital agitation on the all-round destruction of urban sponges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) with a series of virtual activities.For over a decade, MMR has been rapidly losing its wetlands to urbanisation and infrastructure development, leading to a considerable decline in bird life as well increasing instances of flooding during the monsoon. According to Wetlands International South Asia (WISA), Mumbai lost 71% of its wetlands between 1970 and 2014. MMR is home to a large number of wetlands; Raigad district alone has identified 130 wetlands. Environmentalists have, therefore, been raising grave concerns on the issue of destruction of wetlands.BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, who floated an online petition asking people to raise their voice against the destruction, said, “Since physical activities are limited due to the pandemic, we have chosen the online route to raise our collective voice to stir up the conscience of the powers-that-be and the people in general. NatConnect began to mobilise further support to the cause of wetlands through a series of tweets, posting photographs of the destruction.” According to environmentalists, burial of wetlands such as Panje, Belpada, Bhendkhal and Sawahkhar in Uran has been impacting lives and livelihoods, with the fishing community, the original habitants, losing their source of survival and the constitutional right to practice their trade.Nandakumar Pawar, director Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan said, “Wetlands are supposed to be urban sponges and they are nature’s gift to mankind as a flood control mechanism. In their absence, water finds its own course. Our urban planners ignore this and the result is flooding of Uran villages and paddy fields, with saline water.”Disappearance of wetlands, along with mangroves, is having a disastrous effect on the fishing community. “Hence, we have initiated with this digital agitation. Protect some wetlands such as Panje and Talawe as bird sanctuaries, maintain floodplains under the river regulatory zone on the banks of all rivers – both monsoon and perennial – and above all, learn from experience of floods and allow people to live,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-environmentalists-begin-digital-drive-against-mmr-wetland-destruction-101611556152907.html

The moa would be delivered at their doorstep by India Post, manufacturers of this quintessential winter delicacy in Bengal said. Earlier this month, the moa was exported for the first time since it was prepared 116 years ago. “We have tied up with the postal department and the first two consignments of 10kg each are going to Chennai and Mumbai on Monday. A packet of six of this authentic GI-tagged product costs ₹150 and a kilo costs ₹500,” said Ashok Kumar Kayal, secretary of Joynagar Moa Nirmankari Society. Also Read: Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek hits out at BJPEven though the markets of Bengal are flooded with the sweetmeat around this time of the year and almost every neighbourhood shop claims to sell the Joynagar Moa, the authenticity of the product is questionable. Manufacturers said that they have tie-ups with only a select few outlets of certain sweet shops in Kolkata and elsewhere in the country to sell the product. Only those outlets are authorised to sell the authentic GI-tagged moa. “It would take around two days to reach Chennai and Mumbai. The shelf life is usually five days but can go up to seven days. The product is found usually till mid-February,” said Kayal. The delicacy obtained the GI tag in 2014 and only around 25 manufacturers from Joynagar block in South 24 Parganas district, around 50km south of Kolkata, are authorised to prepare the product. GI tag signifies a product has a specific geographical origin and enjoys a reputation because of it. Kanakchur Khoi (fried aromatic paddy), nolen gur (molasses), ghee, khoya kheer, cardamom, raisins, and cashew nuts, among others, are used to prepare the delicacy. According to the GI Journal of November 2014, Ashutosh Das, a resident of Joynagar, first prepared the moa in 1904. “One can visit the website of Joynagar Moa Nirmankari Society and place an order over phone. The money has to be sent to our account and we will send the product to the customer’s address by post,” said Kayal. And it is not just the Joynagar Moa that could be availed sitting at home. The manufacturers will also send Nolen Gur (date palm jaggery, also found only around this time of the year).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-gi-tagged-joynagar-moa-to-be-delivered-at-your-doorstep-101611555072808.html

The five-foot-long capsule weighing 1.5 tonnes will be placed 30 feet beneath the ground and the event would be telecast online, said Dr Rahat Abrar, chairman of the content committee and spokesperson for AMU. “The time capsule is made of highly tempered steel weighing 1.5 tonnes. To safeguard the material inside, nitrogen gas has been filled and acid resistant paper is being used to ensure the longevity of the time capsule,” he said. Also Read: UP govt issues 1,43,929 scholarships to studentsA committee was constituted to determine the content to be placed in the capsule and Abrar was made its chairman while AMU registrar Abdul Hamid was its general convenor. “The event, part of the AMU’s centenary year celebrations, will be held online at 11am and the V-C will be the chief guest on the occasion,” stated Abrar. “Sir Syed was in Varanasi when he thought of the university, which came into being in 1920. We have compiled the history and achievements of AMU since its beginning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had released the stamp for AMU’s centenary celebrations on December 22, 2020,” he added. The then Viceroy of India, Lord Edward Robert Lytton, was in Aligarh on January 8, 1877 for the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental (MAO) College. At that time, a similar exercise of burying a time capsule was undertaken by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, the founder of AMU, though it was not termed as so, said Shafey Kidwai, the head of the mass communication department at AMU and another spokesperson of the university. “The district gazette dated January 12, 1877, makes a mention of a similar exercise. It mentioned a bottle that carried details about Madarastul Uloom (a madarsa upgraded to MAO College) along with coins made of copper, gold and silver which placed in the cavity of the foundation stone,” added Kidwai.

25-01-2021||Lucknow||UP considers reducing liquor quota limit for homes||After making home license mandatory for possession of liquor above the permissible limit, the Uttar Pradesh exercise department is going to reduce the home stock limit. This is being considered in a bid to stop misuse of liquor in the name of private consumption, people involved with the development said.Two weeks ago, the new excise policy approved by the state Cabinet made a license mandatory for stocking liquor above the prescribed limit at home. The policy also prescribed ₹12,000 as the annual licence fee plus ₹51,000 security deposit.Talking about the maximum limit for home stock, excise commissioner P Guruprasad said, “There is already a 2010 notification that prescribes the retail purchase limit of liquor by individuals.”But that notification was on clear on whether stocking beyond the prescribed limit was an offence or not. As such, action taken on people caught with extra stash was arbitrary. In some cases, people were reportedly given the benefit of the doubt while in others, they were reportedly harassed and punished. According to the 2010 notification, there are different limits for each category of liquor that can be stocked at home. (See graphic) “The new policy is clear that keeping liquor beyond the permissible limit is an offence, unless one has a valid license,” he said.According to Guruprasad, it is being felt that the present maximum permissible limit for home possession of liquor is on the higher side. “Currently, one can stock a total of around 26 litres of liquor of different brands at home at one time and this is being considered to be unreasonable,” he said.He said there was a proposal to reduce the current home stock limit so that private buyers cannot misuse the provision. He was, however, not forthcoming on what the new maximum home possession limit could be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-considers-reducing-liquor-quota-limit-for-homes-101611550273399.html

25-01-2021||Patna||In Bihar, ‘Kamalam’ has been helping farmers earn a decent livelihood for years now||The dragon fruit may have grabbed the nation’s attention after being renamed ‘Kamalam’ by Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, but the low-calorie fruit has been helping farmers in Bihar earn a decent livelihood for years now.Farmers who are looking to try something new, and are doing away with traditional farming, are easily earning ₹8-10 lakh per annum with a one-time initial investment of ₹6-8 lakh on a hectare of land in Kosi and Seemanchal areas of Bihar.Also read | Gujarat govt decides to rename dragon fruit as ‘Kamalam’It all started in 2014. Kishanganj Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) horticulture scientist Hemant Kumar Singh has the story. “The success story of dragon fruit cultivation in Kishanganj dates back to 2014, when an enterprising farmer, Nagraj Nakhat, brought about 500 saplings from Singapore. Initially, he tried with 100 plants which have grown to 15,000 to 20,000 full grown plants on about five hectares of land. The initial investment on a hectare of land is ₹6-8 lakh which is required for construction of 5-foot barge polls, tyre rings and farm equipment for drip agriculture. After a three-year gestation period, the investment starts paying and farmers easily earn ₹8-10 lakh per annum.” Singh, who has been assigned the task of spreading awareness and guiding the farmers about the dragon fruit in Kishanganj and adjoining districts, said farmers from nearby districts, including Purnia, Supaul and Araria, frequently enquire about the method of dragon fruit cultivation and they have started growing it at their places. “In Kishanganj alone, the dragon fruit is grown on about 12 acres of land and farmers of Kosi and Seemanchal districts are trying it in their districts,” he said. “Initially, farmers faced problems in selling their produce, but now the system has been streamlined and buyers from Siliguri in West Bengal come to pick up the fruits. On an average, the fruit sells at ₹300-400 per kg,” he said. Farmer Nagraj, who brought the fruit to the area, said, “In case of traditional crops, many processes were involved and you have to rely on the minimum support price (MSP) to sell your produce. In dragon fruit cultivation, I am unable to meet the demand of even the local market. The government should encourage the farmers with subsidies and providing technical know-how.” The KVK has set up a 500 sq mt field to demonstrate to farmers how the dragon fruit crop is grown and its varieties. “The most popular variety is the red fruit with red pulp,” Singh said. “The Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, has posted a video on method of growing dragon fruit, which has been widely viewed by farmers,” said BAU, acting vice-chancellor, RK Sohane. Elaborating on the government’s scheme to encourage cultivation of the dragon fruit, deputy director, horticulture, Rakesh Kumar, said, “From this year, we are preparing saplings of dragon fruit on 0.4 acre land at our centre of excellence (CoE), at Desri in Vaishali district. The saplings will be provided to farmers at 50% subsidy i.e; at ₹20 per plant.” He added that after its success in Kishanganj, the government was focusing on area expansion of the crop. “We will also popularise its cultivation in south Bihar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-bihar-kamalam-has-been-helping-farmers-earn-a-decent-livelihood-for-years-now-101611547753145.html

25-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Key Delhi borders remain closed, curbs on traffic till R-Day||Traffic around Delhi borders remained heavy because of the ongoing farmers’ protest and intensified checking of vehicles entering the national capital because of the Republic Day celebration’s security arrangements. While borders like Singhu, Auchandi, Mangesh, and Tikri have remained closed for the last two months due to the presence of thousands of farmers protesting against the three contentious farm laws, the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) and Chilla (Delhi-Noida link road) are partially open only for traffic moving towards Ghaziabad and Noida. As the protesting farmers have occupied the carriageways going towards Delhi at these two borders, motorists are using alternate border points such as Anand Vihar, Apsara, Bhopra, Loni, Kondli, Dallupura, DND, New Ashok Nagar, and Kalindi Kunj to enter Delhi from Uttar Pradesh.

The other borders between Delhi and Haryana are open, but traffic is slow because the police have been checking vehicles entering Delhi ahead of the Republic Day celebrations.The Delhi Police have made elaborate security and traffic arrangements for the Republic Day celebrations and certain restrictions on some roads, especially around the national parade route at Rajpath, will come into effect from Monday evening.As per the traffic police’s advisory, no vehicle will be allowed on Vijay Chowk 6pm onwards on January 25 till the parade is over on January 26.

25-01-2021||Patna||Bihar: 1-month notice period clause for contractual employees triggers row||The general administrative department’s (GAD) recent circular on contractual appointments has triggered a major row with opposition parties denouncing it as the government’s move to get rid of those on contract.An estimated 1.1 million personnel are working in various departments on contracts, as the government had opted to discontinue the appointment of regular staff several years ago.The GAD’s latest guidelines for engaging staff on contracts evoked widespread criticism, primarily due to the insertion of a clause that allows the government to remove anyone with one month’s notice.Also Read: Notorious interstate contract killer Dhanji Pandey arrested in BiharSenior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Shivanand Tiwari and Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra lambasted the government for its design to keep contractual employees on tenterhooks by offering them just one-month notice period.“The state government did not offer jobs as promised during the elections,however, announced a policy that will take away our jobs. The GAD circular made it clear that the contractual employees should not aspire to work on regular basis despite possessing necessary qualification and work experience,” said the RJD leader.Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “The government decision has raised a serious question mark on all the announcements made by them earlier.”Principal secretary, GAD, Chanchal Kumar, did not respond to repeated attempts made to contact him. However, a press release by the GAD stated that the circular issued on January 22 regarding contractual employees was basically a reiteration of a similar circular issued by the department in September 17, 2018 to ensure various benefits to them as per the recommendations of an expert committee.The press note further claimed that no facility which is being currently offered to contractual staff was being withdrawn.The press note, however, did not refer to the concerns of contractual employees in connection with regularisation and the notice period of one month for termination of service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-1-month-notice-period-clause-for-contractual-employees-triggers-row-101611543912084.html

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Groping without skin contact not sexual assault, rules Bombay High Court||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has set aside the conviction of a man who was found guilty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act for groping a 12-year-old girl four years ago, commuting his punishment.It couldn’t be deemed an offence under the Pocso Act because there had been no skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent, the bench observed in its ruling on January 19. The man allegedly pressed a breast of the minor. “Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration,” the court observed.“In view of the above discussion, this court holds that the appellant is acquitted under Section 8 of the Pocso Act and convicted under minor offence u/s 354 of IPC {Indian Penal Code} and sentenced him to undergo RI (rigorous imprisonment). for one year and to pay fine of ₹500/-, in default of fine to suffer RI for one month. The sentence for the offence punishable under Section 342 of the IPC i.e. six months and fine of ₹500/-, in default to suffer RI for one month, is maintained,” noted the bench.Under the Pocso Act, the man had been sentenced rigorous imprisonment for three years and a fine of ₹500; in default of which he was to spend one more month in jail. The man was convicted by the extra joint additional sessions judge, Nagpur on February 5, 2020 for the offence punishable under Section 8 of the Pocso Act read with Section 354 of the IPC and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of Rs500/-, in default of fine to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one month. The verdict was pronounced on January 19, 2021.According to a complaint lodged by the mother of the minor with the Gittikhadan police station, Nagpur on December 14, 2016, her 12-year-old daughter had gone out of the house to get a guava. On the way, the man stopped the daughter and told her that he would give her a guava and took her to his house. In his house, the appellant pressed a breast of the minor and also attempted to remove her salwar. As the minor shouted for help, he ran away.The mother said she had been informed by a neighbour that the man had taken her daughter to his house. When the mother confronted the man, he denied having seen her daughter, which prompted the mother to search his house, where she found the minor who told her about the incident. She then lodged a police complaint.Arguing for the appellant, advocate Sabahat Ullah submitted that the statement of the mother was on hearsay because she had not witnessed the incident and also raised doubts about the minor’s account. The bench, however, did not accept the submissions. Additional public prosecutor M J Khan opposed the appeal and said that the offence indeed amounted to a sexual assault. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the submissions of the state were not acceptable because the appellant had not removed the top of the minor when he committed the offence.“On prima facie perusal of the order, I feel that when section 354 of the IPC is applied in the case of a minor, then both section 7 and 8 of the Pocso Act has to be applied as well. The Act has been made with the aim of safeguarding minors against sexual assault and hence the investigators and the lawyers should pay attention to the fact while collecting evidence, arguing or passing orders and ensure that the accused person is not let off easily,” said Pravin Ghuge, former chairman of the state Child Rights Commission,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/groping-without-skin-contact-not-sexual-assault-rules-bombay-high-court-101611531281209.html

The farmers have announced to take out a morcha to Raj Bhavan after a public meeting at Azad Maidan on Monday.Ruling parties Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress and other political parties including Aam Admi Party, communist parties have announced their support to the agitation.Key leaders including NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Sena leader Aaditya Thakeray, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat are likely to join the sit-in protest at Azad Maidan on Monday.This is a part of agitation being undertaken under the banner of Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) which aims to intensify the farmers struggle in main capital cities across all the states.

According to the organisers, farmers from as many as 21 districts have joined the march from Nashik.Rajesh Pinjarkar, who owns three acres land in Chandrapur, called it a conspiracy against the farmers. “We might get good price in the beginning but after that they will take over our land and make us contract workers there,” said Pinjarkar.Leelatai Valvi, who travelled from Nandurbar for 17 hours to come to Mumbai said the whole aim of these laws was to enslave them. “These are black laws meant to snatch our livelihood and hand over our land to the multinational companies,” said Valvi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-reach-mumbai-vow-to-intensify-agitation-101611531003952.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ rally allowed after Republic Day event ends||The Delhi Police on Sunday gave in-principle approval to farmers to carry out their tractor rallies in the national capital from three border points – Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur – on Republic Day, even as the police said there were inputs that some elements in Pakistan could make attempts to disrupt the event.The police permitted the tractor rally after the Republic Day celebrations end in the afternoon on Tuesday.The three routes are around 194km in length, of which over 100km will fall inside the national capital, said Dependra Pathak, special commissioner of police (intelligence). The police said there would be around 40,000 Delhi Police and paramilitary forces personnel deployed on January 26.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday told farm unions that the government would not repeal the three contentious agricultural laws, and a proposal to suspend the legislation for 18 months was the best it could offer. The farm unions said that they would be going ahead with a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26, but said they would do it after India’s Republic Day celebrations and not disrupt the official function.While the police pegged the number of tractors at around 30,000, farm leaders said there would be about 250,000 tractors entering Delhi from the three border points.Late Sunday evening, the farm leaders held a press conference, assuring that their rally would be peaceful and that no one would be allowed to consume intoxicants or carry weapons of any type. In a press statement after the briefing, the leaders said that their volunteers will take action and remove tractors from the rally if they deviate from the decided route or park on the roadside.The police said that the three routes were chosen to ensure there was no disturbance to the Republic Day parade, the central parts of the city were unaffected and there was as little trouble to local residents as possible. Pathak said that the permission was granted after the police ensured that adequate security will be provided to the rally to ensure that it is carried out with “dignity, honour and respect” even though “clouds of threat hover” over the event.“An analysis by the Delhi Police’s intelligence unit and other security agencies has revealed that between January 13 and 18, at least 308 Pakistani Twitter handles were tweeting using hashtags that could create disturbance in the rally. There are also inputs of attempts to cause violence by Pakistan-based terror groups. But we are prepared to ensure the rally happens without any trouble,” said Pathak.During the press conference, the police also shared screenshots of tweets from proxy accounts in Pakistan, journalists in Pakistan and one political leader from the neighbouring country tweeting with “#Support Khalistan”. The officer said that social media influencers such as Radio Pakistan and other prominent handlers were also tweeting about the farmers’ protest.Detailing the route for Tuesday, the police said the farmers at the Singhu Border will cover 63km and their rally will pass through places such as Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Kanjhawala, Bawana, and KMP Expressway before returning to the same place. The rally from Tikri will pass through Nangloi, Najafgarh, Jharoda, and KMP Expressway and cover a distance of 62.5km. The farmers at Ghazipur will drive their tractors through Apsara border, Hapur road and Kundli Expressway while covering a total of 68km. Police teams will escort and tail the vehicles at the three places.The farm leaders said they will move at a speed of 20km per hour and that they have many vehicle mechanics and enough fuel to ensure that the tractors do not break down.Pathak said they will ensure the tractors keep moving, no tents are set up anywhere, space is provided to emergency vehicles and there is proper coordination between the police and the farmer volunteers – at least 2,000 such volunteers are in touch with the police.“We are bringing along 50 private ambulances, a host of vehicle mechanics and carrying extra fuel to ensure vehicles do not stop. We’ll be moving at not more than 20km/hr speed,” said Kulwant Singh Sandhu, the general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha.The police will try to ensure that the rally ends the same day, but Pathak said it would depend on the number of tractors that turn up at the rally. As per police estimates, there are about 15,000 tractors at the city’s borders, but they are aware that more are on the way.“If there are about 30,000 tractors in all, we should be able to wrap up the rally by the end of the day. But anything more than that could spill over to next day,” said another senior police officer who did not wish to be identified.But Sandhu said that there will be at least 200,000 tractors and the rallies could range from 24 hours at Ghazipur Border to 48 hours at Singhu and Tikri border points. “In a place as far as Ludhiana, trucks moving towards Delhi are travelling in two lanes,” said Sandhu.What the police as well as farm leaders agreed on was that the farmers will return to their respective places after the rally, and not camp inside Delhi. “We trust them to return,” said Pathak. Sandhu agreed. “We are a disciplined force,” he said.A consensus on the routes was arrived at on Sunday after six “marathon meetings” between the farmers and the police forces of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana over the last week.“Along the routes, we have arrangements for evacuation and providing medical aid to the farmers in case of any trouble,” said Pathak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-rally-allowed-after-republic-day-event-ends-101611528983524.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||700 victims of Delhi riots file claims for damages||The North East Delhi Riots Claims Commission (NEDRCC) which was set up by the Delhi government to evaluate the damage to public property caused during last February’s riots and the recovery process has received 700 applications so far from people affected by the communal clashes.The commission has also extended the date for filing claims till February 15 from the earlier deadline of January 15. The first deadline for claims was December 31, 2020.The panel has received applications for compensations against damaged property and deaths or injuries to family members during the riots.The commission has also received the approval of Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal for the appointment of a panel of five loss assessors, and their appointment is likely to be completed by the end of the next week, said retired Delhi High Court judge Sunil Gaur, who was appointed the claims commissioner by the high court in March. “The appointment procedure for loss assessors has started and it will be completed soon. The process of assessing the human and property losses in the riots will begin after the scrutiny of all the received applications,” said Gaur.The court appointed Gaur after the Delhi government wrote to the court registrar general, seeking the appointment of a claims commissioner. This came following Delhi Police’s decision to recover the cost of damages to public and private property during the riots in north-east Delhi from people identified as “rioters”.A total of 53 people were killed and more than 400 were injured in the riots that ravaged parts of north-east Delhi in February last year. Police have registered 755 cases related to the communal violence.Initially the commission, having its office at old Delhi Police headquarters at ITO in central Delhi, was receiving applications for compensations against property losses. But when people who were either injured in the riots or had lost their family member(s) also started visiting the commission office for compensation, the claims commissioner allowed the filing of such applications as well.“We will take deaths or injuries related complaints on priority so families of the deceased can get justice and their compensations first,” said Gaur.Among the 700 applications for compensation, one claimant, Ikramuddin, has sought a compensation of ₹10 crore against the death of his 19-year-old son Aqib (single name) on February 24. Aqib was out shopping for his sister’s wedding with ₹1,000 he got from his parents, when he received serious head injury in stone pelting during the communal violence in Bhajanpura and succumbed to his injuries in a hospital five days later.Being the main earning member, Aqib’s death left his six-member family struggling to make ends meet. “We got ₹5 lakh compensation from the government but the money was spent on my daughter’s wedding and returning the loans we had taken for Aqib’s funeral. We have demanded ₹10 crore as compensation as my son would have earned at least this much in his life had he been alive,” said his father Ikramuddin.Irshad Khan, a resident of Shiv Vihar, was in his first floor rented home with his 12 family members and relatives when alleged rioters set it on fire on February 25. “The blaze destroyed everything in our house, including electronic items, clothes. We were forced to take shelter in a camp set up by the government for families affected by the riots,” said Khan.Khan’s family received ₹25,000 as compensation. Since the money was not enough to start afresh, the family has moved the NEDRCC and sought compensation of ₹2.5 lakh against the items they lost.Explaining the commission’s functioning and responsibilities, Gaur said the scrutiny of applications will be done to avoid duplication, since they were handed physically and sent through email, or by post. The ones that do not need the commission’s intervention will be discarded. The scrutinised applications will be given to the loss assessors, who will visit the riot-affected areas, meet the claimants, carry out inspection and verification of the claims, compile their reports, and submit them before the commission.“The loss assessors will also take into consideration all investigations carried out by agencies, including the police, while verifying the claims and preparing their reports. I will go through their reports before finalising them and submitting them to the Delhi high court. The court would take the final call on the compensation amount,” added the retired judge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/700-victims-of-delhi-riots-file-claims-for-damages-101611527062593.html

The man accompanying him is his cousin and both were traveling to India for the first time, officials said.The two passengers were identified as Hamuza Sserugo, 34, and Umar Sebandeke, 36. The smuggling attempt came to the fore around 4am on Sunday when the two passengers landed at Delhi airport from Doha and were intercepted following a tip-off as they crossed the green channel.They were both asked to cooperate for a detailed search. “During search of their checked-in bag, a total of 51 pouches, containing 9.8 kilos of white powder, were recovered.

25-01-2021||Environment||Delhi had 7 of India’s 10 bad air hot spots last year: Report||In 2020, seven of India’s 10 most polluted areas were in Delhi, data from a recently launched air quality dashboard shows.The Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Standards (CAAQMS) dashboard also shows that on January 23, ITO in Central Delhi was the most polluted locality in the country by a significant distance. At the ITO intersection, one of the busiest in the Capital, the 24-hour PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) average on Sunday was recorded 529ug/m3.In comparison North Delhi’s Jahangirpuri, which occupied the second place on the list, recorded a PM2.5 reading of 261ug/m3.The CAAQMS dashboard, which is a part of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) tracker project, has been developed by Mumbai firm Respirer Living Sciences and Carbon Copy as a one-stop platform to collate pollution data and make available seasonal, monthly and annual emission averages of cities across the country.The national list of most polluted localities in 2020 according to this dashboard was topped by Sidhu Kanhu Indoor Stadium in West Bengal, where the average PM2.5 levels were 140ug/m3. Jahangirpuri occupied the second spot here as well, with PM2.5 levels around 131ug/m3 through the year.This list also included, in order, Bawana, Rohini, Mundka, Anand Vihar, Nehru Nagar, and Vivek Vihar (See Chart 1).This year too, initial trends have not been promising for Delhi. The list of 10 most polluted localities of India this year, according to the average PM2.5 recordings of 2021 (between January 1 and January 24), featured eight areas from Delhi, with Ashok Vihar recording the worst PM2.5 levels, followed by RK Puram and Jahangirpuri.Apart from localities in Delhi, areas from other states that have featured in the list are Talkatora District Industries Centre in Lucknow (124ug/m3), which was ranked seventh and Loni in Ghaziabad, which stood eighth (123ug/m3) (See Chart 2).The dashboard’s list of 10 most polluted areas in the past 24 hours had areas from Delhi occupying the first four stops.ITO, which had the worst PM2.5 levels between January 23 and 24, is followed by Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar and Wazirpur. Okhla Phase 2 and Nehru Nagar held the sixth and seventh spots in the list, while Vivek Vihar and Patparganj were ninth and tenth, respectively.Experts said such intense monitoring was needed to design pollution control plans at macro and micro levels. SN Tripathi, head of the civil engineering department at IIT-Kanpur, said since NCAP started in 2019, said India is now a fifth of its way through the plan’s targets, and it is important to increase emission monitoring. “It is a five-year plan, with a target to reduce PM2.5 and PM10 by 20-30% by 2024. The measures being taken now are aimed to increase accountability,” Tripathi said.Ronak Sutaria CEO, Respirer Living Sciences, said, “The dashboard has allowed transparency for not just PM2.5 and PM10 data, but also for harmful gases such as Nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/delhi-had-7-of-india-s-10-bad-air-hot-spots-last-year-report-101611522717729.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||‘Notorious’: Another tryst with infamy for Delhi’s Palika Bazar||Last week, Baljit Singh Kohli’s office was inundated with phone calls after Palika Bazar was named in 2020 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy by Office of the United States Trade Representative ( USTR). “A lot of them were shopkeepers of the market, but nobody seemed to know abut the agency, or what it said about the market,” says Kohli.“Palika Bazar, the underground market in Delhi is reportedly well-known for the trade of counterfeit products,” according the review by the US agency, which has also listed the Tank Road market in Delhi’s Karol Bagh besides Heera Panna in Mumbai, Kidderpore in Kolkata, and Snapdeal, one of India’s largest e-commerce platforms.Kohli, chairman, Palika Bazar Shopkeepers Welfare Association, countered the assessment. “Our market has completely transformed from an electronics market to a garments hub in the past decade. Most of what we sell now is made in India and some of it could be Chinese like in any other market in the city. So where is the question of counterfeiting and piracy?” he says.The listing by USTR was another chapter in the controversial history of India’s first air-conditioned underground market. The brainchild of late Congress leader Sanjay Gandhi, Palika Bazar was built by the NDMC during the Emergency in a record time of less than a year and opened in 1979. Initially, the shops were allotted to post-Partition refugees who had their shops on Panchkuian Road.“When the market opened in 1979, it mostly had handicraft, gift shops, and many restaurants such as Hackman’s and Tiffin Top; and Lords, the famous ice-cream parlour. However, there were only a few customers,” says Darshan Lal Kakkar, 65, president of the market association, who runs a Forex shop in Palika Bazar.“But the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi came as a big boost to the business here.”By the mid-1980s, as the popularity of audio and video cassettes grew, many gifts and garments shops in the central hall of the market began selling electronics items. And by the late 1980s, the market became a favourite haunt of those looking for video cassettes of Bollywood and Hollywood blockbusters, video cassette players, and a few years later for Walkman, Discman, cameras, digital diaries, gaming consoles — all imported or smuggled from Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.Not just electronics, the bazar was also a popular place for shoppers of Timotei shampoo, Converse shoes and many other foreign brands in the pre-globalisation era. Many shops like Clydes that sold heavy metal band merchandise commanded a large fan following. And, in summers, many Delhiites descended the steps of the market simply to escape the heat.Piracy hubThe first major blow to the market’s reputation came in the mid-90s when there was a major police raid on the shops selling video cassettes, and many shop keepers, who were allegedly selling pirated movies, were arrested. That was also the time when the market gained an unsavoury reputation for being an underground porn hub.While Sanjay Arora , a shopkeeper in the market, says adult movies were mostly sold by hawkers who came to the market from outside, another shopkeeper who does not wish to be named admits that a few video cassette sellers in the market had set up units in places such as Nangloi, with as many as 200 VCRs churning out pirated copies of movies. Some of these, he says, did sell adult movies mostly reproduced on cheap video cassettes. “There was a lot of money to be made in the 1980s in the video cassette business and piracy thrived in the market,” he says.Most shops in the central hall and its mezzanine floor that once sold only video and audio cassettes are today electronics goods and garments shops. In fact, today Palika presents a curious sight—there are many shops with a front sign identifying them as electronics shops, but they are actually selling garments and shoes. So, you have a Rainbow Video selling ladies garments; Sound Trek, another electronics shop, selling garments at a fixed price of ₹250.Changing businessMost of the erstwhile owners of the electronics and video cassettes shops have been experimenting with different businesses for the past decade.For instance, Jasbir Singh Gill, 66, who was once known in the market as cassette king, started a small snacks shop three months ago, having run a garments shop for over a decade.Similarly, many other shops that were popular in the 1990s have changed their line of business. Clydes, which used to sell heavy rock bands cassettes and merchandise including T-Shirts, shorts and beanies. “In the 1990s, apart from tourists most of our clients were fashionable, English-speaking youngsters from Delhi, Mumbai, and northeastern states of India. Our customers had been dwindling drastically. We stared selling garments by 2005, as the number of our customers had dropped drastically,” says Sushil Deshwar, who runs the shop with his brother.Some shopkeepers feel that the dubious reputation of Palika Bazar has adversely affected their business. Rakesh Talwar, who runs Leather Talks, a leather goods shop, says he opened the shop in the market in 1979. “We were based in Kolkata, where we produced our goods. In the first few years, we felt our decision to open our second outlet was right. But today, I feel suffocated here; it has not been easy convincing customers about the genuineness of products because of the market’s reputation for counterfeiting,” says Talwar. “This does not even remotely resemble the market I came to in 1979,” he says.Similarly, Rajat Gupta, who runs Rajiv Book House, set up by his father in 1979, bristles at any reference to the market having been an electronics hub. “It had some of the finest bookshops, attracting book lovers from all over Delhi and outside. But yes, our business is down like never before and we are currently weighing our options,” says Gupta.But for Ravi Thakur, Palika Bazar has turned out to be a perfect place for business. He opened his first tattoo shop here in 2013, and today runs four tattoo parlours in the market, which attract a steady stream of customers in an otherwise deserted market, where dozens of tattoo shops have come up over the few years. “Today, Palika is the biggest hub of tattoo parlours,” says Thakur, who runs Tattoo World.But Kakkar is not amused at the market’s new reputation as a tattoo hub. “We have tolerated these tattoo shops as they have helped bring in footfalls. We are trying to figure out how the market can reinvent itself,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/notorious-another-tryst-with-infamy-for-delhi-s-palika-bazar-101611522444272.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Garbage piles up as strike continues||Garbage continues to pile on the streets of areas under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation as the strike by sanitation employees of the civic body stretched into more than a fortnight on Sunday.On Sunday, garbage lay piled outside dumping sites and roads across many localities in north Delhi, even as the agitating sanitation workers dumped more on the streets in areas such as Model Town, Timarpur, Daryaganj, Civil Lines, Sadar Bazar, Mukherjee Nagar, Narela, Rohini, Karol Bagh and Keshavpuram.Sanitation workers along with the employees of other departments such as nurses, paramedic staff, teachers, engineers, horticulture department staff, clerical staff started an indefinite strike on January 7 against non-payment of their salaries for the last three months. The strike is being conducted under the aegis of Confederation of the MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of 45 associations of three civic bodies.“Our strike will continue and we will not return to work until salary of employees of all departments are cleared,” Ram Niwas Solanki, general secretary of the confederation, said.Besides payment of salaries, sanitation workers are also demanding regular jobs.JP Tank, president Delhi Nagar Nigam Shramik Sangh, said, “We will continue our strike and will not remove garbage from any locality. We have not been paid salaries of October, November and December. January is also about to end so one more month will be added when our salary will be due. We want a permanent solution to this problem so we have decided to continue our strike despite the mayor’s announcement of two months salary payment, which is yet to be made.”Residents, meanwhile, complained about stench and garbage not being lifted from across north Delhi areas due to the ongoing strike.“All streets are littered with garbage here. Even as the Covid-19 pandemic sweeps through the country, this garbage menace is further endangering public health, said Anam Khan, a resident of Daryaganj near Golcha Cinema.Manish Bajwa, a resident of Sadar Bazar, said people are bearing the brunt of the face off between the civic authorities and the state administration.“When we go to the sanitation workers, they say they are on strike. Neither the government nor the civic bodies are paying attention to the crisis. Residents are the real sufferer,” he said.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that arrangements are being made to clear pending salaries of all employees. “We have released two months salaries of sanitation workers. I now appeal them to return to work as garbage is seen strewn across streets. Salaries of other department’s employees will also be released soon,” Prakash said.Responding to this, acting president of Delhi Nagar Nigam Shramik Sangh, Pawan Tank said, “Sanitation workers are yet to get the said salaries. And also it is now not a matter of only sanitation workers but it is concerned to all civic employees. We have supported the call of the strike by the confederation so we will continue the strike until the matter is resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/garbage-piles-up-as-strike-continues-101611522242221.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The mom-and-pop around the corner||The small stationery shop is noticeable because it also sells magazines, an increasingly endangered sight in these days of online reading. Then, you notice shelves decked with greeting cards, an increasingly endangered sight in these days of social media greetings. Then, you notice a row of DVDs... what’s that?!And then all these sights are trumped by the sight of the owners, sitting by the counter. The elderly couple running the Rachna Book House look totally devoted to each other. Clad in a grey cardigan, with a bindi on her forehead as tiny as a dot, Kanta Oberoi turns towards her husband, Tilak Raj, declaring that the long-time establishment is a consequence of his earnestness and hard work. Mr Oberoi blushes at the compliment, though it’s difficult to confirm because of his face mask.The store has been in South Delhi’s SDA Market since the 1980s, “but he laid its foundation 50 years ago,” the lady says, talking of her husband.Mr Oberoi’s father, a partition refugee from Pakistan, died when Mr Oberoi was seven. Mr Oberoi thus started working as a young newspaper delivery boy to support himself and his mother. “I would pick the papers from Scindia House (in Connaught Place), and deliver them on bicycle in Defence Colony and Kotla.” Those early years were tough “especially because I would get the payment from subscribers only at the month’s end, and then so many people would delay paying up.” For instance, he would knock only to be told that the customer was still asleep or taking a long shower.Regardless, he succeeded enough to open up a pavement stall in Green Park, and later on managed to take up this shop on rent. The couple named it after one of their four daughters.Waving his hand towards the latest edition of Reader’s Digest, Mr Oberoi says, “It costs 100 rupees... at one time, I would sell it for 50 paisa.”The couple concedes that the number of magazine buyers has gone down, “especially with the coronavirus, because the lockdown forced so many magazines to stop publishing their issues on print.” Very few folks are buying magazines, the lady notes, forcing them to sell mineral water bottles and face masks.You ought to visit this shop to hang out with the friendly couple. They live in Sheikh Sarai and commute by auto rickshaw. The shop opens from midday to 8pm. “We are senior citizens, so we arrive late,” says the lady matter-of-factly, as her husband gazes upon her mask-covered face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-mom-and-pop-around-the-corner-101611522010575.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Minor tweaks lead to major jump in overall Covid-19 vaccinations||The Covid-19 vaccination centres across Delhi have witnessed sharp increase in turnout over the last four days after the government resorted to minor protocol changes, apart from investing on campaigns that contributed to confidence building among beneficiaries.According to senior government officials, the measures introduced include out-of-turn vaccine shots, for not only those beneficiaries who are allotted slots on future dates, but also those who missed their shots for some reason, informally allowing centres to exceed the cap of 100 shots per day on ensuring full compliance, and letting beneficiaries take their shots in any centre that is convenient for them instead of the ones in which they were registered.Delhi has an estimated 300,000 health care workers, of which 240,000 have registered for vaccination, said government records. So far, 25,762 of them – out of a targeted 42,578 – have been inoculated in five days, government data said, reflecting an overall turnout rate of 60.5%.“The walk-in process, or the out-of-turn window for jabs, have been opened for all since Saturday. Now, people who are registered for future dates as well as those who have missed their vaccines can voluntarily approach a centre any day to check availability of slot and get vaccinated,” said a government official in the health department.The official further said, “Several vaccine centres are also taking the liberty of administering more than 100 shots per day, even though there is no official directive in this regard yet. In such cases, the centres have to take permission from the district magistrate’s office and assure 100% compliance along with social distancing .” Delhi has 81 vaccination centres, which are functional between 9 am and 5 pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.“As far as the provision regarding allowing beneficiaries to take shots in any centre is concerned, the centres have to update the master file to ensure there is no double counting. They also have to ensure that a person’s name is enlisted for a reminder for the second dose in 28 days. Several centres have allowed this facility since Saturday,” said another official.On Saturday, the city recorded a turnout of 86% at its centres – the highest for a single day since the drive was launched on January 16. Also, in a first, two (out of 11) revenue districts in logged 100% turnout on Saturday. Delhi recorded vaccination turnout of 53% on January 16, 44.2% on January 18, 48.8% on January 19, and 73.4% on January 21.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet Covid-19 commission and vaccination task force for India, said “More vaccination centres should be set up. The state government is working on a proposal regarding this. Timely policy tweaks have helped. The provision to allow centres to administer more than 100 shots has been discussed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-minor-tweaks-lead-to-major-jump-in-overall-covid-19-vaccinations-101611519639070.html
25-01-2021||Budget||‘Debt waiver can restore farmer faith in the govt’||Gurdhian Singh, 42, a resident of Seona village in Punjab’s Patiala district, has big expectations from the upcoming Union budget. But he is not sure what the government has in store for the agriculture sector.“The way negligible yearly increase is given in the minimum support price (MSP) on crops, particularly wheat and paddy, it seems not many farmers, especially small and marginal, could continue to earn a livelihood,” said a worried Singh, who owns eight acres of land and has a family of five to support: two sons, a wife and parents.“It is tough to support the entire family and its needs on eight acres, because prices fixed by the government are too low. I operate a harvest combine and have a small dairy of four-five buffaloes to generate additional income for my family,” he said, standing in his wheat field.The Centre allocated ₹1,38,564 crore for the agriculture ministry in the 2020-21 budget, five percent of the outlay. The increase was primarily because of allocation of ₹75,000 crore for the PM Kisan Nidhi Yojana, the federal income support scheme for farmers.The Centre also said it increased MSP for paddy 2.4 times and for wheat 1.5 times in the past six years and implemented the 2004 Swaminathan Commission recommendation of assured price of 50% profit over the production cost.But Singh thinks it is not enough. “We can grow any crop such as wheat, paddy, sugarcane, potato, vegetables and even fruits. Mother earth has not let us down, but successive governments have cheated us,” he rued, giving an example of increase in MSP on paddy from ₹1,835 per quintal in 2019 to ₹1,888 in 2020. “It’s an increase of ₹53 for 100 kilograms of paddy; just 53 paise per kilogram. It’s a cruel joke played on us,” he said.Singh pointed out input costs such as diesel prices, labour and agro-chemicals had increased four or five times, but MSP had not kept pace.Many of Singh’s fellow farmers are currently agitating outside Delhi to press for the repeal of three controversial farm laws passed in September. They argue these laws will threaten the MSP regime, threaten the government-backed procurement system and leave them at the mercy of big firms.The government has offered to put the laws on hold for 1.5 years and assured that MSP will continue, but the stalemate will continue.“The government is trying to take away the rights of the farmers through unjust laws. The three laws should be repealed which intends to make farmer a subject of the corporate. Not only farmers but people in all other avocations have stood united against these laws,” he said.He said in the 2021 budget, the Centre should announce an MSP of ₹3,000 per quintal for wheat and paddy so that recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission of 50% profit on the input cost is truly implemented.He also wants the Centre to waive the debt of farmers and allow them to make a new beginning. As per State Bank of India research, non-performing assets of farm loans was ₹8,79,000 crore at end of the 2018-19 financial year. In the past five years, the annual increase of farm loan NPAs was 10%. “Debt waiver would restore farmer faith in the government,” Singh said, adding that he has an outstanding loan of ₹18 lakh.He hopes that more farmers are covered under the PM-Kisan scheme. He also sought a special corpus fund for crop diversification so that the burden of procuring wheat and paddy could be curtailed. “Farmers will diversify if the government assures a good price,” he said, recalling his experience of making a loss when he grew potatoes, maize and vegetables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/debt-waiver-can-restore-farmer-faith-in-the-govt-101611518716556.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||No halts allowed during Republic Day tractor rally: Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Sunday said they will focus on ensuring that the protesting farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day does not halt anywhere in the Capital, and that there is no “disturbance” during the programme, even as they claimed to have received intelligence inputs concerning groups that would look to disrupt the event on Tuesday.The police said they also chose the three routes for the day keeping in the available medical facilities along the way, to deal with any potential emergencies.The police on Sunday gave protesting farmers an “in-principle” approval for the tractor rallies in the national capital from three of Delhi’s border points — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — on Republic Day.The tractor rally has been allowed to set off after Republic Day celebrations end in the afternoon, officers said on Sunday.The police said they received intelligence inputs about terror groups from Pakistan looking to disrupt the rally. Dependra Pathak, special commissioner of the Delhi Police’s intelligence unit, said the team had analysed Twitter posts and identified 308 accounts originating in Pakistan that were tweeting a hashtag supporting the demand for Khalistan while writing about the farmers protest in the city. Those using the hashtag included Pakistani journalists and politicians, the police said.The police will be deployed throughout the route along which the tractor rally is scheduled, said. “There will be a police team accompanying the pilot tractors of the rallies from each of the three border points. They’ll be carrying out anti-sabotage checks on the move,” said Pathak.The police have also made arrangements for evacuation in case of any trouble and the routes were chosen keeping this aspect in mind, he said. “We have identified hospitals along the routes that will help us carry out the evacuation in the event of any emergency,” he said.Farmers said they had made their own preparations for the day. “We are bringing along 50 private ambulances, a host of vehicle mechanics and carrying extra diesel to ensure the vehicles do not stop. We’ll be moving at no more than 20km/hour,” said Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha.The farmers will also bring along cooked food and water so they don’t have to halt at any point.The rally was permitted after the farmers agreed to a host of terms and conditions, said the police. “The tractors will not be accompanied by trolleys, they won’t demonstrate anywhere along the route, they won’t halt anywhere or set up tents, they’ll allow emergency vehicles to pass and in case of an emergency, clear the roads for an evacuation plan,” said a senior police officer, who asked not to be identified.Apart from this, the farmers must have their own teams of traffic marshals, first-aid teams, and fire fighting equipment. “They are also required to keep Covid-19 guidelines in mind, and ensure no more than five farmers are on one tractor. All of them must wear masks,” said the officer.No firearms or swords are allowed during the tractor rally.Most farmers who are coming to the national capital just for the tractor rally are expected to return to their villages at the end of the event.“But those who were at the protest sites previously will continue to stay,” said Sandhu.While police officers said they hoped the number of tractors won’t exceed 30,000, farmer leaders said there will be over 200,000 vehicles at the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-halts-allowed-during-republic-day-tractor-rally-delhi-police-101611517911309.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Minimum temperature in Delhi to fall from today, pollution to rise: IMD||The maximum temperature in Delhi was six degrees below normal on Sunday, as a dense fog enveloped the Capital the early hours of the day. Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that the city’s minimum temperature would fall from Monday, and a return of cold wave conditions — the third time this season — was likely.According to the IMD, while the minimum temperature at Delhi’s representative Safdarjung observatory was 8.8 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s normal, the maximum temperature did not increase much, and was six degrees below normal. The maximum temperature recorded at the observatory was 15°C.IMD scientists said the low maximum temperature could be attributed to the dense fog cover over Delhi in the early hours of Sunday.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said Sunday felt colder because the fog in the morning had risen further above the ground during the day. This means the fog layer that was closer to the surface in the morning rose higher as the day progressed, but did not clear. This blocked sunlight and did not allow the ground to get warm.“On Sunday, the wind direction has also changed to north-westerly. From Monday, the minimum temperature will start falling and there is a possibility of cold wave-like conditions in many parts later in the week,” Srivastava said.Dense to very dense fog reduced visibility over all of the Indo-Gangetic Plains on Sunday, according to IMD. Scientists said this persisted through the day in many north-western states.“During the early morning, the relative humidity was 100% and cold north-westerly winds were blowing. A combination of the two led to the fog,” said Srivastava.The dense fog also caused the pollution levels to rise in Delhi. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that on Sunday the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi was 364, in the ‘very poor’ zone. On Saturday, the AQI was 326.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) forecast that pollution levels will continue to rise till January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/minimum-temperature-in-delhi-to-fall-from-today-pollution-to-rise-imd-101611517559290.html
25-01-2021||Delhi||Avoid areas around Republic Day parade routes on Jan 26: Traffic police||The city traffic police in an advisory issued on Sunday warned that several routes leading to Rajpath and Vijay Chowk near India would be shut from Monday evening, as the agency stepped up security in the area ahead of Republic Day on Tuesday. The police said these closures would impact traffic movement in and on the outer periphery of Lutyens’ Delhi till Tuesday afternoon.Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Manish Kumar Agrawal said the parade will start from Vijay Chowk at 9.50 am and proceed towards National Stadium, while the tableaux will start at Vijay Chowk and proceed to the Red Fort ground.Agrawal said no traffic will be allowed at Vijay Chowk from 6pm on Monday till the parade is over. Rajpath will also remain out of bounds for the period.“No traffic will be allowed at Rajpath intersection from 11pm on Monday at Rafi Marg, Janpath, and Man Singh Road till the parade is over. C-Hexagon at the India Gate will also be shut for traffic from 5 am on Tuesday till the tableaux crosses Tilak Marg. From 4am on Tuesday, traffic at Tilak Marg, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg and Subhash Marg will not be allowed on either carriageway,” the joint commissioner said.He asked residents to plan their journeys in advance, and avoid the parade and tableaux routes between 4am and 12.30pm on Tuesday.If the journey is unavoidable, Agrawal said commuters are advised to take Ring Road via Ashram Chowk to reach Sarai Kale Khan and I.P. Flyover to Rajghat. From SJ Madarsa, via Lodhi Road T-intersection through Aurobindo Marg, AIIMS chowk one can reach the Ring Road to head towards Dhaula Kuan and reach Mandir Marg via Shankar Road.

25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Poultry sales pick up again in Chandigarh tricity||Chicken and egg sales, which plunged after avian Influenza was confirmed in Panchkula and Dera bassi, are normalising, with prices increasing too, sellers confirm.“With no case of bird flu transmission to humans, people are less paranoid about contracting the disease. Around 80% of our chicken meat and eggs business has normalised,” says Ashish Kumar, president of the Meat Market Association of Sector 21.With increase in demand, prices of poultry products too are going up, albeit slowly, Kumar added. “Prices of broilers, which had fallen to ₹130 per kg, are now back to anything between ₹150 to ₹160 per kg. Wholesale price for eggs, which had fallen too, is now back to ₹450 to ₹460 per 100 eggs.” Supply was steadying too, he added. Other retailers, however, said sales were increasing slowly.Deepak, owner of Chawlas Chicken at Sector 46, said, “sales have started to improve, but we are still struggling with chicken. People seem to have switched over to mutton and fish, for which sales are high. However, it will take some time for chicken sales to improve. Chicken shops in Panchkula and Mohali also reported a slight improvement in sales. “We are selling about 50% of what we used to sell before we were hit by bird flu. The price of broiler chicken has gone up from ₹130 to ₹150 per kg. Price of a tray of 30 eggs, which had gone down to ₹150, is now up again to ₹170,” said Harsimran Bedi, proprietor of Bedi Chicken in Sector 2, Panchkula.Ricky, proprietor of RK Chicken Shop in Mohali’s Phase 5, said “Sales were not affected much in the city even after bird flu was confirmed in Dera Bassi. After a slight dip it’s business as usual for us.”Assuring people that there was no harm in chicken consumption, Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director of the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, said, “We are keeping a strict vigil on poultry birds in and around Chandigarh.

I received my certificate a day after the staff came home to take my documents.”City residents Sandeep, who had applied for a birth certificate, and Bharat Jain, who had applied for a marriage certificate, also appreciated the timely service. Commissioner Parth Gupta said, “We were the first in the state to start such a service and we’ve received an overwhelming response. The service charge is also nominal and doesn’t create a financial burden. Earlier, the applicant had to visit the office twice or thrice to get the certificates physically. Also, due to the pandemic, residents still avoid going to crowded places and this service gives them an option to stay at home.”Mayor Shakti Rani Sharma said that she’ll discuss with the officials and consider that other services related to properties be added to this process soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ambala-mc-s-doorstep-delivery-of-services-a-hit-101611514868162.html

Farmers from the district going to New Delhi to be part of the much-publicised tractor rally on the Republic Day on Tuesday, have planned their travel. Some tractors are carrying 3-4 tractors on its trolley, after erecting a stable platform. In other tractors, water tankers are being ferried for protesters. In many tractors, indigenous solar mobile charging panels were also being carried. Around 20,000 farmers have left for Delhi. Beant Singh, a farmer from Alamgir village in Ludhiana, said this was the prime example of Punjabi ‘Jugaad’ (innovation). “The fuel cost of a trip to Delhi and back is between ₹6,000 and ₹7,000 for a farmer from Amritsar and Hoshiarpur.”Gurpreet Singh, of Malkapur village, was ferrying five tankers, each containing 2,000 litre of potable water in it. He added that potable water was needed as the water available on the borders was hard and tasted bitter.“We had sent packaged drinking water bottles, but it caused pollution. This time, we are taking tankers of potable water. Some volunteers have provided cans for storing water,” Gurpreet added.Surinder Singh, of Amritsar, said farmers who had visited the Singhu border talked about vehicular pollution and rush. “Affluent farmers have come to the aid of marginal farmers as many of them wished to join the tractor rally, but did not have enough cash for fuel. We decided to take such farmers along and ferry their tractor as well. The protest has led to the crash of walls between the rich and the poor farmer,” Surinder added. Beant added, “Our idea to carry tractors on trolleys also leads to fewer vehicles on road, and lower pollution. From four drivers ferrying four tractors separately to reach the same destination, one driver is ferrying three to four tractors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tractor-ferries-tractor-as-farmers-use-jugaad-to-reach-delhi-for-rday-101611514810221.html

The Miyawaki method, pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, aims at planting dozens of native species in the same area which leads to an increase in growth rate and density of the plantation. BMC officials said last year’s project received a good response, as 162,000 Miyawaki trees were planted across 24 locations in the first phase. Following the success of the pilot project, BMC has decided to plant 47 types of Miyawaki trees in the second phase. In a statement issued on Sunday, BMC said, “Most of the trees have reached a height of four-five feet in one year. We’ll undertake the second phase of planting Miyawaki trees considering the fact that the trees planted in Phase 1 have grown tall in a year.”BMC plans to plant Miyawaki trees by identifying dedicated spots to avoid plantation on roads and footpaths, thereby preventing casualties owing to tree fall incidents. The trees will also be planted on the 70-hectare green cover on the coastal road between Princess Street Flyover and Worli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-to-plant-213-000-more-miyawaki-trees-101611514748841.html
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Delay in admissions for professional courses: Students forced to look for options outside Maharashtra||Vaishnavi Chandra, 18, secured 540 out of 720 in her National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) and was sure to secure admission at a private medical institute in Maharashtra. However, with admissions in the state still underway, Chandra was forced to confirm her admission in Karnataka under the all India quota (AIQ) as a backup. Chandra is among a host of students forced to confirm admissions in states outside Maharashtra, despite wanting to study in the state. The reason: an unprecedented delay in admissions to professional courses. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the confusion over the inclusion of a 12% socially and economically backward classes (SEBC) quota, the admissions to professional courses such as medical, law, management, architecture and engineering have been delayed by over three months. In September last year, the Supreme Court (SC) had stayed all recruitment and admissions in education institutes under the SEBC quota for the 2020-21 academic year, with exception to the postgraduate medical admissions. On September 21, the Maharastra government had filed a petition in the Apex court to vacate the stay on admissions, the court, however, had adjourned the hearing by four weeks. On November 24, the state government released a government resolution (GR) clarifying that all admissions, will for the time being be conducted without the inclusion of the SEBC quota, until there’s clarity from SC, on the matter. Although the Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell, which conducts all admissions, has started the process and is releasing merit lists, many students find themselves in a fix after having confirmed their admissions elsewhere. “The AIQ round is conducted by the Central government and once we confirm our seats in the AIQ round, we are also still eligible for admissions under domicile quota in our state institutes. But this time, MBBS admissions in Maharashtra were delayed due to lack of clarity on Maratha quota and I had no choice but to stick to my AIQ seat,” said Chandra. She added that several students are stuck with their AIQ seat in other states, despite having scored well enough to bag a seat in an institute in Maharashtra itself. The CET cell has so far, declared six merit lists. Students, who have confirmed their seats elsewhere, are worried they may have to forego their fees should they choose to cancel their admissions and come back to Maharashtra. Meena S, 19, a resident of Mumbai, who wanted admission in Sir JJ School of Architecture, has now confirmed her admission in an institution in New Delhi, after waiting long enough for admissions in Maharashtra to begin. Two rounds of merit lists have been announced so far and the process is still ongoing. “I wasn’t sure when the admissions in Maharashtra were to begin. I didn’t want to lose a year, so I secured my seat in Delhi under the AIQ. Now I am unsure about the refund from the Delhi institute if I decide to confirm my seat in Maharashtra. Not everyone can afford to forego the fees for an entire semester,” said Meena. For engineering aspirants, so far only two merit lists have been announced. “In other states, colleges have already started their first semesters. I am attending classes online now, but in Maharashtra, the admission process is in its initial leg,” said an engineering aspirant who has confirmed his seat in Rajasthan. CET Cell, however, maintained that the delay in admissions had not affected the students’ decision in the selection of colleges. “I doubt students faced trouble with admissions delay because the response has been better than we expected in certain courses including engineering. We’ve received more applications this year compared to last year,” said C Joshi, commissioner, state CET cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/delay-in-admissions-for-professional-courses-students-forced-to-look-for-options-outside-maharashtra-101611514449034.html
25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: When no one was plagued by FOMO versus JOMO||Change is the only constant in life. Most of us have heard that before and all of us have experienced it for sure. In fact we are forever living it, adapting to it and then just when we think we are in harmony with our environment there it is, challenging us again. “Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal…” Lately I am focusing more and more on the changes that have taken place on the written word and expressions that seem to be the ‘in- thing’. One such expression came my way when I was talking to my daughter- in-law about exiting some chat groups. She asked ‘doesn’t FOMO bother you?’ Now what’s that? Apparently it is a new term used for people who have the fear of missing out on activities taking place in their circle of friends, parties, and any event, social or otherwise, that is likely to be talked about in social circles. Social media has created jealous behavior over illusions. Sadly, some are envious of things, relationships and lifestyles that don’t even exist, whereas earlier in my younger days news did not travel that fast and therefore the reactions were somewhat diluted. Nowadays of course the news is transmitted as it is happening. My generation who are walking the golden path of duties fulfilled, freedom from the social pressures, a generous availability of time and choices galore can enjoy these novel, so called problems, from a distance. The youth today spend as much time photographing selfies as they do enjoying the event. Earlier in my heyday, I would look forward to meeting new people, exchanging news and views about their lives, work and hobbies. Now it’s more important to know who is invited to the party and (more juicier) who’s not; what everyone’s wearing; and pictures that have to be taken to be discussed later. Questions abound: As to why someone was not invited. The responses to this are spiced up with all the required embellishments to evoke discomfort. Every new phrase and situation usually has a brighter side too, the antithesis. So when I heard on a Ted Talk someone mentioning JOMO I felt some relief, almost jubilation. JOMO is the joy of missing out, that gratifying feeling one can get when one can break away from the real and virtual activities and do things one wants to. A recent forward I received which was funny but meaningful said, “You never look as bad as your Aadhaar card and driving license photograph and never as good as you appear on Facebook.” Well that seems true of many things in life too. What we see may not be the true picture of the lives of others and what we do not know is how easy or difficult everyone’s life can be. We need to find a way to create that beautiful balance in our life, and then it can be as interesting as we desire it to be. promildada@yahoo.comThe writer is a freelancer and development guide based in Jalandhar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-when-no-one-was-plagued-by-fomo-versus-jomo-101611514214173.html
25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: To my dear students, from a teacher||As an educator, I experience love for my students. What makes my heart go out to them is that at times I feel these are years of ‘turmoil’ for them. Yet, I also want them to know that this time can be blissful too. That they can work hard and yet create memories that’ll last a lifetime. Life is anyway like a jigsaw puzzle, most of the pieces fit in into the total picture with time, that’s how both hard work and memories will fit in, but, with time, and if in balance. Here, I must narrate how balancing time between studies and relaxation helped me understand and score very well in psychology practicals. Thinking about it transports me to the tutorial rooms and lawns of Lady Shri Ram College… Back during my graduation days (I was pursuing bachelor of arts in psychology Honours), we used to find the practicals quite tough. When I was able to understand a particular topic, I would help my friends get a grasp on it. I used to enjoy doing that since my own concepts would get consolidated. Though my favourite subject was counselling, I secured my highest scores in the practical exam. Those sessions came in handy later in life too, especially during my service as a mental health counsellor. Secondly, it counts to stay connected with roots. Your parents and family members back home might not be as happening and tech-savvy as you and your peers; yet spend time and remain engaged with them. Sometimes, and in other cases, often; they will surprise you with their insight into and solutions offered for your student life challenges. They carry the gift of undiluted love for you. Also, whatever you do, give it your cent percent. Wherever you are, be fully present. A life hack to that is to do what you should be doing, any given moment. If you don’t, then a part of the brain will take you on a guilt trip and the flow or output and quality plus productivity will suffer. For instance, once you are done studying for a decided period of time in a day, rejuvenate; and really, do rejuvenate. Once you are done for the day, sleep after having turmeric-milk, and really, do sleep. One’s heartfelt presence and dedication towards things is bound to take one a long way. Dream! Your parents, teachers, mentors and all other well- wishers want you to dream, and to work towards your dreams. Sometimes, your student life itself will start presenting you with opportunities to start realising your dreams, sometimes you’ll have to wait longer. In any case, do have dreams and desires. They are like the fuel that keeps the vehicle of life going. Lastly, you might constantly be in doubt about the application and real-life utility of your syllabus, yet be sincere towards it. Many a times, later while pursuing one’s career, one realises in retrospect that s/he had applied a particular theory in a unique way. That all the labour filled hours of the study years are working their due magic – guiding one’s line of action. Had one not done justice to those subjects during school and college years, one wouldn’t be actually able to apply them. Remember, we see you as building blocks of the nation, and while everyone harbours hopes and aspirations for you, everyone also wants you to take care of your mind, body and soul, because it’s only then that our real ground level dreams for ourselves and the nation begin to get realised. reemaban@gmail.comThe writer works as an assistant professor (psychology) at Rajiv Gandhi Govt College in Saha (Ambala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-to-my-dear-students-from-a-teacher-101611514212945.html
25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Miracles do happen, that’s how India won the battle against polio||On January 13 this year, India celebrated ten years without polio, the last patient to be diagnosed with the disease on this date in 2011 being two-year-old Rukhsar of Howrah. For her we were too late but after that India was well on its way to achieving the status of a polio free country. In 2012, the government of India and Rotary organised a polio summit at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi and just before the inauguration, Bruce Aylward from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Geneva, came to the dais and announced that India had been removed from the active list of polio endemic countries. On March 26, 2014, India was certified by WHO and declared polio-free. That is the reason why January 13 is a memorable day in the public health history calendar. It was estimated that in 1988, 450 children in India were affected by polio every day. Only 1 out of 200 children who contracted the poliovirus got paralysed. The other 199 went undetected. Experts opined that India would be the last country in the world to eradicate polio (even as late as in 2002), because of its huge cohort of 170 million children below the age of 5, the population density, unsanitary conditions, impure drinking water, and enteric diseases, etc. India’s victory over polio was achieved after a long drawn struggle. From 3,50,000 children affected by Polio in 122 countries of the world in the ’80s, the global partnership of Rotary with WHO, UNICEF, Centre for the Control of Diseases and Prevention (CDC), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and numerous partners except for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the world as of now is free of polio. Rotary has contributed more than $1.7 billion and countless volunteer hours to immunise more than 2.5 billion children in countries worldwide. Rotary’s advocacy efforts have also played a significant role in decisions by donor governments to add more than $7.2 billion to the effort. It all began in 1977 when Sir Clem Renouf who was nominated as president of Rotary International came across an article in the Reader’s Digest about eradication of small pox. That prompted him to look for another health challenge facing the world. After discussions with numerous health agencies, polio was identified as the biggest threat to the children of the world. In 1979, Rotary initiated the polio immunisation campaign with Philippines by acquiring six million doses of OPV (oral polio vaccine) developed by Dr Albert Sabin and immunised the total population of young children in the country. Encouraged, Rotary took up this programme to free the world of this dreaded disease. Despite World Health Assembly in 1988 persuading all nations to join in this fight, no substantive headway was made in India. Late Sudarshan Agarwal, then secretary general of Rajya Sabha and also a senior leader of Rotary, prompted some members of Parliament to ask questions in both houses about why India was lagging in polio eradication while many countries had gone far ahead. Due credit has to go to Dr Harsh Vardhan, currently the Union minister of health and family welfare, for his contribution in changing the direction of the polio movement. It was one single factor that helped India finally reach its eradication goal. Before 1994 the bureaucracy at the government of India level did not believe in the strategy of National Immunisation Day (NID), observed so successfully by other countries including large population areas such as China and Brazil. Dr Harsh Vardhan took the immunisation initiative in Delhi on October 2, 1994, naming it the pulse polio programme. With D-Day approaching, however, the plague endemic popped up in Surat with an all-too-real threat over Delhi. However, Dr Harsh Vardhan was determined to go forth. All Rotarians and other stakeholders assured active participation. Wearing masks the health workers of the Delhi government with the support of Rotarians, reached out to 12 lakh children in a single day to protect them from polio and also the plague. The then newly appointed Union health minister AR Antulay grabbed the opportunity and convened a meeting of all state health ministers where I could make a presentation to them. The result was the adoption of a plan for observing NID. This was the changemaker in the policy. It was also decided that to ensure the success of the programme the Indian government had to be in the driving seat, which was also done. Rotary took up the responsibility of supplying the entire polio vaccine stock and also funding the activities of WHO and UNICEF in the country. India has been very fortunate that irrespective of the party in power, the immunisation efforts continued year after year. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, had problems with minority communities boycotting immunisation due to false rumours. The government encouraged Rotary to develop a connect with these communities. Through notable work conducting free polio corrective surgeries and befriending Ulemas this hurdle too was crossed In August 2020, Nigeria, and all of Africa as a result, were declared polio-free.The only countries with polio cases now are Pakistan and Afghanistan. All efforts are being focused on them and after three years of nil cases the entire world will then be polio free, the second disease to be vanquished after smallpox. Step by step, overcoming hurdles, never losing determination despite setbacks, the Indian government with Rotary and other partners moved forward. Indeed, the last decade has shown that persistence, perseverance and perspiration can move mountains. Victor Hugo, well known poet and novelist rightly said, “Perseverance, secret of all triumphs”.

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra rights body did not hear a single case in 2020: RTI response||On January 9, 2021, 10 premature babies died at the neonatal care unit of District General Hospital in Bhandara after a fire broke out in the hospital. On January 18, 2021, five persons, including two teachers, were booked for gang-raping a minor student in Nanded district of Marathwada region in Maharashtra. During the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, a large number of cases of harassment, child abuse and the violation of child rights like those mentioned above were reported across the state of Maharashtra. However, the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MSCPCR), which is a body entrusted with the responsibility of taking cognisance of such cases, did not hear a single complaint in 2020, a response to a Right to Information (RTI) query showed. In a response to an RTI query filed by HT, state’s child rights commission has stated that in 2020, a total of 134 cases were filed with the commission. However, not a single hearing took place that year, leading to a 100% pendency rate as far as action against these cases is concerned.MSCPCR is a quasi-judicial body that hears complaints with respect to child abuse, cases of harassment of children and those pertaining to violation of their rights. Between 2018 and 2020, a total of 416 cases came to the commission, of which 164 cases (nearly 40% were disposed of). The RTI response also revealed that six of the 12 or 50% of the permanent posts in the commission were lying vacant as of January 2021. Over the past few years, parents and education activists have been complaining about the lackadaisical approach of the commission in addressing their complaints. The commission consists of a chairperson and six members who are in charge of hearing the complaints. Every hearing requires a quorum of at least two members. The committee has a tenure of three years unless it is extended further. In June 2020, as the tenure of the previous committee was over, the state government did not appoint new members which in turn led to piling up of complaints. Anubha Sahai, president of Indiawide Parents Association, said complaints sent to the commission remained unaddressed due to the government’s apathy. “During the entire lockdown period, several schools harassed students for non-payment of fees by removing them from online classes and not conducting their exams among other things. None of these complaints got a hearing due to the commission’s current state,” she added. Sahai has recently written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) urging it to look into the matter. NCPCR recently took cognisance of the Bhandara incident and asked the district collector to send a report within two days of the incident. Queries sent to state women and child developement minister Yashomati Thakur went unanswered. Uday Jadhav, secretary, MSCPCR, said, “We have requested the state to form the committee at the earliest and it shall be done soon. Since there is no committee at the moment, hearings cannot take place in the absence of a quorum.” Pravin Ghuge, former chairperson of the commission whose tenure ended in June 2020, said the commission’s role is relevant especially now when several cases need its attention. “During the initial months of the lockdown, we worked towards three kinds of children — those living in orphanages, runaway children and those not looked after by their biological parents. We conducted workshops and sensitisation programmes wherein a lot of cases of violations were also found and action was taken in these matters. However, since the tenure of the committee ended in June, the government has not appointed a new committee. Hence issues like the Bhandara incident and other such incidents in the state have not been looked into,” he added. In January 2019, Prasad Tulaskar, a city-based parent, had filed an RTI application to get details about the working of the commission after his complaint filed in 2016 had still not progressed. It had revealed that from 2015 to 2018, the commission had disposed of only 33 of the 280 cases it received during these years. As per the commission’s website, it passed only five orders in 2017-18 as opposed to 90 orders in 2015. “The committee has become a toothless body. Every time we enquire, we are told that appointments are pending. The last hearing of my case took place in 2018 and I have not heard about it since,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-rights-body-did-not-hear-a-single-case-in-2020-rti-response-101611514148788.html

There is no case of bird flu in poultry farms across the state so far. We are taking all precautions with regular sanitisation and testing.”Meanwhile, a press release issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) through the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying on Friday mentioned, “Till January 22, 2021, outbreaks of Avian Influenza (Bird flu) have been confirmed in nine states (Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab) for poultry birds…. Avian Influenza has been confirmed in poultry samples from Almora (RK Pura, Hawalbagh) district of Uttarakhand…”However, officials from the state animal husbandry department said that there is some confusion with the results and that no poultry animal in the state has tested positive for bird flu.Also read: Covid vaccine tracker - How many are inoculated in India and the world“As part of regular monitoring, we had sent samples of poultry from RK Puram and Hawal Bagh for testing in mid-December, the results of which have now come out to be positive. This could be a false positive report as none of the poultry have shown any symptoms, neither has there been any mortality. We have sent a report on this to the state animal husbandry department which is in talks with the Centre regarding the matter,” added Dr Chandra.Dr BC Karnatak, additional director of Kumaon division for animal husbandry department, said that regular samples are being collected from different poultry farms across the region and being tested at two centres - Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar district and Hawalbagh in Almora.“We are looking into the matter of samples testing positive for Avian influenza from Almora, as the samples were sent around December 15, when there was no case of bird flu. The type of sample which has tested positive is not always a strong indicator of bird flu. As of now, there is no case of bird flu in poultry farms in the state,” said Dr Karnatak.So far, deaths of hens have been reported from poultry farms in Udham Singh Nagar and Tehri Garhwal districts.

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: How to pick the right health insurance||The unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic revealed for many of us just how unprepared we were to pay hospital bills. Post the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, demand for health insurance policies has gone up. Here’s a guide on what to keep in mind before you pick up one that suits your needs.How’s the health? There are many kinds of health insurance plans in the market. Currently, health insurance companies offer two kinds of plans: indemnity and benefit-based. Those with indemnity plans are reimbursed the amount spent on hospital bills while those with benefit-based plans are compensated with the predetermined lump sum amount irrespective of the actual expenses incurred. Indemnity plans are available as individual health insurance policies or family floater plans while the critical illness covers available are categorised as benefit-based plans. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com, an online market place for financial products said, “Indemnity plans and fixed benefit plans fulfil two different requirements. Fixed benefit plans are necessary if one wishes to get specific coverage for a defined illness, while indemnity plans are aimed at minimizing the financial burden of hospitalization arising from any kind of medical exigency.” If you have a high risk of specific ailments in the family, it might be better for you to get a fixed benefit plan as well as an indemnity insurance plan for a comprehensive health cover. “Balancing between both indemnity and defined benefit plans also ensures that any expenses towards pre or post-hospitalization are also covered and health insurance does not remain limited to hospitalization expenses alone,” Shetty said.Check for sub-limitsAn essential feature of indemnity health plans is the sub-limits embedded within the plan. This means that you have to foot a portion of the hospital bills on discharge. This is because in plans with sub-limits, the added charges including doctor fees, nursing charges, ICU charges, etc. are linked to the room rent. In most cases, hospital expenses and room rent are limited to 1% of the total coverage. Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra.com, a financial services company said, “The sub-limits on health insurance plans are the capping on the total claim for specific diseases and medical treatments. Before signing up for medical insurance, it is recommended to check applicable sub-limits. Always opt for a comprehensive health insurance plan for max coverage flexibility and convenience in the long term, though it can be a bit costly and will attract additional premium.”Note the waiting periodHealth insurance plans cover the treatment expenses of unforeseen health problems or diseases. This explains why insurance companies do not cover diseases from the first day of buying the policy as existing ailments are not covered. The expenses on treatment of pre-existing diseases will be covered only post completion of the waiting period. The current insurance regulations mandate a waiting period of four years though some companies limit it to two or three years. The concept of waiting period is alike in both indemnity and benefit based health plans.Find out about co-payment clauseSenior citizens often find the co-payment clause embedded in the health plans they buy. This clause mandates the policyholder to bear a part of the hospital expenses while the rest is paid off by the insurance company. In most cases, insurance companies insert co-payment up to 20% of the hospital bills paid. Rakesh Jain, executive director and CEO, Reliance General Insurance, a private insurance company said, “Co-payment in any insurance claims is sharing of risk, higher the co-payment, higher the insurance company will provide a discount on the premium to customer.”Choose coverage amountNo fixed rule determines health insurance coverage. However, depending on your family’s medical history, your residential city, and the hospitals in your proximity, you may decide the coverage amount. Since medical expenses are increasing, it makes sense to seek adequate coverage to pay off the entire medical costs.Elderly people find it difficult to buy health insurance plans of their choice. This is because many policies have an entry age limitation which bars the aged from buying them. However, those paying for health plans before they turn 60 years are relieved from the burden of co-payment for the entire tenure. Though family floaters covering your entire family including parents are relatively inexpensive, it makes sense to buy a separate health insurance cover for parents to ensure increased coverage. However, health insurance premium increases with age, which is why the old have to spend more on health insurance premiums than their younger counterparts.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-how-to-pick-the-right-health-insurance-101611513908740.html

25-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra farmers reach Mumbai to protest at Azad Maidan||Travelling for more than 200km over the past two days, thousands of farmers from across Maharashtra reached Mumbai on Sunday evening for an agitation against the contentious three farm laws and in solidarity with farmers protesting at the Delhi borders. The farmers have announced a morcha to Raj Bhavan after a public meeting at Azad Maidan on Monday. Ruling parties – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – and other political parties, including Aam Aadmi Party and communist parties, have announced their support to the agitation. Key leaders namely NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat are likely to join the sit-in protest at Azad Maidan on Monday. This is a part of agitation being undertaken under the banner of Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM), which aims to intensify the farmers’ struggle in capital cities across all the states. Many social and political outfits and labour unions have joined hands under SSKM to support the protest. The farmers who started their vehicle march from Nashik on Saturday and took a break at Igatpuri at night had to face many traffic jams to reach Azad Maidan in Mumbai. According to the organisers, farmers from as many as 21 districts have joined the march from Nashik. Many even walked down the Eastern Express Highway to reach Azad Maidan. Although the SSKM has announced its morcha from Azad Maidan to Raj Bhavan on Monday, the police department is unlikely to allow them to step them out of Azad Maidan to march towards Raj Bhavan. After the morcha, the organisers have planned to hand over the memorandum demanding the repeal of these laws to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “Our main demand is to completely repeal these farm laws and enact a law guaranteeing Minimum Support Prices (MSP) across the country along with the withdrawal of Electricity amendment bill,” said Ashok Dhawale, convenor, SSKM. He said the agitation will conclude with the hoisting of the national flag on January 26. “We are not giving permissions as it is Covid-19 period,” said senior police official of the Azad Maidan police station who declined to come on record. There are indications that rally will be allowed till Metro Cinema only. The police have stepped up security at Azad Maidan. “We will deploy extra support in the form of 100 officers and 500 police constables who will be present to maintain the law and order situation. Nine platoons of SRPF have been provided and drones will keep a watch,” said Mumbai spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police S Chaitanya. In Thane, the Shiv Sena unit led by state urban development minister and leader Eknath Shinde organised refreshments and medical check-ups for farmers. Sikh community has organised a langar for the farmers for all three days at Azad Maidan. Ajit Nawale, convenor, SSKM, said the proposed morcha was a message to the Central government. “This will be the message to the Central Government that urban population has joined hands with the farmers to oppose the laws and they need to withdraw it,” said Nawale. He said even after January 26, the agitation will continue. “We will decide on the future of the agitation and will agitate till our demands are met.” Rajesh Pinjarkar, who owns three acres in Chandrapur, called it a conspiracy. “We might get good price in the beginning but after that they will take over our land and make us contract workers there,” said Pinjarkar. Leelatai Valvi, who travelled from Nandurbar for 17 hours to come to Mumbai, said the whole aim of these laws was to enslave them. “These are black laws meant to snatch our livelihood and hand over our land to multinational companies,” said Valvi. Recently, labour unions marched in south Mumbai and held a rally in Azad Maidan in favour of the farmers. Prominent farmer leader Raju Shetti and social activist Medha Patkar had addressed the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-farmers-reach-mumbai-to-protest-at-azad-maidan-101611513430185.html
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC aims to give Covid vaccine to 9,500 healthcare workers daily this week||Starting Monday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) aims to double the number of healthcare workers (HCW) who will be inoculated daily to 9,500 by setting up 65 centres. Also, vaccination will be carried out five days a week, between Monday and Saturday, instead of the current four. However, as an exception, the vaccination drive will not be held on Tuesday, Republic Day. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “We will conduct vaccination five days a week from this week. On Monday, 65 centres will be set up for vaccinating 9,500 HCW.s, we expect the daily vaccination figures to go up. On Monday, fewer HCWs might get vaccinated, as it is a day between weekend and public holiday on Tuesday.” From January 16 to 23, the BMC has vaccinated 13,365 HCWs. The turnout for the first three days was around 50%, however, on Friday and Saturday, the turnout went up to around 90%. This as the BMC allowed walk-in vaccination for HCWs without any prior appointments. Meanwhile, the current maximum capacity of the BMC is to vaccinate around 15,000 citizens daily and it will be augmented to 50,000 daily in few weeks. However, according to BMC officials, the number can go up to 1 lakh citizens being vaccinated daily once private players are allowed to hold vaccination camps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-aims-to-give-covid-vaccine-to-9-500-healthcare-workers-daily-this-week-101611513428879.html
25-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra ups Covid-19 vaccination centres to 511, drive to be 5 days a week||The Maharashtra government has decided to increase its Covid-19 vaccination centres from 290 to 511 and to hold the drive five days a week, instead of four, In view of its “adequate” stock of vaccine doses to inoculate 800,000 health workers and the improvement in response.After the initial hesitancy, the turnout for vaccination had improved to 83.73% on Saturday, the fifth day of the vaccination drive as nine districts reported more than 100% turnout. The state has now decided to ramp up the number of centres to the number planned initially, with a target of 50,000 vaccinations daily. The state will complete its 100,000 mark of beneficiaries on Monday after having completed inoculation of 99,242 health workers. It has targeted to complete first doses of all health workers in the next four weeks.“We have more than 1.8 million doses ready to cover all enrolled health workers with two shots. We have targeted to operate 511 centres after Centre allowed us to increase the number, and have activated more than 400 centres till Sunday evening. The number of centres is expected to be increased till Monday morning. Except Tuesdays and Sundays, the drive will be undertaken five days a week now on. We have allowed health workers to walk in for vaccination with vaccinators allowed to add beneficiaries out of the turn,” said Dr Archana Patil, director, state health services. On day 1 [January 16] of the drive, there were 285 centres.Dr Patil said that although actual deadline for the completion of the first dose to all health workers is not set, they want to complete it at the earliest.Another official from the department said that the Centre has also allowed increasing the strength of teams by one member each. “To weed out the difficulty in communication to the beneficiaries due to the glitches in CoWin app, the team of vaccinators has been allowed to contact beneficiaries personally to inform them about their turn. The beneficiaries, who did not turn up during their original schedule, are being adjusted in the subsequent session. At the centres with the good response, additional sessions are being held to complete registered health workers at the earliest.The enrolment of the frontline workers for the inoculation is expected to be completed in next two days. Their actual inoculation is, however, expected to begin only after HCWs complete their first dose and an additional stock of vaccine for them is allotted by the Centre.During the first five days of the vaccination, the response from HCWs went on increasing gradually. From 64% on day 1 on January 16, the percentage improved to 83.73% on Saturday. Backward districts with low human development index registered high response to inoculation. Hingoli (104%),Jalana (113%), Beed (111%), Gadchiroli (136%), Gondiya (143%), Wardha (119%) topped in the number of beneficiaries on Saturday. Meanwhile, the state reported 2,752 new infections and 45 deaths, taking the tally to 2,009,106 and toll to 50,785 on Sunday. Mumbai clocked 479 new cases, taking the tally to 306,050 and seven deaths to push the toll to 11,304. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.53%, although the weekly CFR has fallen to 1.89% over last week.Following Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Nashik, the other three cities with high number of cases reported 222, 253 and 105 cases on Sunday.

Terming caste-based census inevitable, the BJP leader tweeted a video clip of a 2010 speech in Lok Sabha by her father Gopinath Munde, in which the late Union minister had demanded caste-based survey to provide “equal opportunities” to OBCs. Her tweet raised some eyebrows as the Narendra Modi government in the Centre has already denied the same demand made by the state government. “We are the citizens of the India, and our census should be conducted … OBCs caste-based enumeration is necessary and inevitable… 2021 census should be caste-based. There’s no doubt that the voice raised in villages will reach the Capital without fail,” her tweet in Hindi stated. Last January, Maharashtra legislature had passed a resolution, unanimously demanding caste-based survey for the 2021 census. However, the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India informed the legislature that caste-based survey was not possible. “As per the central list, the total number of OBCs in India is 6,285, while the numbers go up to 7,200 if the lists prepared by states and union territories are taken into account. As people use their clan, gotra, sub-castes and caste names interchangeably and due to the phonetic similarities in the names, it may lead to misclassification of castes. It, hence, will be difficult to meaningfully tabulate and classify caste returns,” the letter by the commissioner had stated. Chandrakant Bavkar, president, OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, said the group has been pressing their demand for caste-based census, as it will clear the scenario of backwardness among communities under various categories. “After Marathas were given reservation, there has been a rising dispute between communities. We also contest the state backward class commission’s survey – based on which the Maratha community was given reservation – as no scientific method was adopted for it. There has been no caste-based survey conducted after 1931, leading to the anomalies about the backwardness of the communities given reservation in various categories. If the Centre is not conceding to the demand, the Maharashtra government should go for caste-based census at state level on the lines of the surveys conducted in other states such as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/castebased-census-inevitable-bjp-national-secretary-pankaja-munde-101611513248829.html
25-01-2021||Other||Mumbai civic body yet to receive ₹20-K crore property tax; top 50 defaulters owe ₹1,600cr||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is yet to receive property tax worth Rs20,000 crore from defaulters, of which the top 50 defaulters owe the civic body Rs1,650 crore.After the octroi was repealed, property tax became the biggest source of income for BMC, followed by the premium paid by real estate developers. The highest defaulter is a commercial building at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), which is yet to pay Rs164.92 crore. In the ongoing financial year, BMC has been able to collect only a little over Rs1,000 crore against its Rs6,500-crore target, owing to Covid-19 lockdown. Of the top 50 defaulters, 15 others are major real estate developers, while 20 are state and central government agencies, including the lessee appointed by the Maharashtra government. Government agencies such as the Maharashtra Housing Area and Development Authority (Mhada), owes over Rs54 crore to BMC. The chief officer of Mhada’s Mumbai board, Yogesh Mhase, had not replied to queries on the matter till the time of going to press.Mumbai International Airport has an outstanding of Rs25.59 crore. An official from the airport said, “The amount is disputed for genuine reasons, and based on the final outcome of the reconciliation, we will do the needful.” BMC has maintained that it has sent repeated reminders, and also plans to conduct an auction, in case property tax defaulters fail to pay their dues. Joint municipal commissioner Sunil Dhamne said, “We are undertaking the process of property tax collection, and this year we have collected over Rs1,000 crore. Due action will be taken against defaulters who fail to respond despite repeated reminders. However, for cases where the outstanding is disputed or pending in the court, we will wait for the final outcome.” In January 2020, two months before the Covid-19 outbreak, BMC had launched a drive for collection of property tax, in which properties of 3,564 defaulters were attached, while 262 defaulters lost their water connection. Slamming the civic body, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in BMC Ravi Raja said, “Real estate developers form the majority of defaulters who have been recently given incentives in premiums. Why should they have any outstanding after taking such benefits from BMC? The corporation must take strict action against private players. In the case of government agencies, I am hoping that the tax money will come to BMC.” Meanwhile, from last week, BMC started sending property tax bills to properties smaller than 500 square feet (sq ft). This was done four years after the Shiv Sena, which heads BMC, promised voters in 2017 corporation polls that it would waive property tax of structures up to 500 sq ft on coming to power. BMC said it is sending bills with a partial waiver, citing only general tax components out of the total seven components have been waived off by the state government. Interestingly, the Sena heads the alliance government in the state too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-yet-to-receive-20-k-crore-property-tax-top-50-defaulters-owe-1600cr-101611512708882.html
25-01-2021||Chandigarh||Fresh trouble for Tribune flyover project as Chandigarh urban planning dept says it didn’t give approval||The controversial Tribune flyover project has run into fresh trouble, with the Chandigarh urban planning department shooting off a letter to the engineering department, categorically stating that the project does not have its requisite “approval/concurrence”.The letter comes in a rebuttal to the claims made by the technical committee, set up by the UT adviser on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court to look into project alternatives, in the minutes of its meeting.The committee includes the UT chief engineer and chief architect besides chief engineers from Punjab and Haryana. The minutes were prepared by the engineering department. The meeting was held in compliance with HC directions to deliberate upon various issues raised in a representation against the construction of proposed flyover, rotary and underpass at the busy Tribune Chowk.The letter comes in the backdrop of the technical committee rejecting all the flyover alternatives, and the UT administration deciding to go ahead with the original proposal. The administration is yet to submit the technical committee report in the HC. It is likely to be discussed in the administrator’s advisory council meeting scheduled on February 10.Currently, the ₹183-crore project is in limbo. Even though the contractor was finalised, the construction couldn’t begin. In November 2019, the HC, while staying the removal of trees for the project’s construction, had asked the UT adviser to seek public views on its alternatives. The adviser, thereafter, constituted the technical committee.‘Make necessary corrections’To the committee’s claim that the proposal has been approved with the concurrence of the urban planning department, the letter states: “As per the office record (UT chief architect) no such formal approval/concurrence has been conveyed by the department of urban planning.”Cornering the engineering department on its claims in the minutes of the committee meeting, the urban planning department questions: “However, if any such concurrence is available with you, it may be send to this office (UT chief architect) for information and further necessary action.”Since the inception of the project, the urban planning department has raised several questions over its worthiness. However, in the minutes, the committee contends: “The objection/suggestions of department of urban planning have been duly considered and addressed.” Objecting these claims, the department has asked the engineering department to “make necessary corrections” in the minutes.‘In violation of Master Plan’The urban planning department has also refuted the committee’s claims that the project does not violate the Chandigarh Master Plan (CMP) 2031.Minutes of the committee’s meeting read: “As such there is no violation of Master Plan and also appropriate action will be initiated by the department of urban planning for making necessary amendments in the master plan, if necessary.”Asking the committee to correct it, the department has stated, “As per the notified CMP 2031, overbridges/flyovers are not recommended to be constructed in the entire city due to heritage considerations, since they impact the visual city space and cause inconvenience to non-motorised vehicles and pedestrians. Proposal of flyover in the city is also not as per the original concept of planning of Chandigarh and it will have impact on the entire city.”It also reminded the engineering department about its earlier suggestion: “Proposal of Tribune flyover should also be taken up with the consultant concerned with respect to comprehensive mobility plan of the city.”As per the engineering department, the project has been approved by the ministry of road, transport and highways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fresh-trouble-for-tribune-flyover-project-as-chandigarh-urban-planning-dept-says-it-didn-t-give-approval-101611512408926.html
