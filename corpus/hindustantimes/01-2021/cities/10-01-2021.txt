10-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena starts campaign to woo Gujarati community ahead of 2022 BMC polls||The Shiv Sena on Sunday began its campaign “Mumbai ma jalebi fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda”, wooing Gujarati voters ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections slated to be held in January-February 2022.The function, held at Andheri, was attended by 100 Gujarati community members and was used to attack the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for giving the community step-motherly treatment. Traditionally, Gujaratis and Marwaris are BJP voters and are now playing a decisive role in Mumbai’s electoral politics.Shiv Sena leader Hemraj Shah, the brain behind the campaign, said that it was time to give a chance to the Shiv Sena. “Early, we [Gujarati community] voted for the Congress and then the BJP, but both failed to give justice to the Gujarati community. The new Sena leadership under chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is a progressive one and is doing a lot of work for the people. We are asking for just one chance. The BJP’s steps like demonetisation and GST (goods and service tax) have broken the back of our businesses. We see the Sena as a hope to revive our business,” he said.None of the major Shiv Sena leaders attended the function. Shah said that the program was not meant to be held on a large scale and therefore they had invited only 100 community members. He said that the large-scale event with key Sena leaders would be organised at a later stage.The Sena also used the event to induct 10 industrialists and builders into the party, apart from scores of businessmen.Builder Kalpesh Mehta, managing director, Pramukh Developers Private Limited, said that he joined the Sena as its government cut premiums in the real estate sector. “Uddhav Thackeray has done a good job to boost the realty sector as it was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Mehta. He said his party membership would provide him with a platform to interact with the government.The BJP, however, denied giving any step-motherly treatment to the community. “I have been a BJP corporator six times, and the BJP even made me a deputy mayor. The community is solidly behind us,” said BJP leader Ram Barot, a prominent Gujarati who was the former Mumbai deputy mayor.Traditionally, the Sena does not share a good rapport with the Gujarati community as it was seen as only representing the “Marathi Manoos”. However, the current leadership under Thackeray has been shedding this image to make it an all-inclusive outfit. Thackeray’s son Aaditya, a state minister, erected hoardings in Gujarati during his campaign in the 2019 Assembly polls, which he fought from the Worli constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-starts-campaign-to-woo-gujarati-community-ahead-of-2022-bmc-polls-101610303010161.html

The police said that they are investigating the case as the complainant has some property dispute. Naveen Bhati, the complainant who is a resident of Shahadra village in Noida Sector 141, runs a private school in the neighbourhood. Bhati said that he received the call at 7.55pm on January 7. “The caller started abusing me without any provocation as soon as I received the call,” he said. “Be ready...after three days I will kill you...I am calling from a jail. You have only three days. You can meet people you like and eat whatever you want in three days,” the caller allegedly told him. An audio of the phone call is also in the public domain, the police said. A case was registered on January 8 against an unknown person under sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of IPC at Surajpur police station. When contacted, Bhati said, “I have a property dispute with some local people in the neighbourhood over two acres of land. I recently planned to fence the plot and some people objected to it. I suspect they have hired the killer to eliminate me,” he said. The Surajpur police have launched an investigation into the matter. Dilip Kumar Singh, in-charge of Surajpur police station, said, “We are investigating the matter and prima facie it appears the caller faked that he was calling from the jail.

The authority has also ordered for a shutdown of the factory, as making single use plastic glasses is prohibited in the city, said officials.“We conducted a raid at the factory premises and saw the manufacturing activity being carried out live. The production of the banned single use plastic glasses was underway in the building. As per the rules, we imposed a penalty of ₹25,000 against the factory owner.

We will continue to randomly inspect factories.”The authority conducts random inspections at units manufacturing such items illegally, besides acting on tip-offs, said officials.The crackdown against single use plastics was begun on September 11, 2019. Officials have appealed to the general public to come forward to help them implement the ban on single-use plastics, which choke sewers and drains and also cause harm to the ecology.Since September 11, 2019, the authority has imposed a total of ₹40 lakh as penalty against different agencies for violating rules, said officials.“Initially we focused more on awareness in the general public and vendors, who use single-use plastic items such as carry bags, glasses or other products.

It is a serious matter, and all parents and guardians must be warned to not use any irrelevant content in the WhatsApp groups of classes created for the purpose of online classes and must be directed to take more precautions to avoid any legal action.”“In case of any repetition, FIR must be lodged against the erring person without any delay,” it added.An official at the north civic body said, “The order was issued after receiving similar complaints from several schools. No one can harass teachers in this manner. The young students in the group will also read the messages, which can possibly create an unfavourable impact.”To be sure, officials said it was not immediately clear whether these messages were sent by parents, students, or a third party. However, these messages were received from the official registered mobile number, which is why parents were warned, officials of the civic body said.The principal of a civic body-run school in Jahangirpuri, requesting anonymity, said, “We had received an objectionable video clip in a class 5 WhatsApp group last month. The clip was sent from a student’s registered number. We summoned the students’ parents, but they denied sending the message. Our teachers regularly send messages on the groups requesting parents not to share anything on the group other than any queries related to online classes. Now, we have shared this order issued by the education department.”Ramnivas Solanki, general secretary of civic body teachers’ association, said, “A female teacher in our school had received an objectionable picture from a registered mobile number recently. When we summoned the parents, they claimed that a neighbour had sent the message. It’s good that the department has sent out such an official order in this regard. Principals will now directly file a police complaint in case anything like this happens.”North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said, “The corporation will take serious action against those found responsible for sending such obscene messages on WhatsApp groups meant for study material to be shared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/obscene-posts-in-class-whatsapp-groups-may-lead-to-fir-against-parents-north-mcd-warns-101610301990583.html

North MCD officials say the plan, which was proposed in the civic body’s budget for 2021-22, will help bring in additional revenue for the civic body. The corporation is going through a financial crunch, forcing it to withhold salaries of its staff. According to the plan, the North corporation will build nearly 17 multilevel parking lots and three stack facilities across several areas under its jurisdiction. Currently, the North corporation runs 130 parking lots. The new multilevel parking lots are proposed to come up at 17 locations. These are Shivamarket in Pitampura (500 cars), Gandhi Maidan (2,338 cars), Qutub Road (174 cars), Sant Nagar in Rani Bagh (600 cars), Idgah Road (3150 cars), Shastri Park (577 cars), Rajendra Nagar (464 cars), U&V-block, Shalimar Bagh (288 cars), AC Block, Shalimar Bagh (350 cars), Bank Street in Karol Bagh (500 cars), Madipur (580 cars), Udyog Nagar (470 cars), Punjabi Bagh (324 cars), Nangloi (1000 cars), Mundka Metro Station (1,000 cars), RG Complex Paharganj (350 cars) and Pratap Nagar (250 cars). Stack parking lots for a total of 291 cars will come up at Nigambodh Ghat, Salim Garh near Hanuman Setu and Bagh Diwar at Fatehpuri. “Work on most of the major projects have started. At some places, construction has begun while some are in planning and tendering stage. Parking facilities at Nigambodh Ghat and Fatehpuri are likely to be opened in the beginning of next financial year while multilevel lots at Shivamarket in Pitampura, Qutub Road near Sadar and Gandhi Maidan near Chandni Chowk are likely to be made operational by the end of next year,” a senior official of the north corporation said on the condition of anonymity. He said that construction work on multilevel parking at Shivamarket, Qutub Road and Gandhi Maidan is already underway while bidding process for facilities at Sant Nagar in Rani Bagh, Shatri Park and Rajendra Nagar is likely to be started next week. Parking at Idgah Road and Mundka will be developed in collaboration with the Delhi Metro. He said that a memorandum of understanding has already been signed with the Delhi Metro for Idgah Road parking. The official further said that all the multilevel parking facilities will be at least six floors high, including basement. Officials said these parking spaces will also help in reducing traffic bottleneck in different areas. “Paharganj has featured on the traffic department’s list of most clogged areas. During our study we found out that the area is prone to traffic logjams because of haphazardly parked vehicles near RG Complex in Paharganj. We worked out a solution that a multilevel parking should be constructed to accommodate over 350 cars which spill over nearby roads. Approval from the House has been given for this project and we will soon start the process to acquire a piece of land from the DDA (Delhi Development Authority). The project will be completed in two years,” another official privy to the development, said. Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, said these remunerative projects will not only solve parking and traffic congestion problems but also help the civic body in generating revenue. He said the modalities of several of these projects are yet to be worked out but some of these are likely to be carried out on the basis of public private partnership. “All of these parking facilities will be made operational in next two to three years. This will help great deal in solving parking menace and traffic issues. We are also hoping to generate more annual revenue from such remunerative projects. We will also look for more new sites where multilevel, stack or surface parking sites can be developed,” Prakash said.KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MDD, said these are much needed initiatives and such projects will financially help the cash-strapped civic body.“This is the right approach as these projects will not only give a solution to the parking menace in congested areas like Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh but also help the municipality in augmenting their revenue collection. These projects can be developed on PPP mode and I suggest that the government should also support such initiatives,” he said.Mehra also suggested that the civic body should also implement dynamic parking charges — charge extra during peak hours near markets — not only to streamline parking problems but also to earn more revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/north-mcd-to-create-parking-slots-for-13000-cars-101610301989545.html

Officials said that so far no signs have been seen of avian influenza in the city or zone’s wetlands. “So far we have not seen any sign or symptom of bird flu or came across any dead water bird with unusual symptoms in the city or zone. We are vigilant and Sunday’s inspection at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary is part of the procedure. We are also vigilant with respect to small ponds and lakes in interiors or remote areas, especially those under the jurisdiction of the state forest department. As of now, vigilance is the best we can do to keep our wetlands safe,” said G Prasad, conservator (forests), Meerut circle.He added that limited staff and manpower poses a challenge, however, they are coordinating with other departments. “The only challenge was a little shortage of staff, however, we are coordinating with other departments like animal husbandry and district administrations,” added Prasad. The divisional forest department of Gautam Budh Nagar said that the inspection drive is being held at other wetlands too as a precautionary measure.“We have formed 20 rapid response teams (RRT) to inspect different areas such as Jewar, Bisrakh, Dankaur and Dadri. Each RRT has two officials from the forest department and one from animal husbandry. These teams will coordinate with three range forest officers. The teams will have to check for symptoms among birds, and mark all big and small waterbodies where migratory birds flock to,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO), GB Nagar. He added that under the protocol, if any dead bird is found it is to be approached by officials wearing PPE kits and the carcass will be sent for testing at the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal. The divisional forest department, Gautam Budh Nagar had last week restricted access to certain areas of Okhla Bird Sanctuary and closed the Surajpur wetland for visitors as a preventive measure. The forest department had also issued a warning, urging people and birders to be cautious around wetlands and to report any unusual bird deaths or symptoms, including tremors, diarrhoea, head tilt and paralysis. “Please don’t touch any sick or dying bird. Keep pets away from them and wash footwear after visiting any water-bird sites like ponds and lakes. Please report any dead or diseased wild waterfowl at 9412492985,” said Srivastava. So far, the city has not seen a single case of bird flu, however, as a preventive measure, a district-level task force, in addition to the RRT, has been set up in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-forest-officials-inspect-okhla-bird-sanctuary-for-signs-of-bird-flu-101610301989200.html

Farmers have been protesting since November 28 at UP Gate and the gathering has now swelled to an estimated 10,000-15,000 people. The wrestlers had come from different states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi. “It was a first of a kind experience to hold such an event on an expressway. I retired from the Border Security Force in July and came here with my wrestler friends to support the farmers. We decided that we should hold such an event here and took permission from the farmers’ committee here. They welcomed the move and made arrangements,” said Padam Singh Rathi, who is an athlete and came from Meerut. About 30 bouts of wrestling, including six rounds for women wrestlers, were carried out. “It was freestyle wrestling to encourage young wrestlers and also to show our support to the farmers. A number of ‘akhadas’ (wrestlers’ clubs) participated in the event. The crowd was cheering for the wrestlers and the venue became overcrowded as everyone wanted to have a look. The wrestlers were awarded medals and trophies at the end of the event,” Singh added. Seventeen-year-old Waseem Khan also took part in the event. “It was very encouraging to wrestle amid hundreds of people who were cheering us. Due to the lockdown, I was unable to participate in any major wrestling event so I came here. It encouraged the athletes and we also showed our support to farmers who are carrying on their protest here at UP Gate,” Khan, a resident of Shalimar Garden in Ghaziabad, said. The farmers in the past week had been battling adverse conditions such as rain and winter chill but the events on Sunday under a bright morning sun brought a smile to their faces.Meanwhile, a group of bikers also came to the UP Gate site to support and express solidarity with the farmers. The motorcyclists said that they came from different parts south and east Delhi. A majority of them were riding Royal Enfield motorcycles.“Our group has about 70 bikers, who came to UP Gate on Sunday to lend support to the farmers. We also brought various daily use items as part of ‘sewa’ for the farmers. We often go to other sites at Tikri and Singhu borders. The farmers had taken out a tractor rally, so we also carried out a bike rally to support them,” said Jasmit Singh, one of the bikers who is from Govindpuri in Delhi. The farmers’ leaders said that the wrestling event was held to encourage youngsters and also to maintain an active atmosphere at the protest site.“Our protests are going on in a peaceful manner and bikers also came to show their support. The wrestling event was held to motivate youngsters and also to indulge in a new activity to keep the momentum going. Many younger wrestlers, including women wrestlers, participated and we thank all of them that they performed in the winter chill on the open road. Farmers encouraged them throughout the five hour-long event,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wrestling-matches-bike-rally-brighten-weekend-for-protesting-farmers-at-up-gate-101610301930280.html

The Palam observatory also recorded ‘cold day’ conditions, as maximum temperatures also dropped significantly below normal on Sunday. The station recorded a maximum temperature of 14.2°C, six below normal, while Safdarjung recorded 16.2°C, four below normal.Due to the prevalence of dry north or northwesterly winds over most parts of northwest India, the minimum temperature is likely to fall gradually by 3-4°C over the next three to four days, which may cause isolated cold wave conditions over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan on January 12 and 13.Surface winds, between speeds of 15 and 25kmph are very likely over the plains of northwest India during next the three days, according to India Meteorological Department’s Sunday bulletin.“Very cold northwesterly winds are blowing from snowclad Himalayas towards Delhi, so both maximum and minimum temperatures have fallen. Winds are blowing at 20 to 25 kmph, so the perception of cold is stronger. They are chilly winds. We are expecting cold day conditions over Delhi for the next few days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to the IMD, a ‘cold day’ or ‘severe cold day’ is based on two parameters — a minimum temperature below 10°C and maximum temperature is 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degree C below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10°C or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two straight days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4°C in the plains. A cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal. Air quality still poorDespite very strong winds, Delhi recorded ‘poor’ air, with an AQI (air quality index) of 245 on Sunday. Strong winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail between January 10 and 13. The air quality is likely to remain within the ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ category on January 11 and 12, according to air quality early warning system for Delhi under the Union ministry of earth sciences.“Delhi’s air quality improved to ‘poor’ category and is improving further. We are likely to see ‘moderate’ air quality for two to three days, due to strong winds,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-minimum-temperature-falls-two-notches-further-drop-in-store-101610301929137.html

10-01-2021||Other||UP Gate protest site stays aloof from Covid protocols||Even as farmers continue to protest against the three new central government farm laws, the Ghaziabad administration is found wanting in terms of Covid-19 testing and surveillance at the UP-Gate site. While officials said that they had deployed teams offering tests, farmers say they did not trust the government.The Supreme Court had earlier expressed its concerns over the number of people on Delhi’s borders and the Covid-19 situation. It had asked the Centre to apprise it of the measures taken to protect the protesters from the coronavirus disease. The UP Gate protest had been occupied by farmers since November 28 and the gathering of a few hundreds then has swelled to more than 10,000 people, according to officials. These people are staying in temporary camps, tractor-trolleys without the luxury of following social-distancing norms. The farmers at the UP-Gate site also seem apprehensive about Covid-testing and other protocols like wearing of face masks or maintaining social-distancing norms. “They (district officials) had told us once about getting tested. We believe that the government wants to throw hurdles to derail our movement by one way or the other. It is now almost 40 days and there are no Covid-19 patients here. They talk about protection, but there are many rallies and even elections that were held across the country without paying any heed to Covid health protocols,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand. “There is no corona here. We will support Covid testing but who will ensure that the test reports are genuine? The government must accept our demands on repealing the laws and giving legal protection to minimum support price. It has been weeks now that the government has not been able to make farmers understand, so they must withdraw the laws,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. The Supreme Court on Thursday had issued a notice seeking the Centre’s reply within two weeks. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde remarked: “This same problem is going to arise during the farmers’ protest. We do not know if farmers are being protected from Covid. What guidelines have you issued for prevention of such things?” Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kalanidhi Naithani have sent their reports to the UP government, officials who did not wish to be named said. Despite multiple attempts, Pandey nor his office did not respond to request for comment. Naithani too did not respond till press time.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad, said,”We deployed our testing-vans initially for 2-3 days when the farmers had come to UP-Gate but no one came for testing. We cannot force them to take up tests. We have deployed two teams, about 15-20 days ago, which have been going to the site for surveillance and medical intervention. These teams are basically for providing health facilities to any farmer having health complication.” Dr Gupta could not provide figures of number of people who were tested or monitored at the UP-Gate protest site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-gate-protest-site-stays-aloof-from-covid-protocols-101610301870473.html

District commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said that under Uttar Pradesh’s Mission Shakti campaign, introduced last year, besides spreading awareness on women and children safety, the police are taking stern legal action. “We have started exclusive women safety cells in all police stations, where a sub-inspector (SI) rank officer is supervising cases. In the last 40 days, we have adroitly prosecuted cases at the district and session court. Life imprisonment was awarded to two convicts, while seven others were sentenced to jail terms of different durations,” he said. Vrinda Shulka, DCP (women safety), said after the introduction of the cells, the responsibilities of probe have been fixed on officers deputed. “As a result, police have arrested all suspects in every case related to sexual violence. We are also providing enough medical, chemical and legal evidences,” she said.She further said that crimes against women have gone down in the last one year in the district. “While there is a fall (34 cases) in cases of rape in 2020, as compared to 2019 (99 cases), while cases under POCSO Act have gone down to 127, compared to 147 in 2019,” she said. District special prosecution officer Chhavi Ranjan Dwivedi said: “Now, we are so much more equipped with evidence that escaping conviction has become difficult. In the last 40 days, we have ensured cancellation of bails of 34 accused in crimes against women and children,” he said. Supreme Court lawyer Rajesh Kumar said success of prosecution completely depends on authenticity of facts and evidence. “Full-proof probe is the key to ensuring conviction. Seven convictions in less than 45 days indicate that the district police are taking even minute evidence into account,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nine-convictions-in-crimes-against-children-in-last-40-days-say-noida-police-101610301809158.html

The woman lived with her two sons in a village that comes under the Jarcha police jurisdiction, the police said, adding that her husband had died 10 years ago. Vishal Pandey, additional DCP, Greater Noida, said that the woman had some argument with her family members and she left home without informing anyone on Thursday evening. “The family members launched a search in the neighbourhood and also alerted their relatives. However, they failed to trace the woman,” he said. Next day, the family filed a missing complaint at Jarcha police station. Pandey said that at 8pm on Saturday a passerby informed police about the woman’s body hanging from a tree. “The police team brought down the body. The body was sent for a post-mortem and medical reports revealed the woman had ended her life and there was no mark of external force,” he said. The body was handed over to the victim’s family members, the police said. Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/missing-woman-found-hanging-from-tree-in-greater-noida-101610301749626.html
10-01-2021||Other||Fixing liability for defective airbags will help improve automobile safety||Automobile safety got a fillip last week with the apex consumer court reiterating the car manufacturers’ liability for defective air bags.Coming as it does after publication of the proposed amendment to the Central Motor Vehicles Rules to make airbags mandatory for the front passenger too (in addition to the driver), this order acts as a wake-up call for manufacturers to comply fully with safety standards and ensure that airbags are defect free. The new consumer protection law with its specific emphasis on product liability, also underscore this point. The order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, directing Hyundai to pay ₹3 lakhs to a consumer for the failure of the air bags to deploy during a collision with a truck on the Delhi-Panipat highway in 2017, highlights the consumer’s right to compensation not only for a defective air bag, but also for the failure of the manufacturer to give complete and material information about the airbags prior to the sale.Dismissing the argument of the manufacturer that a) the impact of the crash was not so forceful as to require the deployment of the air bag; b) that the consumer had not produced any expert evidence in support of his claim, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission agreed with the Delhi State Consumer Commission that the photographs of the damaged vehicle showed the impact and the location of the front collision and thereby the defect in the airbags, resulting in injuries to the passengers. And that this was a case where the doctrine of Les Ipsa Loquitor ( the thing speaks for itself) applied and there was no need to rely on an expert opinion.Presiding member CViswanath in his order also observed that “highlighting safety features including airbags while selling the car and not elaborating and disclosing the threshold limits for their opening is by itself an unfair trade practice”. (Hyundai Motors India Ltd Vs Shailender Bhatnagar, Jan 5, 2021)A 2001 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology indicated that mortality in head-on car collisions went down by 63 per cent with the deployment of air bag and by 80 per cent in combination with the seat belt. A subsequent 2011 report in the American Journal of Orthopaedics said seat belts and air bags together brought down mortality as well as injury severity by 67 per cent. It’s for this reason that air bags are considered a critical safety feature in automobiles. In the US, an estimated 2790 lives were saved by frontal air bags in 2017.However, for air bags to be effective, they must be made to precise standards. A wrong sensor setting, for example, could result in the airbag not being deployed in lower energy crashes, where they should be fired. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), airbags should deploy in “moderate to severe frontal or near-frontal crashes” such as those equivalent to striking a parked car of similar size at about 16-28 mph or higher.Any lacuna or defect in the sensor or the air bag module or the electronic control unit or the inflator could lead to failure of the air bag. In the last five years for example, Takata airbags installed in tens of millions of US vehicles across 19 manufacturers have been subject to recall due to a defect that may cause the air bag to explode, resulting in serious injuries and death. Described as the largest vehicle recalls in US history, the defective air bags have led to 400 injuries and 18 fatalities there.Since airbags were not mandatory in India (only driver side airbag was made compulsory from 2019) manufacturers of high-end vehicles often used it as one of the major selling points and consumers have in a number of cases hauled them up for injuries caused on account of the failure of the air bags during a frontal crash and got compensation through consumer courts and even the Supreme Court.The message from these orders is clear- respect the consumer’s right to safety and information or else pay for the consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fixing-liability-for-defective-airbags-will-help-improve-automobile-safety-101610301750074.html

A board will also be required to put up at the site. Once we receive the list of such buildings, a technical team will inspect and start the process of declaring the building as dilapidated,” said BB Chaudhary, district’s basic education officer. The technical committee comprises engineers from the Public Works Department, UP Jal Nigam and the Rural Engineering Department. “Based on a previous report by the committee, we declared 33 buildings as dilapidated during the last financial year. We have also received funds for their reconstruction. Once we get the list sought now, similar process will be taken up,” he added. Under the basic education, there are about 455 government schools running classes 1 to 8. Besides, the district has about 400 senior secondary schools that include government inter colleges and private schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). “The decision has been taken in the wake of the incident at Muradnagar. We have sought the list immediately. The private schools will take up repairs on their own. We have issued directions and in case of any incident, the respective school principals/management will be held responsible,” said Ravi Dutt, district inspector of schools. The academicians, however, said that the education department officials cannot shy away from their responsibility. “Schools are very particular about the infrastructure and adhering to construction norms. It is a general practice that whenever any school wants to get affiliation, or take up its upgradation/extension, it has to take approval from the education department officials. Before giving approval, the officials ask for all conformities. So, they cannot simply say that it is one-sided responsibility of the schools. It is a joint responsibility,” said Jyoti Gupta, city co-ordinator of CBSE and director of Delhi Public School, Sahibabad. “In case they feel the need, they have technical committees which can also take up random checks of the schools,” she added. On January 3, the roof of a shelter at Ukhlarsi cremation ground in Muradnagar had collapsed, claiming lives of 24 people. An FIR was lodged against the contractor and several officials of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika. Five persons, including the contractor, have so far been arrested in this connection. The contractor in his statements to the police has allegedly admitted that he bribed officials and also resorted to malpractices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muradnagar-roof-collapse-effect-schools-asked-to-identify-dilapidated-buildings-101610301749235.html

The AQI of Ghaziabad too improved to 280 against 348 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida, however, did not budge from the “very poor” category, though still managed to show some improvement, with an AQI of 311 on Sunday against 360 a day earlier.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”According to the weather department and the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a pollution monitoring agency, the air quality is likely to improve further. “The AQI is likely to improve and to the “poor” to the “moderate” category on January 12 and 13. No sudden deterioration of AQI is expected till January 14,” said a SAFAR statement on Sunday. The weather analysts added that over the next three days from Monday, as the wind speed will rise further. However, due to clear sky and strong, icy-cold north-westerly winds, the mercury is likely to drop. Sunday saw isolated cold-day conditions at some places across the National Capital Region. The cold-day conditions are a weather phenomenon when the maximum or day time temperatures are at least four degrees Celsius below the season’s average. “The region will see high wind speed over the next two days. The effect of high winds was seen on Sunday as well, with the region receiving 18-20 kmph strong winds. From Monday onwards, this will rise to 25 to 30 kmph, which will lead to a drop in the day time temperature, especially maximum temperature, which may drop by a few degrees over the next three days, with cold day conditions already being realised at some isolated places across NCR,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). He added that the strong wind speed will be good for the air quality of the region. “The air quality will markedly improve over the next three days as strong winds will ventilate most of the pollutants from the city,” Srivastava added. On Sunday, the mercury fell by four degrees Celsius in the city due to icy cold winds from the Himalayan region. The minimum temperature for Noida, realised at the automatic weather monitoring station Sector 62, Noida, was recorded at 8.1 degrees Celsius, against 12.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature also dropped by almost four degrees in Noida and an average of three degrees across NCR. The maximum temperature or Noida was recorded at 16.2 degrees Celsius, against 19.9 degrees Celsius a day earlier. Meanwhile, the average minimum and maximum temperatures in NCR, based on the Safdarjung observatory, were recorded at 7.8 degrees Celsius and 16.2 degrees Celsius, respectively. “There has been snow over the mountain regions, so the minimum and maximum temperatures will drop further. There will be a nip in the air and despite a clear sky and sunshine, the days will feel cold due to winds,” added Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/strong-winds-to-improve-air-quality-expect-cold-day-conditions-this-week-101610301629118.html
10-01-2021||Gurugram||Woman kills self, family alleges foul play||A 30-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by hanging from a ceiling fan at her Basai residence on Friday, the police said. The family members of the woman have accused a male friend of the woman’s and his family for the suicide, alleging that she was depressed for the last few months due to harassment by them.On the basis of a complaint filed by the woman’s family, a case was filed under sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Sector 10A police station on Saturday. The woman, according to the police, used to work at a private hospital in Sector 37 for the past year and had befriended the man six months ago. The man had initially promised to marry her but allegedly refused to do so two months ago, it has been alleged.The woman’s family members said she lived in a rented room in Basai village and had visited her three children, who stay with her grandmothers, at Dhanwaspur village in Sector 104 three days ago.Subhash Boken, the spokesperson for Gurugram police, said that her family has alleged that her male friend had visited her on Friday, murdered her and hung the body from the fan to make it look like a suicide. Boken said the room was found locked from the outside, due to which the family is suspecting foul play. “The Sector 10 A police station received a call on Saturday and rushed to the spot. They found the body hanging and have sent it for a post-mortem examination. The teams are conducting an investigation,” he said. A dog squad and fingerprint experts also visited the spot and took samples, the police said. The family members alleged that she sounded low while talking to them on Thursday and had told them that she would call them later after her friend’s visit. Boken said that as per an initial probe, it seems like the woman had hanged to death after the man refused to marry her. “An initial investigation suggests that the woman committed suicide due to relationship issues. However, the police are investigating all aspects of the case,” he said. The suspect works at a private hospital and lives in Sector 10 of Basai Enclave, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/woman-kills-self-family-alleges-foul-play-101610300909672.html
10-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers from J&K join protesters at Haryana border||A group of farmers from Jammu and Kashmir joined the ongoing agitation on the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Saturday. Farmers said that were not deterred by the plummeting temperatures and preparing for January 26, when they plan to hold a parallel Republic Day parade. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been camping at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district for the past 29 days. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha—the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders— and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that a contingent of farmers from Jammu and Kashmir had joined the agitation on Saturday. “Farmers from various states and union territories such as Jammu and Kashmir are joining us. Activist Medha Patkar had also joined us on Saturday to extend support to farmers and motivate them. The government might think that farmers will back down but our resolve only grows with each passing day,” said Madhav. He said that farmers were facing difficulties in procuring supplies since the Haryana Police had placed restrictions and closed a slip lane that was being used by farmers earlier. “On the Haryana end, the police have placed trucks and containers. A slip road that we were using has been closed now. So, vehicles ferrying our supplies can’t reach us easily. We are trying to source our supplies from Rajasthan,” said Madhav. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, had earlier said that while the protesting farmers were not being allowed to cross the border, the allegations of the police stopping supplies were baseless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-from-j-k-join-protesters-at-haryana-border-101610300909139.html
10-01-2021||Gurugram||Education department starts helpline for students facing mental distress||In an initiative aimed at increasing awareness about mental health issues among college students, the state higher education department has started a distress call centre for psychological aid and support of college students going through emotional stress. Launched last week, the goal of the call centre is to help improve the mental well-being and resilience of students facing mental stress. In a letter shared with principals of all government colleges last Friday, the department of higher education said that students could avail assistance by calling on the round-the-clock, toll-free helpline number +917419864999 for psychological aid and intervention under the Nayi Disha (new direction) initiative. Officials said that the helpline would allow students to receive professional psychological and emotional support from a team of 35 trained psychologists. Mohd Rafique, principal, Government College for Girls, Sector 52, said that the initiative would help students battling mental health issues such as anxiety or depression. “During the pandemic, mental health issues among people of all ages including students have gone up. Due to restricted social interaction, students are struggling with loneliness and other concerns. To help such students, the department has formed a panel of psychologists who can give professional help to students,” said Rafique. He said that since the facility was free of cost, students would be less hesitant in availing help. “While classes are taking place both online and offline, college life has been impacted. All students may not get the chance to share their concerns with their friends or family. In such a situation, taking help from professionals can be beneficial for students,” said Rafique. Virender Singh Antil, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the centre was aimed at spreading awareness and reducing stigma around mental health issues among students. He said that while there had been counselling support in the past, this time, the department had formed a team of professionals. “Mental health issues are quite prevalent among students these days. The lockdown and pandemic restrictions have also aggravated the stress faced by students. Under this initiative, students can reach out to experts for intervention. They can book an appointment and share their concerns with the team,” said Antil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/education-department-starts-helpline-for-students-facing-mental-distress-101610300849495.html
10-01-2021||Gurugram||Teachers in colleges mandated to create e-content due to Covid-19 situation||The state higher education department has made it mandatory for all college teachers to create e-content, mainly comprising video lectures, for the current semester and has linked it to their performance evaluations. Earlier, only a team of select teachers were being asked to prepare e-content, but the department has now made it mandatory for all teachers to record video lectures, keeping in view the delay in resuming in-person classroom sessions due to the ongoing pandemic. In a letter shared with principals of government colleges on Friday, the department of higher education said that changes in the teaching-learning pedagogy were being witnessed due to the pandemic and the department is encouraging faculty to use various means of technology to reach out to students. Preparation of e-content will be linked to the performance of the teachers, the department said. Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, said that while some teachers were already engaged in the creation of e-content, it had now been decided to engage all teachers, both regular and those on an extension, for the preparation of online lecturers. He said that the heads of departments will ensure that all topics of the syllabus for all courses are covered. “Students will be able to access and learn from lecture videos produced by teachers across the states since teachers from different districts will be sharing their content with the department,” said Verma. Satyamanyu Yadav, the principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the move would ensure that all teachers become fluent in producing and disseminating lecture videos at a time when online education is expected to continue for the near future. “Earlier, the creation of e-content was optional for teachers. Only a select team of teachers was being asked to produce lectures for transmission via different mediums. Now, the department has made it mandatory for all teachers to produce e-content. They are of the view that every teacher should produce lecture videos since the pandemic situation might prolong or continue for the next few months,” said Yadav. He said that teachers had received the necessary training for creating e-content as part of faculty development programmes held last year, during the lockdown. “Everyone needs to be acquainted with the tools that can be used for online content creation. Last year, we had also conducted a 14-day workshop in this regard. Based on those learnings, teachers should be in a position to create e-content,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/teachers-in-colleges-mandated-to-create-e-content-due-to-covid-19-situation-101610300849111.html

In the week ending January 10, Gurugram reported 404 new cases of Covid-19 — down from 442 reported the week prior. This was once again the lowest seven-day aggregate of new cases in several weeks.Gurugram’s total tally of Covid-19, as of Sunday, stands at 57,488 cases, of which just under two percent of the cases are currently active. From 828 active patients a week ago, Gurugram’s count of active patients fell to 779 in the week ending January 10. Of these, only 79 are in hospitals, while 697 are under home isolation. Another three people are under observation at various district Covid care centres.Meanwhile, the district saw only one new Covid-related death in the past week, taking the total toll to 347. Hospital bed occupancy rates are also currently at an all time low, with only 51 of 369 ICU beds in use. These include 253 ventilator beds, out of which only 19 are in use. As per health department data, Gurugram has been testing an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 samples per day for Covid-19, with an average daily test positivity rate between 2 and 2.5 percent. This has been the case for over two weeks now.With daily new infections and test positivity rates remaining low for two consecutive weeks, officials said there is a slim chance of another surge in cases taking place over the next month. This will allow them adequate time to focus on the vaccine roll-out plan set to be implemented on January 16. “By the look of the way things have been for the last two weeks, it is unlikely that we will face a large burden of contact tracing and active cases over the next fortnight. This will make things logistically easier for the vaccine camps,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/slowdown-in-new-covid-cases-continues-in-district-101610300791273.html
10-01-2021||Gurugram||Colleges told to set up centres on environment, road safety||The higher education department has directed colleges across the state to set up nature and traffic interpretation centres, which shall educate students about issues pertaining to environmental degradation and road safety. These centres will also introduce action-based programmes for students in the two fields. In a letter shared with principals of all government colleges on Wednesday, the department of higher education said that while the traffic interpretation centre was aimed at creating awareness about growing road accidents, the nature interpretation centre shall educate students about various environmental issues. It is mandatory for all students to register for both the nature and traffic interpretation centres, which will operate out of a common room. “In India, pollution and environmental degradation have reached alarming dimensions due to deforestation and industrial development without adequate environmental safeguards. This creates an urgent need to generate awareness among students. The aim of establishment of the traffic interpretation centre is to instil in the minds of people that road safety is as important as any other survival skill,” said an official, associated with the project. College heads said that the centre shall work towards motivating students to develop an interest in road safety and environmental issues through various programs and would have both online and offline presence. Colleges will be getting virtual reality (VR) sets and other resources to help students ideate on projects through these centres. Dr Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the new centres were aimed at providing students with a platform through which they could contribute towards society in a constructive manner. “The government is keen on reviving a conversation about nature and road safety through these centres. The idea is to put in place a mechanism through which students can imbibe knowledge about road safety and environmental issues. The centres will further give them a chance to develop solutions for tackling various issues around road safety and environmental degradation,” said Yadav. He said that students will be connected through WhatsApp groups and online resources will be shared initially due to social distancing concerns. “While we will initiate work on the campus soon, online engagements and activities will start first since many students are not visiting the college for physical classroom sessions,” said Yadav. Virender Singh Antil, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the college would involve faculty from the geography department to spearhead the nature and interpretation centre. “We will be allocating a common room on the college campus where both these centres will be set up with necessary resources. In all likelihood, faculty from the geography department will be roped in for carrying out the various activities and programs that need to be implemented for creating awareness among students,” said Antil. Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, said that the initiative is primarily aimed at raising awareness about issues of environment protection and road safety. “Students need to be aware of these issues so that they can take proactive steps and be sensitive to their surroundings,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/colleges-told-to-set-up-centres-on-environment-road-safety-101610300790804.html

This was a colder day than Saturday, when the Palam AWS recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees and a maximum of 19.2 degrees Celsius.As per the IMD’s weekly forecast for the city, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 7 degrees Celsius and 19 degrees Celsius respectively on Monday. The minimum temperature is likely to fall gradually by 3-5 degrees Celsius during next few days and may cause isolated cold wave conditions over Punjab, Haryana and north Rajasthan between January 12 and 13. The IMD has also predicted strong surface winds of speeds ranging between 15 and 25 kmph over the plains of northwest India during the next three days, particularly during the afternoons.Air quality in the city meanwhile remained in the “poor” category of the AQI, with an index value of 215 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily pollution bulletin. This is down slightly from yesterday’s AQI reading of 230, also indicating “poor” air quality. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Strong winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail from 10th to 13th January. The air quality is likely to remain in Poor to Moderate category on 11.01.2021 and 12.01.2021.”According to Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, “Even though some colder conditions are likely to be setting in over the next few days, the influence of strong northwesterly winds will prevent a severe deterioration in air quality. In fact, Gurugram may even see moderate air on Monday, after wind speeds pick up during the afternoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/isolated-cold-wave-conditions-to-return-imd-101610300789749.html

10-01-2021||Gurugram||At least 25 bird carcasses found so far at Tau Devi Biodiversity Park, bird flu suspected||Carcasses of at least 25 birds have been found at the Tau Devi Biodiversity Park over the past few days, officials of the wildlife department said on Sunday, amid growing concerns over an outbreak of avian influenza virus (AIV).Officials said that the increasing bird deaths in the city, especially at the biodiversity park, are most likely due to avian influenza. The carcasses of the birds were buried at the biodiversity park and samples sent for testing.During a spot visit to the park in Sector 56 on Sunday afternoon, a Hindustan Times team was able to spot at least five carcasses in the park, including those of three crows, a myna and an egret. The team also came upon two crows that appeared sickly and unable to move.Wildlife officials confirmed that a higher incidence of bird mortality has indeed been reported from Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity park, particularly among crows.“In the last two to three days alone, some 25 dead birds have been retrieved and buried at Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, to prevent any further spread of bird flu. Almost all are crows, with one or two mynas and egrets. Even though confirmatory results from the lab in Jalandhar are yet to come, bird flu seems to be the likeliest cause of death. We are now keeping a very close eye on Sultanpur, Basai and Najafgarh wetlands for anything out of the ordinary, but there has been no unusual activity there so far among local or migrant birds,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which maintains the Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, erected signboards at the park’s entrance on Sunday that read: “A lot of birds are dying in the park because of bird flu. Please be cautious for your own safety.”Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the GMDA, also said that footfall in the park decreased sharply over the past week. “The park was the emptiest it has been on a Sunday in several months. Walkers and joggers make up a huge portion of the crowd, but there is reluctance due to the bird flu scare. If the lab report confirms the presence of AIV, we will shut the park to walkers for a few days.”However, officials also said that any confirmation of bird flu in Gurugram will still take at least another two weeks. “The Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab (RDDL) in Jalandhar is processing samples from all over the country, so the test results will take some time to arrive. In fact, the RDDL’s backlog of samples is so much that we have stopped conducting RT-PCR tests there for Covid-19 so that these bird flu samples can be cleared first,” an official of the animal husbandry department said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, 11 rapid response teams conducted clinical surveillance of poultry farms on Sunday but did not find any sign of an avian influenza outbreak. “I cannot say much except that we have not seen anything unusual with the health of poultry. We are on the lookout. Our field teams have been in constant touch with poultry farmers. Nothing is out of the ordinary there,” said the official cited above. Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director, animal husbandry, declined comment on the issue, saying that dead wild birds are the remit of the wildlife department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/at-least-25-bird-carcasses-found-so-far-at-tau-devi-biodiversity-park-bird-flu-suspected-101610300789245.html

While the latter as well as People’s College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bhopal, a private medical college conducting the trial, clarified on Saturday that the volunteer didn’t die due to the vaccine trial, the state government gave a clean chit to the medical college in connection with the death."The volunteer, at the time of enrolment, had fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be accepted as a participant in the Phase III trial and was reported to be healthy in all the site follow up calls post seven days of his dosing and no AE's were observed or reported," said Bharat Biotech in its clarification through media on Saturday."As per the post-mortem report issued by the Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, the probable cause of death was due to cardiorespiratory failure as a result of suspected poisoning and the case is under police investigation as well," Bharat Biotech added.Also read: PM Modi to meet chief ministers on Monday over Covid-19 vaccine rolloutThe organisations which raised their voice against the vaccine trial in the letter include Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh, Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha, Bhopal Group for Information and Action, and Children Against Dow Carbide.Talking to media, Rasheeda Bee from Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Stationery Karmchari Sangh said at least 700 of 1,700 people on whom the vaccine was being tested were those suffering from ailments caused by the Bhopal Gas Tragedy. One gas victim already died within 10 days of getting the trial shot and many continued to have health complaints of serious nature. No one had been punished for the death of 13 gas victims who died during trials by pharmaceutical companies in Bhopal some twelve years back.“We are writing to the Prime Minister to ensure there is no repeat,” she added.She said, “Family of the gas victim who died during the Covaxin trial should be paid ₹50 lakhs as is done in the case of deceased Corona warriors".Also read: 'Bogus claim,' says BJP after Bengal CM announces free Covid-19 vaccine for allRachna Dhingra from Bhopal Group for Information & Action said, "People whose health is compromised due to Union Carbide's poisons are being given the Covaxin trial shots without their knowledge or consent.

Trial participants who leave or are excluded halfway are denied care and are not followed up."Shehzadi Bee of Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Purush Sangharsh Morcha said, "In addition to immediate stoppage of the trial and compensation for the gas victim who has died during this trial, we demand a thorough and impartial audit, criminal punishment to officials and institutions responsible for this public health disaster and compensation for injuries caused due to trial vaccines."Nousheen Khan of the Children Against Dow Carbide said, "By ignoring the ongoing criminal irregularities in the Covaxin trial in Bhopal, the government is potentially unleashing a public health disaster."Dean of People’s College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Dr Anil Dixit said, “There is no possibility of the death (of the vaccine trial participant), that took place 9 days after getting the vaccine, caused due to the trial.

10-01-2021||Kolkata||‘BJP will win over 200 seats in Bengal,’ says Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel||Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Sunday took a swipe at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee saying the state was a victim of government’s negligence and that the Bharatiya Janata Party will win over 200 seats in the assembly elections slated for later this year.The minister also accused the Trinamool Congress government of digressing from the path of progress and ignoring the local art and culture. “Nature has given everything to Darjeeling, but this area has been the victim of the negligence of the state government. There is no improvement in the status of tea garden workers,” Patel told reporters during his stay in Darjeeling. He also attacked the wage board for tea garden workers and the state government for lease-related issues.Promising a solution to the Gorkha problems in the region, Patel said, “our manifesto is our resolution letter. We believe in the timebound solution to the problem. Whatever promises we make, we fulfil that within the stipulated time. We will find a permanent political solution to the Gorkha problems.”Alleging that there is no platform available for conducting cultural activities in Darjeeling, the Union minister demanded that the Bengal government provide a place like Tagore Culture Space and said if the state government provides the land, his ministry can do a lot of work here in the field of art and culture. “The culture of Bengal is very rich but there is a lack of institutions through which the artists of this place may know about the culture, and work to further improve it,” he added. He promised that when his party comes to power in Bengal, a lot of work will be done in the art and culture domain.Criticising the government on lack of development, Patel said that many types of taxes are collected here since the time of the British, but facilities are not provided in accordance. He alleged that MPs of opposition parties in Bengal cannot spend their MPLAD funds for the development works which is why the people of Bengal want change and “that will happen”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-will-win-over-200-seats-in-bengal-says-union-minister-prahlad-singh-patel-101610295646018.html

10-01-2021||Pune||Local authorities prep up for vaccination launch, but await more info||The health ministry announced on Saturday announced that the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination programme will start in the country on January 16 and accordingly, local authorities have started preparation for the vaccination drive which would possibly be one of the biggest such drives in the country. However, with almost no information at hand about which vaccine would be administered and how many doses the city would get, local authorities are left to prepare without a plan. The state has shortlisted 511 vaccination centres based on the number of healthcare workers who have registered themselves on the CoWin app. Pune district has a total of 55 vaccination centres of which 16 each are for the two municipal corporations while remaining centres are for the rural areas and the councils. As of now, about 90 thousand healthcare workers including nurses, doctors, midwives and the clerical staff at hospitals have registered themselves from Pune district. While the dry run at the four centres went smoothly, uncertainty about the future plan could lead to a possible chaos.A senior official from the PMC’s health department, who is aware of the developments, said, “The uncertainty could lead to a major chaos. The dry run for the vaccination was mostly about the technical part which was the software registration and verification. However, even till date we do not know which vaccine would be administered, we do not know how many do we have to vaccinate every day and for how many days would this first phase go on. We do not even know how many doses we would get. The first 16 centres are being kept ready for the inauguration on January 16. Earlier, we were asked to prepare five sites and now we have to prepare 16.” Dr Ashish Bharti, chief health officer from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “We have to send a list of 16 vaccination centres where the first phase vaccination would take place. These would include mostly government facilities, but also major private hospitals like Deenanath Mangeshkar, Ruby Hall Clinic, Noble hospital and Bharatiya hospital who have expressed willingness to take part in the drive. We will finalise the names and send it.” Dr.Archana Patil, director of health services, said, “We have been asked to provide a lot of information which is ongoing.

However, with after-effects of the virus being reported in a few patients, the administration is now planning to test every recovered patient to look for multiple symptoms which could have been caused because of the infection. Every patient will undergo three screenings through the medical officers over the next three months. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad said, “Over 77,000 persons who have recovered from Covid-19 are from the non-municipal corporation areas in Pune districts. They would undergo three screenings through medical officers over the months of January, February and March for post-Covid-19 symptoms. If anyone is found to be suffering from any symptoms, the patient would be referred to a higher hospital for treatment. The aim is to prevent the long-term effect of Covid-19.” A program is being designed by the administration to make sure that all the possible symptoms are covered including neurological, ENT, dermatological, abdominal, renal, respiratory, psychological, cardiovascular and muscular. Regular follow-ups would be taken every month until March to make sure that the patients are completely checked for any post-Covid-19 related symptoms. As per the district health office, as of Saturday about 89,709 Covid-19 patients have recovered and discharged from rural areas, councils and the three cantonment boards. Post Covid-19 symptoms have been reported especially among those who were on a ventilator for a long time.

10-01-2021||Patna||We will boycott assembly session if it is truncated: Tejashwi Yadav||The opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar on Sunday declared it would boycott the upcoming budget session of state assembly and lay siege to residences of the chief minister and his deputies if proceedings of the House were curtailed in the name of facilitating Covid-19 vaccination. The announcement was made by RJD de facto leader Tejashwi Yadav after a meeting with delegates of Congress, CPI(ML), CPI and CPI(M) which together constitute the opposition coalition helmed by his party. "We met the Speaker yesterday. He had suggested that the budget session, normally held in March, be advanced and the proceedings which often last for a month or so, be wrapped up in a few days. "The reason stated by him was possible vaccination drive for COVID-19 in March", Yadav told reporters. The former Deputy CM alleged that proposed shortening of the session was "a ploy by the Nitish Kumar government to avoid facing elected representatives and getting cornered over the issue of high-handedness of the bureaucracy". He pointed out that assembly elections in the state were held last year while the pandemic was at its peak but large public gatherings in the form of rallies were allowed. "Now they are trying to tell us that just 243 members of the House cannot assemble because of the pandemic. They are talking about vaccination. Can they give a tentative date of its commencement? "Do they have even a faint idea as to how many vials of the shot will be made available to Bihar?", Yadav asked mockingly. Underscoring that legislative business had suffered in the state over the past one year because of the pandemic, Yadav said if the upcoming session was shortened "we will boycott it and gherao the residences of the Chief Minister and the deputy CMs". The RJD leader also took potshots at Nitish Kumar over his failure to come out "with even a small statement or a tweet" condoling the death of dozens of protesting farmers in the national capital. "We have always supported the cause espoused by the protestors and in yet another expression of solidarity, the opposition will be holding a state-wide human chain on January 30", Yadav declared. The younger son of jailed RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, who was stripped of the deputy CMs post more than three years ago following Nitish Kumars abrupt return to the NDA, scoffed at complaints of the JD(U) about having been "cheated" in the assembly elections an allusion to the LJPs sudden rebellion and the BJPs failure to rein in a renegade Chirag Paswan. "Kumar is reaping what he has sown. What did he do to George Fernandes and Digivijay Singh?", asked Yadav, referring to the former Union ministers who were close associates of Kumar early on, but bitterly parted ways towards the end of their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/we-will-boycott-assembly-session-if-it-is-truncated-tejashwi-yadav-101610291143162.html

10-01-2021||Pune||‘Mahamarg Suraksha Dal’ to help highway police during emergencies on e-way||In a bid to improve road safety on the Mumbai-Pune expressway and seek help from local villagers during emergency situations, the Highway State Police (HSP), Pune division, have begun forming “Mahamarg Suraksha Dal” committees. The initiative is being undertaken by the HSP Pune division under the guidance of Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police (traffic) Maharashtra. In order to form the Mahamarg Suraksha Dal, prominent persons from villages near the e-way are chosen. From sarpanch, school principals to college students, members are selected and trained to serve on the committee. The training consists of things to do during an emergency and ways to help the highway police. According to Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, Highway State Police (HSP), Pune, the focus in 2021 is on public awareness and improving the safety of expressway with the contribution of local villagers around the e-way. “We have introduced a new scheme for it, under which we have identified villages on both sides of the expressway. In each of the village, a committee is formed named as ‘Mahamarg Suraksha Dal’. This committee will have five to 10 prominent people from the village like the sarpanch, school and college principals, student representative, youth, medical professionals, prominent women from the village, vehicle garage and roadside dhaba owners and other such people will be part of this committee. This idea of forming such committees was given by our ADGP Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay and we are now implementing it,” Jadhav said. Jadhav added that once the committees are formed in all villages on both the sides of the expressway, awareness programmes will be undertaken in each village. The awareness programmes will elaborate on following traffic rules such as not riding triple seat on a bike, avoiding unauthorised entry on the e-way, the harms of drink and drive, driving on the wrong side, and the compulsion of helmets. “Currently, almost in all the villages these committees are being formed and from our department, each police constable is given the responsibility of a village to focus on. A Whatsapp mobile group will be formed for each village for better communication. So,having continuous dialogue with these local villagers who are part of the committee, we are getting immediate information about accidents or any emergency situation on the highway,” added Jadhav. The committee members will also be trained for first aid and what to do to help accident victims on the highway. “Generally, what happens is that when an accident occurs on the e-way, nearby villagers pull out victims from the vehicle in an untrained fashion. Some victims are given water to drink which causes more damage. However, if proper training about first aid and medical help is given, it will benefit the accident victims. With the help of Lokmanya hospital, we have plans to give such type of training to these committee members in a phase-wise manner,” said Jadhav. Through this committee, the HSP police will also, try to interact with the gram panchayat or local civic bodies of the village to undertake necessary infrastructure work on the roads connecting to the highway. For example, speed breakers, signage boards and signals on roads connecting to the e-way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mahamarg-suraksha-dal-to-help-highway-police-during-emergencies-on-eway-101610291368645.html

Some have been captioning their photos on social media in Hindi; for a few it helps express better whereas for others, it’s the new in-thing! And there are some who have even created pages/accounts dedicated to prose and poetry in Hindi.“Jis bhaasha ko hum bachpan se bolte hai usme dil ki bhavnao ko vyakt karna aasan to hota hi hai, par use ek alag nazariye se dekhne aur usme memes banana bhi ek kala hai!” – Sanjay Kataria, a DU student“Hindi ek aisi bhasha hai jisme main khul ke apne vicharo ko vyakt kar pata hun, kabhi kavita ke roop main toh kabhi koi nibhandh ke roop main. Har ek bhaasha ki apni khoobsurati hoti hai, aur Hindi ki khoobsurati alag hi hai,” says Sanjay Kataria, a student pursuing masters at Delhi University, adding, “Aaj kal social media par Hindi kahaniyo ke pages, Hindi kavitao ke pages mushoor ho rahe hain. Jis bhaasha ko hum bachpan se bolte hai usme dil ki bhavnao ko vyakt karna aasan to hota hi hai, par use ek alag nazariye se dekhne aur usme memes banana bhi ek kala hai! Mere bahut sare mitr Hindi ke memes banakar ek dusre ko tag karte hain.”Reels on Instagram have youngsters lip syncing to Hindi music, poetry, dialogues and dancing to Hindi songs. And now millennials take pride in conversing, writing and speaking in Hindi. “Bachpan se maine Hindi medium mein padhai ki hai. Aaj main apne social media account pe photos ke caption Hindi mein hi likhti hun. Aur Hindi sahitya aur kavita ke social media ke bahut saare pages ko bhi follow karti hun. Achcha lagta hai apni bhasha ko ek naye rang roop me dekhna, padhna,” says Alka Nimesh, a PhD student at DU. She adds the popularity of Hindi reels, on Instagram, has grown by leaps and bounds in recent times. “Bahut log Hindi kavita, gaane aur chutkule ki video post karte hain. Aur in sab pe kaafi comments aate hain. Ye dekh kar ashcharya bhi hota hai aur achcha bhi lagta hai ki in pages ki following lagatar badti ja rahi hai. Isse pata chalta hai ki aaj ke yuva varg me Hindi ka mahatva badh raha hai; keval dikhave matra ke liye nahi par use aaj ke samay me samajhne ke liye,” adds Nimesh.Alongside podcasts and social media videos, videos of Hindi poetry have been going viral especially due to the motivational content they have. “Hindi ke podcasts dheere dheere badhne lage hain. Mujhe Hindi kahaniya sunne aur sunane mein bahut anand aata hai. Ab jaise social media par Piyush Mishra ji ki kavitaye nayi peedi ko zabardast aakarshit karti hai,” says Roopika Jain, a student of Noida-based varsity.Agreeing to the rising popularity of Hindi poetry on social media, Ankush Kumar, 26-year-old founder of Hindinama on Insta, says, “For me, Hindi is not just a language. Mere liye Hindi samman hai!” The description of this account reads: “Sahitya ko samarpit ek prayas.” And Kumar explains, “I started a Facebook page in 2006, with my friend Ujjwal Bhadana to bring to the forefront jo kavitayein hum aaj kal likh rahe hai, ya jo Hindi sahitya ki duniya mein ho raha hai. I started posting my poems, and gradually we started promoting not just Hindi literature, but literature of all languages, taki aur logon ko pahuch sake. The response has been great, too.”“I’m trying to promote Hindi language and literature through my page. Aur Vishva Hindi Diwas ek acha avsar hai Hindi bhasha ki jaagrookta badane ke liye.” – Rashi Sharma, from parichay.bhashaThere are many more like Kumar, who run popular pages on social media, to promote the language in their own unique and distinct ways. For instance, parichay.bhasha posts poetry/verses on handmade posters. Delhiite Rashi Sharma, who is the founder of this page, says, “I’m trying to promote Hindi language and literature through my page. Aur Vishva Hindi Diwas ek acha avsar hai Hindi bhasha ki jaagrookta badane ke liye. Par vishwa ki sabse lokpriya basha ka prachar karne ke liye, keval ek diwas ki awashaykta nahi padni chahiye.”The reason one chooses Hindi as a language to express could be many, but the sentiment that almost always gives one a feeling of pride is often the one expressed in the popular patriotic song Sare Jahan Se Achcha...

The units checked by the fire departments were Kamla Nehru Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi hospital and Sonawane Hospital, all run by the Pune civic body. The fire re-audit, conducted by the fire department following strict directions from fire chief Prashant Ranpise on Sunday, post the Bhandara hospital fire tragedy in which 10 infants perised, has raised serious concerns. At the Rajeev Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada, fire-fighting pumps were found to be shut. At the Kamala Nehru Hospital, the pump room was locked and the location of the keys unknown. Fire-fighting equipment was broken and not in service. Sonawane Hospital did not have the necessary fire- fighting equipment in place. “We are immediately sending our findings to the health department asking them to direct the agency appointed to fulfil the norms as these loopholes are dangerous and life threatening. The entire system must be put in place at the three hospitals. We put special focus on these hospitals as infants are here and hence, we did not want to take any chance. We carried out an immediate fire audit today and found serious lapses at Kamla Nehru Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi hospital and Sonawane Hospital,” said Ranpise. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) central fire brigade, on Saturday, claimed that all private and government hospitals under its jurisdiction have complied with the fire safety norms as per the Supreme Court December 2020 directive. It, however, carried out a re-audit of three hospitals having neonatal intensive care units following orders from deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. The apex court had directed all state and Union territory governments to form committees to undertake fire safety audits of all hospitals, including Covid-19 hospitals, every month. A bench said that every state government must appoint a nodal officer to ensure adherence to fire safety norms in hospitals. According to the civic administration, fire no-objection certificates (NOC) were issued to hospitals after regular inspection of properties during visits carried out by the fire brigade staff. According to PMC records, the city houses between 400-500 small and big hospitals. The central government has been regularly directing state governments to conduct fire safety audits in all major hospitals and nursing homes by the fire and emergency services. The Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006 stipulates that building owners and occupants must install firefighting measures and ensure proper evacuation measures in the case of fire emergency. The Act contains comprehensive guidelines towards securing the fire safety of old as well as new buildings in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-pmc-hospitals-with-infant-wards-have-fire-safety-concerns-fire-chief-101610290348613.html

The focus of the government would be the villages abandoned by its residents in the hills which are popularly known as 'ghost villages'.State agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said that the initiative had been brought to "impart skills to the youth in mushroom farming using the houses abandoned since long.""The move will greatly help in curbing the migration from our villages in the hilly areas and provide a source of livelihood to the youth who can earn a significant income by selling mushrooms," said Uniyal.The minister said that as the "climatic conditions in the state's hilly areas are suitable for growing mushrooms, the initiative will help to boost the rural economy also.""We have identified about 2,000 villages including the ghost villages where we would be training almost 10,000 youths in mushroom farming. Once trained, they would be able to grow various types of mushrooms and earn money," said Uniyal.The minister added that "The department is also working on boosting the number and quality of mushroom spawns or seeds so as to promote them more."Also read: Ahead of Covid-19 vaccine rollout, how states have made preparations 10 pointsDivya Rawat, an eminent mushroom grower in the state, popularly known as the mushroom girl of Uttarakhand, who has been also training people across the country in mushroom farming said, "It is a welcome move for the villages in our hilly areas.""The initiative will surely help in curbing the migration which would in turn boost the economy. Once the economy gets going, fewer people would like to go out as they could get their livelihood at their native place itself," said Rawat.She, however, said that the government should not just limit itself to just training the youths in mushroom cultivation."It should rather train them in all aspects of mushroom farming, then only it would succeed. If the training is right then mushrooms grown by not just 10,000 youths but 10 lakh youths would also fall short in market," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/reviving-ghost-villages-uttarakhand-govt-to-train-10k-youth-in-mushroom-farming-101610287402883.html

The committee was set under the direction of the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed Konkan wetland grievance redressal and the state mangrove monitoring committee. A notice over the panel was issued by Padmashri Bainade, resident deputy collector, Raigad-Alibag, which HT has access to. The committee was formed following directions of the Konkan wetland grievance redressal and the state mangrove monitoring committee after the Raigad district administration told the court that there were no wetland sites in Uran taluka. The committee will be chaired by the sub-divisional officer and will include forest and Cidco (City and Industrial Development Corporation) officials as members. An official from the state department of environment and climate change will be appointed as the panel secretary. D Stalin, director, of NGO Vanashakti, is also a member of the panel. On December 9, 2020, the Raigad district administration had informed the HC-appointed state mangrove and wetland panel that there were no wetlands in Uran taluka, which has faced numerous cases of environmental violations over the past two years. Bainade had then informed members of the panel that following a detailed verification exercise of 13 areas that had wetland features in Uran, none qualified as a wetland as per the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. Days later, the HC-appointed panel directed that a sub-committee be formed to verify the status of all the wetlands in Uran. “The district administration’s submission to the panel that there were no wetlands in Uran taluka is in contradiction to the Wetland Atlas and Baseline Survey of Birds (January-March 2015) report at the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport by the Bombay Natural History Society (BHNS),” said Stalin. The BNHS report highlights that several potential habitats will be destroyed in the near future due to rapid development and land use pattern changes in Navi Mumbai and the adjoining areas in Raigad district, especially due to projects such as the proposed Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link, Navi Mumbai International Airport and the terminal project of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary said, “This committee has been formed under the direction of the HC-appointed panel and has experts from department of environment and police officials. However, none of them are experts on wetlands. If the committee finds that there is a water body with flora and fauna, they will recommend the same. We will then write to the Wetland Authority to verify them as wetlands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-forms-panel-to-verify-status-of-uran-wetlands-101610286088854.html

After 308 days into the battle against Covid-19, the state has recorded the most number of fatalities in the country, and has the second-highest case fatality rate (CFR) after Punjab. However, for the past few months, Maharashtra has been recording fewer deaths as compared to the earlier months of the pandemic outbreak. The first death in Maharashtra was reported last year on March 17, which was the third Covid-19 death in the country. Of the 150,798 Covid-related fatalities in India, one-third (33.17%) are from Maharashtra. Meanwhile on Saturday, the state reported 3,581 Covid-19 infections, pushing the tally to 1,965,556. The active cases in the state now stand at 52,960. The toll has surged to 50,027 after 57 deaths were recorded on Saturday. After witnessing a decline, the state had seen a slight increase in the fatality figures in the past four days. Officials attributed the marginal surge in the fatalities to the delay in recording the deaths. The total number of recovered patients in the state reached 1,861,400 after 2,401 people were discharged on Saturday. The recovery rate of the state stood at 94.7%. So far, the state has tested 13,338,488 samples and has an overall positivity rate of 14.74%. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 70,571 samples. Mumbai reported 596 new cases and eight fatalities on Saturday, taking the city’s tally to 298,235 and toll to 11,181. The active cases in the city stood at 7,680. Senior health department officials said the measures adopted by the administration to curb the absolute number of deaths in the state have been paying off since October. Officials said the death figures are on a decline each month from October. In September, Maharashtra reported 12,079 deaths, when the state had hit the peak in terms of cases and deaths in a day. The following month, the state saw around 40% (7,249) decline in deaths. In November, the number of fatalities dropped further to 3,314, which was a 54% decline from October. In December, it recorded the least number of deaths since May with 2,370 fatalities. “Various interventions, including strict treatment protocol, increased surveillance, tracing, awareness campaigns etc, over the months have resulted in the reduction in deaths. The CFR is still high at 2.55%, but that is due to the deaths reported in the earlier months of the outbreak. The situation is very much under control,” a health department official said. Meanwhile in other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Thane city reported 130 new cases and five fatalities, followed by Navi Mumbai with 88 cases and two deaths. Overall, the region reported 548 cases and 10 deaths on Saturday. Pune city recorded 298 new cases and one death on Saturday, while its rural areas reported 189 new cases and one death. Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 152 new cases and one death. Aurangabad district reported 138 new cases, while Nashik district recorded 207 new cases and four deaths.

PMC has also allowed establishments to appoint private agencies to clear the wet waste if the space to recycle the same is an issue.This latest decision has come in the light of PMC discovering that housing societies that are claiming a property tax rebate because of eco-measures introduced, are in fact, not complying with vermiculture, solar power generation or rainwater harvesting systems.Establishments generating waste of 100kg per day have until March 31, 2021, to put a recycling plan into place, or then pay a hefty fine.As per the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, “Bulk Waste Generator means and includes buildings occupied by the Central Government Departments or Undertakings, State Government Departments or Undertakings, Local Bodies, Public Sector Undertakings or Private Companies, Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Schools, Colleges, Universities, other Educational Institutions, Hostels, Hotels, Commercial Establishments, Markets, Places of Worship, Stadia and Sports Complexes, having an average waste generation rate exceeding 100kg per day (of all waste streams put together)”.Currently in areas under the PMC, there are 692 bulk waste generators of which at least 30 don’t have a mechanism to process garbage at source.Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner, said, “If establishments are giving reasons for lack of space to process wet garbage at source, they should appoint a private agency to process it. Corporation is ready to pick up dry garbage. PMC will not pick up garbage from bulk generators after March 31, 2021 and impose a fine as per law.”“If societies or establishments don’t follow this, the corporation will charge a first-time fine of ₹5,000. After giving notices if the corporation finds a society is still not following the rules, the corporation will issue a ₹10,000 fine. After a third notice, the corporation will charge ₹15000. Despite three notices and three fines, societies or establishment that continues to disobey the rules will be fined ₹15,000 for each penalty thereafter,” Khemnar added.Action on establishmentsAt present, there are 75,038 establishments - residential and commercial units - taking advantage of tax rebates for having implemented eco-measures. During inspection, the corporation found that 3,081 of these establishments are not recycling wet garbage at source.Vaibhav Kadlakh, assistant municipal commissioner, Property Tax department, said, “We get information from the ward offices and soild waste department about rebates to societies. After that, we mention the rebate and provide a final tax bill to the society or property. Now, the solid waste department has given instructions to discontinue rebates to certain societies.” No longer notices, direct action Madhav Jagtap, deputy municipal commissioner in charge of solid waste management said, “Corporation is giving a rebate to property tax bills where vermiculture, rainwater harvesting and solar panel system are set up. Most societies chose vermiculture and rainwater harvesting as it is cheaper to set up as compared to set up solar panels. The vermiculture is not maintained well is what we found in our survey.”“We were given several notices to different societies to dispose of garbage on their premises. Societies are not keen to support PMC. Therefore, we have taken the decision to discontinue rebate benefits.”‘Action is not solution’Shuas Patvardhan, chairman of Pune District Cooperative Housing Federation said, “Fines is not the solution. PMC should motivate societies and sort out their problems, such as providing space for composting and technical guidance from experts. It is a continuous process. It cannot change immediately. It needs time.He admitted, “Societies are also responsible for not maintaining units. Builders install units for rebate. But, societies fail to maintain it due to lack of guidance and expertise. PMC should have to help and counsel them about the importance of garbage problems and disposal. We are appealing to societies to cooperate with the PMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bulk-garbage-generators-clear-wet-garbage-at-source-or-get-ready-to-pay-heavy-fines-101610280748148.html

Swach is a co-operative and working on behalf of the PMC. 3,500 waste pickers of Swach cover 70 per cent of the city.The statement added: “The cooperative is owned, controlled and operated by waste pickers. This model has been recognised globally and nationally as one of the most socially, inclusive, financially responsible waste management models. PMC’s attempt to introduce private contractors under the guise of competition is a clear attempt to deprive waste pickers.”Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar opposed the extension of agreement with Swach and appealed to the PMC to appoint a new agency alleging complaints against Swach. Sutar said: “Many citizens as well as elected members also raised the question over Swach functioning.

The Pune police will be providing security to the vaccine up to the state-border for trucks bound for other states and up to the airport and other destinations within the state limits.“Today (Saturday), I had a meeting with the logistics company and SII. The transport has been outsourced to Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions. We will be providing security to the vaccine trucks. For some part, it will be by road but most of it will go by air,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police.SII refused to comment when asked about the preparedness, government response, and allocation of the vials to various destinations.Covishield, along with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was granted approval by the Drug Controller General of India on January 3 for restricted emergency use.“There is no update on vaccine transportation from Pune airport,” said Kuldeep Singh Rishi, director, Pune airport, on Saturday, who had earlier confirmed that the airport authority is ready with a cargo capacity of 500 tonnes and it can be optimised to 1,714 tonnes if the airport functions at full capacity.“We will be handling the transport from the producers to the government depots. There are some 40-42 destinations that we are looking at. From there onward to the district-level, it will be the government’s responsibility. Although, we have put forth our proposal to take up that part of the transport as well,” said Rahul Agarwal, founder, Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions, which will be playing a key role in transporting the vaccine first 3 crore for front-line workers as well as the following doses in all the states.The transport will be done partially by road and partially by air. However, air transport will reduce after the first few rounds are over.“If you consider the population, it is not going to be a two-three day process. We are looking at three-five years. The cost of air travel is much more per kg, per km. So in the initial phase, the air travel may be preferred for an emergency but slowly it will fizzle out and road transport will be preferred. More importantly, there is no live temperature tracking system on flights whereas our trucks are equipped to provide 24*7 temperature and location tracking,” said Agarwal.When asked about the time taken by road as against time required by air, Agarwal pointed out that the government facility will need time to make space for replenishment as well.While air transport will be handled by the government in coordination with Koolex, road transport will be handled by the company.“For example, to Karnal, Haryana, we will send the vials from Serum to the Pune airport, from there it will either go to Delhi or Chandigarh airport and there out trucks will take over for the final destination,” he added.The company will be providing transport for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as well as Zydus Cadila Group’s vaccine which is under trial. With a fleet of 300 trucks equipped to transport the vaccines, the company will also be taking the vaccine to neighbouring countries of Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-of-covid-vaccine-likely-to-begin-soon-pune-police-to-provide-security-101610273908450.html

In its recent order, the home department has reduced the security cover to former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, his wife Amruta, daughter Divija, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, former Uttar Pradesh governor and BJP leader Ram Naik, among others.In an order dated January 8, the security cover of around 13 persons has been scaled down while it has been increased for special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam and Congress leader Shatrughna Sinha from Y-Plus to Z and Y-plus to Y-Plus with escort, respectively.ALSO WATCH | Bhandara fire: State orders high-level probe as 10 infants die at hospitalDevendra Fadnavis’s security has been reduced to Y-plus with escorts from Z-plus, his wife Amruta and daughter Divija Fadnavis security has been downgraded from Y-plus to X category. Raj Thackeray’s security has been scaled down to Y-plus with escort from Z, Republic Party of India (A) chief and Union minister Ramdas Athawale’s escort facility has been removed from the Y-plus category security. BJP leaders Ram Naik and Ashish Shelar’s security has been reduced to Y category from Y-Plus cover.Former minister of state for home and Shiv Sena leader Deepak Kesarkar, too, is among the leaders with scaled down security. His security cover has been scaled down from Y-plus to Y category.The list however, has the names of leaders and their relatives from the ruling parties too. For some in the ruling party, the security cover has been reduced while a few others have been given additional security cover. Deputy Speaker and NCP leader Narhari Zirwal and the leader of opposition in legislative council, Pravin Darekar, have been give Y security, while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s wife Sunetra, former Shiv Sena MLA Rajesh Kshirsagar, Yuva Sena chief Varun Sardesai will enjoy X-category security.State home minister Anil Deshmukh said, "The decision about the change in security was taken by a committee of five top home department officials, based on the threat perception. During the BJP government in the state, the security cover of Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar, too, was scaled down. The decision is not political, but based on the threat perception to the leaders."A senior home department official, too, claimed that the downgrade was not political in nature. "The committee headed by the chief secretary takes a final decision on the security cover based on the threat perceptions to the leaders. There are names of Congress leaders like former minister Arif Naseem Khan, whose cover has been reduced. Over 10,000 police personnel have been affected due to Covid-19 and hundreds have died due to the infection. Besides, we have a heavy load of VVIPs visiting from other states and from the national capital of Delhi. It occupies a major chunk of the force for security,” he said, requesting anonymity.BJP has hit out at the state government, saying the downgrade has been done for vendetta politics. “Security cover to BJP leaders has been reduced due to vendetta politics and to suppress the voice of the Opposition. Senior police officers have given reports against reducing the security cover to our leaders, despite which it has been done. It is just because we have been exposing the state government for its failures on many fronts, including relief to farmers, handling of Covid-19 pandemic,” said BJP leader Ram Kadam.Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant responded by asking BJP, why the party did not question the downgrading of security cover for Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, by the BJP-led Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-reduces-security-cover-to-devendra-fadnavis-raj-thackeray-101610271748319.html

10-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress plans 'charge sheet' against BJP government||Uttarakhand Congress has formed a ‘Charge sheet Committee’ to document the alleged failures of the BJP-led state government in its four years of rule. This political ‘charge sheet’ would then be taken to every household in the state.Congress state unit in-charge Devendra Yadav announced the committee in Dehradun on Saturday. He was in Uttarakhand for a three day visit, during which, he held several meetings with party members keeping the next assembly elections in 2022 in view."The BJP government has failed on all aspects whether it is jobs, women security, farmers' issues or controlling inflation in the last about four years. To highlight these, we have formed a Charge sheet committee, which will compile all the failures into a 'charge sheet', which we will release on March 18, when the BJP government will complete its four years," said Yadav.Yadav said booth and block level workers of the Congress will visit people's houses with the 'charge sheet' to make them aware of BJP government’s alleged ‘failures’."During my visit this time, we held meetings with the booth committees to chalk out a strategy for the upcoming assembly elections. They will go among the public, learn about their issues so as to expose the government, which makes big claims but did nothing so far. We have activated our booth level workers to ensure robust coordination with the state leadership," he said.Yadav reiterated a claim made by a senior party leader that “many leaders of the ruling party are contacting Congress leadership.""They are using various channels to get in touch with our leadership. However, before welcoming anyone in the party, we will analyse if the leader has a good reputation and a clean track record or not. Only after doing this we will welcome them," said Yadav.He claimed people of the state were fed up with the BJP government."They are looking at the Congress with hope in the Assembly elections, for which we are fully prepared. We are sure that we will come to power and fulfil the dreams of the public," said Yadav.Earlier, Congress state president Pritam Singh alleged that the BJP government was "neck deep" in corruption."The government claims zero tolerance towards corruption, which is however, miles away from the reality. The level of corruption in the state is such that the high court ordered an FIR against the CM and a CBI probe in the allegations of corruption against him," said Singh.He also attacked BJP state president Bansidhar Bhagat for calling senior Congress leader Indira Hridayesh a ‘Budhiya’ during a BJP event in Nainital on Tuesday."With the kind of language he used against our leader, it clearly shows how much BJP and its leaders respect women. It seems that though Bhagat plays the role of Dashrath, he has transitioned into the character of Ravana in real life," Singh said, while taking a dig at Bhagat, who had played Dashrath in a staged enactment of Ramayana.The BJP responded by saying that the Congress leaders needed to look with ‘open eyes’ to see development in the state."If the Congress leaders look with open eyes then they could see development in the state. Or else they could see anything they want," said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice president."As far as their claim of coming to power in 2022 is concerned, nobody can stop them from dreaming, which is miles away from the ground reality, as people know what the BJP government has done for them," said Bhasin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-congress-plans-charge-sheet-against-bjp-government-101610263515788.html

10-01-2021||Delhi||Ghazipur’s poultry hub shut amid bird flu scare||The Delhi government on Saturday announced the closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the import of live birds in the Capital as a preventive measure to stop the potential spread of avian influenza, or bird flu, after more bird deaths were reported, prompting the shutdown of a few recreational parks and the Sanjay Lake.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a digital news briefing that while no confirmed case had so far been registered in Delhi, the government was taking all possible measures to prevent the spread of bird flu.The government’s move came at a time when at least 64 birds were found dead in various locations across the national capital over the past few days. The deaths led the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which maintains most of the big parks in the city, to shut at least four major district parks in Hauz Khaz, Dwarka Sector 9, Hastsal and Sanjay Lake as a precautionary measure until further orders.While experts supported the decision as a preventive measure, traders at the Ghazipur market and poultry retailers said it would impact the availability of chicken and eggs in the market. According to the government’s animal husbandry department, at least 250,000 live birds (chicken) arrive in Delhi every day and almost all of them are sold out in retail the same day. On Sundays, theses arrivals and sales nearly double.Kejriwal said that the results of the first set of samples collected from Delhi sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar for testing and the reports will come on Monday. “In view of the prevailing situation and to prevent the virus from spreading in the city, the Delhi government has taken two very important decisions today. Firstly, we have put a complete ban on imports of live birds in the city. Secondly, the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market has been ordered shut for 10 days,” he said.The government has also launched a 24-hour helpline number – 23890318 – for people to report any spotting of dead birds or seek assistance.Seven states – Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh – have reported the outbreak, which began in December-end. No case among the human population has been reported.A senior DDA official said that at the Sanjay Lake in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase II, 10 ducks were found dead. “The samples have been sent to ascertain the cause of death. Besides, 24 crows died in the last four days at the district park in Jasola. DDA is monitoring the situation closely and is in touch with other government agencies. Meanwhile, precautionary measures like spraying of disinfectant are being carried out in the DDA parks,” the official said on condition of anonymity.While four major parks mentioned above have been shut Saturday onwards, the district park in Jasola was not immediately shut.“We are monitoring the situation. We have closed Hauz Khas parks as a lot of people visit it, especially during the weekend,” said the DDA official.On Friday, the government’s animal husbandry department found nearly 50 carcasses of crows in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, Dwarka and Hastsal in west Delhi.Dr Rakesh Singh of the animal husbandry department said that until Friday, a total of 104 samples were sent from Delhi to Jalandhar. Five more samples were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, ICAR, Bhopal on Saturday.“Of the 104 samples that have been sent already, 100 are faecal and blood samples and four are dead crows,” he said. He said the first set of results will come in by Monday.Traders in Ghazipur, meanwhile, appealed to the chief minister to conduct sample tests at poultry farms in other states from where live birds arrive in Delhi.At least 1,200 birds were found dead across the country on Saturday, including 900 in a poultry farm in Maharashtra, with the Centre saying that the outbreak of avian influenza has been reported in Uttar Pradesh, taking the total number of affected states to seven.The Centre said the reports of samples collected in Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra were awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ghazipurs-poultry-hub-shut-amid-bird-flu-scare-101610224779543.html
10-01-2021||Bhopal||Woman dies by suicide, kin seek case under MP religious conversion law||The family members of a 26-year-old woman who recently died by suicide in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal have sought a case against her partner under the newly enacted Freedom of Religion Ordinance 2020, alleging that he was forcing the woman to convert.The Madhya Pradesh Dharmik Swatantrata (Freedom of Religion) Ordinance, 2020, came into effect on Saturday after the state government issued a gazette notification. The ordinance, which was signed by MP governor Anandiben Patel on January 7, prescribes a punishment of two to 10 years in prison and a fine of ₹50,000 for forcing women to change their religion.The police said the woman died by suicide on Friday and had named the accused in a note. Superintendent of police, Bhopal (south), Sai Krishna Thota, said the accused has been booked under sections 376 (rape), 309 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code, and relevant sections of the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act.The brother of the deceased, however, lodged a complaint with the police on Saturday, accusing the man of forcing his sister to convert for marriage. The brother also accused the man of sexually abusing the woman. “The man hid his religion from my sister as he introduced himself as Babloo. When she came to know about his religion, accused started harassing her. He forced my sister for conversion for marriage but she refused. He left her and also harassed her sexually and mentally,” said the brother.The accused, meanwhile, told the police that he was in a relationship with the woman for the past eight years. He said the relationship ended with mutual consent due to opposition from their families and after his family fixed his marriage, said an officer familiar with the probe.Deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Bhopal, Irshad Wali said: “Police are investigating the case and taking legal opinion on how to register the case under sections of new MP Freedom of Religion Act 2020, which has a provision of imprisonment up to 10 years and fine up to ₹1 lakh for forcing anyone for conversion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/woman-dies-by-suicide-kin-seek-case-under-mp-religious-conversion-law-101610223852077.html
10-01-2021||Kolkata||Nadda reaches out to farmers, defends laws||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Saturday launched a farmer outreach drive in poll-bound West Bengal as he defended the newly enacted farm laws and credited the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government with working for the benefit of the farmers.The campaign comes against the backdrop of an ongoing farmers’ protest against the three contentious farm laws. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 26, demanding a repeal of these laws.“Ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre, Prime Minster Narendra Modi has made a six-fold increase in the central budget for farmers. These will enable farmers to set the price of their products and choose the buyer,” Nadda said while launching the ‘Krishok Surokkha’ (farmers’ protection) programme at Jagadanandapur village in the Katwa area of East Burdwan district.The BJP president announced that the party would hold 40,000 such meetings across Bengal in the run-up to the upcoming assembly elections.Saturday marked Nadda’s second visit to the state in two months. Last year on December 10, during a two-day visit, Nadda’s convoy came under attack when stones were pelted at it. The BJP accused the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of orchestrating the attack, leading to a new flashpoint in the tussle between the Centre and the state. The ministry of home affairs called the three IPS officers who were responsible for providing security to the BJP chief back on central deputation but the TMC refused to send them, accusing the Centre of political vendetta. It also denied any role in the attack on Nadda’s convoy.Later, addressing a press conference in Kolkata, Nadda hit out at the TMC, alleging that the party never represented the Bengali culture but symbolized “anarchy and corruption”.Nadda alleged that the TMC was working with a criminal instinct and had institutionalised corruption.“The TMC never represented true Bengali culture. It represents anarchy, corruption and extortion. The BJP and Syama Prasad Mookerjee represent true Bengali culture,” Nadda said, amid accusations by the TMC that the BJP does not have any idea about the culture of Bengal.He also reiterated that the Centre was determined to implement the new citizenship law in the country but did not set any timeframe. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be implemented in letter and spirit. We are committed. We are framing the rules,” said Nadda.During the visit, Nadda also launched “Ek Muthi Chawal” (a fistful of rice), a programme under which he collected rice from farmers and briefed them about the benefits of the new farm laws. “The warmth you all have shown to welcome me shows you have decided that Mamata Banerjee government is going to be shown the door and BJP will form the govt in Bengal. Your happiness and confidence shows the public is ready to welcome us to form the government,” Nadda said.Nadda accused the TMC leadership of indulging in corruption and misappropriating ration sent by the Centre during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Smuggling of coal and sand is all that you hear about these days. The Calcutta high court ordered an audit into the expenses made towards relief (after cyclone Amphan). But the government challenged it in the Supreme Court. Why? Why is Mamata Banerjee so worried?” said Nadda.Reacting to Nadda’s remarks, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “Nadda hails from Himachal Pradesh. What does he know about Bengal? Spreading misinformation will not help the BJP. The TMC will return to power with absolute majority.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/nadda-reaches-out-to-farmers-defends-laws-101610223488606.html
10-01-2021||City||Fire breaks out at hospital in Maharashtra, 10 infants dead||Ten infants were killed after a fire broke out at the neonatal care ward of the district municipal hospital in Maharashtra’s Bhandara on Saturday morning. Only seven of 17 newborns in the ward could be rescued, said an official.Dr Pramod Khandate, civil surgeon of Bhandara district, said a fire broke out in the Sick Newborn Care Unit around 2am on Saturday. “The hospital nurse first noticed smoke coming out of the neonatal section and informed the hospital authorities. Fire brigade was also called to the hospital immediately which rescued seven babies who have been shifted to another ward,” he added.Shubhangi Sathavne and Smita Ambilduke, the two nurses who were on night duty, said they heard explosion-like sounds in the neonatal ward. “When we rushed inside, smoke filled our noses and eyes. We could not see anything, but heard glass shattering. We raised the alarm and with the help of security guards and fire brigade staff rescued seven of the children,” they were quoted as saying by news agency PTI.According to an official familiar with the matter, at least three of the 10 infants were charred to death, while the rest possibly died of asphyxiation. “The exact cause of death would be ascertained after post-mortem,” Khandate said.The cause of the fire in the four-storey building is yet to be ascertained. Preliminary investigations suggested that a short circuit caused it, a fire department official said on condition of anonymity. “It was said that heaters were being used for the newborn babies at the hospital. It may be the reason for the short circuit there,” the official said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the incident on Twitter. “Heart-wrenching tragedy in Bhandara, Maharashtra, where we have lost precious young lives. My thoughts are with all the bereaved families. I hope the injured recover as early as possible,” he posted.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray called the incident “very unfortunate”, and announced aid of ₹5 lakh for family members of the deceased.“At present, the entire health care system and hospitals are fighting with coronavirus pandemic. The state government will not tolerate any compromise with security and safety of the hospitals. To make sure such incidents are not repeated I have directed to check fire audit status of all the hospitals in the state,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said a six-member committee headed by director, health, Sadhana Tayade will conduct an inquiry into the fire and submit a report within three days.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi condoled the deaths. “The unfortunate incident of fire at Bhandara District General Hospital in Maharashtra is extremely tragic,” he wrote on Twitter.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former energy minister of the state, Chandrashekhar Bawankule, claimed that relatives of the infants had complained about power fluctuations in the ward last week.“The relatives had asked the hospital staff to check electric switches etc, but apparently no action was taken,” Bawankule told PTI.He also alleged that the hospital didn’t have proper fire safety equipment, and a proposal to purchase fire safety equipment worth over ₹1 crore sent to the health department was pending for approval.Former Maharashtra chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, too, termed the incident “very painful”, and demanded a thorough probe.Parents of the deceased children, meanwhile, were struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. “We had not even named our daughter and now we have got her burnt dead body,” said Vishwanath Behere, a labourer.Vandana Shedam (28) said she lived in the hospital itself as her seven-day-old daughter was admitted to the neonatal ward for being underweight. “We came to know about the fire around 2am but had no idea of the condition of my baby till 8 in the morning. Then they put her burnt body before me,” she said.An RTI application has revealed that the fire safety audit of the Bhandara Civil Hospital was not done since 2018. Moreover, the district administration had sent a proposal of over ₹1.52 crore for purchasing fire safety equipment for the hospital on May 12 last year to the joint director (health services), Mumbai, which has not been addressed yet.RTI activist Vikas Madankar, who sought information from the district health department regarding the fire safety measures of the Bhandara Civil Hospital, was informed a few months ago that fire hydrants, sprinklers, smoke alarm, fire escape ladder and fire escape routes, which are mandatory in such institutions, are not available in the hospital.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-breaks-out-at-hospital-in-maharashtra-10-infants-dead-101610222887905.html

The JD(U) contested on 115 seats in the 2020 assembly elections and won 43, a drop from the 71 seats it won five years ago. The BJP, an ally of the JD(U), bagged 74 seats and the opposition RJD emerged as the single-largest party in the 243-member assembly with 75 seats.“The seat distribution within the NDA should have been done five months prior to the elections but that was not done and as a result, JD(U) had to pay a big price.Nitish’s comments come against the backdrop of six JD(U) legislators joining the BJP in Arunachal in December, leaving the party with just one MLA in the 60-member state assembly.Reacting to Nitish’s remark, BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said: “This kind of assessment is good to strengthen the inner party system and overcome negative factors. Good that our NDA partner JD (U) is working towards strengthening the party."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/delay-in-deciding-distribution-of-seats-cost-jd-u-in-polls-nitish-kumar-101610221609015.html

Rampal Jat, National President of Kisan Mahapanchayat said, “Dilawar should give list of such bird flu-infected persons who are spreading bird flu and also the terrorist/robbers who are participating in the farmer agitation”.Rampal said that Dilawar has made a vague allegation just to grab headlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/socalled-farmers-enjoying-chicken-biryani-trying-to-spread-bird-flu-bjp-mla-101610217359930.html
10-01-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal urges Centre to give Covid vaccine for free to all||Describing the Covid-19 pandemic as the “biggest epidemic of the century”, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged the Central government to provide vaccines for free to all citizens of the country.“The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest epidemic of the century. It is very important to protect our people from this. I request the Central Government that the vaccine should be provided free of cost to all countrymen. The expenditure on this will be helpful in saving the lives of many Indians,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Senior officials in the chief minister’s office said Kejriwal is likely to reiterate the free vaccination demand during the scheduled interaction of chief ministers with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. This will be his first meeting of the PM with CMs of all states after the recent approval of the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, for restricted emergency use by the country’s drugs regulator.Delhi, like all other states, will also start the Covid vaccination drive from January 16.Earlier, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said that Covid vaccine doses will be provided free of cost to all Delhi residents and asserted that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government had made all preparations for the vaccination drive.“The Delhi government had so far made preparations to vaccinate 100,000 people in a day,” Jain added.Chief minister Kejriwal had said on December 24 last year that a total of 5.1 million people, under the Centre’s primary category, would be administered Covid-19 vaccine doses in the first phase. He further segregated the primary category into health care and front line workers, senior citizens and those with co-morbidities. Kejriwal also said that each person would be given two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-urges-centre-to-give-covid-vaccine-for-free-to-all-101610217094684.html
10-01-2021||Kolkata||JP Nadda sharpens attack on Mamata Banerjee, avoids naming Abhishek||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda, who visited West Bengal for about 10 hours on Saturday, sharpened his attack on chief minister Mamata Banerjee, alleging that she has lost her credibility because in Bengal “corruption has been institutionalized, the administration has been politicized and politics has been criminalized.”Nadda, who visited a village at Katwa in East Burdwan district to launch the party’s first poll campaign aimed at Bengal’s farmers and later held a massive roadshow in the district’s Burdwan town, told the media in the evening that the TMC, which brands BJP leaders as “outsider,” does not represent Bengal’s culture but the BJP does.Nadda reiterated at the press conference that the Centre was determined to implement the new citizenship law in the country but did not set any timeframe. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be implemented in letter and spirit. We are committed. We are framing the rules,” said Nadda.Interestingly, for the first time, Nadda did not refer to Mamata Banerjee as pishi (aunt) and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee as bhaipo in Bengali. During one of his speeches he said, “While the farmer’s income has touched the bottom, that of the 'naya rajkumar' (new prince) has gone up 200 times.”When asked who he was referring to as the 'new prince', Nadda said, “The masses know who he is. They were taking his name today. Why do you want me to name him?”Nadda also refused to comment on Madhya Pradesh minister Narottam Mishra’s comment during a recent visit to a Bengal district. Mishra had said that once the BJP comes to power in the state it will introduce a law against inter-religious marriage commonly referred to as love jihad. The Madhya Pradesh government introduced the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion ordinance 2020 on Thursday.“Our only jihad (holy war in Islam) is against infiltrators,” said Nadda.Significantly, the exchange of rhetoric between the BJP and the TMC revolved around Bengal’s history and culture throughout Saturday although Nadda made several remarks on politics and the state’s economy. For every comment that Nadda made in Katwa at Burdwan, replies from TMC leaders came at ruling party rallies in other districts.Also read: Bengal governor meets Amit Shah, fears violence in run-up to crucial polls“Do coal mafia, extortion, politics of appeasement and cow smuggling represent the rich culture of Bengal? There was a time when people used to say “What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow.” The state contributed immensely to the freedom struggle and every intellectual movement. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, founder of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (parent party of the BJP) was a pride of Bengal. We drew inspiration from Bengal to build the nation. We present the true culture of Bengal,” said Nadda.Nadda, whose wife is a Bengali, quipped, “In personal life, I live Bengal.”“On the other hand, the language Mamata Banerjee has used in her comments on me and the Prime Minister is not befitting of a chief minister,” he added.Several TMC leaders reacted to Nadda’s comments. While addressing a TMC rally in North 24 Parganas district, Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “These BJP leaders, including Narendra Modi, parrot a few lines from Tagore’s poems from written scripts. Ask them to recite the next four lines and they will go silent. They cannot become Bengalis or know its culture and heritage overnight.”Nadda also said that during the day Bengal ranks 24th among the 29 states when it comes to procurement price paid to farmers. He launched the BJP’s first campaign for Bengal’s farmers at Jagadanandapur village in the Katwa area of East Burdwan, which is considered the state’s rice bowl.“Ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a six-fold increase in the central budget for farmers. He implemented the minimum support price recommended by the Swaminathan committee. The new farm laws will make farmers free. These will enable farmers to set the price of their products and choose the buyer,” Nadda said while launching the 'Krishok Surokkha' (farmers’ protection) programme.Nadda announced that 40,000 such meetings will be held across Bengal before the assembly elections.Nadda’s plane landed at Andal airport in West Burdwan district. He flew to Katwa and Burdwan town in a chopper.He also launched the door-to-door rice collection programme which has been named 'Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah' (collecting a fistful of rice) campaign. He visited five homes and collected the rice.Also read: Extremists could return to Washington, disrupt Biden’s inauguration: Report“The 'Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah' campaign is to reassert the party and its government's commitment and conviction towards the growth, progress and prosperity of farmers. Before the 2021 Vidhan Sabha elections in West Bengal, the BJP will reach out to the homes of all the 73 lakh villagers across the state,” the BJP central office in Delhi said in the statement on Friday.After collecting the rice, Nadda visited the home of Mathura Mondal, a farmer, to have lunch. Before addressing the rally he offered prayers at the popular Radha Gobinda temple associated with 15th-century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.The TMC government is planning to hold a special session of the legislative assembly to introduce a resolution against the Centre’s recent farm laws that led to unrest in Punjab.Reacting to the campaign, Saugata Roy said, “Thousands of farmers are agitating outside the gates of Delhi against the Centre’s farm laws. Nadda should talk to the farmers if he dares to face them.”“During my last visit on December 10, I was welcomed differently,” Nadda said, referring to the attack on his convoy. “Today I saw people in a different mood. The enthusiasm I notice shows that people of Bengal have made up their mind to welcome the BJP. Mamata Banerjee has now written to the Prime Minister that she wants to implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi programme. We have been asking her for a long time to do it,” said Nadda.“The Calcutta High Court ordered an audit into the expenses made towards relief (after cyclone Amphan). But the government challenged it in the Supreme Court. Why? Why is she worried?” said Nadda.Nadda offered prayers at the historic Sarbamangala temple in Burdwan town and led a roadshow from Burdwan Clock Tower to the Curzon Gate.He addressed the media and the party's core committee members before returning to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/jp-nadda-sharpens-attack-on-mamata-banerjee-avoids-naming-abhishek-101610216985727.html

Officials cited that due to a high volume of samples at the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar, the test results are getting delayed.“Nothing concrete can be said about the avian influenza until the test results are declared. It will take nearly 15 days as informed by the lab. Until then we will continue to monitor the status as migratory birds are arriving at Sultanpur bird sanctuary,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurugram on Saturday. According to him, the park has been closed for public since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity park, where carcasses of four crows and one egret were found on Friday morning, will continue to remain open. Samples of two birds have been sent for testing while other birds are buried. Amid a bird flu scare in the national Capital, Sanjay lake and three recreational parks were closed on Saturday. Officials in Gurugram said that the parks in the district will remain open as there is no fear of infection yet.Subhash Yadav, metropolitan green planner in GMDA’s urban environment division, said, “Decision of closing major parks like Tau Devi Lal, and those in sectors 29 and 22 will be taken after test results are out or in case if we find more carcasses.”Haryana has notified an outbreak of influenza strain H5N8, with Panchkula’s Ganauli and Kheri being declared as the epicentre. In Gurugram, to keep an eye on the situation, 28 teams have been formed by the animal husbandry department to check poultry farms and markets for sick or dead birds.

10-01-2021||Delhi||Two minors held for murdering 10-year-old, hiding body in mosque||Two boys — aged 12 and 17 years — allegedly killed a 10-year-old in a mosque in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas area and then hid his body on the same premises with a plan to extort money, the police said on Saturday after apprehending both the suspects.This was the duo’s second attempt in 10 days to kill the boy, said Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (north-east). “The first time they had offered him water mixed with sleeping pills, but it didn’t have any impact on the boy,” said the DCP.The victim, investigators claimed, lived with his parents and his father owns a footwear manufacturing unit.The two suspects lived in the same neighbourhood as the victim.“The 17-year-old had lured the 12-year-old plan to commit the murder and then extort money. The boys didn’t have any concrete plan on how to go about the extortion or the amount to ask. They just thought that they would somehow inform the boy’s father that his child was with them and would be released only if the money was paid. The two boys planned to flee from their homes after getting the money,” said the DCP, based on initial details shared by the two alleged juveniles.So, after the first failed attempt, the boys allegedly caught hold of the victim a second time when he was walking to the local mosque around 6.30pm on Thursday.“They gave some cash to the boy and asked him to buy momos from a stall. They then asked him to accompany them to the first floor of the mosque to eat the momos together,” said the DCP.After having the momos, they lured the boy to the terrace where the younger of them grabbed the 10-year-old victim’s feet while the older one strangulated him, said the police.Thereafter, they dragged his body to the second floor where they hid in amid some debris and covered it with a sack containing cement.Meanwhile, the victim’s father approached police with a missing persons complaint upon which a probe was launched and boy’s friends and relatives questioned. When the police got to know that the boy was last spotted walking to the mosque, they focused their probe there and got to know that the victim was last seen with the two boys. The police searched the mosque and recovered the boy’s body.The DCP said that CCTV footage from the mosque was scanned, revealing the role of the two boys mentioned by the public.“We spoke to the two boys separately and there were contradictions in their statements. They finally owned up to the crime,” the officer said, adding that it continues to be probed if any adults were involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-minors-held-for-murdering-10-year-old-hiding-body-in-mosque-101610216304221.html
10-01-2021||Delhi||10 ducks, 2 crows die in Sanjay Lake triggering fears of avian influenza spread||At least 10 ducks and a couple of crows were found dead between Friday and Saturday in the Sanjay Lake, a popular water-body developed by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri near Mayur Vihar, sparking fears of an outbreak of bird flu (avian influenza) in the city.A senior DDA official said that 24 crows were found dead over a period of four days between January 5 and January 8 in the district park in Jasola Vihar in south-east Delhi.On Saturday, four district parks — in Hauz Khas, Hastsal, Dwarka sector 9 and Sanjay Lake — were closed for public. The district park in Jasola has not been shut for public as of now.“We are monitoring the situation. We have closed Hauz Khas park as a lot of people visit it, especially during the weekend,” said the official.A senior DDA official said, “At Sanjay Lake, at least 10 ducks were found dead. Their samples have been sent to ascertain the cause of death. Besides that, at least 24 crows have died in the last four days at the district park in Jasola. DDA is monitoring the situation closely and is in touch with other government agencies. Meanwhile, precautionary measures like spraying of disinfectants is being carried out in all DDA parks.”The deaths of the ducks and the crows came to fore on Saturday, a day after the carcasses of dozens of crows were found in a park in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Phase-3, Dwarka and Hastsal .The deaths have triggered fear of an outbreak of bird flu and has prompted authorities to collect samples of dead birds and send them to laboratories to ascertain if the deaths were caused by the potential spread of the virus, similar to the one that has affected at least six other states. The report of the samples collected on Friday is expected on Monday.The death of the birds in the last few days has also prompted the government to order closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and impose a ban on the import of live poultry in the city. The government said the measures were preventive in nature and aimed at checking the spread of the avian influenza.Also, on Saturday, at least three crows were found dead in three separate parks located near Krishna Kunj Apartments, a residential society in Rohini Sector-15. The samples of the three birds were not collected before the carcasses being buried by the authorities, as officials believed that the deaths were not caused by avian influenza.“Sample testing is done only when birds die in groups of 10 or more. As far as the carcasses of the three crows are concerned, they were found in three separate parks, each at a distance of nearly 300 metres,” said a municipal corporation doctor, who visited the spots but did not want to be named.According to the doctor, the crows in Rohini were found dead around 11.30 am by residents, who informed the local resident welfare association (RWA) and its officials in turn alerted the authorities.On Saturday morning, 10 ducks died one after another at the Sanjay Lake complex, where nearly 450 ducks are kept and looked after by caretakers employed by the DDA.When HT visited Sanjay Lake on Saturday afternoon, one of the largest green areas in east Delhi and spread over 69 hectares, several dead fish were also found floating in the artificial lake located within the premises.The employees working there said that apart from 10 ducks that died on Saturday morning, two more ducks had died late on Friday evening, while two crows were also found dead in the park the same morning.“Around 6am, all the ducks were taken out of the barn and left in the lake to swim. Around 11am, four-five of them began swimming in circles.. Some more ducks also showed similar symptoms. We immediately rushed them to the barn and gave them medicine. But 10 of them died and we informed our senior officers,” said a caretaker, requesting anonymity.A security guard at the premises said that a medical team, along with DDA officials, arrived after being informed about the deaths and collected samples of five-six dead ducks. “After the sample collection, the dead ducks were buried near the barn on the instructions of the doctors,” the guard said.Despite the death of the ducks, the recreational area remained open and scores of visitors, including children, were seen playing, walking, fishing, and enjoying boating in the lake throughout Saturday. Many visitors were unaware of the deaths of the ducks while a few did know about the possible scare of the bird flu in some states.Farid, a resident of Trilokpuri who claimed to be present near the lake when the ducks died, said “I often come here (Sanjay Lake) to collect dry wood. Today, some 12-14 ducks fell unconscious soon after they were taken out of the lake. They all died and were buried.”About the deaths of the fish, Shiv Bahadur Singh, another employee at the Sanjay Lake said, “We are also baffled by the deaths of the fish. It could also be because of the extreme weather conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10-ducks-two-crows-die-in-sanjay-lake-triggering-fears-of-avian-influenza-spread-in-city-101610215704182.html
10-01-2021||Delhi||All 256 test -ve for Covid in Delhi on Day 2 of UK flight resumption||All 256 passengers who arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport from the United Kingdom (UK) on Saturday tested negative for Covid and were sent for a seven days of mandatory institutional quarantine.The 256 passengers landed in Delhi around 1pm on Vistara flight UK18 that had departed Heathrow airport late on Friday night. As soon as they landed, the passengers were escorted by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel for their immigration clearance, baggage collection and customs clearance. They were then whisked away to a waiting hall to get their RT-PCR tests done.Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder and director of Genestrings diagnostics that is conducting the RT-PCR tests at the Delhi airport, said none of the 256 passengers tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday.“We gave all the reports within 4-5 hours. We also had our staff strength increased to make sure the process is smooth and quick. The tests were completed smoothly. The flights arriving from the UK are under tight scrutiny given the high alert due to the new strain circulating there. Hence, multidisciplinary operational and administrative teams — comprising CISF, Delhi government officials, Delhi Police personnel and GMR-DIAL officials — have been deputed to ensure highest level of security and checks,” she said.Officials at the airport said those who have tested positive so far since Friday, have been sent to Covid designated hospitals while those found negative, were sent for a seven days institutional quarantine, as per the new rule.On Friday afternoon, the Delhi government issued an order making it mandatory for all UK returnees to undergo a seven-day institutional quarantine, even if they tested negative. International returnees, other than those coming in from the UK, can apply for exemption from institutional quarantine online, produce a negative Covid-19 report, and can quarantine for 14 days at home.Officials said the flight, UK18, was to initially supposed to bring 291 passengers but 35 of them cancelled their trip because of the new mandatory quarantine rules.On Friday, the first flight that landed in India from the the UK after 16 days of ban, brought 256 passengers, out of which two tested positive for Covid-19 at Delhi airport.Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said all those who opted for paid quarantine facility were taken to Aerocity where some hotels have been declared as Covid quarantine facilities. “We have adequate deployment in place at the hotels as well as at the testing centre to make sure that everyone gets tested and no one manages to escape,” Ranjan said.A senior government official in-charge at the airport said of the 512 passengers who arrived from the UK on Friday and Saturday, only 5 opted for the free government facility at Terapanth Bhawan in South Delhi’s Chhatarpur area.A Delhi government spokesperson said all protocols laid down by them are being followed in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/all-256-test-ve-for-covid-in-delhi-on-day-2-of-uk-flight-resumption-101610215405522.html
10-01-2021||Delhi||10 men, many walkie-talkies, one open-top jeep:How one group keeps Singhu secure||From dealing with suspected pickpockets to rushing the sick into ambulances, and from patrolling the congested seven-kilometre long farmers’ protest site to clearing traffic along this stretch, a group of 10 men wielding walkie-talkies and driving an open-top jeep say they are in charge of security at Singhu Border.On Thursday, when hundreds of farmers took out a tractor march, this security vehicle played an important role, the men manning it said. “We travelled alongside the tractors and repeatedly went back and forth to ensure no queues were broken and the farmers were not undisciplined,” says Mandeep Singh Gill, one of the security men, breaking away routinely to hear the audio on his walkie-talkie.The “security team” has left no stone unturned to make their presence felt at the site. A large LED board atop the jeep continuously rolls out the words ‘Security Patrol’ in English, and the farmers manning the security vehicle used loudspeakers and hooters to announce their arrival.While it is the farmers who are providing the security arrangement, the vehicle — that bears a Delhi registration number plate — belongs to Gurdeep Singh Sidhu, of Bhogpur in Punjab’s Jalandhar.“I was using the jeep as a private vehicle in Jalandhar. But soon after farmers began assembling here, I knew there would be security issues, and I donated my vehicle temporarily for use as a security patrol,” Sidhu said.The security team works around the clock, he says, patrolling the stretch multiple times. “Farmers across the stretch have the phone numbers of the security team and give them a call at the slightest hint of trouble,” he said.In recent weeks, the group said, they have saved the lives of at least three farmers who fell seriously ill and had to be rushed to an ambulance. “We would load them in the vehicle and zoom through the congested route to reach the nearest ambulance. Since most farmers know about us, they quickly make way to facilitate our movement,” Gill says.The toughest job, however, these security men say, is clearing traffic for movement of essential vehicles through the maze of other parked vehicles and the tents set up here.“Since we are fully aware of the entire route, we are able to reach any such point quickly. A few weeks here has taught us how to clear the traffic,” said Gill.In the daytime, as many as six security men patrol in this vehicle. At nights, usually just two or three men make the rounds.While the Delhi Police is stationed at one end of the protest site of the Singhu Border, they have maintained a safe distance and do not venture amidst the farmers. Much of the protest site falls in the jurisdiction of Haryana, but the Haryana police are also only guarding the outer areas and do not mix up with protesting farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/10-men-many-walkie-talkies-one-open-top-jeep-how-one-group-keeps-singhu-secure-101610214084183.html

Following recovery of a suicide note, the Jamalpur police on Friday booked five people, including three women, for abetment to suicide, as they had been threatening the deceased with the intention of grabbing his house in Thalla village, Phillaur, Jalandhar.The accused have been identified as Mahinder Kaur, an NRI; Poonam, alias Nand Rani, and her husband, Aman, of Wadala village, Phillaur; Amrit Singh of Thalla village of Phillaur, who is the husband of the village sarpanch; and Gurdev Kaur, alias Baldev Kaur. In his complaint to the police, the deceased’s son said his father used to live with his maternal uncle and aunt in Thalla village. After the death of her husband, the aunt had transferred a 188 square yards house to his name. This left the aunt’s relatives vexed and they started threatening his father to grab the house, and filed a fake rape complaint to coerce him. This left him deeply disturbed and he hanged himself at his office on Thursday.Assistant sub-inspector Paramjit Singh said they had launched a manhunt for the arrest of the accused, who had been booked under Sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-realtor-ends-life-nri-woman-among-5-booked-for-abetment-101610196503380.html
