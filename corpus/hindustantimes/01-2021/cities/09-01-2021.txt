The raid was conducted following orders of additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 1) Deepak Pareek in the wake of overcharging complaints by visitors to the hospital. The complainants had also alleged that the parking staff assaulted them when they objected to exorbitant parking fees.Therefore, the ADCP sent police personnel to the hospital in civil clothes. After they parked a scooter in the parking lot, the staff demanded ₹20 as parking fee instead of the approved ₹5. When the cops objected to overcharging, the employees hurled abuses at them. This led to the arrest of one of the employees. He along, with a co-worker and their contractor, were booked under Section 384 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code at the Division Number 2 police station.Gurmel Singh, a visitor, said the staff had two types of parking slips, which did not carry the fee rate to pull wool over the visitors’ eyes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-sting-finds-parking-staff-at-ludhiana-civil-hospital-fleecing-visitors-3-booked-for-extortion-101610216844299.html

As the eighth round of talks with the government over the rollback of the three farm laws ended in a stalemate on Friday, protesting farmers said they are in it for the long haul and won’t budge till their demands are met.The UP Gate protest site has been turned into a “city of tents”, occupied by an estimated 9,000-10,000 people who have come from different parts of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab. The farmers, through their own contributions, have roped in two 52-seater buses, to ferry them to and from UP Gate, which is about 250km from Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand.“Private buses have been roped in by different associations from Udham Singh Nagar and they are footing the bill for fuel, etc. For protesters, it is a free of cost journey to UP Gate and back. The buses are making it easier for women to join the protest. Otherwise, they had to travel in tractor-trolleys. It is also useful as protesters can now go back home and then return easily with the help of these buses,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and a member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee. Volunteers are also seizing the long stay opportunity and have come up with “Sanjhi Sath” – a form of “digital chaupal” which is attracting a number of farmers.“At the Sanjhi Sath, we have a collection of about 100 titles of books in Hindi, English and Gurmukhi. Farmers can come and read these books free of cost. Besides, we have made arrangements for newspapers to be delivered daily. Further, we have a projector through which we play historical and patriotic films. We have added the concept of “Ek Pradesh” in which different cultural, social and other aspects of one state per day is discussed in a forum,” said Ravneet Kaur, a volunteer from Udham Singh Nagar who is also spearheading and coordinating activities of the women-only camp at UP Gate. She says that the UP Gate site has a large number of youths. “So, we intend to channelise their energies and time properly and they get new things to learn from being at the protest site. We are telling them about the Constitution, different government schemes and even showing them documentaries on the lives of Mahatma Gandhi, Dr BR Ambedkar and Sardar Bhagat Singh, among other eminent personalities,” she added.Twenty-two-year-old Shah Nawaz has also arrived at UP Gate from Udham Singh Nagar, where he operates a barber shop. “With the help of NGOs I collected a mirror and other items, besides which some farmers provided me a chair. With these, I have opened up a saloon for free and offer cutting and shaving services here. Every farmer should look neat and tidy. So, I have come here and will stay with them and provide free services till they stay here,” he said, while adding that his shop in his home town is being run by one of his assistants while he is away. Likewise, another group of farmers who have come to UP Gate are providing free-of-cost shoes shine service to farmers. “We are doing it free of cost, be it shoe or liquid polish, for our farmers. We have a sufficient quantity with us and will continue to offer our services till the protest goes on,” said Harjinder Singh, a farmer who has come from Shahjahanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-protest-free-buses-from-uttarakhand-digital-chaupal-among-newly-added-facilities-at-up-gate-101610216725484.html

The move comes after the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) conducted a study and found some technical faults in the U-turns, which have been leading to traffic jams and accidents. SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority said that the CRRI was assigned to conduct a study of MP – 1 road, which connects the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway to Sector 61, a road from Sector 62 to Sector 71, and a road on the Noida Sector 37-Capt Shashikant Sharma marg. “The CRRI has found that most of the U-turns are very small and narrow, which creates problems for vehicles in navigating. We have planned to modify these U-turns,” he said.Sometimes, vehicles taking the U-turn and those coming straight on to the road left of the U-turn navigate closely, which creates high risk for accidents. Mishra said that the Authority will issue tenders and hire contractors to make necessary changes. “The entire process will take about six months,” he said. Experts believe that U-turns in the city are not scientifically planned. Anurag Kulshrestha, president of TRAX, an NGO working towards road safety, said: “Sometimes a pedestrian crossing is developed into a U-turn, and in absence of any other means pedestrians also end up using the U-turn, which leads to accidents. There should also be a proper signboard 20-30 metres before the U-turn to guide motorists. Sometimes, motorists wanting to go straight run into the U-turn only to realise that it’s not an additional lane, which leads to confusion,” he said.Kulshreshta said that these U-turns should also be of good height, so that vehicles do not run over it. “The U-turns should be as per the guidelines of the Indian Roads Congress, the apex body of highway engineers of the country,” he said. Meanwhile, Noida Traffic police and the authority have planned to install warning boards at 35 ‘black spots’ on roads that have witnessed frequent fatal accidents in Gautam Budh Nagar. Of the 35 black spots, 18 are identified on internal roads, 11 on Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and Yamuna Expressway, and six on National Highway 91 and 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-authority-to-modify-over-20-u-turns-in-city-101610216725046.html

Around 50 home buyers said that they had invested in Mahagun Mywoods’ Phase 3 project, which is coming up in Greater Noida West, but the developer has allegedly delayed the possession. Rajiv Ranjan, a homebuyer, said that the developer had advertised the phase 3 project in 2013. “They had planned to develop seven towers, each 28 stories high, each floor having eight apartments. There was a plan to develop around 1,500 apartments in the project, named Wing 8 and Wing 9. Wing 8 has four towers and Wing 9 has three towers. The developer had earlier promised possession to homebuyers in 2017 and 2018. However, for the last two years, we are seeing a very slow pace of development. There are few workers at the project and we feel the project will be further delayed. We have gathered to protest and demand swift delivery of the apartments as most of the home buyers have already paid 80-90% of the project money,” he said. Ranjit Singh, another homebuyer, said that homebuyers are living on rent and while also paying monthly instalments for the loans they had taken for the flats. “I had booked a 2BHK apartment in 2016 and the delivery was planned in 2018. We have been holding meetings with the developer and the deadline is always extended by a few months. We demand assurance as to when the project would be delivered,” he said. The buyers wore black clothes and black bands on their heads, as a mark of protest. They also waved banners and raised slogans against the developer. Amit Jain, Mahagun director, said that the project has been developed in phases. “The construction workers are completing the shaft, fire fighting equipment, lifts, etc. in the project. We assure each buyer will get their apartment. We will complete the Wing 8 project by June 2021 and Wing 9 project by December 2022. We are always ready for the meeting and a discussion with the homebuyers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/homebuyers-protest-against-delayed-possession-greater-noida-west-project-101610216666317.html

Residents of sector 74 and 76 complained that irresponsible construction activity continued to take place in their area by one government agency and one private builder. Grap norms are supposed to be in place in Noida till February 15, which compels the builders to take adequate emission controlling measures. On Saturday, the city air quality turned ‘very-poor’ after remaining under ‘poor’ category for past two days. Noida was also the second most polluted city (after Ghaziabad), at the beginning of the year 2021.According to Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board , both the builders had been handed out a penalty of ₹5 lakh each in December. The agency said that it will take more strict action now if the builders were found continuing to flout norms. Residents of the highrises who live in the vicinity of the construction sites complain that the improper construction activities was not just leading to excessive road dust, but also leading to discomfort in terms of breathing. “The construction work is being held at the sector 76 main road and the one connecting sector 74 and 75. The issue had been going on since last few months and no adequate dust control measures have been taken. The construction from the site leads to dust emission. The movement of open trucks carrying building materials makes it difficult for us to even stroll out,” said Amit Gupta, city-based activist and resident of sector 77. He added that the resident had earlier raised complaint with the pollution board and the district administration through the respective online portals. Another resident, who lives next to the construction site, said that during the daytime strong winds often carry soil and larger dust particles from the construction site to their houses. “During the day time, it is almost impossible for us to open the windows because of the dust. We have complained a number of times but the issue persists,” said Puneet Sharma, resident of Aditya Celebrity Homes, sector 76. “The heavy trucks bring a lot of mud from the construction sites and during rains the stretch is covered in slush and mud, making it impossible to walk on,” said Sachin Goyal, a resident of JM Orchid, sector 76, adding that the tires of the trucks are never washed as Grap rules suggests. Meanwhile the officials of Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the violators had been slapped with a penalty earlier and they are now working on taking more action. “The violators are repeat offenders and it seems that they have not learnt their lessons. We are working on taking legal action by prosecuting them The process will be initiated under the legal framework and the matter under the Air Pollution act will be taken up at the environment court in Lucknow,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. He added that given the scale of construction in the city and the violations, it is important for the concerned authorities to give a mandatory training on environment norms to any agency or builder before they start working on ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-sec74-76-residents-complain-of-dust-pollution-from-irresponsible-construction-activities-101610216664628.html

During the previous dry-run on January 5, both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar had conducted the process at six centres —three each in rural and urban centres. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India would take a landmark step forward in fighting the coronavirus pandemic on January 16 when the government begins the drive to vaccinate nearly 30 million health care and front line workers. The UP government has already rolled out vaccination-related guidelines on December 21 last year and said that health care workers (HCWs), which include staff of government and private health care facilities, will get the vaccine in the first phase. The second phase is scheduled for front line workers such as police personnel, home guards, jail staff and employees of Nagar Palikas, among others, while the third category includes people aged over 50 years and also those aged below 50 but suffering from comorbidities like diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure. “The full dry run will be conducted in the district on January 11 and it will cover all the proposed vaccination-centres. This will be the second dry run, with the first one being limited to six centres. At that time, the online portal was working a bit slow and we hope that it will be better this time. We think that the real challenge will be when actual vaccine arrives,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar. “For the actual vaccination drive, the police already have a security plan in place to cover storage and transit of vaccines as well as to protect the vaccination-centres,” he, added. The district has come up with 13 cold storage points for storing of vaccine besides the main vaccine depot. The officials have also identified 73 centres where the vaccination will take place and a list of about 21, 543 doctors and medical staff has been identified for vaccination under the first phase. The dry run is intended to test the efficacy of infrastructure as well as other resources so that the actual vaccination process can be carried out without any hitches. The Ghaziabad district has also identified a list of 44 locations, including 30 private health care facilities, where actual vaccination will take place. The district has identified about 21,800 health care workers who will take up vaccination under the first phase. “During the dry-run on January 11, we will have 15 beneficiaries who will be assigned to one team. During the previous dry-run on January 5, we had assigned 25 beneficiaries to one team. For our 44 locations we have 70 teams. So, we are drawing up plans and preparing for a comprehensive dry run. With this dry run, we hope to get all our resources and infrastructure in place before the actual vaccination,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. During the previous dry run, the health department had identified certain minor issues which they said will be taken care of before January 11.NO NEW COVID DEATHS IN NOIDA, GHAZIABADAt least 28 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in the Gautam Budh Nagar district in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases in the district since March to 25,169, on Saturday.According to the state health department’s daily bulletin, the district has 271 active cases, after considering cross-notifications to other districts.

It is learnt that one of the arrested suspects, junior engineer CP Singh, who was arrested by the police after the roof collapse in Muradnagar, was in fact posted with the Modinagar Nagar Palika and was holding an additional charge of JE-civil at Muradnagar.On January 3, a roof collapse at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground led to 24 deaths and about a dozen people being injured. An initial report in connection with the incident had found “sub-standard” construction-material and “design issues” had allegedly led to the roof collapse. It has been learnt from sources that the structure which collapsed was probably erected in the last quarter of 2020, while the junior engineer who had the additional charge at Muradnagar retired on September 30, 2020.Thereafter, no engineer was posted to look after the ongoing work.“The JE retired in September/October. He was on an additional charge at Muradnagar. We have one post of JE sanctioned. The previous full time JE had been transferred about one-and-a-half years ago. After the current JE with additional charge retired, we have had no JE with the Palika till date. The shelter was being constructed as part of beautification work and the JE was solely responsible to look after the quality checks. The work was under construction,” said Vikas Teotia, the chairperson of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika, adding that the JE or the contractor should have barricaded the construction area. “The inspections are done by officers of Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department (UP PWD) and a technical audit committee (TAC) as well. On the basis of overall reports by engineers, the executive-officer of the Palika gives a go ahead for payments,” he added. The officials of the UP PWD, however, said that their work was only limited to ascertaining whether the structures were present at the site or not. “The JE attached to Muradnagar retired on September 30, 2020 and thereafter no engineer has been posted with the Palika. The work of the PWD engineer is only limited to verify whether the structures are present at the ground level or not. One of our assistant engineers inspected the site in March and July, and the structure which collapsed was not present at the site then,” said Manish Verma, executive engineer of the UP PWD, adding that the JE (civil) of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika was entrusted with the responsibility to ensure that standards, specifications and quality is maintained.He said that a district-level technical audit committee (TAC), formed by the district magistrate, comprising engineers from PWD and the rural engineering department, had also visited the cremation ground site for inspection of structures on August 17. “As part of the TAC, we inspected the boundary wall, platform, tiles, store, toilets, etc., and saw that construction works were there at the site. But the structure which collapsed was not present at the site till August 17. The TAC inspects whether the structure is present at site or not and goes for inspections when local bodies call them for the same,” Verma added. The investigation of the roof collapse incident has now been entrusted to a special investigation team (SIT) which arrived at Ghaziabad on Friday and will also be probing angles of bribery, as alleged by contractor Ajay Tyagi. Sources said that the structure was about 25 metres in length and 5.5 metres in width, and the investigators should probe if its measurements were included in the original estimate of work allotted to the contractor or not. “This means that it is to be probed whether the structure was part of the work assigned or was it getting constructed additionally,” the source added. It is also learnt that there were attempts by the district administration officials to give additional charge of Muradnagar to the JE of Khoda Nagar Palika, but it did not materialise, sources from Khoda Nagar Pallika confirmed. Like Muradnagar, Khoda Palika also has one post which is duly allotted to a full time JE. The Modinagar and Loni Palikas have two sanctioned posts for JE (civil). When contacted, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said: “The incident is taken up for investigation by an SIT. It is up to them to take up any required investigation.” Aditya Prajapati, the sub divisional magistrate of Modinagar, who the district magistrate said is looking after the work of the executive-officer of Muradnagar Nagar Palika, did not respond to repeated calls for his comments over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muradnagar-roof-collapse-civic-body-had-no-full-time-junior-engineer-for-over-a-year-101610216604252.html

As per the rates fixed earlier, the plot owners had to pay a transfer fee of ₹5,000 for a six-marla plot, and that of ₹10,000 for a plot of 8 marlas. Under the new rates, the owners have to pay ₹2,500 for 2 marlas, ₹ 3,500 for 3 marlas, ₹6,400 for 4 marlas, ₹10,500 for 8 and 10 marlas. Similarly, rates have been fixed for commercial properties. As per the HSVP officials, the state has been divided into six zones namely hyper zone, high-1, high-2, medium, low-1, low-2 depending upon the property rates and the circle rates prevailing in the area. The highest fees for property transactions has to be paid in hyper zone, in which Gurugram falls, while the lowest rates have been fixed for low-2 zone, which includes areas such as Hansi, Assandh, Naraingarh, etc.Vivek Kalia, estate officer-2 said that the rates have been revised after almost a decade and this will help in generating additional revenue for the authority. “The rates have been revised for different categories after a decision was taken in this regard by the committee in Chandigarh. The new rates are based on slabs and for small plot owners these have also been rationalised,” said Kalia. An HSVP official said that revision in rates will particularly help owners of small plots as the rates have been reduced. “Presently, the market is very down and savings for a small house or plot owner are welcome,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-revises-fees-for-transfer-of-property-after-a-decade-101610216545281.html

Decisions are yet to be taken on procurement and distribution, which will start from next week onwards.” In Gurugram, almost 87% of the private healthcare workers will get the shot at 116 session sites to be established across 21 private hospitals. In five big private hospitals, nearly 12 vaccination sites per hospital will be set up, according to senior health officials. On Saturday, in a meeting held with the representatives of five private hospitals, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, discussed the planning of the session sites in detail. “Private hospitals will prepare a plan on setting up multiple session sites within their hospital premises for the maximum coverage of the health staff and others from nearby clinics, nursing homes and health facilities. They will be sharing the details on Monday.” Representatives from other 16 hospitals, where session sites will be comparatively fewer, will also be meeting the medical officer on Monday. According to Yadav, on the first day of the vaccination, at least 161 vaccination sites will be set up.

Gurugram, however, was the least polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR) with the AQI in Delhi, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad staying in the “very poor”category on Saturday. Experts attributed the deterioration in air quality to poor ventilation conditions due to which pollutants couldn’t be dispersed. “Due to slow winds and moisture in the atmosphere, the ventilation conditions were not favourable for the dispersal of pollutants. Better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail on Sunday,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. He said that an improvement in air quality could be expected on Monday and Tuesday since strong surface winds are expected. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality on Sunday is likely to improve but remain in the “poor” category. Strong winds and better ventilation conditions are likely on January 10 and 11. The air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” to “moderate” category on Monday, followed by similar conditions over the next five days.While the IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record either minimum or maximum temperature on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department’s AWS, in Palam in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 11.4 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature at 19.2 degrees Celsius. On Friday, the Palam AWS had recorded a minimum temperature of 11.2 degrees and a maximum of 15.4 degrees Celsius. As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 10 and 17 degrees Celsius respectively on Sunday. IMD officials said that the temperature would dip gradually in the coming days. “Shallow fog will prevail in the morning hours on Sunday and temperature will fall by a few degrees in the coming week. The minimum temperature is expected to be around 9 degrees on Monday,” said an official. As per the IMD’s bulletin for the day, due to the prevalence of dry north/northwesterly winds over most parts of northwest India, the minimum temperature very likely to fall gradually by 3-5°Celsius during next 3-4 days causing cold wave conditions over Punjab, Haryana and north Rajasthan between January 11 and 13. The IMD has also predicted strong surface winds for January 11 and 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-air-quality-deteriorates-due-to-slow-winds-poor-ventilation-101610216485042.html

After a delay of several months, the NHAI got the approval from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to shift the three toll plaza gates, which till now were being operated by the Delhi civic body. The flyover at Shankar Chowk, which is a part of this project, has already been completed.NHAI officials said that once these gates are removed, they would be able to complete the underpass as only 20 to 25 percent of the work remains to be completed. NHAI officials said that they would get an approval from the headquarters in this matter within a couple of days and the work to remove these gates would be completed in the next 15 days. “We have received a work estimate of ₹46 lakh from the SDMC to complete this work. The delay in removal of gates was hampering the completion of the underpass. The flyover at Shankar Chowk, which is also part of this project, has already been completed,” said Vikas Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, Gurugram. The underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza will help commuters travelling from Gurugram and Udyog Vihar towards Ambience Mall as they would not have to enter Delhi to take a U-turn at Rajokri that amounts to a detour of around 4 kilometres. The demand for an underpass at this location has been repeatedly made by city residents. NHAI said that functioning of three lanes of the toll plaza would be affected during the construction of the box type structure of the underpass. As such, it needed to shift these toll gates. They also said that almost 80 per work on the project is complete and, once the toll gates are shifted, they would be able to complete the project soon. The work on building the underpass and flyover commenced in March 2019. While the flyover has been made operational by NHAI, the underpass is still stuck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-to-remove-three-toll-gates-at-sirhaul-expedite-underpass-work-101610216484162.html

It is very important to protect our people from this. I request the Central Government that the vaccine should be provided free of cost to all countrymen. The expenditure on this will be helpful in saving the lives of many Indians,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi. Senior officials in the chief minister’s office said Kejriwal is likely to reiterate the free vaccination demand during the scheduled interaction of chief ministers with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. This will be his first meeting of the PM with CMs of all states after the recent approval of the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, for restricted emergency use by the country’s drugs regulator.Delhi, like all other states, will also start the Covid vaccination drive from January 16.Earlier, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said that Covid vaccine doses will be provided free of cost to all Delhi residents and asserted that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led government had made all preparations for the vaccination drive.“The Delhi government had so far made preparations to vaccinate 100,000 people in a day,” Jain added. Chief minister Kejriwal had said on December 24 last year that a total of 5.1 million people, under the Centre’s primary category, would be administered Covid-19 vaccine doses in the first phase. He further segregated the primary category into health care and front line workers, senior citizens and those with co-morbidities.

09-01-2021||Delhi||AQI dips to very poor; mercury hovers four degrees above normal||Delhi’s air quality on Saturday deteriorated to the “very poor” category of the air quality index (AQI), a turn that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) attributed to the light rain in some parts of Delhi-NCR on Friday.IMD officials said wind speed had started picking up from Saturday and will remain high over the next few days, which would keep the pollution under control.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s air quality index for Delhi on Saturday was 301, in the ”very poor” zone. On Friday, the AQI of Delhi was 234, in the ”poor” category. On the AQI scale of 0 to 500, a reading between 200 and 300 is considered “poor”, while a reading between 300 and 400 is considered “very poor”.IMD scientists said by Saturday afternoon, wind speeds in Delhi had improved to around 12 kmph. However, the pollution spike seen was an impact of the accumulation of pollutants over the past 24 hours, because of the light rain in parts of Delhi and NCR, which led to increased moisture content in the air.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said from Sunday, wind speed will improve drastically, which will also result in the dispersion of pollutants.“For the next two or three days, the wind speed will be high. The main reason behind this is the passing of two western disturbances back to back. Usually, once a western disturbance has passed over a region, the wind speed picks up,” Srivastava said.He also said the dense fog over the city will lift owing to the strong wind.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also said the AQI is expected to remain in the “poor” category on Sunday but will improve to the ”moderate” category by Monday.“The improved ventilation condition is likely to influence the AQI positively for the next few days. The AQI is likely to improve to “moderate” category on January 11 and January 12. No sudden deterioration in AQI is expected in the next few days,” the Safar forecast said.Meanwhile, the temperature on Saturday remained higher than the season’s normal. The minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 10.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 19.7 degrees Celsius.Srivastava said from Monday, the temperatures will dip slightly but will remain around 8-9 degrees Celsius. “There will be a dip, but it will not be a drastic one,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aqi-dips-to-very-poor-mercury-hovers-four-degrees-above-normal-101610215524124.html

A sample was taken by the Ambala animal husbandry department and sent to the Jalandhar-based Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. However, assistant poultry development officer Dr Devender Dhull said that as per initial findings, the cold weather conditions could be the reason for the death. “We’re not taking any chances, so we collected the sample. It seems that the crow died due to the cold, as birds might face some respiratory issues during the winters. We also inspected poultries but everything is fine,” he said. The department had collected 40 samples from poultry and wild birds on Friday that were sent for testing. The Barwala and Raipur Rani belts of Panchkula are just 30 kilometres away from of Naraingarh sub-division of Ambala, due to which around 26 teams of the department have been formed to track any unusual activity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/crow-found-dead-in-ambala-sample-to-be-tested-for-bird-flu-101610215405186.html

According to the DCP, he earned a lot of local goodwill by organising health and food camps for the poor.“He was popular back home. Encouraged by local youth, he was all set to contest the Zila Parishad elections in Sitamarhi in March this year,” the DCP said.This is not the first time Irfan has been arrested by the Delhi Police. After his arrest in 2017, investigators had said that his charity included donating ₹5 lakh to a poor family for their daughter’s wedding.“He had gang members spread across states. They would visit houses on the pretext of collecting donations and repeatedly knock on doors to gauge whether the house was occupied or not. If residents were not around, Irfan and his men would strike and steal valuables,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/burglar-who-loved-luxury-cars-and-gave-to-charity-arrested-in-delhi-101610215044138.html

The MCDs have around Rs. 200 crore to be recovered from the Income Tax department and Rs. 1200 crore from the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). But, it is not even recovering money from anywhere to make payments to the sanitation workers,” she said.On January 7, the AAP has started a series of mohalla sabhas to highlight the alleged rampant corruption within the three BJP-ruled MCDs. The public meetings will go on till January 15.“About 20,000 people participated in the Mohalla meetings held on Friday, while about 27,000 people attended the Mohalla meetings held today (Saturday). The growing participation of local people in Mohalla sabhas shows that the people of Delhi are willing to talk about the corruption being done by the BJP in the MCDs and the public tax money it is looting,” said AAP MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the Kejriwal government is responsible for the strike of municipal workers and other employees.“It would be better if instead of shedding crocodile tears for the sanitation workers, the AAP pressurises their CM Kejriwal to immediately release the funds due to the MCDs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-holds-mohalla-sabhas-to-expose-corruption-in-mcds-101610213964071.html

Congress councillors rake up farmers’ protest, BJP hits back Having boycotted the election of the Chandigarh senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, Congress held a press conference and criticised BJP councillors for not standing up in the House as a mark of respect to farmers who died during the ongoing agitation on the Delhi-Haryana border. The lone Akali councillor, Hardeep Singh, who boycotted the mayoral election in support of the farmers’ protest against the BJP-led Centre, asked all councillors to stand up for the farmers. Of the 19 BJP councillors present, only one stood up. “This is disrespect to the farmers. This exposes the BJP’s anti-farmer mentality,” a Congress leader said. When asked to comment on this, a BJP councillor said, “Congress should have walked out of the House before the election if it was so keen on taking a stand on the farmers’ protest.

09-01-2021||Delhi||Three nabbed for conning elderly into selling their jewellery at inflated prices||Two women were arrested along with a 59-year-old auto-rickshaw driver for allegedly duping elderly women of their jewellery and other belongings after scaring them about recent crimes in the city or luring them by offering to buy their jewellery double or triple the actual prime, police said on Saturday.Apart from a gold chain and pendant that the two sisters had stolen from an elderly woman in south Delhi last month, three mobile phones and an auto-rickshaw used in the crime were also recovered from them. A total of five such cases registered in Delhi have been solved with the arrest of the trio, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Police identified the three as Aarti Rathore,30, her sister Kiran Rathore,25, and Madan (single name), the auto driver. Aarti sold used clothes while Kiran is a beautician by profession. They were last arrested in Uttarakhand’s Dehradun in a similar cheating case, the DCP said.On December 25, DCP Thakur said, a 60-year-old woman filed a complaint and alleged that three women duped her of her jewellery and some money in a park in Lado Sarai near Mehrauli. The elderly woman alleged that she was going to get her spectacles repaired when a woman asked her the directions to reach Dhaula Kuan.“The elderly woman was telling her the route when two more women arrived and lured her to sit in an auto by telling her that they would drop her to her destination. The women took her to a park in Lado Sarai and tricked her into removing her jewellery by telling her that it was not safe to be out wearing so much jewellery,” the DCP added.The women gave her a handkerchief and asked her to keep the jewellery in it. As the elderly kept the jewellery, the women replaced the handkerchief with a similar one and kept it in her bag before they all left the park. The woman found the jewellery and cash missing when she returned home and opened the bag, said the police.A case of cheating was registered and the police scanned the CCTV cameras of the routes that the woman and the suspects had taken. The police first identified the auto and nabbed its driver, Madan. His interrogation led to the arrest of the two sisters, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-nabbed-for-conning-elderly-into-selling-their-jewellery-at-inflated-prices-101610213604109.html

But off late, Kinnar Akhada, Pari Akhada and Vishwa Akhada have been pressing for their inclusion as the 14th addition, thereby getting direct privilege and benefits, particularly during the Kumbh fair.Kinnar Akhada's Mahamandaleswhar Kaushalya Nand Giri alias Tina Maa said that the transgender community has been given due recognition and equal rights by the Constitution of India and they expect the same from the Akhada Parishad."We are not fake or self-styled god people but have deep religious affinity and adhere to Sanatan Dharma. Why are we being denied due recognition by Akhada Parishad? We press forth for due official status as 14th Akhada from the apex Akhada Parishad. We have been doing religious rituals, meditation and propagating Sanatan Dharma which should be duly considered. We thank Shri Panch Dash Nam Juna Akhada for allowing Kinnar seers to take part in royal dip (Shah Snaan) during the upcoming Mahakumbh 2021 in Haridwar," said Mahamandaleshwar Tina Maa.Also read: English language course for government school teachers at US embassySupporting Kinnar Akhada's demand, spiritual guru Jagadugru Udasin Ashram Swami Suteekshan Maharaj said that transgender seers too have same right to be regarded as official Akhada and should be given due status.Citing the incident of the seers from Kinnar Akhada taking religious dip in Prayagraj Kumbh two years back, Mahant Dinesh Das Shastri, pontiff of Shri Ram Nivas Ashram, said that Akhada Parishad should call a meeting and hear Kinnar Akhada's viewpoint.Siding with Kinnar Akhada, general secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj said that as part of Shri Panch Dusnam Juna Akhada, Kinnar seers will be taking part in Shahi Snaan on all the four auspicious days during Mahakumbh 2021.Mahant Narendra Giri Maharaj, however, clarified that the 13 Akhada system of the Parishad will be not be expanded. He pointed out that it is not apt to meddle with Akhada customs and age-old traditions.Whether it is Kinnar, Pari or Vishwa Adhyatm Akhada, they don't have any Kumbh lineage, historic, religious, spiritual and mass acceptance. These are fake bodies and Akhada Parishad opposes any specific privilege, recognition or facilities to them by state government or Mela administration during Haridwar Kumbh, he said."No question of 14th Akhada or any other religious body getting affiliated as part of Akhada Parishad. Though individually, Kinnar Akhada seers, as part of Juna Akhada, can take sacred Ganga dip on the pious occasion of Shahi Snaan in Mahakumbh, we have no issue in that but they won't be recognised as an Akhada Parishad entity," reiterated Mahant Narendra Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/saints-pitch-in-for-inclusion-of-kinnars-as-14th-addition-to-akhada-parishad-101610211905583.html

09-01-2021||City||AIADMK's highest decision-making body passes resolutions for assembly polls||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)’s general council, the party’s highest decision-making body, on Saturday passed 16 resolutions. One of the resolutions called for the Centre to not allow dissolving of the provincial councils in Sri Lanka which ensure devolution of powers to Lankan Tamils.The 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, an outcome of the Indo-Lanka Accord of July 1987 between former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and then Lankan president JR Jayawardene during the civil war, provides for devolution of powers to the island nation’s minority Tamil community by creating provincial councils. This issue resurfaced after the Rajapaksas came to power in 2019, bringing a Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalism to the fore. Last week, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who was in Colombo, pressed for the legislation to be implemented fully.Amongst its other resolutions, the AIADMK also formalised that chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami will be the incumbent candidate for the upcoming assembly elections in Tamil Nadu due in April or May. The party has empowered Palaniswami (AIADMK’s co-coordinator) and deputy chief minister and coordinator O Paneerselvam to decide on the electoral alliances and seat-sharing. The party thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for including Tamil Nadu among the six states under the central lighthouse project.Also read: 300 casualties in Balakot airstrike by India, admits former Pak diplomatAt the meeting, party deputy coordinator KP Munusamy said that the polls were a direct contest between the AIADMK and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and that national parties don't matter in the state. The AIADMK has been in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has said that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will announce the chief minister candidate, much likely during party president JP Nadda’s visit to the state on January 14.In a veiled reference to the party's former interim general secretary VK Sasikala who will be released later this month from Bengaluru prison, Munusamy said it will not impact the party.More than 4,500 members were invited to the party meeting today which was held in Chennai’s suburbs.

My advice to you is please join the BJP officially. Then all cases against your relatives being probed by the ED, the CBI or corruption matters will be buried,” said Chadha while addressing the media.“And then you can also work openly for the BJP,” he added.The AAP leader further claimed that the Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, which was part of the high-powered committee formed by the Centre on its three contentious farm ordinances earlier, had given its approval.He criticised the CM for approaching the president to seek scrapping of the farm laws instead of PM Narendra Modi.Chadha alleged that the CM did not come out of his residence to stand with farmers when they were facing water cannons and teargas shells on their way to Delhi.The CM had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah but did not bother to travel a few extra kilometres to meet the agitating farmers, he said.Chadha said now the Congress-led dispensation has opposed the decision of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, which had said that the apex gurdwara body would not invite the PM for the upcoming 400th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Tegh Bahadur.“Captain Sahib, his ministers and party are opposing the SGPC decision and are saying Modi should be invited,” alleged Chadha.“It proves that to save his son, Captain Sahib is behaving like an agent of BJP,” alleged Chadha.Chadha claimed that his party is providing legal assistance to the aggrieved farmers, who are moving courts against some BJP leaders for their alleged defamatory remarks against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-is-acting-like-bjp-agent-aap-leader-raghav-chadha-101610202076894.html

Delhi Government in its affidavit had submitted that guidelines are very clear cut that, "any person" moving around in his personal or official vehicle must be wearing masks compulsorily."All "Public Places", and a personal vehicle falls in the said category and cannot be said to be a "private zone" as contended by the petitioner in the instant case," the state government said.The court was hearing a petition which sought a refund of ₹500 fine imposed against him and compensation of ₹10 lakh for publicly causing mental harassment. According to petitioner Saurabh Sharma, on September 9, 2020, Delhi Police issued a challan of ₹500 for not wearing a mask even though he was alone in the car while driving to work.The petitioner argued that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines only state that the mask has to be worn in a public place or place of work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mask-not-mandatory-if-person-is-alone-in-a-vehicle-centre-to-delhi-hc-101610199329616.html

The Jagan government has sharply reacted to the development and has filed a petition in the High Court today seeking to stall the election schedule.Employees Associations declared that they can't take part in the election work because they would be busy with the vaccination exercise. The High Court has posted the matter for hearing to Monday.In a late evening official release on Friday, state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar declared that the first phase of elections for gram panchayats would be held on February 5, the second phase on February 9, the third phase on February 13 and the final and fourth phase on February 17.The notifications for these four phases of elections would be issued on January 23, January 27, January 31 and February 4 respectively. “As per the Supreme Court directions, the model code of conduct would come into force with effect from Saturday,” Ramesh Kumar said.Also read: Special court summons CM Jagan to appear in connection with quid pro quo caseThe state government strongly objected to the unilateral announcement of the schedule for the conduct of local body elections by the SEC. “This is nothing but defying the directions of the Supreme Court, which said the state election commission should decide the schedule only after consulting with the state government on its preparedness,” state principal secretary, panchayat raj, Gopala Krishna Dwivedi said in a statement.He said the three-member committee of senior officials, headed by chief secretary Adityanath Das, which met Ramesh Kumar, categorically told him that the elections to local bodies could not be conducted due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation and the vaccination programme being rolled out by the Government of India from January 13.“The commissioner did not heed to the suggestions given by the state government, which said the conduct of elections was not possible as the entire government machinery would be busy with the vaccination programme. He has announced the schedule without caring for the public health and sought to play with the lives of the people,” Dwivedi said.Ramesh Kumar, however, defended his decision to hold the elections in February as the state government’s excuses were untenable. “Hitherto, the government sought postponement citing a second Corona wave and also a winter spike. But it did not happen and the incidence of daily infections has come down significantly,” he said.He pointed out that near normalcy had returned with the opening up of commercial and educational spheres of activity and political mobilization too was going on at a large scale without visible observance of social distancing.“Now, the government wants deferment of elections on the pretext of vaccination, which is a continuous process. In fact, the phase-III of vaccination programme will extend up to 2022. Hence, elections cannot be postponed till then,” Ramesh Kumar argued.He requested the government to make all arrangements for the conduct of fool-proof and free and fair elections for the local bodies in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagan-govt-andhra-poll-panel-spar-over-local-body-election-schedule-101610194701695.html

The government’s move comes at a time when nearly 100 wild birds have been found dead in various locations across the national capital over the past few days. Addressing a digital press conference, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said no bird flu case has been confirmed in Delhi, adding that the results of the first set of samples sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar for tests will come on Monday.“In view of the prevailing situation and to prevent the virus from spreading in the city, the Delhi government has taken two very important decisions today. Firstly, we have put a complete ban on imports of live birds in the city. Secondly, the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market has been ordered shut for 10 days,” Kejriwal said.Six states --- Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh --- have reported the outbreak that began in December-end. No case among the human population has been reported.At least 24 crows were found dead at a district park in south Delhi’s Jasola over the past three days and 10 ducks have died at the famous Sanjay Lake, government officials said on Saturday.

During the trial, 50 per cent people get the actual injection while the rest are given saline," he said.Kapur said Marawi was kept under observation for 30 minutes after the trial as per guidelines before he was allowed to go."We monitored his health for 7 to 8 days," he claimed.Madhya Pradesh health minister Dr Prabhuram Choudhary did not respond to phone calls.Meanwhile, family members of Marawi, a tribal, said he was working as a labourer.They claimed that Marawi and his colleague were administered the Covaxin injection on December 12 during the trial."When he returned home he felt uneasy and experienced some health problems. He complained of a shoulder pain on December 17. Two days later, he spewed foam. He refused to see a doctor saying he would be alright in a day or two. When his condition deteriorated, he was being rushed to hospital but he died midway (on December 21)," they added.Rachana Dhingra, a Bhopal-based social activist, claimed neither Marawi's consent was taken for participation in the clinical trial nor he was given any proof of his participation in the exercise.However, the hospital has denied this charge.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had last week approved Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/days-after-participating-in-covid-19-vaccine-trial-man-dies-in-bhopal-101610188518474.html

While the presence of the virus was found in crows in nine districts, two of these nine districts also reported the virus in poultry and herons, as per officials.Meanwhile, after the Bird flu was detected in poultry in Malwa region - Indore and Neemuch- the administration in nearby tribal-dominated districts of Jhabua and Alirajpur faces a major challenge in checking the spread of the virus given the sale of high-protein black meat chicken, also known as ‘Kadaknath’, from unregulated markets in the region.Kadaknath is much in demand in Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere given its nutritional value. Backyard poultry farming is much popular among tribals in the region for the sake of good income, as per officials.Malwa region is the worst affected by Bird flu in the state so far. While the chicken shops have been closed in Indore and Neemuch, officials in Jhabua and Alirajpur decided on Friday to launch a massive awareness campaign in the districts through the traditional methods like ‘Munadi’ or public announcements, pamphlets etc.As per a state government communiqué, Bird flu virus has been confirmed in crows in Indore, Mandsaur, Agar, Neemuch, Dewas, Ujjain, Khandwa and Khargone, all districts in Malwa region, and Guna in central MP. Virus was confirmed in poultry samples from Indore and Neemuch, where the poultry markets in the affected and adjoining areas have been closed for seven days as precautionary measures.Director of Animal Husbandry department Dr RK Rokde said, “Virus has been confirmed in herons’ samples too in Khandwa. We are waiting for reports from National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD) on samples of crows collected from at least 12 districts but it’s a matter of relief that except three to four districts in Malwa region including Indore, Mandsaur and Agar, where a good number of crows were found dead, the deaths of crows are not significant in number in other districts.” He said preventive measures are the best way to check the spread of the virus.An agriculture scientist at Agriculture Science Centre, Jhabua, IS Tomar said that the spread of Bird flu in Jhabua and Alirajpur can be checked through awareness only as the districts have unregulated markets for sale of Kadaknath chicken and the practice of backyard poultry farming is also prevalent on a large scale in the district.“How to minimise contact between fowls and human beings in such a situation is a major challenge. However, sale of Kadaknath has been reduced by 25% to 40% in Jhabua after the Bird flu scare. However, Bird flu has not been detected in the district so far.”Alirajpur collector Surabhi Gupta said the administration had launched a massive campaign for awareness for prevention of the disease in chickens through traditional and non-traditional methods.“The traditional methods include Munadi or announcement from village to village while beating a drum and distribution of pamphlets and non-traditional methods include use of social media like WhatsApp etc. So far, there is no presence of Bird flu in the district,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/bird-flu-spreads-in-mp-kadaknath-chicken-sale-in-malwa-region-causes-concern-101610188998261.html

There will also be a complete ban on import of live birds in the national capital, Kejriwal added."There is no confirmed case of bird flu in Delhi so far. We have sent around 104 samples to a lab in Jalandhar, the reports will come by the day after tomorrow. The Delhi government will take the necessary decision based on reports," Kejriwal told reporters.Around 50 birds have died in three areas of the national capital over the last three to four days, Dr Rakesh Singh of the animal husbandry department told news agency PTI. "We received information about the death of crows in Dwarka, Mayur Vihar Phase 3 and Hastsal village in west Delhi. However, it is yet to be ascertained if bird flu infection is the reason," Singh said.According to officials, 11 rapid response teams have been set up to monitor Delhi's potential avian influenza (H5N8) hotspots, officials said. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has also instructed officials to maintain a strict vigil on birds at major bird sites, especially poultry markets, water bodies, zoos and other potential hotspots. These include Ghazipur Fish and Poultry Market, Shakti Sthal Lake, Sanjay Lake, Bhalswa Horseshoe Lake, Delhi Zoo, and smaller water bodies in DDA parks among others.Due to the bird flu scare, the wholesale prices of poultry have dropped by around ₹40 per kilo in two days in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), according to traders in the city’s wholesale markets. However, the drop in poultry prices is yet to reflect in retail markets, even as traders across the city said the number of customers has dipped slightly.The Centre has so far confirmed the presence of the disease in six states—Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-ghazipur-wholesale-poultry-market-to-be-shut-for-10-days-to-prevent-spread-of-bird-flu-arvind-kejriwal-101610188986833.html

The teams have been provided with support staff and police protection. The culling is being carried out in all five farms,” said Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja.Culling started at Sidharth Poultry Farm at Kheri village in Raipur Rani in the afternoon. “We couldn’t start in the morning as the logistics and support staff were being put in place in these areas,” he said. Later in the evening, culling started at Nature Poultry Farm, Dhandlawar-Ganauli, Raipur Rani. At Sidharth farm around 1,000 birds and at Nature 2700 birds were culled on Saturday. The culling operation is expected to run for another two-three days.On Friday evening, after it was confirmed that the large-scale deaths of birds at poultry farms in the Barwala belt were due to avian influenza, the Haryana government declared the outbreak, turning the area within a kilometre of the two epicentres as infected zone and 1-10km as surveillance zone. The other three affected farms are Narender, Naveen and Sunil farms in Kheri village.So far, more than 4.37 lakh poultry birds have died in the area over the past month. The health department and animal husbandry team are also administering medicines to birds in other poultry farms.Four schools in Raipur Rani have been designated as quarantine facility for members of the 12 rapid response teams involved in culling and other activities to contain the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, the Panchkula health department screened about 9,000 people for influenza-like illness in Barwala and administered 500 doses of Tamiflu as a precautionary measure.Allow vaccination of birds: Poultry farm ownersPoultry farmers have demanded that birds in only those farms that have been affected should be culled.“The government should allow for vaccination of birds in other farms, like in most of the other countries. Indonesia and Vietnam have developed the vaccine as it can protect the industry from outbreaks. The H5N8 virus shows no harm to humans and poultry can be saved by vaccination. If the government cannot provide immediate vaccination, it can be imported,” said Rajesh Singla, a poultry farm owner.Darshan Kumar Singla, president, Haryana Poultry Farmers Association, said, “The government should compensate the poultry farmers as per the current costs of bird rather than those based on earlier computations. The current cost of bird is ₹400-450, but the government is offering only up to ₹90.”Chhatbir Zoo closes bird enclosuresMohali A day after chicken samples from Barwala poultry farms tested positive for avian flu, Chhatbir Zoo authorities decided to close its bird enclosures for visitors till further orders.Earlier, on January 5, the enclosures were closed for five days .Chhatbir Zoo field director M Sudhagar said: “There are possibilities that avian flu is carried by humans and under such conditions giving human exposure to birds may prove fatal. If more forensic reports come positive, then the closure will not be lifted till the animal husbandry department declares the area safe for birds.”Three more dead birds found in ChandigarhChandigarh The carcasses of two crows and a third of an unidentified black bird were recovered from Leisure Valley in Sector 10 on Saturday, taking the total number of dead birds found in Chandigarh in the past five days to 13.

This fact will never change," Siddaramaiah said.He further said that India would still be under British rule if the Indian National Congress had not fought for independence under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi."This is the history of Indian National Congress. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are not freedom fighters but they are only the beneficiaries of Independence," Siddaramaiah tweeted.He further claimed that Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa was trying to spread Sanathana Dharma in Karnataka in the name of Anubhava Mantapa."Our government had formed a committee under the chairmanship of G R Chennabasappa to re-establish the philosophy of Basavanna by constructing Anubhava Mantapa. But now, the Anubhava Mantapa which is being constructed by Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa is against the principles of Basavanna," he tweeted."Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa is attempting to spread Sanathana Dharma in the name of Anubhava Mantapa. This is the idea of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Yediyurappa has fallen for it. Anubhava Mantapa should resonate with the ideas of Basavanna and not that of Sanathana Dharma," Siddaramaiah further stated.According to the CLP leader, Basavanna spread the idea of equality and social justice. "He fought against evil practices like caste system, untouchability & gender discrimination which was practiced in Sanathana Dharma."Basavanna was the 12th-century Lingayat saint and Bhakti poet, who spread the concept of Anubhava Mantapa (Centre for Experience), which was the socio-religious centre that existed in the present-day Basava Kalyana of Bidar district in Karnataka.Anubhava Mantapa is regarded as the first religious parliament in the history of mankind. This 12th-century centre has a special significance in the history of humanity, as it represents composite culture, philosophy, spirituality, equality among other universal human values.On January 6, Yediyurappa laid the foundation of 'New Anubhava Mantapa' in Basavakalyan, the place where Basaveshwara lived for most of his life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-siddaramaiah-says-coalition-with-jd-s-led-to-loss-for-congress-101610185750595.html

Zoo officials claimed that the 18-year-old lioness, Urvashi, was not only the eldest inmate of Patna zoo but also the oldest among hybrid lionesses across all the zoos in the country.Urvashi was brought to Patna zoo in 2004 from Bokaro. Authorities said she had almost completed her life span and had turned toothless and inactive about two years back.Patna zoo director Amit Kumar said the lioness had stopped eating since a couple of days. “She was unwell since the last two years due to ageing, so a group of veterinary doctors were monitoring her health and diet on a regular basis. After the advice of veterinary experts, she was shifted to a secluded place, away from public eyes.”“The prime facie examination indicates that the lioness died due to cardiac arrest. A group of veterinary doctors, including experts from Bihar Veterinary College conducted a post-mortem of the deceased. Tissue samples from her lungs, liver, kidney were collected and sent to IVRI Izatnagar lab, Bareilly for further tests. Report is yet to arrive,” he added.Kumar said the average life of a lion is between 7 to 10 years in a forest and 16 to 18 years in captivity.“After the lioness’s death, we are maintaining extra vigil to monitor the health and safety of other inmates,” said a senior zoo official.In December last year, Patna zoo had reported the death of a male lion, Sheru, due to septicaemia shock. Now the zoo is left with two male lions.Lions are currently categorised as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/oldest-lioness-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-in-patna-zoo-101610182179708.html

He added that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident.“The fire brigade personnel have succeeded to rescue seven newborn children but could not save 10 other babies,” Khandate said.There were 17 newborns admitted at the SNCU unit of the hospital when the fire broke out. A doctor and a nurse were on duty at the time of the incident. The nurse first noticed the smoke coming from the neonatal section and informed the hospital authorities. Fire brigade was called immediately, which rescued seven babies, who were then shifted to another ward, said Khandate.The civil surgeon added that the patients in the ICU ward, dialysis wing and the labour ward were also shifted to other wards for safety after the incident. The fire brigade personnel reached the spot with fire tenders and started the rescue operation with the help of hospital employees.All the infants killed in the blaze were between a month and three-months old. Three to four infants were charred to death while the rest of the casualties happened as oxygen supply was cut. The exact cause of death would be ascertained after the post-mortem of the bodies, Dr Khandate said.The cause of the fire in the four-storey building is yet to be ascertained. However, preliminary investigations suggest that a short circuit could have caused the tragedy. It was said that electric warmers were being used at the neonatal unit at the hospital.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed grief over the tragic incident. “Heart-wrenching tragedy in Bhandara, Maharashtra, where we have lost precious young lives. My thoughts are with all the bereaved families.

09-01-2021||Kolkata||Chaos at BJP rally in West Bengal’s Nandigram; stampede averted||A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rally at Nandigram in West Bengal’s East Midnapore district was disrupted by chaos when some outsiders allegedly threw stones at a section of the audience when the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was in the middle of his speech.“This was definitely a conspiracy to foil the event. There could have been a stampede as people had started running helter-skelter without realizing what was going on,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar who was one of the speakers. A huge canopy had been set up to accommodate the BJP supporters. Other leaders who addressed them were BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, national vice-president Mukul Roy and Nandigram’s former Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Suvendu Adhikari who joined the BJP on December 19. Adhikari resigned from the legislative assembly last month. In their speeches, the speakers targeted chief minister Mamata Banerjee and called for a change in regime in Bengal. A long and violent movement against acquisition of farmland in Nandigram by the erstwhile Left Front government had helped Banerjee oust the Marxists in 2011. “Suvendu addressed the people and calmed them down,” said Majumdar. Although the BJP leaders accused ruling party workers of pelting stones, some BJP workers told local journalists that the chaos was triggered by slogans raised against a local TMC leader who came to join the BJP.Several TMC leaders and workers from East Midnapore joined the saffron camp at Friday’s rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/chaos-at-bjp-rally-in-west-bengal-s-nandigram-stampede-averted-101610143340657.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||Dead crows in dozens at Mayur Vihar park spark panic, some more found in Dwarka||Carcasses of dozens of crows have been found in east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar and in Dwarka as well as Hastsal in west Delhi over the past few days, triggering fears of a bird flu outbreak in the national capital similar to the one that has affected at least four other states in the country.While officials of the municipal corporation and residents of Mayur Vihar Phase 3 said about 150 crows had died in the past three or four days, the Delhi government said the number of birds found dead at the three places was below 50.On Friday morning, after receiving reports of crow carcasses being found in Mayur Vihar Phase 3, a team of doctors from Delhi government’s animal husbandry department reached A-2 Central Park and collected samples to check if the deaths were caused by the cold or due to avian flu. The test report is expected on Monday.The Delhi government in a statement said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia sent officials immediately to the spot in Mayur Vihar and the team found 17 dead crows in the park. Four samples were collected for testing from among these carcasses.But a senior official of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which manages the park, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Nearly 150 crows have died over the past three days in the Central Park. As this is a matter pertaining to the Delhi government’s animal husbandry department, we informed the authorities concerned. A team of doctors from the animal husbandry department inspected the park and collected samples of dead birds,” the EDMC official said.HT visited the Central Park on Friday evening and found carcasses of at least four to five crows there. According to residents, the other carcasses were removed on Friday morning but those found in the evening could be from fresh deaths.As news about the bird deaths spread, there was panic among residents and shopkeepers.“Crows are dying and falling off trees for the past four days but the authorities are not paying heed. We had raised the issue with the civic body employees deployed at the park two days ago but action was taken only today (Friday). We fear that it may be an outbreak of bird flu, which has already been reported in other states,” Devendra Kumar, a resident of A-2 block in Mayur Vihar-3, said.Another resident of the area, Dinesh Pratap Singh, said the death of such a huge numbers of crows was frightening. “This mysterious death of crows indicates the presence of bird flu in the city. At least 150 crows have died in the past four-five days. We have stopped going for walks in the park,” Singh said.Traders in the market said in the previous years, there were sporadic cases of birds dying due to the cold. “But crows dying in such large numbers is new. The government officials should check if crows are dying due to bird flu. We don’t know how this disease spreads, and so there is panic among the residents. We are not ready to face another virus or pandemic,” Viru Gupta, who runs a garment shop in the market, said.The Delhi government in a statement on Friday said as part of the exercise to prevent the ingress of avian influenza to the capital, multiple samples have been collected and sent for tests. The collected samples have been submitted to the laboratory in Palam and these will send to the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, ICAR, Bhopal, on January 9.“All remaining carcasses were disposed of by deep burial following bio security measures and the area was sanitised. Instructions were also given to attendants of the park to report further mortality of birds, if any. Two crows were found dead at a DDA Park in Dwarka and one sample was collected from there for tests,” a government spokesperson said, adding that at DDA park in Hastsal village reported 16 dead birds. Of this, four samples have been sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, for tests.Dr Rakesh Singh, animal husbandry department, said until Friday, a total of 104 samples were sent from Delhi to Jalandhar. Five more samples have been collected by the department which will be sent to the laboratory in Bhopal on Saturday.“Of the 104 samples that have been sent already, 100 are faecal and blood samples and four are dead crows. Of the five samples that will be sent on Saturday to Bhopal, one will be an oral swab and the remaining four are dead birds,” he said.Dr Singh said the first set of results will come by Monday. “Actions like restricting the number of trucks and regulating shops will be taken only if a bird flu outbreak is confirmed. The results of the samples will start coming from Monday. As of now, Delhi has no case of bird flu,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dead-crows-in-dozens-at-mayur-vihar-park-spark-panic-some-more-found-in-dwarka-101610142494111.html

Identified as Anant Gurpal Singh, he was the youngest son of Baba Pritpal Singh, granthi at Gurdwara Gur Sagar Sahib near Sukhna Lake. He had completed his graduation and was involved in sewa at the gurdwara, said people known to the family.Anant was returning home from market around 10pm when the accident took place. The drop gate, which is pulled down only during protests, was open. Anant is suspected to have lost control of the vehicle before ramming it into the drop gate’s base. A police control room vehicle rushed him to the PGIMER, but he succumbed during treatment.Police said the car’s air bags had opened due to the collision, and there was no major external injuries, though some blood was found on the driver’s seat. Police have impounded the vehicle, and initiated inquest proceedings. The family is waiting for Anant’s sister, who is married and stays abroad, to reach the city before performing the last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/granthis-son-killed-in-accident-at-punjab-mla-hostel-in-chandigarh-101610131758174.html

Reason: The firm did not obtain environmental clearance before starting construction.As per norms, each residential project covered under the environmental impact assessment notification 2006 is required to obtain clearance from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change before initiating any activity at the project site.There are around 1,700 flats in the said project, and the builder has already completed 50% construction.In the orders issued on January 7, NGT said that despite repeated directions by the state-level environment impact assessment authority and initiation of prosecution, the builder continued construction in utter disregard and defiance of the statutory norms. The plea that a writ petition has been filed against the assessment authority’s order cannot in any manner justify continuing illegal constructions, for which there is no sanction in any of the orders of the high court, said NGT, adding that the builder is trying to create an irreversible situation by completing the construction and creating third-party rights, which is not congenial to the enforcement of rule of law and protection of environment and public health. A senior official of Punjab Pollution Control Board said: “The orders have been sent to our legal team and action will be initiated once we get its report.” Meanwhile, Kulwant Singh was not available for comments even after repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngt-slams-brakes-on-former-mohali-mayor-s-housing-project-101610131698109.html
09-01-2021||Gurugram||No signs of avian influenza outbreak in Gurugram yet, say officials||Clinical surveillance for avian influenza (H5N8) has not detected any unusual mortality at poultry farms in the district yet, said officials in the animal husbandry department on Friday. However, the district wildlife department said on the same day that it had retrieved five wild bird carcasses, of which two have been sent for testing to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar. “We found five fresh carcasses on Friday morning. Four crows and one egret — all seemed to have died of similar symptoms. One crow and egret samples has been dispatched to Jalandhar by the animal husbandry department. The others have been buried,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurugram, declining to specify where these carcasses had been found. After suspicions arose earlier this week, Haryana on Friday notified an outbreak of influenza strain H5N8, with Panchkula’s Ganauli and Kheri villages being declared as the epicentre. In light of this development, officials said they will continue to monitor the status of chicken farms and wetlands — where migratory waterfowl are feared to be spreading this disease — for at least another three weeks. Chahal, however, said that no migratory bird carcasses have yet been found. “Migrant winter birds are in fact thriving in Sultanpur. There are no plans to close the national park to visitors, as was the case during an earlier bird flu outbreak in 2015,” Chahal clarified.A district-level committee, headed by the animal husbandry department’s three sub-divisional officers (SDO), was also formed on Friday. If any containment operation is put into motion in the next few days — as per a centrally approved action plan received by the regional office on Thursday — it will be steered by this committee, officials said. Veterinary officers assigned to rapid response teams, which were put in place a day earlier, will also report to this committee. “We have had a training workshop for all officers and surgeons on Friday. A detailed discussion was held on the action plan. We are prepared to start viral surveillance and serosurveillance in both poultry and wild birds, at a moment’s notice,” said a department vet, seeking anonymity. Officials in the district animal husbandry department, including their deputy director for Gurugram, Dr Punita Gahlot, declined to comment at length. “We have not been authorised to speak to the press. I can only say that there are no signs of an outbreak in Gurugram as of today,” said Gahlot. However, another senior official in the animal husbandry department, also seeking anonymity, said, “All poultry farmers maintain a log of chicken deaths, since they are an everyday occurrence. The average mortality rate at any high-density chicken farm is about two percent. Some birds will simply not survive their expected life cycle, which is just under two months. We have looked at data from some backyard units going back about two weeks, and there is no statistical evidence of excess mortality.”Officials also said that Gurugram, being one of Haryana’s least productive poultry farming districts, was less susceptible to an outbreak. “The sector itself is very disorganised. There are no large markets. Hatcheries and large farms are scattered. Other than two or three industrial-sized operations, most of the chicken is supplied from backyard units, whose flocks don’t intermingle much, thereby reducing chances of an outbreak,” said one senior veterinarian, also requesting anonymity. Demand hitNotwithstanding these caveats, however, the demand for poultry and eggs in the city has taken a hit, prompting wholesalers and butchers to reduce prices in response. From ₹100 to ₹120 for a full broiler chicken, the price has now come down to about ₹80 in Gurugram’s wholesale market. In retail markets, the price of a full, freshly butchered chicken has dipped to about ₹150, down from about ₹200 to ₹220 just a few days ago. Mustak, who runs a small butcher shop in Chakkarpur, Sector 28, said, “I sell anything between 30 to 40 chickens every day usually, but last two days I have sold only around 25 pieces. The government has said it is safe to eat chicken.” Traders fear that they may have to slash prices further after Haryana notified the outbreak officially. In Panchkula, the prices of chicken have fallen even more sharply, touching about ₹50 per kilogram in the wholesale markets, according to some estimates. Traders expressed serious concerns over the impact this outbreak will have on small and medium-size poultry farmers. Damandeep Singh, who owns multiple fish and meat shops in Delhi-NCR, said, “Poultry farming used to be very prominent in Gurugram until 15 years ago; not so much anymore. Every time there is a bird flu scare, independent hatcheries close down and do not reopen. Demand will definitely pick up again, but smaller businessmen may find it hard to revive their operations.” This, Singh said, was all the more unfortunate given how the industry as a whole suffered during the Covid-19 lockdown. “There were so many rumours about chicken causing Covid-19. Demand fell very sharply and is not yet back to pre-Covid times. So to deal with this now is naturally going to cause even more stress to farmers, butchers and sellers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/no-signs-of-avian-influenza-outbreak-in-gurugram-yet-say-officials-101610131219656.html
09-01-2021||Gurugram||Cold, foggy mornings here to stay, but afternoons may be warmer: Experts||While the city’s solitary automatic weather station (AWS) did not record either minimum or maximum temperature on Friday, the India Meteorological Department’s AWS, in Palam in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 11.2 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature at 15.4 degrees Celsius. Just two days ago, the same AWS had recorded a minimum of 14.4 degrees and a maximum of 19 degrees Celsius.As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram, the mercury is going to consistently keep dipping over the next week, although officials also said that chances of another severe cold wave (as Delhi-NCR witnessed over the New Year) are slim. Minimum temperature in Gurugram is expected to dip to as little as 5 degrees Celsius by January 14, though daytime temperature is expected to rise to about 21 degrees Celsius.“The region will see shallow to moderate fog in the morning, which will push the minimum temperature down. During the day, we may have clearer skies so daytime temperature should climb slightly and remain above 20 degrees Celsius,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre, IMD.Srivastava said that another western disturbance may pass over the northern plains around January 20. “The interim period will be chilly. The drop in temperature will not be too steep, but will fall gradually every day, with the chilliest day being around January 11. Another warm front may come at the time of the next weather system, but until such time, present conditions will prevail,” Srivatasva said.Air quality in the city remained in the “moderate” category of the air quality index, with 163 on the CPCB’s daily AQI bulletin. This is down from 204 (poor) the previous day. Other major NCR towns, including Delhi, recorded “poor” air with AQIs ranging between 200 to 250. Experts attributed this to the resumption of westerly winds on Friday, blowing at between 8 to 10kmph, which may have helped mitigate some of Gurugram’s pollution load by transporting it eastward, towards Delhi and beyond. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air is likely to remain in moderate category on 09.01.2021 and 10.01.2021,” and may remain in the moderate category for the most of the next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cold-foggy-mornings-here-to-stay-but-afternoons-may-be-warmer-experts-101610131219191.html

09-01-2021||Gurugram||Electricity department will hold public meeting every two months: CM||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday directed the power department to hold public meeting across Gurugram once in two months to resolve residents’ complaints.The power department will have to declare the date and time in advance to allow people the opportunity to have their grievances heard.The chief minister issued these orders while addressing a complaint during a grievance redressal meeting. “Power supply has improved since 2014. For making electricity consumption transparent smart meters are being installed. It would help in resolving billing-related issues. However, if people have doubts about the smart meter reading, they can get their meters checked at a lab,” said Khattar. In the last few months, several complaints have been reported in different localities about inflated power bills and smart meter readings. “The power loss through electricity lines which was almost 34% in the state has reduced to almost 17%. Even the subsidy on electricity which would cost nearly ₹7000 crore to the state exchequer has now come down to ₹6000 crore,” said the minister In Friday’s meeting, at least 14 complaints were placed before the CM, including three forwarded from the previous month’s meeting. Khattar ordered FIRs in two cases related to violation of norms in running a hot mix plant in Farukhnagar and construction of a building in New Colony despite both being sealed.“Legal action will be taken against the offenders. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board should impose penalty and file a FIR against the hot mix plant for unsealing the factory and resuming work,” said Khattar. For controlling the air pollution during winter months, the hot mix plants were directed to remain shut. But violating the norms plant kept on functioning. In another case of continuing the construction work in a sealed building which failed to follow the construction norm, CM ordered legal action. During the meeting, relocation of land owners from five villages – Garhouli, Khurd, Harsaru, Mohammed pur, Khandsa and Narshinghpur – whose land were acquired under Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the state industrial body in 2006 was also raised. Complainants raised the issue of getting unfair compensation. Khattar asked the officials to submit the report and said that the compensation amount will be calculated again and even if the land owners are unhappy, they can approach the court. Other issues like construction of park on a residential land, illegal encroachments in village Bajghera and water connection in sector104 were also discussed in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/electricity-department-will-hold-public-meeting-every-two-months-cm-101610131217341.html
09-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP to probe complaints of discrimination against EWS residents||Taking into consideration, the complaints of discrimination lodged by residents of EWS (economically weaker section) housing in residential projects, the enforcement wing of the department of the town and country planning (DTCP) has decided to issue notices to residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and hold meetings in this regard. The department said that residents of EWS housing have the same rights and responsibilities as other flat owners and they should not be discriminated against in terms of access to entrances, amenities and common areas as per the rules of the DTCP. DTCP officials said that they had received nearly 10 complaints from the residents of EWS housing, alleging that the RWA had created separate entry points for residents and they were not allowed to take the main entrance. In some instances, the residents were not allowed to use the common areas and facilities like parks, community centres and other facilities. In one of the complaints lodged by 119 home buyers of the EWS category in a project located in Sector 95, the residents alleged that the common area demarcated for their block had been barricaded by using iron grilles, thereby depriving them of access.The residents also said that their common area was used as a car parking by apartment owners and they were being denied space, which was rightfully theirs. After a number of complaints of similar nature were lodged by EWS residents, especially during the lockdown, the DTCP officials said that they decided to address the problem in its entirety. “We will be holding meetings with RWAs and conduct inspections of the spots, where these violations have been carried out. Firstly, the RWAs would be asked to remove such walls and gates, which prevent access to common areas. If this doesn’t happen voluntarily, then action would be taken by the enforcement wing,” said Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that they have held meetings with RWAs before in this regard but given the rise in such issues, they have planned an outreach programme to resolve these matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-to-probe-complaints-of-discrimination-against-ews-residents-101610131160158.html

Over 36,000 health workers, including about 4500 from the government sector, will be covered under the first phase of the vaccination drive. The health department will set up at least 60 vaccination sites which could be raised to 80 depending on the requirement, said the senior officials.Among the sites will be at least 21 large private hospitals.“Staff at small health clinics or nursing homes falling within the vicinity of 21 big private hospitals will be clubbed together to form groups of 100 people each. It will help in covering maximum people for the vaccine shot,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. Health care workers have already been registered on Co-WIN, a digital platform to keep real-time information on the beneficiaries of the Covid-19 vaccine. The task is now to map vaccination sites to beneficiary based on proximity. As per the plan, vaccination will be held every Monday, Thursday and Saturday from 9 am to 5 pm. The dry run was helpful in ironing out any wrinkles in the plans.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Out of the 181 sites that we had identified for the vaccination drive, we are likely to choose between 50 and 80. The exact number of sites will be known once we get to know the the vaccine doses that will be made available to us.” Yadav said they hoped to vaccinated the 36,000 health care workers over a few weeks, so that they can be ready to administer the second booster shot after 28 days. “It requires planning and mapping,” said Yadav. Under the phasewise strategy, first health care workers will be vaccinated, followed by frontline workers and then people above 50 years of age. Under priortised group, people below 50 years of age with co-morbidities are also included.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-department-starts-forming-groups-of-health-workers-for-covid-19-vaccination-101610131159706.html

Moreover, even as reports from the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, came positive on Thursday night, the Panchkula administration failed to impose restrictions in the affected areas immediately. It was only on Friday evening that the Haryana animal husbandry and dairying department officially declared two pockets as the epicentre of bird flu, and listed out various measures, including planned culling of 1.66 lakh birds at five poultry farms.Over 4.37 lakh poultry birds have died in the area. A Panchkula health official, who did not wish to be named, said that during the field survey, some farm owners reported that deaths had been taking place since December 1.However, it was only on January 3 that some samples were sent by the Haryana animal husbandry department to Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar.However, the lab found these samples of “poor quality” and had to send its own team to collect them afresh on January 5. Those reports are still awaited.Meanwhile, on January 4, the ministry of health and family welfare constituted an experts’ team to monitor the situation. It held a meeting with the Panchkula administration on January 7 (Thursday). The same night, reports from the Bhopal laboratory came positive.It mentioned that five samples of “dead birds (chicken)” taken from Siddharth poultry farm, Kheri, and Nature poultry farm, Dandlawar, Ganauli, have been found “positive for H5N8 avian influenza” virus.However, it was on Friday evening that the Haryana government declared the outbreak, turning the area within a kilometre of the two epicentres as “infected zone” and 1-10km as “surveillance zone.” The five affected farms are Siddharth, Narender, Naveen and Sunil in Kheri village and Nature in Dhandalwar, Ganauli. “As per guidelines, alert should be issued immediately and movement must be restricted from farms even when there is a suspicion and samples are taken. However, the administration delayed the process. Even after the final report was out, they took a night and entire day to issue the notification,” said an expert, who is part of the five-member central team, who did not wish to be named.The expert said it will get very challenging to break the chain of transmission, as poultry products have been transported to so many different parts of the region, thus “spreading the infection further”.In fact, Hindustan Times found that even till Friday evening, movement was not restricted at some of these farms. A tractor-trailer was seen leaving a farm with empty egg trays and even the driver was without mask. ‘Less pathogenic, but risk remains’ “Although risk to human health is there as H5N8 can be transmitted from birds to human beings, it is less pathogenic, which means there are lesser chances of catching infection,” said a central government expert.Chances of spread of infection is more among those who have long exposure to these birds.“However, we are worried that if its mutation changes during transmission to humans, it will get difficult to control the spread, and like any other flu, mortality will be more in elderly and in people with low immunity,” said the expert.Task force constitutedThe Panchkula deputy commissioner in a press release issued on Friday night said a task force has been constituted. It comprises of senior officials and will work on a war footing, he said. The team will distribute medicines in the affected areas and help in burying the culled birdsHaryana animal husbandry and dairying minister JP Dalal said avian influenza virus is sensitive to heat. Consumers should ensure that all parts of the poultry are fully cooked (no pink parts) and that eggs, too, are properly cooked (no runny yolks). Persons involved in food preparation should wash their hands thoroughly and clean and disinfect surfaces in contact with poultry products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delays-marked-panchkula-administration-s-response-to-bird-flu-scare-101610131159270.html

The suspect was identified as one Krishan Kumar Yadav, a resident of Kherki Duala, who owns a farmhouse in Farukhnagar. He was produced before the court on Friday and taken on a two-day police remand, said officials. According to the Faridabad vigilance department, the victim, Naveen Bhutani, who runs a call centre and sells religious products in the UK and Australia, had approached the senior officers of the department with a complaint against two officials of Kherki Daula police station, alleging that they had extorted ₹57 lakh from him and were demanding another ₹10 lakh. On December 28, the State Vigilance Bureau, following the complaint, had arrested a head constable of Kherki Daula police station and booked its station house officer (SHO) for accepting bribes. However, the latter remains untraceable, said officials. Bhutani had alleged that he was illegally picked up from a resort near Kherki Daula on the expressway and taken to the police station where he was beaten up by the station house officer and threatened with dire consequences. The victim told the officials that SHO had forcefully kept his laptop, which contained all his business data. He had even taken the help of a person from an outsourced agency, who scanned the company’s turn over, data and other confidential data, said officials. The complainant was illegally detained and allegedly taken to a farmhouse in Farukhnagar, nearly 12 kilometres from the police station. PK Aggarwal, director general of police (DGP), vigilance, said that the two policemen threatened Bhutani to put him behind bars and illegally detained him. “They forced him to make calls to his family members, friends and relatives, asking them to arrange for money. One of his friends arranged the money and came to hand it over to him. Meanwhile, he was taken around in his car by the head constable and two other men,” he said. The victim alleged that the SHO had initially demanded ₹1 crore but after negotiation, the deal was finalised for ₹60 lakh. “A case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 384 (extortion ), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code(IPC) was registered against the police officials. The investigation is underway,” police said. Yadav has been booked for conspiracy and common intention, said the police, adding that he had helped the police to use his space despite knowing they were illegally detaining a businessman, said officials. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that an internal inquiry has been started against the SHO and head constable and things will be clear once the SHO is arrested. “There is no place for corruption and action will be taken against those who are found guilty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmhouse-owner-arrested-for-conspiring-with-cops-to-extort-money-from-businessman-101610131158034.html

Officials marked December as the month when they started seeing the declining trend in active cases although they had expected a spike during winter. An analysis of the situation in the district showed that the sample positivity rate (or SPR, which is the number of postiive cases per 100 tests) has been declining since November when it stood at 4.14% with 4822 positive reports out of 116,399 tests that month. This was 2.99% in December with 3034 positive reports out 101,496 tests. From January 1 to 7, there were 153 positive samples out 15,243 tests. Since February, The officials said that the overall sample positivity since March when the outbreak was detected is about 4.58% with 29118 samples testing positive out of total of 635,919. The number of positive samples is greater than the total cases as a person could have been tested multiple times.“The decline is not only in the district but also in the state of UP as well. However, we are still carrying on with our testing and surveillance and also focussing on targeted testing in high incidence areas,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The state control room records also indicate a declining trend with total of 23031 total cases including 1510 active cases as on November 30 while the total cases on December 31 stood at 26109 including 484 active cases. Till January 7, the total cases have stood at 26254 which include only 282 active cases. The experts said that the cases have shown a steep decline in past one and half months and the trend is continuing in January. “Overall, there has been considerable reduction in number of patients coming in. Although the active cases are only a few hundred but all precautions like wearing face mask and frequent hand-washing besides maintaining social-distancing should continue. The arrival of vaccine is possibly very near and it will certainly help,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “It is expected that the declining trend could possibly be result of herd immunity against the infection. Anyways, trend shows that about 80% of patients remained asymptomatic while 15% developed mild/moderate symptoms. The rest 5% required oxygen intervention or ICU admission and only 2% of the 5% required ventilator support. So, it is also possible that large proportion of the population got the infection and it passed away without giving any symptoms,” he, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/positivity-declines-to-1-in-first-week-of-january-101610131038969.html

The maximum temperature also fell three degrees due to the icy cold north-westerly winds in the past 24 hours, with Friday recording a maximum temperature of 15.9 degrees Celsius -- almost a cold day condition -- again 18.4 degrees a day earlier.The average minimum temperature in NCR, based on the Safdarjung observatory, was recorded at 9.6 degrees Celsius, three degrees above the season’s average, while the maximum was recorded at 16.9 degrees, three degrees below the season’s average.Meanwhile, due to poor ventilation conditions on Friday, led by cold weather and drizzle that hiked humidity thereby trapping pollutants, the air quality of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida fell to the ‘very poor’ category, a first since Jan 3. The air quality index (AQI) of Noida remained under the ‘poor’ category, where it was the day earlier.On Friday, the AQI of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, as per the central pollution control board (CPCB), was 261 against 236 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 312 or ‘very poor’ against 288 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 304 against 294 a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nip-in-the-air-as-mercury-drops-in-noida-101610131037483.html

While a few shop owners said that they had seen a slight drop in the sale of poultry products, a few others pointed out that customers were curious about their products -- whether the bird they were buying was healthy when slaughtered and fresh. “We have registered about 30% drop in sale of the chicken today and price too has dropped by ₹40 to 50 per kilogram. However, sale of other meat has picked up too,” said, Muhammad Faizan, who deals in food retail and wholesale business based out in sector 51, Noida. “News of bird flu have spooked a lot of people. However, there have been no such cases from Noida yet. If there are any directions from the administration on this, we will adhere to it.”Another meat and poultry product shop Al-Eshan in sector-77 said their sale has not yet been affected.“The customers are very concerned and asking questions about the safety of the meat and poultry products. But so far we have not seen any drop in sale,” said a worker at the shop.At Delhi’s Ghazipur Murga Mandi that also supplies chicken to Noida and neighbouring cities, the wholesale traders said that price of birds had dropped.“The wholesale rates have gone down by about ₹20 to ₹40 per kilogrammes so far. The demand has also affected due to the fear of the bird flu. However, the effect is not so visible in the retail market yet,” said Imran Qureshi, a wholesaler at Ghazipur Murga Mandi.Cases of bird-flu had been reported in the state of Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. While no case had been reported in Uttar Pradesh so far, the administration has formed a task force to inspect poultry.“We have put all the veterinary hospitals on alert and the surveillance teams are on high alert. So far there had been no incident of unusual deaths among birds or any symptoms noticed suggesting avian flu. There had been only a few reports of two crow and a pigeon dying around some villages but there was nothing dicey about it as a few wild birds especially the crow often dies during the winters due to the lack of protein,” said VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer (CVO), Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-has-poultry-shops-in-noida-concerned-101610130979500.html

The team comprises a superintendent of police (SP)-rank officer, besides a circle officer and three inspectors, who will camp in Ghaziabad.The incident, which took place at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground on January 3, claimed 24 lives and left about a dozen people injured. The police, on the basis of complaint filed, registered an FIR and arrested Nagar Palika’s executive officer Niharika Singh, junior engineer CP Singh and supervisor Ashish Kumar, besides contractor Ajay Tyagi and his accomplice Sanjay Garg. The FIR was registered under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 (causing hurt to any person by doing any act rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (causing damages) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant etc). Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on January 5 had directed that the government’s loss in the incident should be recovered from the suspects. The CM had also directed that action under the National Security Act should be initiated against the suspects.On January 6, Adityanath had directed that the case will be probed by the SIT from the Economic Offences Wing. Tyagi, following his arrest, allegedly revealed to the police that he bribed officials and also resorted to malpractices.“We have taken over the investigation and it is in its initial phase. We have also met the victim families and visited the incident site. More details of the incident are being probed. We are also investigating how the structure collapsed,” said SP Dev Ranjan, who is heading the SIT. According to sources, the SIT met several eye-witnesses and visited the Nagar Palika office, where files of related accounts and works are kept sealed. They added that the probe will also try to find out if more persons were involved in the incident.“The SIT has taken over the investigation from us and they will be staying in Ghaziabad for the duration of the investigation,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). Magisterial inquiry ordered five days after the incident: Meanwhile, the district administration on Friday, five days after the incident, informed the press through a statement by the district information officer that the district magistrate has initiated a magisterial-inquiry into the incident, to be completed by the additional ADM till January 15. When contacted, however, DM Ajay Shankar Pandey maintained that the inquiry was ordered on the day of the incident itself.“I had initiated the magisterial inquiry on January 3 and it is not necessary that every message goes to the media,” Pandey said, while adding that he did not receive the technical inspection report from the committee of engineers constituted after the incident. Earlier, an initial assessment report taken up on the day of the incident by chief engineers of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) and the municipal corporation had found that prima facie, “substandard quality” material and “design issues” had allegedly led to the structural failure. The initial inquiry report had been sent by the divisional commissioner (Meerut) and inspector general (Meerut range) to the government.Later, a team of senior engineers from the GDA, the civic agency and the UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Limited had inspected the incident site on Tuesday. The team was directed by the DM to submit a technical report.Sources said Friday that the team was not able to find any design plan for the structure. The work had been assigned to Tyagi in February 2020 from funds received under the Fourteenth Finance Commission.“The team could not find the design plan for the structure. It also recommended that an expert agency be roped in and a probable design of the structure be prepared to assess different aspects which should have been in place. It is a general practice that public works must include soil testing, foundation design and load bearing capacity of the structure. Otherwise, it is a big risk,” said the source. Free education for children of victim families The DM said he has handed over letters of free education to the 31 children from victim families, including injured persons.“We also have confirmation letters from schools to this effect and handed over letters to families of children. The free education of these children will continue till the last class of the school, whether government or private,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muradnagar-roof-collapse-sit-takes-over-probe-magisterial-inquiry-ordered-101610130978549.html

She is not a technical person and payments could be released payments only after it was duly inspected by engineers,” said Singh’s lawyer Manoj Sisodia outside the office of the chief judicial magistrate where the hearing took place. “The court said that Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) were invoked in the case and will tried by the sessions court, so the bail was rejected.”Singh was lodged at Dasna jail in Ghaziabad. Police had also arrested contractor Ajay Tyagi, his alleged accomplice Sanjay Garg, and Muradnagar Nagar Palika junior engineer CP Singh and supervisor Ashish Kumar in the case. The FIR names them and also invoked IPC sections 337 (causing hurt to any person by doing any act rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 427 (causing damages). Contractor Tyagi was entrusted with the construction work at Ukhlarsi cremation ground. It was to cost about ₹55 lakh and assigned to Tyagi in February, 2020 who was to complete it in 60 days. Tyagi, during questioning, allegedly told police that he received first payment of ₹26 lakh in March and another ₹16 lakh in July. He had to allegedly pay ₹16 lakh to the junior engineer and the executive officer before he could receive the first instalment.Following the alleged disclosure, the Ghaziabad police in a written statement issued on January 5 said that they will add sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act to the ongoing investigation. However, the UP government has entrusted the inquiry to a special investigation team of the Economic Offences Wing. The team headed by superintendent of police Dev Ranjan arrived at Ghaziabad on Friday and visited the incident site and also met victim families and several eye-witnesses. “We have taken over the investigation and it is in initial phase at present. More details will be revealed once the investigation progresses,” SP Dev Ranjan, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bail-of-muradnagar-executive-officer-rejected-lawyers-to-move-sessions-court-101610130979003.html

Children made paintings to attract the attention of the Noida authority on the issue.There are 75 main drains and 44 small drains across Noida. The authority hires contractors to de-silt them as and when needed. However, residents say, that even after cleaning the drains are full of plastic and other waste.“The authority should cover this drain in a manner so that it can be cleaned regularly and the gases emanating out of it does not pollute air in this locality,” said DP Goyal ex-chairman of Jalvayu Vihar Sahkari Awas Samiti.The Noida authority said that it will do what it can.“We clean the drains regularly but people keep throwing all kinds of waste into the drains. However, the national green tribunal had banned covering drains,” said Indu Prakash Singh officer on special duty of the Noida authority.The NGT on March 25, 2014 said banning drains could cause emission of hazardous gases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/residents-demand-cleaning-of-stinking-drain-101610130977440.html

It carries waste water from both Delhi and Noida. It is, however, choking with plastic and other waste thrown into it as it passes through the cities. At least 300 smaller drains merge with it and are just as polluted. The Noida authority has started putting up bamboo net traps to stop this.The irrigation department said they build at least 50 ponds and plant trees that will help reduce pollution levels.“We will start work at the site once the MOU is signed,” a UP irrigation department official confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-iit-clears-funds-for-water-conservation-ponds-101610130978038.html

We expect that the concerned respondents will take measure for speedy disposal of matters before the trial court. We expect that the witnesses be produced so that the rest of the matters are also disposed of”.It asked the Centre and the Delhi government to file a status report with regard to the cases disposed in December 2020 and January 2021 while posting the matter hearing on April 18.The PIL was initiated after the apex court, on September 16, had asked the chief justices of all high courts to forthwith list before an appropriate bench all pending criminal cases involving sitting and former lawmakers where stay was granted.The direction came on a petition which was filed in 2016 and raised the issue of inordinately delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers. While hearing the plea, SC had issued the direction after observing that there has been “no substantial improvement” in disposal of pending criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers.It directed the high courts of all the states that “in the event that a stay is considered necessary, the court should hear the matter on a day-­to-­day basis and dispose of the same expeditiously, preferably within a period of two month, without any unnecessary adjournment.”Referring to a report placed before it in the matter, the top court had said that it indicated that about 175 cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and 14 cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 are pending against sitting or former lawmakers.“These are in addition to the 4,442 criminal cases indicated to be pending as per the earlier report of the amicus dated September 8, 2020,” the Supreme Court noted while directing the chief justice of each high court to formulate and submit an action plan for rationalization of the number of special courts necessary.It had said that the aspects to be considered, while making the action plan, were -- total number of pending cases in each district, required number of proportionate special courts, number of courts that are currently available, number of judges and the subject categories of the cases, tenure of the judges to be designated, number of cases to be assigned to each judge, expected time for disposal of the cases, distance of the courts to be designated and adequacy of infrastructure.The top court had also said that while preparing the action plan the chief justices of the high courts should also consider whether it would be necessary and appropriate to transfer cases where trial is going in an expeditious manner.“The chief justices of the high courts shall also designate a special bench, comprising themselves and their designate, in order to monitor the progress of these trials,” it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcasks-authorities-to-ensure-speedy-disposal-of-cases-against-mps-mlas-101610130917319.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||HC to hear plea on alleged overcharging of colour coded fuel stickers||The Delhi High Court on Friday said that it will hear in February, a plea by the President of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Anil Kumar, alleging that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) were overcharging for the colour coded fuel stickers and High Security Registration Plate (HSRP) that have been made mandatory for vehicles in the national capital.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was informed by advocate Sohail Dutt that the matter is pending in the Supreme Court. However, the claim was disputed by advocate Sunil Fernandes for the petitioner who contended that the present matter had nothing to do with the apex court.He urged the court to at least direct the petitioners to file their reply to the Public Interest Litigation (PIL). The court posted the matter for further hearing on February 12.During the hearing Kumar’s plea was opposed by senior advocate Salman Khurshid, who appeared for the manufacturers, putting two fellow congressmen against each other.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma for the Dehi government told the court that these are statutory schemes and have to be adhered to so that the public is to be benefitted. He said that there is an impression that the citizens of Delhi are in some sort of fear. But there is nothing of that sort.According to the plea, the manner in which the Delhi government was implementing Supreme Court orders for HSRP and colour coded fuel stickers would lead to a loss of around ₹342 crore to the people of the national capital. It said that the notified fee for a colour coded sticker is ₹12.15 and for a complete HSRP set, including the sticker, it is ₹213.24.However, the OEMs were charging customers ₹141.60 (tax not included) and ₹991.20 for the sticker and the HSRP set, respectively, the petition has claimed.It has further claimed that there was a “probable collusion” between OEMs and Delhi government as the latter has commenced a city-wide drive to challan vehicles not having the sticker or the HSRP and the fine amount of ₹5,500 has created a “fear psychosis” in people in the national capital region who are scrambling to get the sticker and HSRP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-to-hear-plea-on-alleged-overcharging-of-colour-coded-fuel-stickers-101610130797349.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||Interstate gunrunner nabbed in Delhi, 35 illegal pistols recovered||A consignment of 35 sophisticated illegally-manufactured pistols and 60 cartridges smuggled into Delhi from Madhya Pradesh by hiding them in secret cavities made inside a car were seized from a 24-year-old alleged interstate gunrunner, police said on Friday. The firearms and bullets were to be sold to different criminals active in Delhi and Haryana, police added.The alleged trafficker of illicit firearms was arrested by a team of the special cell on Thursday afternoon from northwest Delhi’s Pitampura, where he had come to deliver the consignment. He was identified as Ashish Kumar Pandey, a resident of Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said.“Pandey purchased one pistol for R7,500 and sold it further to his contacts in Delhi-CR for R15,000, earning a double profit. The same pistol is sold to a criminal between R25,000 and R30,000,” added the DCP.DCP Yadav said that keeping in view the forthcoming Republic Day celebrations the special cell has been carrying out a special drive against suppliers of illegal firearms in Delhi and adjoining states. Several teams were tasked to identify and nab gunrunners entering Delhi with trafficked firearms manufactured illegally in Bihar’s Munger, and places in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The prime focus was mounted on syndicates that procured illicit firearms from Khargone, Dhar, Barwani, and Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh.On Thursday, a police team received information that an alleged gunrunner, Ashish Kumar Pandey, would be coming to Pitampura with a consignment of arms and ammunition in a Swift Dzire car. Around noon, a trap was laid on Shree Kalyan Parshvanath Jain Mandir Marg, where the suspect arrived in the car after around 1 pm.“The team members surrounded the vehicle and apprehended Pandey. The car was thoroughly searched and 35 pistols along with 60 bullets were found hidden in the secret spaces created in its four doors and the boot. Four pistols were kept in each door while the remaining 19 were kept with the bullets in the spare tyre’s space,” said Yadav.The DCP said Pandey confessed to being a member of an interstate syndicate involved in trafficking of illegal firearms and ammunition. He had procured the weapons from one Prahlad alias Jaggu in Barwani.Pandey told the police that after completing his graduation from Kanpur, his financial crisis led him to come in contact with some illegal arms suppliers two years ago.The police are now looking for other members of the syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/interstate-gunrunner-nabbed-in-delhi-35-illegal-pistols-recovered-101610130497698.html

He said that the children’s future is at stake as they have been deprived of the care and custody of their mother while also contending that she has been falsely implicated in the present matter by the investigating agency.Communal riots had broken out in north east Delhi in February last year claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/court-denies-bail-to-woman-accused-in-head-constable-rattan-lal-s-murder-101610130497249.html

So, the wholesale rates of poultry has dropped in the market. Till Wednesday, the wholesale prices were about ₹100 per bird per kilo which has now dropped to ₹80 to ₹60 per bird per kilo depending upon quality,” said Tehseen Quraishi, a wholesale trader in Ghazipur Fish and Poultry market.Adil Ahmed, another trader at the wholesale market, said that they are taking all precautions and teams of Delhi government are also collecting samples from the market.“Fewer customers came to buy poultry today as compared to the last two days. Samples are being collected by the government to check and control spread of the flu,” he said.However, traders in the city’s retail markets said that the prices of poultry is the same, but customers are asking question before buying the bird.“The customers are probing if the poultry they are buying is healthy and fresh and if it might have been infected by the flu. Though the prices have not yet dropped, but the number of customers has dipped slightly as compared to the last 2-3 days. If cases of bird flu start being reported from the city, then the business will take a hit,” said Salim Quraishi, who has a poultry shop in Sukhdev Vihar area.Consumers said that there was no drop in retail prices of poultry but they were exercising caution.Madhuri Nath, a resident of South Delhi’s Moti Bagh said that the retail prices of chicken had not reduced till at least Friday morning.“We ordered a kilo of boneless chicken on Friday for ₹240. The place where we usually get our supply from had assured us of safety but now that the cases might be coming up in Delhi, we might stop buying poultry altogether,” said Nath.Another consumer, Nipun Tiwari, a resident of Meera Bagh, said that since the news of avian flu scare came out, they have not ordered poultry or chicken products.“We have completely stopped ordering poultry or eggs for the last 2-3 days. It might not be dangerous to humans but we do not want to take any chance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poultry-prices-crash-in-wholesale-markets-amid-fears-of-avian-flu-outbreak-101610130437654.html

The department said there is a forecast of light rains in some parts of the city in the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that Delhi’s air quality on Friday was 234, in the ‘poor’ category. On Thursday, the AQI was 255, also categorised as ‘poor’.On Friday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official marker for the city, was 9.6 degree Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 16.9 degree Celsius — both normal for this time of the season.IMD scientists said winds picked up speed during the day on Friday, due to light rain in some areas of Faridabad on Friday, leading to the dispersion of pollutants.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said winds will get significantly stronger from January 10.“Because of increased wind speeds, air quality will also show a good improvement. On Saturday, the air quality is expected to be between the ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ zones,” said Soni.IMD has also forecast that the temperature is expected to increase slightly over the weekend due to another western disturbance affecting Delhi and areas in the National Capital Region (NCR).Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said there is a possibility of moderate to dense fog in the early hours of Saturday.“There is no major warning of any drastic dip temperature in the coming days. The fog in the early hours is also likely to be moderate. The wind from Sunday will also help clear the fog,” said Srivastava.Due to abundant moisture and other favourable meteorological features, dense to very dense fog is also likely over isolated pockets in Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, West Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and east Uttar Pradesh on January 9 and 10, IMD officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mercury-may-rise-but-air-will-get-cleanerimd-101610130438152.html

The dry run was mainly to build confidence in the processes, resolve any issues that might arise, and to gain much needed practise in taking care of any adverse events that might happen during the immunisation drive.The vaccination drive might begin Wednesday onwards, HT had reported on Friday. The districts have long-listed 55 government and 105 private hospitals, each with over 100 health care workers, to receive the initial roll-out.Meanwhile, officials of the Union health ministry informed the Delhi government on Friday that the vaccine will be rolled out at 89 sites in Delhi.The vaccination sites will be a three-room set-up – the waiting room where beneficiaries will wait on arrival, the vaccination area, and the observation area.There are four vaccine officers and a vaccinator designated for each site and they will verify each person’s ID before matching the name with the list on the government’s CoWIN portal, take a medical history and then administer the shot.The person is to wait in the observation room for 30 minutes to check if (s)he develops any allergic reactions, rashes, breathing difficulty, or fever.At each site, 25 beneficiaries were called in on Friday to go through the mock drill that started at 9am and lasted two hours.At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the site was in the employee health clinic on the eight floor of the outpatient block. “Since the health care workers would be the first to get vaccinated, we have created a site in the employee health clinic. Our nurses are already trained in the exercise and the whole process went smoothly,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the hospital.Across the road, Safdarjung hospital created a vaccination site on the first floor of its old outpatient clinic block that was converted for Covid testing since the pandemic outbreak. “There are things like how to store the vaccine – even in the vaccine carrier boxes, there has to be a certain amount of ice and a certain number of doses. Or, how to take care of adverse events. The dry runs help those who haven’t taken part in such vaccination drives previously understand the processes,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at the hospital.All sites will have an “adverse event following immunisation (AEFI)” kit present and it will contain medicines such as atropine, epinephrine, antihistamine for allergies and paracetamol for fever to take care of any immediate reactions/ side effects.The government has decided to conduct the vaccination drives at 55 government hospitals and 105 private hospitals initially– before starting them in dispensaries – to see what reactions might happen and ensure timely treatment of those who suffer such reactions.At private hospitals selected as centres, the vaccines will be supplied by the Delhi government and will be available for free to beneficiaries. The sites will draw staff from the hospital but will have government appointed supervisors present.“At first, the beneficiaries will be from our own hospital. A list of our staff members who are experienced in vaccinations has already been sent to the Delhi government. They will now be trained for a couple of days on using the government portal and the vaccination process. However, some government staff will also be present during the actual drive,” said Dr Amiya Verma, deputy medical superintendent of Max hospital, Patparganj, which also conducted a dry run on Friday.He said the only hitch o Friday was that many of the staff members called in as beneficiaries had carried their hospital ID instead of a government issued ID needed for the vaccination drive.“It gave us an understanding of how everything needs to be arranged for the actual drive,” he said.India’s drugs controller on Sunday granted restricted emergency approval to two companies for their Covid-19 vaccines.The first vaccine to become available in Delhi will likely be the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, called Covishield in India, and manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India. The other vaccine that has been granted approval for “restricted use in emergency situations” is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hospitals-say-dry-run-was-a-good-practice-days-ahead-of-the-vaccine-roll-out-101610130377188.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi records less than 500 Covid cases in a first since May last year||As the city continues to report fewer number of new cases of Covid-19, the number of tests being conducted too has seen a dip in the last one week.The city has conducted around 70,583 tests on an average daily for the last seven days. In comparison, there were 75,953 average daily tests conducted the week before and 82,710 tests the week before that.On Friday, Delhi reported 444 new cases of Covid-19 and 10 new deaths due to the infection. Delhi’s current death toll stands at 10,654.The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – has, however, coninued dipping.On Friday, the single-day positivity rate stood at 0.59%. The average positivity rate reported over the last seven days was 0.68% as compared to 0.86% the week before that and 1.16% the week before that, the daily data shared by the Delhi government showed.Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for 14 days. Delhi has seen a positivity rate of less than 5% for 37 days now. With flights from UK set to resume, the Delhi government has ordered that all UK returnees must remain in 7-day mandatory institutional quarantine and 7-day home quarantine even if they test negative to prevent the spread of the more transmissible variant of Covid in the city.“For the first time in the last 7 and a half months, the number of cases has gone below 500. After May 17 last year, this is the lowest number of cases recorded. Positivity rate has fallen; testing is still being conducted on a large scale. The outbreak in Delhi is quite contained, but I will still urge you all to wear a mask and follow all the proper precautions,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-records-less-than-500-covid-cases-in-a-first-since-may-last-year-101610130317750.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||Teachers to be included as front line workers for vaccination||Teachers in schools run by the Delhi government and the municipal corporations — who have been actively involved in Covid-19 duty — will also be included in the list of front line workers to be vaccinated in the first phase, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said he raised the matter in the meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday, after which it was unanimously decided that all personnel, irrespective of their departments, who have been part of the city administration’s Covid management team, will be given the vaccine shots on a priority basis under the category of front line workers.“The matter was discussed at length and it was unanimously decided that all personnel who were or have been engaged in Covid related works will be given the vaccine shot under the priority category. This is going to be across all departments,” said Sisodia.The DDMA is chaired by lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and has chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as its vice-chairperson.Earlier the government’s list of front line workers for vaccination only included police personnel, sanitation workers and civil defence volunteers.Apart from teachers, the DDMA’s decision means that select workers from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), and departments such as transport, power, and revenue, among others, will also be considered for vaccination, if the concerned official had performed any Covid duties in the past 11 months.As per rough estimates of the government, around 300,000 health care workers and 600,000 lakh front line workers are to be vaccinated in the first phase. However, the final list of front line workers is still being worked out by the administration.As for including teachers, their inclusion was discussed because school teachers were put on Covid-19 duty, sometimes even for 12 hours or more, as physical classes in schools across the city have been on hold since March last year owing to the pandemic. Hundreds of teachers were helping the government in food distribution during the migrant crisis and were also made in-charges of temporary shelter homes. Scores of other MCD and government teachers are also involved in the government’s door-to-door survey programme in detecting Covid-19 cases and now have been deployed for the upcoming vaccination campaign.“After the vaccine process begins, the government can consider reopening schools. It will be better if teachers are vaccinated. Reopening schools is important because it has been shut for more than 10 months now. The whole academic learning process for thousands of students has taken a hit, especially in government-run schools,” said an officer, who was part of the DDMA meeting.Outlining the Capital’s plan for the first phase of the vaccine roll out, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the government has identified 5.1 million people who will be the first to get Covid-19 vaccination under the Central government’s “priority category”.The government is currently conducting a registration drive and has identified citizens in three priority categories -- health care workers, front line workers such as police personnel and citizens who have been deemed at-risk. The phone numbers of citizens are being updated and an SMS will be sent to the person’s mobile number notifying them about the date, time and place of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-to-be-included-as-front-line-workers-for-vaccination-101610130317299.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi makes 7-day institutional quarantine mandatory for all UK returnees||The Delhi government on Friday announced that all passengers arriving from the United Kingdom would have to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine of seven days, even if they tested negative in an RT-PCR check conducted at the airport on landing, in order to better control the spread of a more infectious mutant Covid-19 strain that is raging in parts of Britain.According to the Union health ministry’s protocols for incoming flyers, released on Wednesday, those who tested positive were to be housed in state quarantine, while those who tested negative could be in home isolation for 14 days.Delhi initially endorsed the guidelines, before adding the extra clause of institutional quarantine for all for the first seven days. The decision was supported by experts from a preventive perspective, but by the time the order was issued, flyers from the UK were already airborne. They learnt that they would have to mandatorily stay in an institutional quarantine facility only after they landed, leading to chaos at Delhi airport soon after the first incoming flight from the UK in 16 days — carrying 256 passengers — landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.Over the course of the day, several of the passengers posted videos and photographs on social media blaming authorities for issuing the order without prior notice.Sauravan Roy, who lives and works in Southampton, said he had taken the first available flight from London to India to visit Kolkata. He said his father had died on January 2, but he could not attend the last rites due to the bar on flights. On Friday, when he reached the airport with a negative Covid-19 test report, he was told that every incoming passenger had to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine for seven days in Delhi.“I followed all the guidelines laid down by the Indian government. I brought along my RT-PCR test report, and got tested upon landing. Despite that, I have been left with no choice but to spend seven days in quarantine. This defeats the purpose of me travelling home during an emergency,” said Roy.He contended that since the new rule was put in place after their flight had departed, those who tested negative should have been exempted, and the rule should have bee applied from the next flight onwards. “If passengers knew about the new mandate, many would have planned their travel accordingly,” he said.Till Friday night, two of the UK returnees had tested positive for Covid-19, and their samples will now be sent for genome tests to check for the mutation.Government authorities said the decision, while inconvenient, was important for safety.“After seeing three waves of Covid in Delhi, somehow the number of daily cases has become manageable. The positivity rate has come down to 0.59%. In such a case, if there is an outbreak of the new UK variant of Sars-Cov-2 it will spread like wildfire in the city as it has higher transmissibility,” said a senior health official who asked not to be named.He added that allowing home quarantine for UK returnees who test negative for Covid-19 would be “too big a risk”.Since the emergence of the new strain in early December, the UK has seen its most severe spike in cases and deaths since the Covid-19 outbreak began. In the last seven days, the country has added an average of 57,243 new cases of the infection per day.The Delhi government has identified 20 hotels and five hospitals to quarantine the passengers. The incoming flyers will have to pay to stay at the hotels -- mostly 4-5 stars; the list includes Taj Palace, ITC Maurya, The Imperial, and several hotels at Aerocity, among others -- and for treatment at four of the five hospitals — Max (Saket), Batra, Fortis (Vasant Kunj), and Sir Gangaram. Treatment at the fifth hospital, Lok Nayak, is free of charge.The rates at the hotels — approximately ₹4,000-4,800 a night — include all meals.Incoming flyers can also stay for free at a quarantine facility at Terapanth Bhawan in Chhatarpur.Officials of the New Delhi district administration, which is in charge of making quarantine arrangements for the UK returnees, said a total of 1,950 rooms in 20 hotels will be used as paid institutional quarantine facilities for the passengers. Eleven of the hotels are in Aerocity, where 1,450 rooms are reserved for quarantine. The other nine have been asked to reserve 500 rooms for the UK returnees.AIRPORT CHAOS The incoming flight (AI 112) landed in Delhi at 10.30am, and passengers said they had to spend around 8-10 hours to get their tests done, receive their reports, and be sent to their respective quarantine centres.Sanju Rigson said she travelled to India on Friday for her wedding on January 18, but was forced to miss her connecting flight to Kochi because of the new rules. “At Heathrow airport, I was given the boarding pass for my flight from Delhi to Kochi. The Delhi government came up with the rule only after we had departed and so we should have been exempted,” she said.Rigson was tested at the Delhi airport around 4.30pm. At 7pm, when she spoke to HT, she was yet to get an update about her test result.“There was a lot of mismanagement at the airport. Only two testing counters are open, causing long queues. The first batch was tested around noon, but there are no updates on reports even at 7pm,” she said.However, officials of the Delhi airport on Friday said that they had specified, in advisories to passengers, that the “time for the test results at T3 may take up to 10 hours”.Passengers also complained that the charges for the Covid-19 tests and paid quarantine were too high. A passenger from Derby, who said his incoming trip was an emergency because his son had sustained burn injuries at his home in Andhra Pradesh, said he had to pay ₹3,400 for the mandatory RT-PCR test at the airport.“Everyone wants to opt for free government quarantine facility. But it will soon be full and we will be left with no option to spend ₹4,000 per night for our quarantine in a hotel,” he said.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said people in the initial phase of infection do not test positive. “The infection’s incubation period is five to six days. A 14-day isolation period is important, and essential. If they had done this (mandatory quarantine) when the infection began to spread in January, we would have managed to contain the spread more effectively,” Kant said.Delhi government spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment, despite multiple calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-makes-7-day-institutional-quarantine-mandatory-for-all-uk-returnees-101610130257296.html

Meanwhile, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is also being followed on the zoo premises by authorities.“All the enclosures are being disinfected thrice a day, with special focus on areas where wild and migratory birds come in. Enclosures are also being inspected regularly to check for any symptoms of flu” said a Delhi zoo spokesperson.The official also said that as a precautionary measure, the National Zoological Park has also stopped ordering chicken from NCR towns and from other wholesale markets. Usually, the Delhi zoo orders around 40-50 kilos of chicken to feed the animals there.“We have stopped feeding chicken to animals. This is not only for the safety of animals but also for the safety of the enclosure keepers who are handling their feed,” the official said.When it comes to checking the feeding of animals, the zoo is also at present not keeping fish and bird feed in open enclosures, to ensure that this does not attract wild birds.Officials said that they are careful and do not want a repeat of the 2016 bird flu epidemic at the Delhi zoo, which led to the death of several birds. The Delhi zoo, one of the most popular tourism spots of NCR, was closed for visitors for nearly three months after the 2016 scare.“All the tests will be conducted and we will ensure maximum safety,” the Delhi zoo spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-zoo-taking-precautions-for-safety-of-its-inhabitants-101610130198375.html

09-01-2021||Delhi||PWD translocates pipal tree near demolished temple in ChandniChowk to east Delhi||The Delhi government’s public works department (PWD) early Friday morning removed the pipal tree in Chandni Chowk -- located right next to the Hanuman temple that was demolished by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation earlier this week on the orders of the Delhi high court -- and transplanted it at a site in east Delhi. Although the PWD officials said they had taken permission from the forest department and were in line with the law while removing the tree, the Delhi BJP criticised the government for not protecting heritage trees.A PWD official said the tree has been transplanted at its subdivision office near Geeta Colony in east Delhi after being removed from the site around 2am Friday.“We had necessary permission for the relocation of the tree from the forest department. It has been transplanted at our subdivision office. Like the temple, the tree was also falling on the right of way and had to be removed,” said the PWD official in charge of the project.But the BJP took umbrage over the way it was transplanted. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shanker Kapoor, said, “They removed the tree at night. The PWD removed the tree from the site after permission from the government. We condemn the move.”North corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “This shows that the government is not concerned about heritage trees and the environment.”The temple, located on the road which is being redesigned only for pedestrians only as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan, was declared “illegal” by the high court and the order for its removal was passed in 2015.On Sunday, the North corporation had demolished the Hanuman temple in the heritage market in pursuance of the high court order.This had led to a blame game between the AAP and the BJP. While the AAP blamed the BJP, which is the ruling party in the North corporation for the demolition, the latter blamed the Delhi government for not incorporating the temple and the tree in the redevelopment plan of Chandni Chowk.The Chandni Chowk redevelopment work aims to have a decongested and pedestrianised heritage market along the 1.5km road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid and the project is being executed by Shahjahanbad Redevelopment Corporation.Both the AAP and the Delhi government refused to comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pwdtranslocates-pipal-tree-near-demolished-temple-in-chandni-chowk-to-east-delhi-101610129957649.html
09-01-2021||Delhi||High court to hear plea against Covid bed reservation on Feb 12||The Delhi High Court on Friday said that it would hear the plea by Association of Healthcare Providers challenging the decision of the Delhi government to reserve 80% Covid ICU beds in 33 private hospitals on February 12 after the petitioners raised questions on the gradual manner of de-escalation of Covid ICU beds.Justice Navin Chawla said that no further adjournments would be given on the next date and posted the matter for Tuesday.The Delhi government counsel advocate Urvi Mohan sought an adjournment from the court due to the absence of the Additional Solicitor General. However, this was opposed by senior advocate Maninder Singh, for the petitioners, who said that they should not be left at the mercy of the government which has reserved the beds even after the positivity rate had plunged to 0.5%.Senior advocate Singh said that when the government had to reserve the beds, it did it in one go but the de-escalation is being done gradually. He also opposed the Delhi government’s move to reserve 40% Covid ICU beds in 33 private hospitals and said that he has also advised his client to file a suit of recovery against the government.“It is very convenient for the government to take adjournments in the matter when there is no stay on the order. We are under article 226 and we are not getting any adjudication here,” Singh, along with advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, submitted.The Delhi government also informed the court that it has reduced the reservation of Covid-19 intensive care units (ICU) beds from 80% to 40% in 33 private hospitals, while considering the low occupancy of such beds by Covid patients in the city.The government gave an order of January 6 passed by the medical superintendent of nursing homes, RN Das, under the approval of home minister Satyendra Jain to the court, stating that it has accepted the recommendations of a review meeting held on January 5 by a committee of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to reduce the number of beds further to 40%.The order has said that the data with respect to pattern of Covid ICU bed occupancy on Jan 5 in 33 private hospitals was analysed by the committee and it was recommended that the de-escalation should take place up to 40%.It, however, added that the status of Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket as a fully COVID dedicated hospital shall continue.On December 27, the Delhi government had reduced the ICU beds occupancy from 80% to 60%. However, it had also said that they would not consider any further de-escalations in the wake of the new strain of the Sars-Cov-2 virus detected in the United Kingdom, as well as with Christmas and New Year’s celebrations in mind. The government said it will review the situation in January.The court had, on December 24, said it would be “inhumane” to have 80% ICU beds in almost three dozen private hospitals of the city reserved only for Covid-19 patients, especially when the positivity rate and cases in the city was falling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-to-hear-plea-against-covid-bed-reservation-on-feb-12-101610129957147.html
