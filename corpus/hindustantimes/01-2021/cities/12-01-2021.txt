Some students had spotted her lifeless body hanging from the fan and raised the alarm. Police have initiated inquest proceedings and sent the body to the civil hospital for post-mortem. The cops claim to have recovered a suicide note, in which the girl, who is a Class-12 commerce student, had written that she was taking the extreme step as her parents were planning to marry her off after her final exams. The girl’s parents, however, denied the claim. They stated that she had gone to school as usual on Monday but did not return home. After waiting for some time, they had started a search for her but to no avail. They later filed a police complaint. On Tuesday morning, school authorities informed them about her suicide, they claimed. The girl is survived by her parents and two siblings.As per sources, footage of the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in the school had revealed that the girl had been wandering in the school building throughout the night. A CCTV grab showed her moving from Room Number 12 to another room.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Harnek Singh, who is investigating the case, said the girl’s life could have been saved if the guard had checked all the rooms properly before locking the school.Taking note of the incident, district education officer (DEO), elementary-cum- secondary Rajinder Kaur visited the school and marked an inquiry. A two-member committee, comprising the principal of GSSS, Basti Jodhewal, and principal of GSSS, Ayali Khurd, was formed to look into the matter. The DEO said, “It was necessary to mark an inquiry as this is a sensitive matter. The school authorities should have checked the classrooms before closing the school. This shows negligence on the part of the school authorities.” School principal Smriti Bhargav said she was on leave and had learnt of the incident from some teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/17yearold-missing-ludhiana-girl-found-dead-in-her-school-101610475917790.html

A sophisticated pistol, with one cartridge, was recovered from Vishwakarma, who has been involved in at least 22 crimes, including seven murder cases, in Uttar Pradesh. He belongs to Dhruv Kumar Singh alias Kuntoo Singh’s gang that has a rivalry with Mukhtar Ansari’s group, said additional deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Ghanshyam Bansal.On January 6, Vishwakarma along with associates Ravi, Ankur, Bandhan and two others had gunned down Ansari’s alleged henchman, Ajit Singh, near Kathauta crossing, under Vibhuti Khand police station limits in Lucknow’s Gomti Nagar. Singh was in a sports utility vehicle (SUV) with his associate Mohar Singh when bike-borne assailants opened indiscriminate fire on the vehicle on January 6. Singh was killed while Mohar and a passerby were critically injured, the police said.Ajit Singh, apart from being Ansari’s close associate, was also a key witness in the murder of UP’s former legislator Sharvesh Singh alias Simpu in July 2013, the police said. Ansari is presently lodged in a jail in Punjab’s Ropar.Additional DCP Bansal said that on January 11 (Monday), the outer-north district’s special staff team received information regarding the movement of a man with an illegal firearm in Shahabad Dairy area. The team processed the information and caught the man, whose identity was established as Girdhari alias Kanhaiya Vishwakarma, a suspect wanted by the Uttar Pradesh Police.“Vishwakarma’s interrogation revealed that apart from Ajit Singh’s murder, he was also involved in the murder case of a bus conductor, Ritesh Singh, who was also believed to be associated with Mukhtar Ansari. Ritesh was murdered in 2019 in Varanasi. The UP Police had declared R1 lakh reward on Ajit Singh’s arrest in that case,” said additional DCP Bansal.Police said that Vishwakarma entered the crime world in 2001 by committing a robbery. In 2005, he joined Kuntoo Singh’s gang, became his hitman and began committing murder, they said.“Vishwakarma last came out of jail in 2016. He was also booked in UP under the Gangsters Act,” said Bansal, adding that the UP Police have been informed about the arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-wanted-for-murder-of-gangster-turned-politician-mukhtar-ansari-s-aide-arrested-101610475858910.html

The lecture was organised on the 158th birth anniversary of Vivekananda.“He [Vivekananda] particularly talked about unity of society and lamented that one of the causes of India’s degradation was its social fragmentation, caste system and self-centric narrow vision. He said and I quote “The solution to the caste problem in India is not to degrade the higher caste but to raise the lower up to the level of the higher”,” Doval saidThe national security advisor also said the country was on the “threshold of a great leap forward” and the youth showed “a new surge to carry the nation forward with a new passion of patriotism”.“If they [youth] work with the single goal of nation building, your generation can play a seminal role not only in transforming India at a pace and in a way as never before but also the world at large,” Doval said.He also said JNU has played “seminal role in academics, research, and public affairs” and said the country was “proud” of the contributions of cabinet ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and S Jaishankar, who are the alumni of the university.JNU Rector III RP Singh said the week-long celebration of Swami Vivekananda festival included a series of lectures, sports, mini marathons, badminton, table tennis and other activities. The awards will be given to students on January 26 during the Republic Day celebrations, Singh said.In November, JNU had also announced that it will organise week-long “Swami Vivekananda Youth Festival” every year. On November 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also digitally unveiled the statue of Swami Vivekananda on JNU campus.“This would immortalise the messages, thoughts and visions of this great son of India and spread the teachings of Swami ji among the JNU community, especially among the students,” JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-jnu-s-first-swami-vivekananda-lecture-doval-asks-youth-to-focus-on-nation-building-101610475678226.html

Proposals sent by many private schools are pending government’s nod.“The cabinet approved two NICSI [National Informatics Centre Services Inc] empanelled firms to set up PMU [Project Monitoring Units] with reputed Chartered Accountants to examine fee hike proposals of private recognised unaided schools on government land in Delhi. This will enable faster disposal of the proposal for fee hike submitted by the schools for the session 2018-19 and 2019-20,” the government said in a statement on Tuesday.Under the land lease agreements, private schools built on government land in Delhi cannot increase fees without approval from the Directorate of Education (DOE). Once a proposal is sent, the DoE will audit their finances and allow the schools to increase fees only if they are found to be struggling to manage expenses. Schools operating on private land are not required to take DoE’s approval to increase fees but they have to submit their statement of fees and other financial details with the department every year.The Delhi cabinet also approved ₹64.37 crore for incurring expenditure towards the annual disbursement of cash subsidy for the students of government and aided schools. Every year, DoE provides textbooks and cash through direct benefit transfer to students of government and aided schools studying in classes 1 to 8 and cash subsidy to students of classes 9 to 12.An additional recurring expenditure of Rs.30.05 crore has been allocated under the Delhi government’s scheme ‘free supply of textbook supplies and material 2020-2021’, the government said. Under this provision, supply of allied material, workbooks, mental maths material, teacher diaries including nursery and KG textbooks to the government and aided schools will be done by Delhi Bureau of Text books (DBTB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-to-set-up-panels-to-examine-fee-hike-proposals-by-pvt-schools-101610475618837.html
12-01-2021||Other||Young and healthy to be given the shot first||New Delhi: Younger healthcare workers without co-morbidities will be the first to receive the shots against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on January 16, when the nationwide roll-out of the inoculation drive begins, several officials from Delhi involved in the process confirmed on Tuesday, requesting anonymity. Those between 20 and 49 years without co-morbidities have to be selected in the list of 100 beneficiaries for each of the 89 centres that will kick-start the vaccination drive in Delhi, according to a communication from the state team to the districts. The districts have also been asked to focus on vaccinating safai karmacharis, ambulance staff, and ward boys in addition to the doctors and nurses, the district officials said. “This will help us monitor and better manage adverse reactions, if any. We have to put our best foot forward and instill confidence among people in the vaccines,” said a senior official from the South-West district. A senior official from New Delhi district said: “As a matter of utmost precaution, we will be selecting young and healthy volunteers for the first few days of the vaccination drive.” This was confirmed by senior officials from North and West districts as well. “All districts are currently conducting a sort of internal dry run to see everything runs smooth on the CoWIN platform on Saturday. The list of beneficiaries who will be vaccinated on that day will be finalised tomorrow,” said a senior official from Central district, refrying to the app that will facilitate the drive. The Delhi government did not respond to queries.Delhi has nearly 300,000 health care workers– doctors, nurses, paramedics, safai karmacharis, security personnel, and administrative personnel in health care facilities – who will receive the vaccine first. An estimated 600,000 frontline workers and 4.2 million people above the age of 50 will follow. The government is yet to prepare a list of those below the age of 50 with co-morbidities who will be eligible for the vaccine under the government programme. So far, the city has received 264,000 doses of Covishield -- Indian variation of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India. Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a part of the state task force on Covid-19 vaccination, said: “The hospitals will focus on staff other than the doctors and nurses, with many ward boys and other staff receiving the shot on the first day. The beneficiary list is yet to be finalised, but the decision to select young and healthy people is in line with the Centre’s mandate that those with co-morbidities receive the vaccine a little later.” She added: “The compliance is likely to be better among the younger people. Also, it is the young doctors, nurses and staff – those below the age of 50 – who have been working in the Covid-19 wards and it is important to protect them first.” She said a vaccination rate – those who actually get the vaccine among those identified as beneficiaries -- of 75% to 80% would be considered a success. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The chances of any adverse event happening or the adverse event being dangerous is lower among the young and healthy people for vaccines in general. This could be the rationale behind selecting such beneficiaries early on.” He added: “In case of this vaccine, the decision could also have been based on the safety data that has been provided by the companies to the drug controller. The current analysis of safety is based on those between the ages of 18 and 50 and even though older volunteers have been included in the phase III trials, the sub-group analysis of the data is awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/young-and-healthy-to-be-given-the-shot-first-101610475498284.html

In Delhi, the drive is scheduled to be formally launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at Lok Nayak hospital, a senior government official said.“Delhi is fully prepared and all preparations are in place,” said Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain.The 89 locations approved so far include – 49 private hospitals and 40 public healthcare facilities. They include hospitals such as Lok Nayak, AIIMS, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, Sir Gangaram Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Fortis, Indraprastha Apollo, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (Cancer), Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (Tahirpur), ILBS, Venkateshwar Hospital (Dwarka), Madan Mohan Malviya (Malviya Nagar), Moolchand Hospital and St Stephen’s Hospital.Preparations at the 89 selected vaccination locations were on a full swing on Tuesday, with district officials taking note of any last-minute requirements. “We, the district officials, are just going to the sites and taking note of any last-minute additions or logistics that needs to be taken care of,” said a second government official.On the first day, one booth or vaccination site each will be there at 89 centres. However, over the next week, the government has planned to increase the total number of booths to at least 225, by setting up multiple vaccination sites in some of the locations, said a senior government official.The official added, “We have set up teams that have assessed the 89 vaccination locations. Several of them are capable of accommodating more than one vaccination site.”The teams have so far identified several hospitals that include Lok Nayak and AIIMS as locations that can have three or more vaccination sites, said the official. “At each site, there has to be space not only for vaccination but also for verification of candidates, and rooms where they can rest while being monitored for at least 30 minutes after taking the shot,” he said.Each booth will administer a maximum of 100 vaccine shots a day and run by six to eight staff.A health department official said, “There are 621 functional cold chain points. Each cold chain point will be connected to four to five vaccination sites. This means, most of the big hospitals will have more than one vaccination sites as they would need to quickly vaccinate all their own staff, before moving on to others from smaller centres,” said a health department official.With time, the government aims to increase both vaccination locations and vaccination sites. “We had sent a list of more than 600 locations, of which 89 have been approved by the central government so far. In the coming days, more locations are likely to get approved. Eventually, we have plans to increase vaccinations sites to 1,000 in several phases,” the official added.On Tuesday morning, 22 boxes containing 1,200 vials each of the vaccine was brought to Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital’s utility block that has been retrofitted with 90 deep freezers which can store 4.1 million doses of the vaccine. “Each of the vials contains ten doses of the vaccine. So far, Delhi has received 264,000 vaccine doses that will be almost enough for the healthcare workers in the city,” said another senior government official.“There are three levels of security that will be in place – first there are CCTV cameras installed within and outside the building, second there are hospital guards stationed at the vaccine store round the clock, and police personnel deployed outside the store,” said Dr Chavvi Gupta, spokesperson for the hospital.The Delhi has pegged the number of healthcare workers at 300,000, of which around 225,000 have already been registered. The government has planned to finish giving them the vaccine shots by the end of this month, said another official.Next in line would be frontline workers – a wide range of people including police, teachers, sanitation, and civil defence volunteers. Their total number has been estimated at 600,000 and registration process for them is underway.The third category that would include people aged over 50 years and those with serious comorbidities irrespective of age. The government has roughly pegged the number at 4.2 million for these categories taken together but, senior officials said, it is likely to witness increase. Registration for this category is yet to begin. While the government has prepared a draft list of people over 50 years through electoral data, those with comorbidities are yet to be identified, the official said.“We are committed to ensuring that the vaccination goes smoothly for people who are vaccinated as well as officials and workers involved in the process,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and advisor to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-receives-first-vaccine-consignment-drive-to-be-launched-at-89-centres-101610475377831.html

12-01-2021||Chandigarh||Supreme Court clears decks for power privatisation in Chandigarh||The Supreme Court on Tuesday put on hold the stay given by the Punjab and Haryana high court for privatisation of the Chandigarh electricity department, thus clearing the decks for the administration to go ahead with the process.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “Power privatisation will be put on fast track now.” The bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Ajay Rastogi was hearing the Chandigarh administration’s plea against the stay. The detailed order is awaited. The next date of hearing is February 5.The high court bench of justices Jitendra Chauhan and Vivek Puri had stayed the process on December 1 on the plea of UT Powermen Union, a worker’s collective that had challenged the move to privatise 100% distribution and supply functions of the electricity wing of UT’s engineering department. The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12 after directions from the Centre. An empowered committee was constituted to oversee and implement the process, and the administration had assured the Centre that it would be completed by the end of 2020.As many as 17 firms, including Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power Company Limited, GMR Generation Asset Limited, NTPC Electricity Supply Limited and Sterlite Power, have also expressed interest after the administration on November 9 invited bids. The union had sought quashing of the decision to privatise the department and subsequent process of tendering initiated by the administration. What were powermen’s objectionsThe HC was told that the administration is selling 100% stake of the government in the absence of such a provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003. As per Section 131 (2), the power department cannot be transferred to a totally private entity with no stake or control of the government at all, the court was informed. The department is running into profits and its revenue has been surplus for the past three years, the high court was told, adding that the current system is economically efficient with transmission and distribution losses less than the target of 15% fixed by the power ministry. It was pointed out that the transfer scheme has been prepared without calling for objections from all stakeholders — neither employees nor consumers. “In the absence of an advise from the advisory committee to the Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) and without there being any recommendation of the JERC to that effect, privatisation of electricity wing of UT is not sustainable in the eyes of law,” it has been argued in the high court. How will it affect youA senior UT official said that the electricity department caters to a city with relatively low demand of around 400MW. As there are only 2.3 lakh consumers, if privatised, the efficiency is expected to improve, specifically of the distribution of power, he said.

According to the rules, the promoter has to transfer the balance amount available with him against the maintenance charge to association of allottees once it is formed,” Rajive Kumar, chairman of UP-Rera, said on Tuesday.“Some projects are completed in phases with a time gap in construction. Since each phase is an independent area, AoA has to be formed for each phase as per Section 14 of Apartment Act. Hence, phase-wise formation of AoA is a legal and practical requirement,” said Kumar.“Regarding what should be the shape of AoA after the completion of all the phases, there is no much clarity on this issue, and this has to be discussed with the various stakeholders and a decision legally tenable may be arrived at,” said Kumar.However, Pankaj Goyal, a realtor and member of Credai-NCR (western UP zone), said, “Separate maintenance account is not going to solve the problem. Income and expenditure details of maintenance are made separately and AoA can verify the details. However, if UP-Rera feels there is a need for a separate maintenance account, we will take suggestions from promoters and send them to the regulator when it meets with promoters on the issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uprera-suggests-separate-maintenance-account-for-builders-101610474658784.html

Thousands of farmers have been protesting at UP Gate border with Delhi since November 28 and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway since December 3. Rakesh Tikait, farmer leaders and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said on Tuesday: “Andolan jaari rahega ... koi galatfahmi me naa rahe ... January 26 ka tractor march hoga Dilli mein (The protests will continue... no one should be under any misunderstanding... the tractor march will be held in Delhi on January 26),” Tikait said at UP Gate. “We will also go to our legal committee and dissuasions will be held (about court’s directions) in our core committee. We will also speak to the government on January 15.” The BKU later issued a statement in which they thanked the Supreme Court for showing a positive stand towards the farmers. “The core committee will examine the court order and will decide on future course of action,” the statement said. Among the protesters were the elderly, women and children who were staying in temporary camps, tractor-trolleys while others also visit the site on daily basis. “The women are farmers and have come here with their children without any force. So, we cannot force them to leave. We have not decided whether we will shift base from here to any other site. In all, we want to say that we will stay here till laws are repealed. The exercise for the tractor march on January 26 will also continue and 11 farmers who are on 24 hours relay fast will continue their fast,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and part of the farmers’ committee at UP-Gate. On Tuesday, 70-year-old Mohammad Naseem, a protesting farmer and native of Muazffarnagar, had to be rushed to a hospital in Vaishali. “He almost fainted at the protest site.

The icy cold winds towards Delhi-NCR regions are coming directly from the region that had received fresh snowfall thus the mercury will drop for next two days. Due to this there is high possibility of cold-wave for next three days across NCR including Noida and adjoining area,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the weather analysts, the wind chill factor will continue the nip in the air with lesser difference between the minimum and maximum temperatures. “The icy cold north-westerly winds will maintain the wind chill factor, which means that in spite of sunshine, the day time temperatures remain low due to the cold winds from northern Himalayas,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency, Skymet. On Tuesday, Noida saw a minimum temperature of 7.5 degrees Celsius against 8.7 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature on Tuesday for Noida was recorded at 16.4 degrees Celsius same as a day earlier.

12-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers bond over cups of hot tea||As a cold wave sweeps across the Delhi-NCR and intermittent showers lash the makeshift tents of farmers protesting at the Haryana-Rajasthan border, a teeming crowd of men hovers around a particular camp at the site—the Mewat camp. On getting closer, one is able to spot the crowd-puller— a cuppa of hot tea, which has gained immense popularity among the protesting farmers. The tea langar is being run by a team of people from the Meo community of Rajasthan and Haryana for the past one month. Spread across the once contiguous belt of eastern Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the Meos or Mewati (as the community identifies itself) often rally around common causes. This time, the Mewatis from the two states have united to extend support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Mohammad Shakir, a resident of Nuh in Haryana, said that farmers from the region were against the three farm laws and have joined the agitation to strengthen it. “Beyond the borders of states, we see ourselves as a common unit, as Mewatis. We are farmers too and stand against these laws and in support of our fellow brothers,” said Shakir, while serving hot tea to a serpentine queue of protesting farmers. The tea langar runs from five in the morning till 11 at night, with people taking turns at making and serving tea. A team of 25-30 people, consisting of Mewatis from both Rajasthan and Haryana handle the operations of the langar. The supplies needed for making tea and other snacks are contributed by people from different villages. “People from different houses in the village contribute milk, sugar and biscuits depending on their capacity. We send out a word in the village or make announcements from the mosque so that people are able to contribute,” said Shakir. Most of the men handling the cooking at the camp only learned to make tea recently. Maulana Umar, a 27-year-old from Punhana, said that he and others were not well-versed with cooking until now. “I did not know how to make tea initially. I learned it here and made tea for the first time,” said Umar, who teaches at a Madarsa. “While others are busy in the fields, we were relatively free since the madarsa is closed due to the pandemic. Our elders asked us to serve people here and we came here for khidmat (help),” said Umar. It took the men the first few days to get the taste right but both the tea and the snacks served here gained quick popularity. “They don’t put much water in the tea. It’s very different and we call it the special Mewat chai. Everyone loves the tea here,” said Rakesh Phagodiya, a farmer from Rajasthan. He said that the government had unintentionally united people by bringing the three laws. “Everyone has come together to defeat the three laws here. There are no differences among us,” said Phagodiya. Mohd Shakir, a Mewati from Alwar in Rajasthan, said that people walked for kilometres to have tea at the Mewat stall. “Farmers are spread across kilometres but they still prefer to come here for tea. Their appreciation motivates us,” said Shakir, adding that police officials stationed at the border also enjoyed the tea prepared by the Mewat camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-bond-over-cups-of-hot-tea-101610473097524.html
12-01-2021||Gurugram||Plot owners call for 10% cut in proposed circle rates||Plot owners, builders and homebuyers in the city have asked the district administration to reduce the circle rates by at least 10% as the real estate industry is facing a sustained slowdown due to the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The district administration has already proposed the new circle rates in the last week of December 2020 and are likely to be implemented from April. Objections to the same can be submitted till January 15.Gurugram Home Developers and Plot Owners Association, in a letter to the district administration on January 9, said that there is a need to reduce the rates by almost 10% to make real estate competitive in the district. The association has also demanded that circle rate for builder floors, which is the only segment witnessing sales, not be being increased by almost ₹1,000 per square yard. “The proposal to increase the circle rate from ₹5,500 to ₹6,600 per sq yd will badly hit the segment. Small developers and contractors engaged in building such floors will lose business and the government will lose revenue if the rates are increased,” said Ramesh Singla, a senior functionary of the association. The association has also asked the district administration to review the circle rates for sale of basement, saying that the current rates are exorbitant. “There is no right of land for basement. So, circle rate should be charged only on construction,” said Singla. Property dealers also said that registration of property at revenue offices should be further streamlined so that the buyers and sellers don’t suffer. “The process of obtaining no-objection certificate (NOC) for carrying out property registration has become very difficult. Earlier, it was easier to get permission, but now, the process has become cumbersome,” said Imran Khan, a property owner. Basti Ram, the district revenue officer, said that all affected stakeholders, including property developers, can submit their objections and concerns to the district administration by January 15. “We will look into the objections and same will considered positively. The new rates will be applicable from April,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/plot-owners-call-for-10-cut-in-proposed-circle-rates-101610472737503.html
12-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram to get 40K doses of vaccine by Thursday||The district is set to receive almost 40,000 doses of Covishield coronavirus vaccine by Wednesday night or Thursday morning, from the first batch of over 241,000 doses assigned for Haryana. Senior health department officials said on Tuesday that the vaccine is likely to arrive at the Kurukshetra vaccine storage facility on Wednesday.Of the total consignment to be received by the state, there are at least 241,000 doses of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India and 20,000 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which would arrive later. On Tuesday, the Covishield vaccine reached New Delhi through a flight from Pune airport. “The vaccine has arrived at the Central government’s warehouse in Karnal for supply to the northern region. On Wednesday, the stock allocated for Haryana will arrive at the state warehouse in Kurukshetra. From there, it will be transported to all 22 districts through vaccine vans and is likely to reach all districts by January 14,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department. Covishield has been developed by the Serum Institute of India, a Pune-based pharmaceutical company. It is a local version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being used in the UK. The safety and efficacy data of the vaccine generated on over 23, 745 participants above 18 years of age in different countries, showed vaccine efficiency to be around 70.42%. The results from the Serum Institute’s Phase II and III clinical trials on 1,600 participants was found comparable with the data from the overseas clinical studies. On January 3, the Subject Expert Committee of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation gave approval to Covishield for restricted use in emergency situation in India. Covishield is one of the two vaccines to get emergency approval for controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, with the other being Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Gurugram will get the maximum number of doses in the initial phase due to the highest number of healthcare workers, over 36,000, registered on the Co-WIN platform, said officials. Across the state, the count goes up to 250,000 healthcare workers. “The first batch of vaccine is sufficient to cover all the health workers, both government and private, as the state is getting almost 261,000 doses. Gurugram will also get sufficient doses of Covishield to cover all its health workers,” said Arora. According to officials privy to the matter, the exact district-wise allocation of doses has to be approved by the central government. “Covishield will be provided to Gurugram. It is likely the district will get almost 40,000 doses, considering there will be 1% wastage of vaccine at every session site,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Arora said that the inoculation drive starting from January 16 the state will have only limited session sites, as per the guidelines issued by the Central government.

12-01-2021||Gurugram||Dedicated cold storage unit set up at Pataudi hospital for Covid-19 vaccines||A dedicated cold storage unit has been set up at the Civil Hospital in Pataudi to store the Covid-19 vaccine, which is likely to arrive in the city on Wednesday night. The facility has a walk-in cooler and deep freezers equipped with constant temperature checks to maintain the potency of the vaccine, said officials.Located almost 30 kilometres from the main city, the facility has the capacity to facilitate storage of over 300,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses. It is a regional reserve that will supply vials to other nearby districts of Faridabad, Palwal, Nuh and Rewari, said health officials. In Gurugram alone, vaccine vials will be transported to at least 36 public healthcare centres and further to vaccination sites through small vaccine carriers. Dr Neelu Yadav, senior medical officer, Civil Hospital, Pataudi, said, “The storage facility is equipped to store vaccine whenever it arrives. Earlier this month, the district vaccine storage unit had to be shifted from the old Civil Hospital due to construction of the new hospital building. Therefore, for Covid-19, a separate cold storage unit has been prepared to stock vaccine at the optimal temperature.”The store has a walk-in cooler, which is like a modular cold room to put vaccines and the temperature of the cooler is maintained at 5 degrees Celsius. Two temperature measurement devices and a small temperature printer are affixed outside the walk-in cooler to monitor and record the temperature, and check any fluctuation between checks.“Over 2.5 lakh (250,000) doses can be stored inside the walk-in cooler. To maintain the temperature, walk-in coolers are opened only when necessary. Opening it every now and then can lead to fluctuations in temperature, affecting the vaccine’s potency,” said Sushil Sewak, a district cold chain technician, who has been working with the Gurugram health department for the last 33 years. “Covid-19 vaccination is a major exercise and has to be handled cautiously. Thereby, all arrangements are being done to properly store the vaccine,” he said, displaying another small cooler, shaped like a refrigerator, which can stock over 40,000 vials.The unit also has four ice-line refrigerators or deep freezers to refrigerate ice packs for transportation of the vaccine. These are in addition to the four deep freezers used in the vaccines for routine immunisation programmes. “Presently, the temperature of the ice pack is -25 degrees Celsius. These ice packs will be conditioned at the required vaccine temperature of 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius before the Covid-19 vials are placed in the round sockets. It is also called temperature conditioning before vials are put inside the vaccine carriers for distribution to community healthcare centres and primary healthcare centres and further to vaccination sites,” said Sewak.Each refrigerator has Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) to monitor the temperature of the cold chain and vaccine stock. The details can be accessed through a mobile phone. In addition, almost 285,000 auto-disable syringes of 0.5 ml, for the vaccination, have also been stored at the facility. On Tuesday, two policemen were seen deployed on 24-hour duty outside the storage unit.Balbir, a policeman deployed at the site, said, “We have to prevent unnecessary gatherings and movements near the storage facility for a few days, until the vaccination is launched. There will be restricted entry; only health department and senior government officials will be allowed. Extra vigil will be kept during night hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dedicated-cold-storage-unit-set-up-at-pataudi-hospital-for-covid-19-vaccines-101610472678459.html
12-01-2021||Gurugram||Gangster Akash Yadav arrested after chase from Shimla||Chasing a wanted man from his hideout in Shimla, the Gurugram police finally arrested 26-year-old gangster Akash Yadav, alias Ashu, on Sunday night from the Dwarka Expressway. Teams have been on his trail over the last week to arrest him in connection with an attack on a household in Bhamrauli village on November 15, 2020.The police had announced a reward of ₹25,000 for information on Yadav’s whereabouts. He is involved in several murders — most notably that of a classmate in a private school in 2007 when he was a juvenile — besides cases of attempt to murder, extortion, snatching, kidnapping, loot, carjacking and robbery, said officials.The police said he had been living at a friend’s residence in Shimla since November 20 last year. He was spotted on the Mall Road last week, following which the police swung into action.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that teams were sent to Shimla last week. “We had identified the house and had surrounded him on Sunday. Being a tourist place, police teams did not use any weapon and asked him to surrender, but he escaped from another route and fled in his SUV to Delhi. Teams chased him and arrested him, along with his close aide, from village Garhi Harsaru on Dwarka Expressway late Sunday,” he said.Five close aides of Yadav were arrested from different locations in Gururgam last Friday, said police.Yadav is a resident of Bhamrauli village in Sector 10 and on November 15, 2020, he had allegedly attacked three members of a family over a parking issue and fired a countrymade gun during the attack, the police said. He was accompanied by over 30 goons, his younger brother, father and mother during the incident and they had fired around 30 rounds, the police said. His family members were arrested last December.Sangwan said the firing incident in the village was recorded by a local on his mobile phone and was also picked up by four CCTV cameras in the vicinity. “Yadav was holding a pistol and he, along with other men, his brother, father and mother, shot around 30 rounds, of which three hit two of the victims, who were discharged after a week from the hospital,” he said.Manoj Yadav (21) suffered a bullet injury, while Shamsher Singh, a former sarpanch, and his family members Sanesh Yadav, Parveen Yadav, and Sumit had suffered head injuries.On November 18, around 100 villagers had met the police commissioner, seeking Yadav’s immediate arrest, expressing a fear for their lives. Upon the villagers’ request, the police had provided security to the victims’ family over fears of another attack.The police said that Yadav also runs an illegal water business in developing sectors. After spending three years in a juvenile observation home when he was a minor, for the murder of a classmate, Yadav is out on bail and maintains a gang of more than 200 members, said police.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that residents of nearby villagers have been complaining against his notorious activities. “His gang members live in his house and they often misbehave with the villagers, threaten them and extort money from them. He is involved in illegal arms business and often provides weapons to other gang members. He is already out on bail in a few cases and was acquitted for the murder of his friend in March 2015 in Palam Vihar,” he said.Yadav was produced before the court on Tuesday and was taken on a two-day police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gangster-akash-yadav-arrested-after-chase-from-shimla-101610472677484.html
12-01-2021||Gurugram||Departments to prepare for possible bird flu outbreak||The department of animal husbandry on Tuesday has called a meeting of 11 departments in the district on January 14 to discuss their roles and responsibilities in containing a possible outbreak of avian influenza. While lab reports of two bird samples sent to Jalandhar are awaited, officials said they are operating under the assumption that they will test positive for bird flu, in which case culling of poultry may be required.Thursday’s meeting, to be presided over by Dr Punita Gahlot, the deputy director of animal husbandry, is likely to be attended by the police, public health, forests and wildlife, revenue and land reform, public works, panchayat administration, and the disaster management cell officials, in addition to the deputy commissioner and municipal commissioner. “So far, we have been focussing on conducting clinical surveillance at poultry farms and training our veterinarians. But containing an outbreak requires a lot of coordination among various line departments. For example, the police will be required to provide manpower to field teams when they visit poultry farms. Then, the revenue department is responsible for disbursing monetary compensation to affected farmers whose birds are being culled, and for drawing up epidemic maps and identifying safe burial sites,” said a senior veterinary officer with the district animal husbandry department, seeking anonymity.Similarly, the deputy commissioner will be the nodal authority for ordering a ban, if required, on sale and transport of poultry products, either from the district or from containment zones. The deputy commissioner will also be responsible for coordinating all financial and logistical support for the containment operation, should one be required. The department of public health, meanwhile, will be responsible for monitoring the health of all veterinarians, livestock handlers and safai karmacharis involved in culling of birds, and will also provide them with antiviral drugs as a precaution. The public works department will supply disinfection and fogging machines, and any other heavy infrastructure (such as earthmovers), which may be required for culling and burying carcasses.Department officials, not authorised to speak on the record, also said that they have reached out to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar, requesting them to expedite the test results of two carcasses. “We may receive the sample results in a day or two. If they test positive, we may not begin culling immediately since there is no excess mortality of poultry in Gurugram till today. We may send chicken samples for tests first,” said the veterinary officer cited above.Dr Gahlot declined to comment but confirmed that a meeting to apprise other arms of the district administration has been convened at 11am on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/departments-to-prepare-for-possible-bird-flu-outbreak-101610472677946.html
12-01-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka cabinet to get 7-8 new ministers on Wednesday||After months of delay, the BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka is likely to get 7-8 new ministers with the oath-taking ceremony slated for 4 pm on Wednesday.Governor Vajubhai Vala is expected to administer the oath of office during a simple ceremony at the Raj Bhavan due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Chief minister Yediyurappa said that the names of the ministers are being finalised and would be submitted to the Raj Bhavan later on Tuesday night.With only seven vacancies available, Yediyurapp's comment on 7-8 new inductees raised eyebrows. When asked about it, the CM said, "Yes there is a possibility (that one sitting minister might be dropped). All will be known shortly."According to BJP sources, three defectors from the Congress who helped the party form the government by resigning their legislative seats are sure to be inducted. They are Raja Rajeshwari Nagar MLA Munirathhna who won a by-poll. The other two ar MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar, both Vidhana Parishat members.Also read: Trump slams impeachment move as Democrats press aheadShankar had won the 2018 poll as an independent and had switched sides several times earning the nickname 'pendulum' for his yo-yo act before joining as an associate member of the Congress only to finally resign his legislative seat and help BJP topple the coalition government.Shankar did not contest the ensuing by-poll choosing to be elected to the upper house as a BJP member. Nagaraju, one of the richest politicians in the state and has declared assets to the tune of ₹1,220 crore, was defeated in the by-polls but was elected to the upper house on a BJP ticket.Amongst the 'original' BJP legislators - Umesh Katti, the six-term legislator from Hukkeri in Northern Karnataka; S Angara, the five-term legislator from Sullia constituency; and Hiryur MLA Poornima Srinivas - are said to be the front-runners for a cabinet berth.Katti, while speaking to reporters at Belagavi airport, claimed that he had been summoned by the CM to be present in the state capital, presumably to take oath as a minister. Angara too made a similar claim in Sullia.Of the other one or two berths left, intense lobbying is on by party's senior Dalit leader Arvind Limbavalli and BJP's key actor in the old Mysuru belt CP Yogeshwar who is a member of the upper house. If the CM decides to go ahead with inducting 8 new faces, he will have to drop at least one as the maximum cabinet size including the CM is 34 in Karnataka and there are only seven vacancies at present.Excise minister H Nagesh another independent who helped BJP form the government but is facing corruption allegations or Shasikala Jolle the minister for women and child development are likely to face the axe, according to BJP sources.Political analyst Aravind said that irrespective of who gets the nod, the exercise is likely to kickstart another round of dissidence. "There are simply too many claimants for too few posts. It will definitely create heartburn amongst those who have been denied a berth. It remains to be seen how he will handle the aftermath of the cabinet expansion exercise".BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh will be present at the ceremony according to party sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cabinet-to-get-7-8-new-ministers-on-wednesday-101610470798651.html

12-01-2021||Pune||As vaccine trucks leave Serum campus, India starts fight to end Covid in country||Early on Tuesday morning, a runner out for his morning run stopped in his tracks after seeing a group of people, including many with cameras outside the gates of Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Hadapsar campus in the city. There was a nip in the air, but those waiting didn’t seem to mind it.The crowd outside the gates heard the hum of the engines of the temperature controlled truck that would carry the first Oxford University-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccines to be produced by the company.Traces of anxiety from the five days leading upto Tuesday morning was tangible as Pune police officers along with employees of the SII performed a traditional puja (prayer) of the first truck and decked it with a garland shortly before it moved out of the sprawling campus of the vaccine manufacturer.At the stroke of 4:53 am, the gates opened, a police escort van remerged; it was followed by three trucks, with boxes carrying 5.65 million doses of the vaccine meant for Delhi, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Hyderabad in Telangana, Chandigarh, Kolkata in West Bengal, Patna in Bihar, Bengaluru in Karnataka, and Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. They were headed for Lohegaon airport, around 15 kilometres from the factory.The gravity of the moment dawned upon the drivers of the trucks as the crowd present at the gates erupted in spontaneous applause that pierced the silence of the morning. At least six armed guards were seen outside the SII gates along with a team of police officials who had been on standby since Monday morning as the uncertain departure timings were set and cancelled multiple times.The vaccines, produced under licence by SII , and developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford will form the new vanguard of India’s fight against the coronavirus disease. Vaccinations are to start on January 16, with 30 million health care and front line workers forming the first cohort that will be vaccinated.Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of SII, spoke to the media hours after the flights had taken off. SII executives’ absence at the gates had promoted deputy police commissioner Namrata Patil to take lead and perform the puja.“Our trucks left the SII facility early morning and now the vaccine is being distributed across the entire country. This is a proud and historic moment as scientists, experts and all other stakeholders took great efforts while making this vaccine in less than a year,” Poonawala said.Soon, the trucks entered the cargo-loading section of the Pune International Airport. Packed in boxes covered in styrofoam, the vaccines were scanned by four different machines of four different airlines - SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir, and Air India before taking to the air..The SpiceJet flight was the first to take off at 8.05 am with 56 boxes of vaccine vials . Soon eight other flights took off from Pune airport for various destinations. The endgame of India’s fight against Covid-19 had begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/as-vaccine-trucks-leave-serum-campus-india-starts-fight-to-end-covid-in-country-101610468057329.html
12-01-2021||Pune||Nine flights to 12 cities leave Pune with Covid vaccine doses||Pune Tuesday morning saw an otherwise quiet Lohegaon airport in Pune witness high drama as the country’s first batch of Covishield vaccine doses left for 12 different cities on nine passenger and freight flights. After the vaccine doses were packed in ice boxes at the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the airport authorities played a pivotal role in ensuring that the vaccines reached the rest of the country in time. Three domestic airlines transported close to 5.6 million doses on the first day to kick-start the massive pan-India inoculation drive against Covid-19 infection.After a year of fighting through the pandemic, the first consignment of Covishield consisting of 2,64,000 doses was transported from Pune to Delhi on SpiceJet flight SG 8937. The flight took off from the Lohegaon International Airport at 8.05am and landed at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, at 10.15am. Along with Delhi, Spicejet also transported multiple vaccines to Guwahati, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhubaneshwar, Bengaluru, Patna and Vijayawada. In addition to Spicejet, GoAir and Indigo also sent doses to Chennai, Chandigarh and Lucknow respectively. For Mumbai, GoAir in its statement said starting from January 13, the vaccines will be transported from Mumbai to other cities on the basis of the allocation. A spokesperson from the Serum Institute added that a truck would leave via road to the Mumbai airport and from there to other cities. The spokesperson added that, “Two trucks would leave for the Mumbai airport via road from our Pune institute and from there it would go to other cities.” Union aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri tweeted on Tuesday morning, “Together nine flights will leave Pune through four carriers - Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir & Indigo - with 56.5 lakh doses to Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow & Chandigarh.” The first aeroplane took flight with the Covid-19 vaccine ‘Covishield’ from the Serum Institute of India at around 8am with the first consignment. Three trucks left the institute at around 4:55am. A total of nine flights carried vials of the vaccine from Pune’s Lohegaon airport with 477 boxes, including three chartered freight flights which had close to 5.6 million doses. Each box contained about 1,200 vials of Covishield and each of the dose is priced for the Indian government at ₹210, including GST of ₹10. Each vial has about 10 doses which were packed in ice boxes. As per earlier statements from the Oxford University and Serum Institute, each person would need to get two doses for maximum protection against the virus. Each dose is about 5ml and the second dose needs to be taken 28 days after the first dose. The vaccine needs to be stored between +2-+8 degrees Celsius which led to a speedy movement of all the boxes within the first two hours since the airport started operating at 8am. The last flight for the day left was to leave at 4pm to Lucknow according to airport officials. Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh, said, “Earlier 14 flights were to leave from Pune’s Lohegaon airport with the Covid-19 vaccine in 456 boxes, however, plans were changed last night. A total of nine flights left from the airport of which three were chartered flights. Pune airport has always been prepared for vaccine transportation. As of yet, we do not have any plans for vaccine transportation on Wednesday.” The vaccines transported were packed with ice packs in thermocol boxes. As per the details on the box being transported, the vials were manufactured in October 2020 and have an expiry date of March 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nine-flights-to-nine-cities-leave-pune-with-covid-vaccine-doses-101610467996858.html

The apex court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of three new contentious farm laws and constituted a four-member committee to hear all objections and report to the court. The farmer unions said they will not hold any discussion with the committee and alleged that all the four-members of the committee are pro-reforms. Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border on Tuesday evening, Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal, said, “All the four members of the committee have been openly justifying the three new farm laws. How can we expect them to take a rational stand on the matter? We had been saying that the farm unions will not accept any committee, forget about a committee like this… We never went to the Supreme Court demanding a committee. It’s the government who was trying to form a committee through the court.”Jagmohan Singh, secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said farmers will reject any committee even if its members are changed. “The idea behind setting up committees is to divert the attention of people from the real issues. The government is trying to end our movement. We want to tell the government that this is an indefinite movement and we will not go anywhere till the three new farm laws are repealed.”“The committee has been constituted to find out the drawbacks in the three laws. We don’t want to know that. We want to complete the revocation of these laws. The Supreme Court can help us by taking suo moto cognisance and repealing these laws. We do not want any committee. We want to negotiate with the government,” said another farmer leader Raminder Singh Patiala.Farmer leaders also said that their ongoing agitation is not going to conclude on Republic Day. “There are many rumours about our January 26 plan. There have been attempts to propagate false propaganda that farmers will gherao Parliament or take over the Red Fort on Republic Day. Our programme will be very peaceful. We will announce the complete plan after January 15. We want to request farmers coming from parts of the country to participate in the January 26 plan to remain peaceful. We will never tolerate violence and any irresponsible behaviour,” Rajewal said. The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered 48th day on Tuesday. On Tuesday, farmers protesting at Delhi borders were seen preparing for festival of Lohri, which will be celebrated on Wednesday. “Lohri marks the beginning of the new harvest season. We pray for the good harvest by burning bonfires and singing songs and dancing around it. This year, we will be singing the songs of resistance by burning copies of the three new laws.” said Gurpreet Kaur, 58, a farmer from Tarn Taran, protesting at the Singhu border.Several farmers said their family members are also travelling to Delhi on Wednesday to celebrate Lohri with them. Devinder Singh, a member of the main stage committee at Singhu, said, “My parents asked me if I was coming home for Lohri. When I told them that I can’t come in the middle of the agitation, they decided to join me here. Parents and family members of many other protesters are arriving in Delhi on Wednesday to celebrate the festival.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-reject-sc-committee-demand-repeal-of-farm-laws-101610463856179.html

Earlier, the samples were directly transported to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, however, to reduce the workload in Madhya Pradesh, a test is conducted in Pune. “With the rise in the number of unusual deaths of birds, we asked the state government to conduct a test in Pune and if a trace is detected it will be sent to Bhopal. This will reduce the workload at Bhopal,” said Sachindra Pratap Singh, state animal husbandry commissioner. So far, 97 samples from 17 districts of Maharashtra have been brought for testing in Pune. The tests on 78 samples have been completed of which 18 samples are infected with the bird flu virus. The 17 districts from where a positive sample has been found include Mumbai, Parbhani, Latur, Beed, Thane, Ratnagiri, Akola, Gondia, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik, Yavatmal, Nanded Satara, Gondia and Ahmednagar. In Pune, RT-PCR tests are conducted on samples which give results in 48 to 72 hours. The test is conducted to check whether there is a presence of H5 (Hemagglutinin type five) in a sample which confirms the bird flu virus. Once it is confirmed, samples are transported to Bhopal to check the subtype N1 or N8. N stands for Neuraminidase which has nine subtypes. The traces of H5N1 are highly pathogenic Avian influenza while H5N8 is low pathogenic Avian influenza. As of Tuesday, a total of 1,839 deaths of various birds have been recorded in the state since January 8. The samples from Mumbai, Ghodbander (Thane district) and Dapoli (for crows and herons) and samples of poultry farm from Muramba, Parbhani have found H5N1 strain while the samples from Beed district have been found positive for the H5N8 strain. “These areas have been declared as infected areas and all the poultry farms within a one-kilometre radius of the infected poultry farms will be culled.

In addition to the classes, the schedule of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examination was also declared. The city is known for both, MPSC exam preparations and coaching classes, as students from across the country, come to study in Pune. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the education ecosystem in the city was hit, and online education took over as the new academic year began. Since the unlock process, students are returning to the city and now looking to start afresh with coaching classes, study circle libraries and the preparation for competitive exams. “As the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued orders related to starting of private coaching classes in Pune, we immediately started getting calls from parents and students. All of them were eagerly asking about when we are going to restart offline classes. Class 10 and 12 exams have been postponed this year, but students want to prepare for it well. So, we are now making necessary safety arrangements at all our class branches in Pune city, and restart offline classes in batches from next weekend,” said Kedar Takalkar, founder-director of Takalkar Classes. In Pune city, there are different types of private coaching classes, right from school level, for board exams, entrance exams and competitive exam classes. With students in the city, an entire financial eco-system is dependent on them, like PG rooms, mess, small businesses, grocery shops. Similarly, study circles in Pune especially in the peth areas have again started gaining momentum, as day by day the number of students coming back to Pune and taking admissions are increasing. Rajesh Pandit, owner of Valmiki study circle said, “During the lockdown period, all the study circle centres were closed in Pune. However, in the last couple of months, we have all reopened measuring responses by students. Now, as the MPSC exam dates are declared, we hope that the number of students coming to study circles will increase. We are following all the Covid related protocols given by the government, also social distancing is maintained inside the centres. Also, the medical history of students is taken before admissions.” On January 11, the MPSC announced its revised dates for state civil service prelims examination. This exam which was earlier scheduled on October 11, 2020, is now rescheduled for March 14, 2021. Archana Solanki a parent said, “My daughter is in CBSE board class 10 and she hardly studies during the online classes. We are worried about her marks, as her entire career is dependent on getting good marks in the board exams. It has given us relief that private coaching classes are restarting back soon. We have already contacted the class management where she used to go last year and will join the classes once it starts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/precovid-buzz-to-return-in-city-as-classes-coaching-centres-reopen-101610463136143.html

Do you believe the PMC’s decision to allow private coaching classes to start was timely? Our organisation welcomes this decision of PMC and we are glad students will now benefit from coaching classes. At the same time I think the decision was a bit delayed, as for last three months we have been demanding that the state government allow private coaching classes to open. All other works and businesses have started in the state, only private coaching classes were not yet allowed. Schools were allowed to open, and so far, news about students getting infected in schools is not there. Other civic bodies should allow private coaching classes to open. Any instructions to members about safety measures to be taken while opening up? For us the safety of students is our top priority, so along with state and central government-guidelines related to Covid, we have also given several instructions to all our members in Pune and across the state. Right from sanitising the class premises, face mask compulsion, thermal checking of students and most importantly, consent from parents needs to be taken before joining the class. If a student shows any symptoms related to Covid, then s/he should be sent back to home and parents needs to be informed. Class owners in Pune are gearing up their preparations to start offline classes from this week. Any appeal to students and parents? Parents can freely send children to coaching classes, with all necessary safety precautions and following Covid guidelines. As the board exams are coming and also students have started preparing for entrance exams, coaching classes play a major role. Students want to join classes as they want to score marks in the exams, we are already to take care of their further academic studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/other-civic-bodies-should-follow-pmc-and-allow-private-coaching-classes-to-start-101610458007527.html

Get department’s permission first||Pune: The Junnar forest division under the Pune circle has made it mandatory for tourists and trekkers to seek its prior permission to explore the reserved forests not approved by the authorities. The rule also applies to those who want to rappel, valley cross or camp in forests or forts located in the division. The decision taken on January 10 has been to ensure the safety of tourists and protect the forest ecosystem, said forests officials. The Pune circle includes Pune and Solapur districts. Pune district has two divisions, Pune and Junnar, and one sub-division, Bhor. Junnar division has 5,826 sq km geographical area with 591.89 sq km under forest cover. “Tourists and trekking enthusiasts need to inform the taluka forest officer about their planned trip to forts or forests. Those who visit regular places using approved routes do not need to do this,” said Jayaramegowda R, deputy conservator of forests (territorial), Junnar division, Pune circle. “Some visitors take dangerous paths for trekking or to reach forts. There have been a few unfortunate incidents. Also, some tourists are not sensible towards environment. They dump plastic waste in reserved forests. There have been incidents of fire because of carelessness by visitors. The rule will help check such incidents,” said Jayaramegowda. Junnar division has four talukas under its jurisdiction and seven forts, including the popular Shivneri, Hadsar and Chavand. “How will the authorities enforce the rule? How will they monitor people in ranges?” said Vinayak Wadekar, trekker and member of rescue groups. For visitors’ sake Forest officials have been instructed to make catalogues of routes where rappelling, valley crossing and camps can be set up. The department will use Google images of these routes and places. Tourists and trekkers will need to submit application to forest officials at the taluka level with details of their planned routes. It will have to be approved by the forest officials. Follow precautions during jungle visits Exploring the woods can be a refreshing activity. Experts though cite some precautions to be followed by visitors to preserve the nature as reckless behaviour, like littering, badly impacts the forest environment. “Though many who love nature tends to take care of it, there are some who visit the greens just to have fun at a cost that damages the forests. I have seen people bursting crackers from the hilltops in Sahyadri ranges. It is reckless. Everyone must follow some protocols to preserve the nature,” said veteran mountaineer Umesh Zirpe. Zirpe listed Do’s and Don’ts to be followed during forest visits. Do’s Study the local culture before visiting the forests Respect local people and do not disturb their lives Study the spot’s capacity to accommodate people. Avoid overcrowding. Respect nature. Don’ts Do not “leave a trace” like dumping waste especially plastics Do not lit a fire while camping. It may cause wildfires Do not smoke Do not consume alcohol. Do not bring anything back from nature except memories.

The culling will be completed in two days and all the birds in one-kilometre radius of the farm where the hens were found dead on Saturday will be destroyed, according to an official.Additional commissioner of Maharashtra animal husbandry department DD Parkale said, “The bird culling has started in Parbhani. It was a small poultry owned by a farmer where the hens were found dead. The birds in the one-kilometre radius of this poultry will also be destroyed. Orders have also been issued to seize that farm immediately to stop the spread of bird flu.” Following the deaths of hens, district collector Deepak Mugalikar had declared Murumba village in Parbhani as a prohibitory zone, banning the sale of poultry product in a five-kilometre radius. The teams from the animal husbandry department then collected samples of the dead birds and sent them to a laboratory in Bhopal and Pune to ascertain the cause of death. Parkale said, “As per the recent census, Maharashtra has a total of 7.42 crore hens. The commercial poultry has around 5 crore birds and the rest are either in small poultry or with farmers.” The bird flu outbreak has already been confirmed in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, the bird flu was only found in crows, parrots in Mumbai and parts of Konkan region. However, in recent years hens have contracted it, which according to officials is more worrying as the birds are consumed by people, said an official from the animal husbandry department.Parkale said, “We have started the surveillance in Mumbai and Konkan region and instructed all the departments, mainly from irrigation and forest, to report the deaths of birds they found in their premises.” Venky’s general manager PG Pedgaonkar said, “It is natural that whenever there is news about bird flu, it creates panic among poultry farmers affecting the demand and pricing. However, the poultry farmers take enough care of their farms and do not allow outsiders to enter in to avoid contact.”Maharashtra animal husbandry department officials said, “An appeal has been made to avoid visiting the poultry farm where the bird flu was found, other farmers and some poultry owners visit such farms and become a source to spread bird flu among birds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/culling-of-hens-begins-in-parbhani-after-avian-influenza-outbreak-101610442226023.html

According to a senior SII official who requested not to be named, the order placed by the Central government is of 11 million doses for the initial period of vaccination. With the purchase order in place, the first consignment of vaccine doses will leave Serum’s Manjari campus to the state government-owned National Cold Chain Resource Centre at Raja Bahadur Mill road in the city as well as to other cities on Tuesday. The first truck carrying the vials is set to depart from the institute at 4:30am in the morning, according to Serum institute spokesperson. The transportation of vaccines will be carried out by air as well as road in the trucks owned by private logistics firm Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions with two-tier security by Pune police. The vaccine was recently approved for restricted emergency use by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). The first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination will kick start in the country from January 16 for healthcare workers. “The government purchase order is for 11 million doses and we currently have close to 100 million doses. Also, the cost has been finalised at ₹210 including the GST of ₹10 per dose. Mainly, the four locations where depots are located include Delhi, Mumbai, Karnal in Haryana and one in the south where vaccine doses will be taken initially. Also, the government has given us an indication that vaccine doses will be taken to 54 different locations apart from these four main locations,” said the SII official. The transport will be done through road and by flights, according to Koolex executives. The road transport would probably be for locations which could be covered within 12-15 hours, and for cities with longer distance, air mode will be used. But we will wait yet as the government has also made some arrangements with the transporter in Mumbai. “We will try to send it directly from here to where flights are available but where it is not possible, we will send it through cold vans. The purchase order was finalized at 3pm on Monday and so the transportation will probably begin to other cities on Tuesday morning. With the purchase order in place, we have started distribution of vaccines and we already have our own office at the Pune airport for regular vaccine movement. These vaccines will be sent both by commercial cargo flights or even passenger flights if they have space. We will pack the boxes with cold ice packs which can keep the vaccines safe for a few hours,” said the SII official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-signs-purchase-order-for-11-mn-covishield-doses-transportation-begins-today-101610442106909.html

Rubal Agrawal, PMC additional commissioner said, “We have finalised and sorted out 16 centres where the Covid-19 vaccine will be administered. Until date, we’ve sent information of around 34,000 health workers to the state government which are mainly working in government as well as private hospitals.” According to Agarwal, the jumbo hospital on the COEP ground has been included in the list but it might close down soon. “We have planned to extend the number of vaccination centres from 16 to 99 in the coming days as per requirement,” she said. In the first phase, the PMC will administer the double-dose vaccine to 52,707 health workers. Therefore, the number of vaccine doses that will be required are 1, 15,825. A total of 11,074 health workers working in government hospitals, urban health centres and maternity homes and 41,628 health workers working in private hospitals will be prioritised for the doses. The PMC has organised a training session on Wednesday. As per the guidelines, a single vaccination centre can administer the vaccine to a total of 100 people in a day. The civic body will set up 99 booths at these 16 centres, and 402 employees will be tasked with completing the job. Four private hospitals, including the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, Noble Hospital and Joshi Hospital will have vaccination centres. According to the PMC health officials, the priority order for the vaccination has been fixed. Around 1.5 lakh citizens are to be vaccinated on a priority basis. The doctors, paramedical staff, nurses and frontline workers will be vaccinated first. The PMC does not have information about the number of vaccines; however, as per the state government directives, the civic body has sent details of health workers to the state. According to top state government health department officials, the central government will purchase vaccine from companies and a quota will be allocated to each state. Subsequently, the state will decide the priority city and disburse vaccine to cities or local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-finalises-16-vaccination-centres-in-pune-101610442106163.html

Ghule relied on the shortest route shown on the digital map between Kotul and Akole. The trio did not know the area well and were dependent on the digital map application for directions and proceeded accordingly. Their car ventured onto the Kotul-Akole road as per the right directions of the digital map, but the trio did not know that the said road for closed for vehicular traffic as the area was inundated with dam backwaters following monsoon. The car reached the bridge which was 20 feet submerged in water and since it was dark with no warning signs, the car sped ahead directly into the water, police said.According to the police, before the trio could sense anything, the car drove straight into the dam waters. All three friends tried to save their lives by opening the doors of the car and swimming out of the water. Guru and Sameer managed to come out of the car, however, Ghule could not. The friends who survived, swam to safety and raised an alarm and alerted the villagers.Local residents came to know about the accident at 8am and rushed to the spot. Relatives of the three friends also reached the spot. The car and dead body of Ghule has been recovered. The locals went in to search for the car and fished out Ghule’s body, including the car with the help of an earth mover. Meanwhile, Ghule’s post-mortem was completed at Kotul rural hospital where the body was handed over to family members who also reached the spot upon hearing the news.Police inspector Abhay Parmar, incharge Akole police station, said, “The trio navigated through a digital map on GPS and it was around 1.30am. They did not realise that the road was closed. The public works department (PWD) should have shut the road permanently and there were no safety sign boards at the accident spot.

12-01-2021||Delhi||Amenities at Army vets plots: HC tells DJB to act||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Centre to take a decision within four months on the regularisation of land allotted to 53 war veterans, residing in the Sainik Farms area while hearing their plea seeking basic facilities like water and sewerage.The plea stated that the 65-acre land allotted in 1961 by an order of defence ministry for residential purpose is authorised and duly registered under the records.The court, however, noted that the land allotted to the petitioners was an agricultural land and cannot be used for residential purposes.Justice Jayant Nath asked the secretary, ministry of defence, to convene a meeting of functionaries and said that secretary, ministry of urban development and Delhi’s chief secretary may also be a part of the committee to take an expeditious decision.The court also directed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to provide potable drinking water to the petitioners, adding that they cannot be deprived of a right to access to drinking water merely on the ground that it is an unauthorised colony.“Merely because the petitioners were allotted the plots cannot be a ground to insist that the area is for residential purposes. The contention of the petitioners to the contrary claiming that the area is a residential area is a misplaced..,” the judge said.The petition had claimed that currently water is being supplied for drinking purposes through four tube wells as an interim arrangement which is being maintained by the Residents Welfare Association (RWA).The petitioners contended that the despite paying all taxes and having their property duly registered, they have been denied basic amenities. It has said their land has been declared as unauthorised and hence the MCD is not permitting any repair work or granting sanctions for building plans.In 2019, the Centre had notified the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Regulations, 2019 — to regularise 1,700 unauthorised colonies. The notification, however, stated that ownership rights will not be conferred on affluent unauthorised colonies. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs has identified 69 such affluent colonies, which includes Freedom Fighters Enclave, Neb Sarai Extension area, Chattarpur Enclave, Sainik Farms, Mahendru Enclave and Anant Ram Dairy, among others.The court noted that the “peculiar” circumstances of the case and said that it cannot be denied that the land was given for the residential purposes to the veterans. “Keeping in view the above facts and circumstances, in my opinion, the respondents are duty bound to take an appropriate decision based on the cogent facts regarding the status of the said area known as ‘Defence Services Enclave’,” the court said in a 21-page judgment.There was no response to the court judgment from the Delhi Jal Board, the ministry of housing and urban affairs, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Development Authority (DDA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amenities-at-army-vets-plots-hc-tells-djb-to-act-101610403663287.html

He was also apparently heard telling the policemen to let CM Yogi Adityanath know his “death is imminent.”People around Bharti were heard asking police officers to ensure the arrest of the man who hurled ink at him.Amethi police on Monday travelled to Rae Bareli to arrest Bharti, a former Delhi cabinet minister, after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker Somnath Sahu registered a police complaint on Sunday over his alleged remarks on the state’s medical facilities day earlier.According to Rae Bareli additional superintendent of police, Daya Ram, a case was registered under sections 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code.Later on Monday, Bharti was remanded to judicial custody in the Sultanpur district jail. His bail plea will be heard on Wednesday. In a tweet in Hindi, the MLA said: “You have ink thrown at us, got goons to attack us, registered false cases and then pressured court to put us in jail. Yogi-ji, we will fight.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also tweeted at Adityanath on Monday. “Yogiji, our MLA Somnath Bharti ji was going to inspect your government schools. Ink was thrown at him? Are your schools so bad? If someone goes to check your schools, why do you get so scared? Fix the schools. If you do not know how to fix them, you should ask Manish Sisodia.”UP finance minister Suresh Khanna said Kejriwal should apologise for Bharti’s comments.“AAP wants to exercise Naxal politics in UP. But it (AAP) will not succeed,” he said, referring to AAP’s announcement that it would contest the 2022 polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aap-mla-bharti-held-in-rae-bareli-101610403252326.html
12-01-2021||Delhi||Four parks shut, govt says bird flu cases limited to a few areas||With bird flu confirmed in the national capital, the Delhi government’s animal husbandry department has advised government agencies to take precautionary measures at parks and water bodies in their jurisdictions. While more dead birds were found on Monday and samples were taken from various parts of the city for testing, no decision has been taken on the closure of parks as yet.As on Monday evening, four parks — Sanjay Lake, Hastsal district park, Dwarka Sector 9 park (all maintained by the DDA) and the Central Park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2 (maintained by the East civic body) — were closed to the public.Ten of the over 110 samples sent to various laboratories have tested positive for avian influenza on Monday morning. While eight came positive in the morning, two more positive reports reached by Monday evening.A senior animal husbandry official said, “So far, the infection has been restricted to a few pockets. Therefore, there is no need to close all parks. We have asked agencies to close parks where samples have tested positive for bird flu.”The eight samples that tested positive were the ones of dead crows and ducks picked up from Sanjay Lake park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2, Dwarka Sector 9 and Mayur Vihar Phase 3.Government agencies such as the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), the three municipal corporations, and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which are in charge of major parks and water bodies in the city said a majority of parks continue to remain open to public and they are closely monitoring the situation. As on Monday, only Sanjay Lake and Hastsal district park have been closed to the public.After the government confirmed bird flu in the Capital, culling of live birds was initiated from 8am on Monday in Sanjay Lake Park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2. Culling in more areas will follow soon, one of the officials said.The NDMC has restricted the entry of visitors near the duck corner at Lodhi Gardens, while at the seven biodiversity parks under the DDA, people have been advised to avoid going near the water body and birds.“We are yet to decide whether to close parks. As of now, we have only restricted entry of visitors near the enclosed duck corner at the Lodhi Gardens and our veterinary doctor is monitoring the situation. The duck corner has been cordoned off and we have sprayed a lime solution in and around the enclosure to reduce chances of the virus infection. Nehru Park is open; however, public have been advised not to go near birds,” a senior NDMC official said, requesting anonymity.The central public works department (CPWD), which maintains a few parks such as the Buddha Jayanti Park, said that it has not closed any of the parks as yet.“The DDA district park in Dwarka’s Sector 9 was closed to the public after samples of two dead crows tested positive for avian influenza,” a senior DDA official said. With this, three DDA parks were shut, as on Monday evening.Scientists at the DDA biodiversity parks said they are monitoring the health of migratory birds since December 28 and no carcass has been found so far. Teams have been formed in each biodiversity park to monitor the situation. “We have put up advisories near water bodies asking people to stay away, though no flu case or dead bird has been found in any of the parks,” said Faiyaz Khudsar, a scientist at the biodiversity parks.He added, “We have a functional ecosystem which is very complex. Pathogens usually don’t survive in such a complex ecosystem. We have a lot of migratory birds and the situation is under control.”The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) also maintains green spaces near heritage sites. On Sunday, six birds were found dead at the Red Fort and two at Jantar Mantar. A senior ASI official said, “We have not got any advisory from the Centre or the Delhi government on closing parks. The samples from Red Fort and Jantar Mantar have been sent for testing.”Sunder Nursery, one of Delhi’s popular heritage parks, continues to remain open as no case has been found there. Ratish Nanda, CEO of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture that maintains the park, said, “We are actively monitoring birds in Nizamuddin-Sunder Nursery area on a real-time basis. At the slightest sign of trouble, we will take all required steps to safeguard visitors.”At Naini lake in Model Town, a popular boating destination, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has asked visitors to not go near the duck enclosure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-parks-shut-govt-says-bird-flu-cases-limited-to-a-few-areas-101610402855269.html
12-01-2021||Delhi||Govt amps up action as bird flu cases confirmed in Delhi||Delhi on Monday became one of the 10 states in the country with confirmed cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, even as authorities announced a ban on the sale of processed and packaged poultry brought from outside the city as a precautionary measure aimed at stopping the spread of the disease.At least 10 samples from three locations of the over 120 samples sent to Bhopal’s National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research have returned positive, government officials said, launching a drive to either cull or isolate birds in east Delhi’s Sanjay Lake Park that has already been shut.Carcasses of 17 ducks were found on Sunday, triggering a scare and prompting authorities to declare it an “alert zone”. Officials said the culling of live birds at Sanjay Lake Park began at 8am on Monday. They said large-scale culling might not be required in Delhi immediately.In an online press briefing in the afternoon, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government was making all efforts to check the spread of bird flu and that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was monitoring the situation.“...there is a ban on selling packaged chicken or processed chicken from outside in Delhi to prevent infection from one state to another,” he said, asking people not to panic. “Those who consume chicken and eggs...if you cook your chicken and boil eggs properly, there is no risk..,” Sisodia added.A senior government official, who did not want to be named, explained that date and place of packaging will be considered before imposing the ban.“For example, if a company sources its poultry from Haryana, which has reported cases of bird flu, authorities will check manufacturing dates on packages in the storage unit of the company in Delhi, or at its retail outlets. If the manufacturing date is after the outbreak in Haryana, it will have to be trashed immediately. If it is pre-outbreak, then it will be approved for sale. Similarly, if a company has already brought its stock from a state which is not yet affected, sale of those packages will be allowed,” the official said.“We will also issue advisories to people asking them to check the manufacturing dates of packaged chicken and eggs. People are advised to check from which states the product is coming before purchasing and the manufacturing date of the same. However, bringing fresh stock into the city will not be allowed as of now,” he added.Later in the evening, state animal husbandry unit issued an order, saying the “entry and sale of dressed/processed/canned poultry products is also required to be restricted as a measure of abundant precaution in view of public health and safety”.On Saturday, Delhi announced the closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the entry of live birds from outside Delhi. Over the past four days, about 150 birds have been found dead across the city.Though Sisodia said in his briefing samples of ducks from Sanjay Lake area were the only ones in Delhi that tested “positive so far”, officials clarified later that 10 samples from three locations in the city were found with bird flu virus.In the morning, officials said three of the positive samples were from Sanjay Lake Park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2, four from Mayur Vihar Phase 3, and one from Dwarka Sector 9.By evening, two more samples — from a district park in Dwarka Sector 9 — tested positive, prompting authorities to immediately shut the facility for public.Apart from the Sanjay Lake Park and the one in Dwarka Sector 9, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which maintains most of the big parks in the city, has shut down at least two parks — in Hauz Khaz and Hastsal — until further orders. Agencies such as DDA, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the three civic bodies issued separate advisories on Monday, asking people not to go near water bodies in parks and monuments.“Doctors of all 48 veterinary hospitals of the Animal Husbandry Unit are continuously monitoring bird flu across Delhi. Also, 11 rapid response teams have been set up which are continuously collecting samples,” a Delhi government statement said.Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, too, reviewed the situation in the Capital.On Twitter, he said officials have been advised to enhance surveillance and undertake requisite measures for control and containment. “Citizens are advised to maintain caution and reach out to help line # 011-23890318, in case of need of any assistance,” he tweeted.As of Monday, nine other Indian states have reported the outbreak: Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Maharashtra. No case among the human population has been reported.“We have seen a slight reduction in the sale of raw chicken. This has been compensated by the increase in sales of fish and seafood, mutton and pork products,” Siddhant Wangdi, chief executive officer at meatigo.com (an online marketplace selling seafood and meat products), said.“We source our poultry products from certified and licensed supply partners who have their own network farms. There has not been any report of the outbreak of avian influenza or any other disease from any of our supply partners in the past 30 days....Further, when we receive the birds, each of them undergoes a safety and quality check and is vacuum packed to curb any kind of contamination,” he said.The current outbreak — migratory birds are believed to be behind it — began in December-end, barely a few months after India declared the country free from the disease on September 30, 2020.While the risk to humans from the disease is considered low, past outbreaks among farm birds have needed extensive slaughtering programmes to contain the outbreak.Only those coming in close contact with infected (alive or dead) birds for a long time can contract the H5N1 (strain of) bird flu virus, which does not usually spread from person to person, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Most other strains of bird flu cannot be transmitted to humans. Experts say well-cooked chicken or poultry products such as eggs (heated over 70 degrees Celsius) kill the virus and are, therefore, safe to consume.“The receptor used by the virus that causes the bird flu is very different from the receptors needed for human flu. So it is very unlikely for the infection to pass on to humans unless there is some recombination or mutation that allows the virus to enter human cells. Second, it does not pass from humans to humans. It is not a respiratory infection like Covid-19 and can happen to humans only if they are handling the dead infected birds or poultry that has been infected,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“However, once a person is infected, the disease tends to be severe. The bird flu virus usually attaches with the lower respiratory tract and causes pneumonia,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-amps-up-action-as-bird-flu-cases-confirmed-in-delhi-101610398461749.html
12-01-2021||Delhi||Petition in HC seeks to nullify all child marriages performed in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Monday sought the response of the Delhi government on a plea to declare all child marriages in the national capital as “invalid”.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the petition by a woman who has also sought to nullify her wedding which was allegedly performed when she was a minor.The woman has also sought a declaration from the court that every child marriage performed in the state should be null and void right from the onset.The court issued notices to her father, brother and husband seeking their response to the plea before February 12, the next date of hearing.According to the woman, represented by advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, when her wedding was performed in April 2010, she had no option but to give her consent as at that time, she was awaiting her class 10 results and could not go against her parents’ wishes.The woman, who claims to be born on December 10, 1993, said she was residing peacefully with her parents till November 19, 2020, when the person to whom she was married as a child came with his parents to take her to Gujarat with them.When she objected, she was allegedly beaten up by her brother at the behest of the husband. Subsequently, she escaped from her home on November 20, 2020, and has remained in hiding since then, the petitioner claimed. She also sought protection from the husband and her family.Advocate Mir told the bench that his client was staying at an undisclosed location as she feared that her family would force her to agree to the live with a marriage that was performed when she was a minor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/petition-in-hc-seeks-to-nullify-all-child-marriages-performed-in-delhi-101610397335900.html
12-01-2021||Delhi||No admission in Sindhi language this year in only DU college offering subject||With no student opting for the Sindhi language as a subject in undergraduate programmes this year, the only Delhi University (DU) college offering the subject at that level is struggling to sustain the department, officials said. Administration members at Deshbandhu College said the University’s decision to not provide any additional cut-off relaxations this year has led to such a situation.Of DU’s 63 colleges, only Deshbandhu College offers Sindhi as a subject to BA (programme) students. Officials at the college said the only sanctioned teacher post for the subject has been lying vacant for the last two years. While the college managed to enrol five students in the programme in 2019, none opted for it this in 2020 even as the admission process concluded on December 31.Chotu Ram Meena, admission convenor for BA (programme) courses at Deshbandhu College said, “We have been managing to get a few admissions in the language every year by providing some concessions in the cut-off. However, the University [last year] asked us not to make an exception for any Modern Indian Language (MIL) as a subject. Therefore, we have not got any admission in Sindhi this year.”Colleges across DU offer cutoff relaxations if a candidates choose MILs as a subject while enrolling in the BA/B Com (programme). However, in 2020, the university did not allow any additional criteria in the admission process.DU dean of admissions Shobha Bagai said, “The admission committee had decided that colleges would not be allowed to have any additional admission criteria in order to avoid any confusion among students as the admission process was shifted online. Giving relaxations in cut-off for opting MIL is also an additional criterion being used by several colleges. But the administration later had allowed colleges to give relaxation and fill the seats under the two special cut-offs.Principal Rajiv Agarwal said the college has identified two first-year BA (programme) students, who belong to Sindhi families and counselling them to opt for Sindhi as a language subject. “Only a few students opt for Sindhi language every year, because of which it has become difficult for the college to sustain the department. We had been seeking permission from the university to allow us to provide Sindhi as a language option to students enrolled in courses other than BA (Programme) as well. It’s not necessary that the students from Sindhi backgrounds will enrol in that course. But there has been no response [from the university] so far.”When asked why the sanctioned Sindhi teacher post has been vacant, Agarwal said, “The post has to be filled by a Schedule Caste (SC) candidate and we have not been able to find one of as of now. The DU department of MIL takes the classes of our present students.”Rajiv Tekchandani, an associate professor of Sindhi at DU’s department of Modern Indian Languages (MIL), said that there has been a similar situation there as well. Tekchandani, who is the only teacher across DU for the language — said that the department offers certificates and diploma courses in several courses. “Till last year we had only two students in Sindhi language, one in each course. Besides, there are currently only two MPhil and three PhD scholars enrolled in the language. The National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, talks about promoting Indian languages. Sindhi is one of the 22 languages recognised in the Constitution. The University needs to make Sindhi available for students of other courses as well so that it doesn’t die a slow death here. The University should also set up a board to promote the language just like it has for Hindi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-admission-in-sindhi-language-this-year-in-only-du-college-offering-subject-101610397143920.html
12-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra targets 50,000 shots on first day of vaccination drive||The Maharashtra government expects around 50,000 of its health workers to be inoculated on the first day of the world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive, starting from January 16 across India, with around 100 people set to be vaccinated at each of the 511 centres in the state. Mumbai has the most vaccination centres at 72, while Pune has 55.Although the Centre, during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference, did not clarify on the number of vaccine doses the state will get in the first round, the state expects 1.6 million doses for 800,000 workers over the next two months.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The state has set a target of 50,000 health workers to be vaccinated on the first day itself. Each of the 511 centres will have a batch of 100 health workers enrolled for vaccination. Some of the health workers may opt out of the vaccination. But the health workers are expected to set an example before the common people by getting vaccinated. There is no need be afraid of it as it is a safe vaccine.”Meanwhile, the state reported 2,438 new Covid-19 cases and added 40 deaths on Monday. The daily caseload slumped below 2,500 after two weeks. The case tally has thus touched 1,971,552, while the toll has reached 50,101. Mumbai reported 434 cases and seven deaths, taking the tally to 299,326 and toll to 11,193. After the video conference with Modi, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with health department officials. “The transportation, storage of the vaccine and the vaccination drive should be implemented with due diligence. The cooperation among various state machineries is important. The authorities should also ensure that the people do not lower the guard and continue with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he said.There was no word from the Centre over the bearing of the cost of the vaccine doses meant for people in the third phase and beyond. “We have been told that the Centre is going to bear the cost for the vaccine to health and frontline workers in first two phases. These two phases will take at least 4-5 months to complete, after which the vaccination of the people above 50 years of age and with comorbidities will begin in third phase. The Centre expects more vaccines to throng the market by then, making the decision over the cost easier. The prime minister is expected to hold another meeting with chief ministers after 60% of the vaccination is completed in the first two phases (health and frontline workers),” said a health department official, requesting anonymity.Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, made a presentation in the meeting, giving information about the procedure to follow for the vaccination.“We have vaccination centres at 511 locations across the state and they are all set to roll out the drive from the first day. We have highest, 72, centres in Mumbai, 55 in Pune and the allotment of the centre to the districts and cities are based on the number of enrolments of beneficiaries. We expect the first phase of vaccination of 800,000 health workers to be finished in less than two months. Though there is no clarity on the stock of the doses we are getting from the Serum Institute of India, in Pune, we do not see any problem in rolling it out smoothly,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission.He said the number of centres would be increased, gradually based on the need.DN Patil, state immunisation officer said, “We will augment our capacity to 1,000 booths in coming days from 511 after gauging the demand and availability of vaccine doses. In first phase, 800,000 health workers will be vaccinated. Of them, 780,000 have been registered on the Co-WIN app. We have to implement the drive without allowing our routine works to be hampered.”Meanwhile, the state’s case fatality rate (CFR) dropped to 2.54%, while the number of active cases slightly rose to 52,288. The highest number of active cases are in Pune (14,779), followed by Thane (10,142) and Mumbai (7,370). State’s recovery rate has touched 94.75% as 1,867,988 people have recovered from the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-targets-50-000-shots-on-first-day-of-vaccination-drive-101610393920372.html
12-01-2021||Mumbai||11 months on, two arrested for killing 75-year-old woman in Versova, Mumbai||After 11 months, DN Nagar police arrested two persons responsible for the murder of 75-year-old Gulabi Narayan Shetty. Police officers scanned through footages of 250 CCTV cameras between Andheri and Bandra. The arrested accused, Rashedul Johad Sheikh, 21, and Noorali Abdul Sattar, 23, have several cases of house break-ins registered against them, said police. On February 23, 2020, Shetty’s daughter and another relative found her dead in her home. Shetty, who owned Chaitanya Hotel in Versova and lived alone in a house above the hotel, also owned two shops and a room, all of which she had rented out. According to Shetty’s daughter Manorama, her husband had gone to visit Shetty at 4pm on the day of the incident but she did not respond to his knocks, hence he left. Later, around 8pm, Manorama and their relative Ramni visited the house and knocked at the door, and got no response. They then found that the door was open and found Shetty’s body in the washroom with her legs, hands, throat and face tied with a yellow sari. Following a complaint, DN Nagar police registered a case of murder and began investigation by scanning CCTV footages from nearby areas and narrowed down on two suspects from Bandra (West) with a criminal history. Police officers said that in one of the CCTV footage they saw two men entering Shetty’s house and leaving with a bag after some time. “But we could not identify them as they had covered their faces after noticing the CCTV camera present outside Versova police station. We tracked the two men till Infinity Mall, and then saw them entering a by-lane in Bandra, after which we could not trace them,” said a police officer. Later, police officers found that the two accused stayed in the locality and kept a watch for them. “The accused did not return to their house for 11 months. But when they returned to their house late last night, we arrested them,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 9, Abhishek Trimukhe. Manorama said “We deserve justice. The two killers should get maximum punishment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/11-months-on-two-arrested-for-killing-75-year-old-woman-in-versova-mumbai-101610393378034.html
12-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai school bars students from writing exams citing pending fees||Parents of some students studying at Somaiya School in Vidyavihar alleged their children were not allowed to write exams scheduled on Monday citing pending fee payments. Virendra Singh, parent of a Class 5 student, said when his daughter tried to open the link for the Mathematics paper scheduled at 8am, she could not access it. “Even the zoom link meant for proctoring wasn’t working. First, we thought that it must be a technical glitch from our end. But soon, more parents began writing on the parents’ group. When we called the teachers, we were told that the children were not being allowed due to pending fee payments. Teachers asked us to speak to the school but no one from the school was ready to speak to us,” said Singh. Singh said that he had paid one instalment of the fees but the school had asked him to clear all the remaining due, to the tune of over ₹1 lakh. “There has been some financial pressure and we promised the school that we will pay one more instalment now and others soon. But they asked for the whole amount at once,” he added. A spokesperson from the school said, “The management had made available various options for payment of fees including that of paying in four quarterly instalments, monthly instalments, and deferred payment on a case to case basis, should conditions not permit a parent to pay at the stipulated time. Despite all our efforts to ease the burden on parents, some have not even paid first/second instalments even though we are now approaching the end of the current academic year. Thus with a heavy heart, we have had to restrict the defaulting students from appearing for internal tests which can be retaken at any point in time. None of the defaulting students scheduled to appear in the CBSE board exam this year have been barred from appearing in the ongoing pre-board exams.”Another parent from the school said the school had been making calls to make payments over the past few days. “We have been receiving calls and emails and some of us ended up paying in pressure. But some others who are unable to pay are facing a tough time,” said a parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-school-bars-students-from-writing-exams-citing-pending-fees-101610393198245.html

The victim’s mother and brother had, along with their relative, slit the man’s throat and dumped it at Kasara Ghat on January 7. Kasara police said they have arrested all the three accused on Monday. On January 9, Kasara police received a call from the victim’s 28-year-old brother Shivaji Agale, stating that he had got a call from an unknown person who told him that the body of his younger brother Satish was found at Kasara Ghat. “We found the body at the spot. We had taken the victim’s family along with us for identification of the body and began investigating the case. The call data revealed that the victim’s brother had not received any call from an unknown caller. So we became suspicious and began interrogating him and his mother. The victim’s mother then confessed to the crime,” said a police officer. The police refused to reveal the mother’s name. The family said they took the step because Satish was unemployed and used to assault his mother and Agale under the influence of alcohol. He used to always ask his mother and Agale for money to buy alcohol and when they would not give him money, he would pick up fights with them. “The mother and the brother in their statement said they were going through financial crisis during the lockdown. Agale had lost his job and used to do odd jobs to make their ends meet. When they could no longer bear the daily assaults, Agale, his mother and one of their relatives Amrut Birare, slit Satish’s throat when he was asleep. They packed the body in a gunny bag and dumped it at Kasara Ghat. His mother wanted perform his last rites, and thus made up the story of getting a call from an unknown caller, so that they could claim the body. We have arrested all three accused,” said senior inspector Suresh Manore from Kasara police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mother-brother-among-3-held-for-murdering-24-year-old-man-dumping-body-at-kasara-ghat-near-mumbai-101610392961527.html

Chitre, 84, was undergoing treatment at Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital for age-related liver ailments. Considered a stalwart in the Indian astronomy community, he was the recipient of the Padma Bhushan award in 2012. After retiring as a senior professor from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, in 2001, Chitre went on to aid the establishment of the Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences (CEBS), a collaboration between the University of Mumbai and department of atomic energy. He was the academic chairperson and professor emeritus of CEBS.Chitre is survived by wife Suvarna, and sons Yohan and Yatin who are based in the United States.“Professor Chitre’s passing is a grievous loss to the scientific community. He was one of the stalwarts of the astronomy community but there was hardly any sector in academics that was untouched by him, be it nuclear energy, space energy, education or technology,” said Mayank Vahia, Chitre’s former colleague and professor at department of astronomy and astrophysics, TIFR. A student at the University of Cambridge since 1959, Chitre did his PhD at the varsity’s department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics between 1962 and 1963, when Hawking too did his PhD at the department. In an earlier interview to HT, Chitre had described Hawking as his ‘office mate’ who taught him to play croquet.Chitre had also served as president of the Astronomical Society of India (ASI), chairman of the Indian National Committee for Astronomy, chairman of the Bombay Association for Science Education. His passion for science education is well-remembered among colleagues. “What professor Chitre will be most remembered for is his passion for getting people excited to take up science. More than his contributions as an astrophysicist, his teachings marked important turning points in the lives of his students who decided to pursue a career in science,” said Divya Oberoi, secretary, ASI, and associate professor at the Pune-based National Centre for Radio Astrophysics affiliated to TIFR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sm-chitre-mumbai-astrophysicist-and-stephen-hawking-s-friend-dies-at-84-101610392960235.html

However, the hospital refuted the report on Monday. According to the report, TMC’s Kharghar unit called ACTREC found three mutations — K417N, E484K and N501Y — in three patients in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region out of the 700 Covid-19 samples it put through gene sequencing. Of these, E484K mutation is similar to the strain found in South Africa. The hospital refuted the claim and ssaid, “It is hereby clarified that no sample in the set sequenced in ACTREC, TMC had either the UK or the South African variant of this virus. The South African variant is characterised by the presence of all three mutations, ie K417N, E484K and N501Y, which was seen in none of our patients.”A media report had stated that E484K strain is less susceptible to the antibodies produced in the body against Sars-CoV-2. In response to that, Dr RA Badwe, director of TMC, said, “These claims are uncertain and speculative at this point of time. All the studies which claim this are under peer review,” he said.TMC carries out genetic sequencing for cancer patients, most of them from Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Raigad. During the ongoing pandemic, the hospital also started testing and sequencing of Sars-CoV-2. Dr Badwe also said that viruses undergo modification when they remain in the environment for a long time. “But so far, the presence of any genetic mutations in the virus has not yet had an adverse impact at the population level in India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-new-strain-of-covid-19-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-tata-memorial-centre-101610392718433.html

The Covid-19 innovation award selection, one of the many smart city awards, was held in August wherein the Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL) did a presentation on all the innovative works undertaken by KDMC to fight the pandemic. The civic body, which once reported more than 600 Covid-19 cases daily in September, has now reduced the number to below 100. It has also achieved zero deaths last week. On Monday, the civic body recorded 65 cases while the number of progressive cases was 62,573. “The civic body is the only one from the state to be shortlisted for this award. One major reason for the selection is the collaborative approach by the civic body in fighting the Covid-19 cases in its vicinity. The civic body has roped in many residential groups, doctors and other authorities to curb the cases,” said a representative of SKDCL who did not wish to be named. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “This comes as a great motivation to us as we have been working round the clock to make sure cases are reduced. Once KDMC had the highest per day cases, but we have managed to bring down. One idea that we introduced is the concept of family doctors where doctors were asked to help patients. The Indian Medical Association had collaborated with the civic body from day one as well.” The final round of the award is to be held this week online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kalyan-civic-body-shortlisted-for-the-final-round-of-covid-19-innovation-award-101610392298136.html

Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray is expected to write to CMs of other states, which are facing legal battle on reservation, to join hands for early redressal.Maharashtra government convened a meeting on Monday of the senior counsel representing defendants including Maratha community organisations to chalk out the strategy ahead of hearing in the Apex court from January 25. During the meeting held at Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, the senior counsels discussed the role of the Central government about reservation cases from various states.Public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan after the meeting said that the government has already decided to write a letter to the Prime Minister for intervention. “Besides the Central government, if the states whose reservation cases are pending in the Apex court should demand to club these cases for collective hearing. It will expedite the legal process,” he said.According to legal experts, who attended the meeting on Monday, said that the Central government’s intervention will help in resolving contentious issues related to the 50% cap on reservation, state government’s authority to award reservation in exceptional and extraordinary circumstances. The experts also suggested to the Maharashtra government that in the wake of the 102th amendment of the Constitution, state rights have come under doubts and that the inclusion of the reservation in the 9th schedule too needs to be discussed. “We had a detailed discussion on various aspects including the provisions in articles 15 and 16, provisions of schedule 9 of the Constitution, constitutional validity of the reservation and effect of the reservation given to economically weaker sections. We will chalk out a procedural and substantive strategy within a week for the hearing in the Apex court,” said Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-wants-reservation-cases-of-other-states-to-be-clubbed-with-maratha-quota-petition-101610392117905.html
12-01-2021||Mumbai||At 23.5° C, Mumbai records highest minimum temp in January since 2011||Following a spell of cloudy weather, the city recorded its hottest January day in a decade on Monday as minimum temperature rose to a record high. A minimum temperature of 23.5 degrees Celsius, 4.1 degrees above normal, was recorded at Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai. At Santacruz weather station, representative of Mumbai and suburbs, the minimum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius, 5.7 degrees above normal. This is the highest minimum temperature recorded in the month of January since 2011 and has surpassed the earlier highest minimum temperature of 22.3 degrees Celsius recorded on January 28, 2014. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 34.5 degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees above normal. This is at par with last year’s highest maximum temperature for the month of January recorded for two consecutive days (25 and 26). At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 31.4 degrees Celsius, which was 1.3 degrees above normal. “After a spell of cloudy days, temperatures in Mumbai soared on Monday. This is because of the clear skies and warm easterly winds,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Meanwhile, increased temperatures provided respite from pollution as air quality improved slightly. Though an overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator— of 256, which falls in the poor category, was measured on Monday, it improved from Sunday’s 301 (very poor).The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. At Colaba, the air quality was the worst with an AQI of 337 (very poor), followed by Bandra-Kurla Complex at 332. “Although AQI has improved slightly, colder temperature and low ventilation is still prevailing and will keep Mumbai’s AQI in the brink of poor to very poor for next two days,” said a spokesperson of SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-23-5-c-mumbai-records-highest-minimum-temp-in-january-since-2011-101610391878274.html

There are statements from 59 witnesses including 15 experts including forensic experts. Further inquiry will continue in the case,” said Sachin Vaze, assistant inspector, who is heading the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) that is probing the case. The agency has also named Republic TV’s COO Priya Mukherjee as accused in the charge sheet. The agency in the charge sheet claimed that Ramgarhia manipulated TRP rating of rival channels of Republic TV to show increase in TRP of Republic TV, around 40 weeks since its launch.The police alleged that Dasgupta was also involved and communicated with office-bearers of Republic TV through official email id and WhatsApp chats. The police claimed this was done by the two for their personal gain.Meanwhile, Dasgupta, who is still in judicial custody, has approached the sessions court for bail after the magistrate court refused to grant bail to him. The plea will be heard on January 15.BARC had filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. Hansa is one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes or people’s meters.TRP, which is measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. According to police, some of these households were bribed to tune into Republic TV and a few other channels. Republic TV had, in the past, denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trp-fraud-mumbai-police-file-3-400-page-supplementary-charge-sheet-101610391578087.html

The corporation has appealed to residents to contact officials concerned on the helpline numbers if they come across any dead birds. “We have formed a special cell to handle any bird death-related complaints; this has been done to ensure these complaints are considered on priority. With the current bird flu scare, it is essential that people do not come in contact with any infected birds, and hence we have to respond immediately. This cell will take stock of any bird flu instances within the Thane Municipal Corporation,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, TMC. The regional disaster management cell’s toll-free number 1800 222 108 or 022 -25371010 can be used to submit complaints related to bird deaths. Last week, TMC received complaints of 15 pond herons and two crows having died in Vijay Nagri in Thane. These birds were taken for tests, which revealed the presence of avian influenza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-tmc-sets-up-control-room-to-tackle-complaints-of-dead-birds-in-thane-101610391521934.html

The court has granted CIU permission to arrest Chhabria. He will be produced before a court on Tuesday where CIU will seek his police custody. Defence lawyer Vagish Mishra, who was representing Chhabria, argued, “It is a civil dispute which is being coloured into a criminal case.” “The vehicle was 90% complete and the complainant did not come to finalise the colour of the vehicle as well as minor compliance, due to which it was not delivered.” Sharma approached CIU on January 7 and his statement was recorded. In his statement, Sharma said he had approached Chhabria to design a vanity van in 2017 and paid ₹5.3 crore to him between May 2017 and May 2018. Later, when he found that there was no progress on his order, he approached Chhabria in July 2018. Chhabria then allegedly demanded ₹40 lakh more as GST (goods and service tax), which Sharma paid in July 2018. However, after a few months, there was still no development on the van. Sharma then asked for his money back, said a police officer. Chhabria then said he would deliver the van but asked for an additional ₹60 lakh. Sharma then approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in 2019, following which NCLT froze Chhabria’s account. Chhabria then sent Sharma a bill of around ₹12 lakh for parking the vehicle and keeping spare parts in factory premises. After receiving the bill, Sharma approached Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) and registered a complaint. Now CIU is registering a separate case against Chhabria and will investigate the case. Chhabria was arrested by CIU on December 28, 2020, after police found that he and his firm, Dilip Chhabria (DC) Designs Pvt Ltd, had allegedly availed loans from some non-banking financial companies (NBFC) by posing as customers looking to buy DC sports cars. Police raided his factory in Pune and seized 14 cars and 40 engines. After his police remand ended on January 7, Chhabria was produced in court again and was granted judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/car-designer-dilip-chhabria-faces-arrest-for-cheating-comedian-kapil-sharma-101610391457862.html

However, we have to be on alert due to which we have increased our surveillance,” said Dr Sanjay Tripathi, director of Byculla zoo.“We would have had to worry of infection spreading if say we had ponds at which the zoo birds and migratory birds drank water. However, at Byculla zoo, our over 200 birds are caged,” he added.According to zoo authorities, they have increased surveillance by ensuring the staffers wash their hands before serving the birds’ food or medicines and keeping general hygiene at its maximum level to ensure zero chance of the zoo’s birds getting infected.Byculla zoo authorities said that as of Monday, there are no plans to conduct screening of the exotic and aquatic birds at the zoo. “There are no plans to screen any birds yet. But if such guidelines are issued, we will act accordingly,” said Dr Tripathi.Byculla zoo has been shut since March 2020 owing to the outbreak of Covid-19 and there has been no announcement regarding its reopening.On Sunday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had reported complaints of 11 dead birds in Chembur. Of the 11 birds, samples of two were sent by the state’s animal husbandry department for testing on Sunday. On Monday, it was learnt that the two birds had tested positive for bird flu.Before this, 13 birds were reported dead in Thane. On Monday, the district authorities in Parbhani had also confirmed that 800 chickens in a village died due to bird flu.According to BMC officials, the state government is expected to issue directives in the form of measures to be taken in Mumbai when it comes to poultry retailers and shops in the city.Ajit Narawade, assistant municipal commissioner of M-East ward that covers Chembur, said, “We have not got any directions in regards to poultry retailers and shops in the city, but at the ward level we will carry out inspections after receiving instructions from the commissioner and state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-threat-in-mumbai-byculla-zoo-on-high-alert-for-its-200-plus-aquatic-exotic-birds-101610391339395.html

The Sars-Cov-2 virus causes Covid-19. Led by professor Mahesh Panchagnula from IITM’s department of applied mechanics and consisting of research scholars Arnab Kumar Mallik and Soumalya Mukherjee, the research team modelled breathing frequency in a laboratory. Their findings show that low breathing frequency increases virus’s time of residence therefore increases the chances of deposition and consequently infection in an exposed individual. The results of the study were published in November 2020, in the reputed peer-reviewed journal, Physics of Fluids.The researchers said the study shows how different dimensions of lungs effect an individual’s susceptibility to Covid-19. “Covid-19 has opened a gap in our understanding of deep pulmonological systemic diseases. Our study unravels the mystery behind how particles are transported and deposited in the deep lung. The study demonstrates the physical process by which aerosol particles are transported into the deep generations of the lung,” said Panchagnula.Explaining their laboratory model, Panchagnula said, “We have been consistently studying and understanding the mechanics of breathing lungs. Infections like Covid-19 spread through sneezing and coughing as they instantly release droplets. Our team simulated the droplet dynamics in the phantom model of a lung by studying the movement of droplets in the small capillaries, which were of a diameter similar to the bronchioles.” Water was mixed with fluorescent particles and aerosols generated from this liquid were used with the help of a nebulizer for the experiments. “These fluorescent aerosols were used to track the movement and deposition of particles in the capillaries,” he said. Panchagnula said the science shows wearing masks in public spaces is advantageous as a protection against infection. “Use of masks not only contains the infection-laden droplets from an infected person, but also ensures others don’t come in contact with these droplets,” he said.Apart from focus on the effect of diseases like Covid-19 on lungs, the IITM study also paves the way to develop better therapies and drugs for respiratory infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/masks-not-stopping-breath-best-way-to-prevent-covid-19-infection-iit-madras-study-101610391338313.html

According to the PU Calendar, each faculty elects its dean before January 31 every year and both the dean and the secretary, thus elected, hold office from February 1 to January 31 of the year following.Deans preside over faculty meetingsThe PU Calendar also lays down that every faculty shall consider recommendations of the board of studies/board of control in regard to the matters related to syllabi and the courses, minimum qualifications required for admission to various courses and other matters. They forward the same to the academic council and/or the syndicate.Chaman Lal, who is dean faculty of languages, said, “As the governing body is already gone, the democratic structure will crumble after the term of deans and the Board of Finance (BoF) ends. After that, it will only be the V-C without any democratic body.”The deans are also members of committees for CAS promotion and direct recruitment of teachers and there is uncertainty as to how the process will go on after January 31.Moreover, the research degree committee (RDC) that approves synopsis of students is also chaired by the dean of the respective faculties.PU registrar Vikram Nayyar said, “Given the present situation, the varsity will see how to address the matter according to PU Act and regulations.”Allow deans to continue: PUTAThe executive body of the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) on Monday held a meeting in which they resolved that deans should be allowed to continue till the new deans take over.Meanwhile, the teachers’ body continued the protest for the 53rd day in a row over pending teacher promotions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-senate-and-syndicate-fate-of-panjab-university-deans-uncertain-too-101610391097784.html
12-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu cases in Maharashtra: Be vigilant, but don’t panic, urges CM Uddhav Thackeray||A day after the first case in Parbhani district, Maharashtra on Monday reported cases of bird flu or avian influenza in five places in the state – Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed and Latur. The ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing, confirmed bird flu cases at Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri and Beed districts. The central laboratory has found H5N1 avian influenza virus as cause of death in birds in the first three areas, except Beed, where mortalities were a result of the H5N8 avian influenza virus, states their report. Also, the Western Regional Disease Diagnostic laboratory (WRDDL), Pune, has found ‘H’ variant of the avian influenza in samples collected from Latur in central Maharashtra, following which preventive measures such as culling of poultry birds are going to be started in one-km radius of the infected area from Tuesday, confirmed state animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh. HT had reported on January 10 how over 843 poultry birds (chicken) died in a poultry farm in Parbhani district due to H5N1 avian influenza virus. Singh said they have directed the local bodies to be on alert and start surveillance, especially in cities like Mumbai and Thane, where only crows have died. “Poultry birds in Mumbai and Thane haven’t died of bird flu. Local civic bodies have been directed to start surveillance of markets. Shops and those in business have been asked to report to the authorities concerned if they find any unusual deaths,” the commissioner said. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Monday urged people not to panic, as Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed and Latur, too, reported cases of bird flu, after Parbhani. Thackeray held meetings with senior officials and district collectors to discuss measures to contain bird flu outbreak. He directed the local administration to be vigilant and implement all precautionary measures without any negligence. Thackeray also said in areas where there are no cases of bird flu, people can consume eggs and chicken after cooking or boiling them a 70°C for 30 minutes. He also directed the development of a laboratory in the state that will help in early detection of the virus in future. The chief minister also urged people not to share misinformation or rumours about bird flu. State animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar said they have not banned sale of chicken and eggs, except in the surveillance zone of 10-km radius where an infection was found in Parbhani district. Also, those found spreading rumors will be punished. From January 8 till Monday, 1700 birds have died across the state. On Thursday, 15 pond egrets and two parrots were found dead in Thane and three crows in Mumbai. On Friday, six crows were found dead in Dapoli in Ratnagiri and 11 crows in Beed. Their samples were sent to the nodal testing body, ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, to ascertain the cause of deaths. On Saturday, around 200 poultry birds in Latur district, one crow in Akola, two crows each in Gondia and Chandrapur, one heron in Thane and three crows in Dapoli at Ratnagiri district were found dead. On Sunday, 160 more birds were found dead in several districts of the state. Of them, 43 and 40 poultry birds were found dead in Parbhani and Latur districts, respectively. Their reports from ICAR-NIHSAD are still awaited. Deepak Muglikar, collector, Parbhani district, said they have ordered culling of 6,000 poultry birds. The village has also been declared as a prohibited area. “The culling has started within one-km radius of the poultry farm where bird deaths were reported. We have created a surveillance zone within a periphery of 10-km, which means no birds will be allowed to sell or purchase in that area. Murumba village, where that poultry farm is situated, has also been declared a prohibited area, which means no one can enter inside and no one can come out. A medical team has been set up to examine people,” Muglikar told HT. Moreover, 426 pet chickens raised by farmers were found dead in another village of Kupta in Parbhani district. The district collector said they have sent their samples to ICAR-NIHSAD. Dr NM Markandeya, associate dean, college of veterinary and animal sciences, Parbhani, said, “No virus can survive the way we cook chicken or non-vegetarian food.” Dr VV Limaye, joint commissioner (disease investigation), animal husbandry department, said both H5N1 and H5N8 are pathogenic for poultry birds but for human beings the difference between both the viruses is that there is no possibility of transmission of H5N8 into human beings, whereas H5N1 virus can transmit to human bodies only in case of major mutation. “No case such has been reported in the country as of now,” he said. To monitor the situation, the animal husbandry department has set up a control room in Pune and has requested the people to report any such incident on toll free number 18002330418.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-cases-in-maharashtra-be-vigilant-but-don-t-panic-urges-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101610390977929.html

The constable, identified as Nitin Khairmode, attached to Powai police station, has been admitted to hospital with severe injuries. Maheshwar Reddy, deputy commissioner of police, zone 10, confirmed the incident but refused to identify if the accused belonged to any political party. According to Powai police, the three men, identified as Sachin Tiwari, Deepu Tiwari and Ayush Rajbhar, all residents of Vikhroli, were riding together on a motorcycle and crashed into a car being driven by a woman doctor around 3pm outside Galleria Mall. The doctor confronted the trio, following which an argument ensued. Khairmode, who was on patrolling duty, noticed the altercation and intervened. When the constable was about to handcuff one of the accused, they started assaulting him and hit him with the handcuffs. Khairmode, who was injured, managed to call for reinforcements from the police station. A team of police officers rushed to the spot and arrested Sachin but Deepu and Rajbhar managed to escape. Khairmode was rushed to a hospital where his condition is critical.Following the incident, an audio clip of a phone call between BJP MLA Ram Kadam and a Powai police officer was leaked online. In the call, Kadam is heard telling the officer to be considerate about the accused as it would ruin their lives. “I would request you to consider the repercussions they will have to face as such cases lead to the conviction of five years of imprisonment. I would request you to be considerate and help them,” Kadam said to the police constable over the phone.Kadam later clarified that he was not asking the officer to withdraw the case against the three men. He instead claimed that two of the accused were minors and needed to be treated as such. “Two of the accused in the case are minors at 12 and 16 years of age, while the third one is 22. Since they are from my constituency, I thought it appropriate to learn what happened, so I called the police personnel. I told him that I would not support the action of the accused, and would have personally slapped them had I been in Mumbai,” Kadam said. Police have not confirmed the ages of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-constable-assaulted-by-3-men-at-powai-bjp-mla-denies-asking-police-to-drop-the-case-101610390737690.html

According to the vigilance department, the victim, Naveen Bhutani, who runs a call centre and sells religious products in the UK and Australia, had approached the senior officers of the department with a complaint against two officials of the Kherki Daula police station for allegedly extorting ₹57 lakh from him and demanding ₹10 lakh more. Bhutani said that SHO Vishal Kumar assaulted him in his office and got his laptop data scanned for information on his business. He allegedly asked for ₹1 crore for his release but agreed on ₹57 lakh after negotiation. Later Bhutani approached senior vigilance officials and narrated his ordeal, following which a case under Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 384 (extortion ), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code was registered against the police officials. Another senior officer privy to the investigation said that Bhutani was called to a resort on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway. Two policemen in uniform and seven in plain clothes took him to custody, bundled him inside his car and took him to Kherki Daula police station, where Kumar allegedly assaulted him inside his office. The officer said that head constable Amit, allegedly on the direction of SHO, was putting pressure on Bhutani to make a payment of additional ₹10 lakh in exchange for his laptop which was recorded by the victim. The vigilance team laid a trap and caught the head constable red-handed while allegedly taking ₹5 lakh from Bhutani at a dhaba on December 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-cop-accused-of-graft-and-illegal-detention-surrenders-101610388096735.html
12-01-2021||Other||Zend Zend, the man behind the counter at Mumbai’s iconic Yazdani bakery, dies||Zend Zend, a Mumbaiite of Iranian origin born in the city and best known for running its iconic Yazdani bakery, died on Sunday. He was 86.Zend Zend began working at the Fort eatery — started by his father Meherwan Zend — when he was 17.“He was making German-style loaves way before any of artisanal or home bakers were,” said food anthropologist and archaeologist Kurush Dalal. “He was perhaps one of the first bakers in the city to go beyond brun, laadi pav and sliced bread. His apple pie was delicious. Zend was loud, opinionated, brash, but also very honest and a baker par excellence.”Actor and food writer Kunal Vijayakar remembers him as a handsome gentleman who would often visit the National Centre for the Performing Arts, where Vijayakar often performs. When the play Unfaithful was being staged there, co-starring Perizaad Zorabian, “I would see this gentleman attend often, Vijayakar says. “He would also come backstage to say hello to Perizaad.”Zend’s biggest legacy, Vijayakar adds, is that the bakery he inherited is still thriving in a time when many old eateries and the majority of Irani cafes have either shut or are struggling to survive amid changing demographics, gentrification and heightened competition.“The Yazdani family shaped the bakery culture in Mumbai,” says Pooja Dhingra, founder of the Le 15 chain of patisserie and cafes. “Zend was a big proponent of using fewer chemicals, softners and preservatives in his food. His passion for bread and baking was unmatched.”“Even suffering from Parkinson’s disease, Zend would come to the restaurant for a few hours every day,” says Kalyan Karmakar, a food writer and brand consultant who also conducts heritage walks in the Fort area. “Despite the physical difficulties, he would stand, greet his guests. He always made everyone feel welcomed to Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zend-zend-the-man-behind-the-counter-at-mumbai-s-iconic-yazdani-bakery-has-died-101610358804750.html
