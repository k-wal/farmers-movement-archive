This comes after the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare sounded caution against e-cigarette manufacturing companies, which promoted these devices as “harm reduction” alternatives of smoking.“It is important that we remain vigilant against such attempts to target young children and protect them from exposure to tobacco use. As per guidelines issued by the MoHFW, a Tobacco Free Educational Institute must not participate in any event sponsored by any firm or seller which promotes the use, manufacture or sale of tobacco products in any form. Prizes or scholarships offered by such firms should not be accepted by educational institutions or students,” the Directorate of Education said in a circular on Thursday.Last year, the Centre had banned e-cigarettes and similar devices through “The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Act, 2019.The notices were issued based on the statement of the Convention Secretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHOFCTC) on “Foundation for Smoke Free World (FSFW)”. The convention said FSFW was established in 2017 and has received a pledge of $80 million USD annually for 12 years starting in 2018 from a tobacco company. WHO FCTC also added that through the said foundation, the tobacco company has been trying to influence school children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/don-t-participate-in-events-sponsored-by-tobacco-firms-delhi-govt-tells-schools/story-MLps7GfCnALiv5Ag5scFVP.html

The protesters, most of whom were women, were on road venting anguish over the brutal murder of a lady in Ranchi. The lady’s body was recovered from Ormanjhi locality on Sunday, prompting the BJP, the main opposition party to take to the streets. The police handled the situation and diverted the carcade via Seva Sadan. The IG and DIG took control of the situation assuaging the protestors’ sentiment that was on the boil. The chief minister reached his residence safely.Earlier, BJP mahila morcha delegation led by state president Arati Kujur met Jharkhand governor Draupadi Murmu highlighting the government’s failure in protecting women. She requested the governor to intervene into the matter and take appropriate action.She said, “the women were being raped and subjected to torture while the Hemant Soren government was busy celebrating the completion of one year in power”. It’s frustrating and ridiculous, the government must go, she said.The Bharatiya janata yuva morcha too staged a protest across districts. Yuva Morcha state president Kislay Tiwari said the Hemant Soren government has been neglecting the crime scenario and lost its trustworthiness. “If this is the scenario of the state capital, the condition in other places could be well understood,” he said, adding that the government should be dismissed immediately.Also read: No solution was found as farmers ‘adamant’ on rollback of farm laws - TomarCommenting on the incident, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said it was a deliberate attempt to disturb peace in the state capital. “The incident is deplorable. Such violence in name of protest in the state capital is an attempt to disturb the peace by stoking tension and violence. Some were reportedly been injured in the incident and had undergone treatment in Medica hospital,” he said. Bhattacharya said the administration knows how to deal with such anti-social elements and it will take appropriate action against those behind the incident.The JMM leader said that the frequent incidents of rape were unfortunate and mentioned that the state government has taken various measures such as opening fast track courts for speedy trial and conviction of the accused and special POCSO courts besides the launch of an app-based help for women in distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/after-stone-pelting-on-carcade-jharkhand-cm-diverts-route-to-reach-home/story-0Td5xX2noXoAhNF2o17fdK.html

04-01-2021||Delhi||Constable, son held for cheating in recruitment exams||The Delhi Police on Monday said they had arrested a head constable of the force and his 21-year-old son for allegedly using a proxy candidate to clear the written exams for the recruitment of constables, for which the son had applied to.The written exams were conducted on November 27 last year and the proxy candidate had impersonated the head constable’s son at an exam centre in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur. The man, who had appeared in the exam in place of the head constable’s son is yet to be arrested, the police said.The arrests were made on Sunday from Delhi by a team of the crime branch, which has been probing a case of impersonation, cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy registered on the complaint of the officials of the staff selection commission (SSC). The arrested persons were identified as head constable Vineet,46, who was posted with the railways unit of the Delhi Police, and his son Kashish (single name), said a senior police officer associated with the case, requesting anonymity.“Our investigations in the case are still on,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Pawaria.According to the officer cited above, the head constable’s son, who was pursuing B.Com from through distance learning, had applied for the post of constable in Delhi Police and had opted Bihar’s Muzaffarpur as his exam centre. On the examination date, another person impersonated Kashish and solved the question papers.“The impersonator could not be detected at the exam centre and had completed the written exam procedure. But during the further scrutiny, the SSC found something wrong and filed a police complaint with the Delhi Police since the candidate originally was from Delhi,” the officer said.Accordingly, a case was registered and during the investigation the role of the head constable emerged as the person who had allegedly arranged the proxy candidate for his son. “We arrested both of them,” said DCP Pawaria. Police said they were probing if any organised syndicate is involved in the entire matter, as similar arrests were made in at an examination centre in Noida on the day of the written exam, for providing proxy candidates in place of real candidates.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/constable-son-held-for-cheating-in-recruitment-exams/story-icc2GFfvecz1AwvOZYppjN.html
04-01-2021||City||Jamia to hold open book exams for undergraduate, postgraduate students||New DelhiFollowing protests from students over online proctored examination, Jamia Millia Islamia on Sunday announced guidelines for online open book examination for its undergraduate and postgraduate students. A compulsory mock examination will also be held for students, university officials said.To appear for their online examinations, students would have to log in to the university’s examination portal using their credentials and download the question paper. They have also been asked to use separate sheets to answer each question and upload the answer scripts question-wise for easy evaluation.Students will be given three hours to complete the paper and will get one additional hour to upload the answer scripts to the portal. Students with disabilities will be given five hours and those requiring a scribe will have to arrange it on their own, the university added.In case students are unable to upload the answer scripts due to technical glitches, they can also email it to obe2020@jmi.ac.in. “Answer sheets can only be emailed if submission of response through the portal is not possible. Documentary evidence, such as screenshots, is also required to be emailed along with answer response,” the controller of examinations said in the guidelines.The university has also said that students submitting scripts “through such an alternate medium, may also face delay in declaration of their results, due to verification/scrutiny and validation of process of submission.”Jamia’s declaration comes months after Delhi university – which also conducted its first online OBE in August last year – saw a delay in declaration of results as multiple email submissions by students had resulted in duplicity of answer scripts.Qasim Usmani, a final-year undergraduate student of Sociology, who has been a part of the student community opposing the proctored exam mode said, “We wanted assignment-based assessments but the university said as per University Grants Commission guidelines, they had to conduct exams. Online OBE was one of the options we proposed.”“The OBE option put forward by the university allows us to approach our teachers for question papers if the portal doesn’t work, asks for question-wise answer scripts for smoother evaluation, and doesn’t require high-speed internet for downloading papers or uploading scripts. Following consultations with student groups, we realized this was the best way out,” he said.ENDS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jamia-to-hold-open-book-exams-for-undergraduate-postgraduate-students/story-mCUBuFCau93wDE8y6sGNHP.html

On Monday, there were 4,689 active cases as per the daily health bulletin released by the government. With fewer than usual tests, Delhi reported 384 new cases of the infection on Sunday, as reported a day later in Monday’s bulletin. The city has been conducting fewer than 80,000 tests for three days in a row – on New Year’s Day and over the weekend. On Sunday, the city had conducted just 50,288 tests in comparison to 75,067 tests conducted each day on average for the last seven days and 78,668 on average the week before that. Over 60% of the tests were conducted using the more accurate RT PCR method, which has happened for the first time since the alternate rapid antigen tests were introduced in mid-June. The positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – remained at 0.76% on Sunday, making it the eighth day the positivity rate has remained below 1%. Experts believe that the spread of the infection is under control if a positivity rate of 5% or less is maintained for at least two weeks. Delhi’s positivity rate has remained below 5% for over a month now. The city, however, reported 12 deaths due to the infection. With fewer cases, the seven-day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – remained above 3% the eighth day in a row as well. On Monday, Delhi’s seven-day average CFR stood at 3.27%. The cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of the total number of cases and deaths – stood at 1.69%. In comparison, India’s cumulative CFR stands at around 1.44%. “These are our corona warriors who endangered their lives day and night to save others. The Delhi government salutes their spirit,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a video on the work done by Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility – 2,000 bed Lok Nayak hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/active-cases-in-delhi-below-5-000-mark-first-since-may-last-year/story-ueiGg37QSPUscOYqDSNJrI.html

Several other farmer organisations are part of the plan. Maybe that will get the government to finally pay attention to our issues,” said Ramveer Singh Tomar, a protestor from the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Bhanu faction.On Monday, the farmers were joined by a Delhi resident who wanted to celebrate his birthday with them.“His name was the same as mine – Yogesh – and he had turned 27. He sat with us to celebrate his birthday and had brought daal-chawal with him, which he shared with some of us. This was his way of lending support to our cause. People understand our plight and have been supporting us in their own way,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU-Bhanu.Police said they are maintaining status quo.“For now, the status quo is being maintained both in terms of law and order, and traffic,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/chilla-border-farmers-plan-parade-on-republic-day/story-WiU7ewAmBu6qsBbnoIzCBK.html
04-01-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad see best air quality of season on Monday||Noida: Noida and its adjoining areas saw their best air quality of the season on Monday, with rain and easterly winds washing away pollutants from the air. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), due to an active western disturbance (WD) in the Indian Himalayan region – a phenomenon that causes snow in the northern states – the entire national Capital region (NCR) is currently seeing rainfall activity, with peak rains on Monday. The air quality that had been oscillating between “severe” and “very poor” for past three days, improved to “moderate” category on Monday.“The region’s air quality improved primarily due to the rain and the easterly winds which were slightly warmer and were flowing at a speed of 10 kmph. The wind speed and directions will remain the same on Tuesday (January 5) as well, which may keep pollution levels under check,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 154 on Monday, against 364 day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was 134 on Monday, against 364 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad was at 168, against 384 a day earlier.An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, between 201 and 300 is “poor”, between 301 and 400 is considered “very poor” and above 400 is considered “severe”.The AQI levels of the three cities were all in the “severe” category on January 1 and 2, with Noida and Ghaziabad the top two most polluted cities in the country.Levels of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, a major pollutant in the region, improved from being at seven times at the starting of the year, towards almost matching the permissible limit on Monday.The PM2.5 levels in Noida were recorded at 91.12 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) on Monday, against 210.36µg/m3 a day earlier, and 382.37µg/m3 on January 1. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida improved to 64.91µg/m3 against 201.25µg/m3 a day earlier, and 310.14 g/m3 on January 1, while for Ghaziabad it was 477.54µg/m3 on January 1, which improved to 255.91µg/m3 on Sunday and 84.41µg/m3 on Monday.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the AQI will remain favourable for another two days and deteriorate only slightly towards Wednesday, after the rain stops.“The overall air quality has improved to the “moderate” category, as forecasted. Rain observed over many places over the Delhi region and associated wet deposition of pollutants has led to a clean environment. Under the influence of an active Western Disturbance, a wet spell with widespread precipitation is likely to continue Monday and Tuesday. The AQI is likely to improve marginally and stay in the “moderate” to “satisfactory” category Monday and Tuesday. AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and in the “moderate” to “poor” category on January 6 and 7,” said a Safar statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-see-best-air-quality-of-season-on-monday/story-GO4yxrfrt6NRL66XtF6F4K.html
04-01-2021||Chandigarh||No weightage for legal studies in BA LLB (H) course in UILS: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Monday dismissed pleas to give additional weightage to students clearing legal studies subject in the 10+2 exams and seeking admission to the five-year integrated BA LLB (Hons) course at Panjab University’s (PU) University Institute of Legal Studies (UILS). Even as a detailed judgment was awaited, lawyer Harlove Singh Rajput said that weightage allowed for those who had studied economics and legal studies in 10+2 would not be given and rules given in the prospectus for admissions would be followed.A clutch of petitions for and against the award of weightage to students studying the two subjects in 10+2 examination had been filed in HC after admissions through written tests were scrapped due to Covid-19 last year and PU decided to hold counselling on the basis of marks obtained in the 10+2 exam. However, certain changes were introduced in the manner of counselling which was challenged in these pleas. On December 1, HC stayed the counselling process.PU had decided to award weightage of four marks each while admitting students to B Com LLB course (Hons) but not for BA LLB (Hons). The petitioners had argued that PU could not be allowed to adopt a pick and choose policy for similar courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-weightage-for-legal-studies-in-ba-llb-h-course-in-uils-hc/story-xeBA5R0hUf7XyqL7UrPL1I.html
04-01-2021||Noida||Light rains predicted in Noida today; Wednesday may see dense fog||Noida: The India Meteorological department (IMD) has said that light rains the region is currently experiencing will continue on Tuesday as well, keeping the cold wave and cold day conditions under check. Rains and thunder activities on Tuesday, however, will be followed by dense fog in the entire national Capital region, especially in open areas such as expressway and highways, on January 6, 7 and 8, officials said. According to the IMD, Noida recorded 15mm of rain on Sunday and about 2.5 mm on Monday (till 5.30pm). “Tuesday would also see light rainfall activity along with easterly winds. This will keep the mercury high, as a clouded sky helps trap temperature. Thus, the maximum temperatures would hover around the season’s average, which is around 20 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperatures will be about three degrees higher than the season’s average, which is about seven degrees Celsius, so the minimum temperature will be around 10 degrees Celsius for next two days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (IMD). He added that the mercury will, however, drop from January 8 as the wind directions would change from easterly to icy-cold north-westerly, with dense fog from Wednesday. “The mercury will start dropping from Friday and Saturday due to the change in wind. The region will also see dense fog from Wednesday, January 6 to January 8 as the western disturbance’s withdrawal will keep the winds low and moisture high. This would lead to dense fog,” Srivastava added. On Monday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 12 degrees Celsius, against 11.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The average minimum temperature for NCR, based on Safdarjung observatory was 11.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 22.6 degrees Celsius, against 19.3 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The average maximum for NCR was recorded at 22.6 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/light-rains-predicted-in-noida-today-wednesday-may-see-dense-fog/story-a2FjutJaF94btAFbQfFUeN.html

The report is now a part of the inquiry being conducted by the divisional commissioner (Meerut) and inspector general (Meerut range) into the incident.The senior officers had called on the chief engineers of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) and the municipal-corporation for an initial site inspection of the cremation ground. “Inspection revealed that there were issues related to substandard material and design which finally led to structural failure. Upon inspection, the material appeared to be of inferior quality and more testing is to be done to ascertain the quality. The officials of Muradnagar Nagar Palika could not show us the proper designs of the structure,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of the Ghaziabad development authority. The executive officer of the Nagar Palika, besides a junior engineer and a supervisor, were arrested on Monday in connection with the incident. “The incident was more likely triggered due to rain and it seems that slabs of the structure were not properly bound, which led to the collapse of the entire structure,” he added. Officials said they also found out that the junior engineer of the Nagar Palika had allegedly signed the measurement book, while the executive engineer of the public works department, and their assistant engineer, had allegedly provided their signatures for forwarding of bills. Manish Verma, executive engineer of the PWD, did not respond to calls. The contract for the construction was given to Ajay Tyagi, who has been booked. The police said that the suspect is absconding. “The inquiry assigned to us is most likely to get complete by Tuesday and will be forwarded to the state administration. We are analysing all aspects and documents related to the incident,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). The inquiry at Muradnagar was directed by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday. Meanwhile, it has come to light that Tyagi had allegedly also procured contracts for a number of civic infrastructural works with the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. “Tyagi has contracts with the corporation. At this point there are only allegations that inferior quality material was used at Muradnagar and this should be inquired. If there is some scientific report which confirms this, we will take up suitable action. The initial report was sought by the district magistrate and this needs to be investigated,” said MS Tanwar, municipal-commissioner. “However, we are conducting random inspections of our works and are also checking up the quality of construction of works taken up by Tyagi,” he added. The structure which collapsed was about 40 feet in length and assigned to the contracture for Rs 50 lakh from the Fourteenth Finance Commission. Nagar Palika’s executive officer Niharika Singh on Sunday said that construction was pending and had faced delays due to lockdown. Meanwhile, hundreds of onlookers came to the Ukhlarsi cremation ground where leftover bags, shoes, helmets and other items of the victims were lying scattered in the debris. “It is one of the biggest incidents in the district where so many people have lost lives. The debris indicates that the material was inferior quality – parts of it can be broken down with a normal brick. There are no priests at the cremation ground as people attacked them after the incident on Sunday. They have locked their house and left the place,” said Sunil Sharma, a local resident of Muradnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-roof-collapse-substandard-material-and-design-issues-led-to-structural-failure-finds-initial-report/story-6ACbGXrWmwHQ8zCySXGDxO.html
04-01-2021||Noida||Muradnagar roof collapse: Families place bodies on road, block way to press for demands; three officials arrested||Ghaziabad: Families of the victims of the roof collapse tragedy, which took place in Muradnagar, blocked the Delhi-Meerut Road for almost seven hours on Monday by placing the dead bodies on the road, in order to press for their demand for hiked compensation . Their other demands include a government job for one member per family, free education for children of the deceased and strict action against the erring persons.The Ghaziabad police arrested three officials of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika in connection with the incident on Monday, who had been named in the FIR lodged after the incident. Officers said that the construction work had been assigned to Ajay Tyagi, a contractor who has also been named in the FIR, who is absconding since the incident. The Ghaziabad police on Monday also announced a reward of Rs 25,000 on his arrest.“In connection with an FIR lodged into the incident on late Sunday, we have arrested Niharika Singh (executive-officer of Muradnagar Nagar Palika), Palika’s junior engineer CP Singh and a supervisor, Ashish Kumar,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural), Ghaziabad.“We have arrested three persons and five teams are conducting raids to nab the contractor. We have levied IPC sections based on the complaint and are investigating the case in detail. The FIR also names other persons and officials,” Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad, told reporters at the protest site in Muradnagar.As many as 24 persons had died when the roof of a concrete shed, about 40 feet in length, at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground collapsed, when a group of about 50-60 people were there to attend the funeral of a 65-year-old man. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to each of the families of the victims, and had sought a report from the divisional commissioner (Meerut) and the additional director general (Meerut zone). The autopsy of the 24 victims went on till late Sunday, after which the bodies were handed over to the families. Men, women and children from the victims’ families as well as from nearby localities staged the sit-in alongside six bodies at Delhi Meerut Road for seven hours before they finally lifted the blockade. The families said that they narrated their plight before officials and also raised questions why their demands were not being accepted despite a major tragedy having occurred. “Our entire family is shattered as I lost my grandson, who has left behind his sister, and I also lost my son-in-law who is now survived by his widowed wife and two minor children, aged four and six years. Both families are left without any earning member. It is now a question of survival of my daughter-in-law and her children,” said 70-year-old Ram Das. Like Das, Iqbal Singh lost his son, Nitin Singh, 40, to the tragedy. “He was in a private job in Delhi and I work in Delhi to sustain the family. Since the lockdown started my employer has been paying me just Rs 8,000 per month. I am now left with my son’s widowed wife and his two children, aged six and five years. Their entire future is ruined and I can hardly sustain their education,” Singh said. The families said that they put forth several demands but officials continued with deliberations with state officials in Lucknow and UP cabinet minister Suresh Khanna, who was in Ghaziabad. “We demanded Rs 20 lakh for the families of each of the deceased, government jobs to one of their family members, free education of their children and strict action against the erring persons. We kept reminding the officials but each time we went to them, they said that they were talking to state officials,” said Yogendra Singh, Nitin’s brother. The blockade of the major road, an erstwhile national highway, disrupted traffic for seven hours. During the protests, victim families continued to press for their demands before Anita C Meshram, divisional commissioner (Meerut), and Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range) who had come to Muradnagar. “We gave assurance to the families that their demands will be considered with compassion and that all assistance will be made available for them. Three persons have already been arrested and teams are searching for the contractor,” the IG (Meerut range) said, without elaborating which demands of the victim families were finally met. Khanna, on Monday evening, reached Muradnagar and met the victims’ families. The district administration later issued a statement in which it said that the minister gave assurance of compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the victim families and jobs based on qualification. “An inquiry has been set up by the CM and once the report is received, others will be punished. Three persons have been sent to jail. We have given assurance for compensation of Rs 10 lakh and jobs (based on qualification). We will take strict action based on investigation and inquiry. The contractor will be arrested soon and there will be an exemplary punishment,” Khanna told reporters at Muradnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/muradnagar-roof-collapse-families-place-bodies-on-road-block-way-to-press-for-demands-three-officials-arrested/story-IlHotq3nnrasIdDJD15njP.html
04-01-2021||Kolkata||Abhishek Banerjee on 5-day tour of north Bengal where BJP gained most in 2019||In the crosshairs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the run-up to the West Bengal assembly polls due in a few months, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee on Monday started a five-day tour of the north Bengal districts where the saffron camp won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and now poses a major challenge to the ruling party. This is the first time Abhishek Banerjee is visiting the region alone for so many days only to look into organizational issues plaguing the TMC. Since October last year, BJP state and national leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah, have been singling out Abhishek Banerjee in their speeches and social media posts, calling him “tolabaaj bhaipo” (extortionist nephew in Bengali) and accusing him of amassing wealth through unfair means. After joining the BJP on December 19, former minister Suvendu Adhikari intensified this attack by raising short slogans against Banerjee. Mamata Banerjee, often referred to as pishi (aunt) by the BJP leaders, has almost become a secondary target if one goes by the rhetoric.Also read: Supreme Court’s judgment on Central Vista project on TuesdayTMC leaders told HT that Abhishek Banerjee, who is a Lok Sabha member and heads the party’s youth wing, will mostly hold internal meetings with legislators and senior leaders from the region. He will hold two internal meetings in Siliguri on Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet leaders from Darjeeling, Alipurduar, South Dinajpur, Cooch Behar and Malda over the next few days. On Thursday, Banerjee will address party workers at a public meeting in Gangarampur in South Dinajpur district where Mihir Goswami, the TMC legislator from the South Dinajpur seat, joined the BJP in November. In 2019, the TMC’s tally in the Lok Sabha came down from 34 seats to 22, giving the BJP a position to pose a challenge to Banerjee for the first time. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal, the BJP was ahead of the TMC in 35. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats and Shah has announced that his party will oust the TMC government by winning more than 200. Also read: ‘2020 was the 8th warmest year in India’ - IMDMamata Banerjee, too, spent three days in north Bengal in mid-December and her rally in Cooch Behar, where the BJP claims to have made deep inroads, witnessed a huge turnout. BJP leaders of both state and national level are also frequently camping in north Bengal. The most prominent among them is BJP national president JP Nadda. “Abhishek Banerjee is coming to north Bengal mainly to take stock of the situation on the ground and personally interact with leaders who are facing dissidence in the ranks,” a senior TMC leader aware of the visit said on condition of anonymity. Troubled by infighting among district leaders in north Bengal, Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor travelled to Siliguri together in October to iron out differences in the ranks. The duo discreetly held meetings with leaders from five districts at a hotel near the Tenzing Norgay bus terminus in Siliguri. The spate in infighting in north Bengal has its roots in the induction of younger faces in district committees during a reshuffle in July last year. The structural changes have made many old-timers insecure, TMC leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/abhishek-banerjee-on-5-day-tour-of-north-bengal-where-bjp-gained-most-in-2019/story-C6P4CA6f3NQZPEvZnl5rbK.html

The district has identified about 21,800 healthcare workers who will be vaccinated under the first phase. “During the dry run, our teams will carry vaccine boxes (with ice packs) to the vaccination facility. So, they will get attuned to the process when actual vaccine arrives. We have identified 29 cold-chain points and one vaccine store for storage of vaccine. During the dry run, we will be co-ordinating the activities from the Covid control and command centre and will identify gaps for improvement,” the Ghaziabad CMO said. GB Nagar CMO Ohri further said that the police commissionerate has deployed adequate forces to ensure smooth and safe transport of the vaccines from cold chain points to vaccination sites during Covid inoculation drill. “The district has 13 cold storage points where vaccines can be stored, besides the main vaccine depot at my office. We have also identified 73 centres where the actual vaccination will take place. We have already prepared a list of 21,543 doctors and other medical staff, who will be inoculated,” he said. Ohri further said that it is mandatory for the vaccination centres to have three separate rooms for the purpose. “While the first one will be the waiting room, the second and third rooms will be for vaccination and post-immunization assessment. Also, there will be separate entry and exit points at all the vaccination centres. We will keep the name, address and mobile number of every person, who’ll get the shots in the first phase,” he said. Meanwhile, the UP additional chief secretary (health), Amit Mohan Prasad, said that all the divisional commissioners and district magistrates have been asked to ensure that syringes, vaccine, AEFI (adverse event following immunization) kit and other logistics reach the session sites in time. “The waiting and observation areas should have proper sitting arrangements. It has to be ensured that the vaccination team reaches the site 45 minutes in advance. The government has also appointed sector officers to ensure the dry run sessions on time,” he said. It may be noted that the Drugs Controller General of India, which is the regulating body in the country, has approved Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.The Uttar Pradesh government has already issued guidelines for Covid-19 vaccination and identified three categories of people who would be vaccinated in first, second and third phases.

The move will benefit the general public and reduce time spent on processing the files, said officials.“The UP government has asked us to adopt the Greater Noida authority’s model of preparing the electronic file instead of manual files to process all kinds of work. We will soon start work on this to execute the same on the ground,” said a Noida authority official, not authorized to speak to media.The move will benefit the thousands of allottees, who can get their work done online, the officials said.“Once it is implemented, the authority will inform farmers and other allottees about a particular work on mobile numbers. The public handling will become more easier with the new system. However, the staff will have to be put under training for the new model,” said another authority official.The Greater Noida authority had in April last year directed the staff to start preparing of electronic files instead of traditional paper files to process various routine or big budget projects, including land acquisition from farmers. The move was aimed at reducing public interaction during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Greater Noida authority had also started the process to acquire 1,400 acres of agricultural land via direct buying from farmers in order to ready industrial pockets to be allotted for manufacturing units through e-filing to be processed online.“We had then directed all project engineers and other staff members to restart land acquisition via making e-files and following all standard operating procedures. In e-files, it takes less time in processing and carrying out work of all kinds,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-to-adopt-greater-noida-s-model-of-e-files-of-every-work/story-vDA8yQtw9XvpN4zLMsZV6I.html

04-01-2021||Gurugram||Cannabis, worth ₹11 crore, recovered from truck on KMP Expressway||The police on Sunday seized 2,233 kilograms of cannabis (ganja), worth ₹11 crore in the international market, from a fodder truck on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway near Pachgaon in Manesar. According to the police, there has been a spurt in the smuggling of drugs since March last year. The police have so far have recovered drugs worth ₹14 crore in the last eight months across the district. According to the police, the cannabis was being transported in a truck from Odisha and was on its way to Uklana in Hisar in Haryana. The driver of the truck, Bhupinder Singh, and the co-driver, Omji Singh, both residents of Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh, were arrested. During interrogation, they allegedly told the police that they have been working with a transport company for the last three years. Recently, they came in contact with some people of their village, who used to allegedly sell ganja and smuggle it to states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. They lured them to smuggle it from Odisha to different parts of Haryana, by promising them ₹4 lakh per consignment. This was their first job, said the police. Last week, they came to Koraput in Odisha to unloaded a consignment of metal, which was sent from Hisar. One of the suspects met them and offered ₹4 lakh for the delivery of drugs to Uklana in Hisar. They were allegedly given an advance of ₹20,000 and were asked to hide the drugs beneath some fodder. They were told to deliver the consignment to a drug peddler in Uklana, after which they were supposed drive back the empty truck to another location in Hisar, from where they were supposed to load another consignment through the transporter, said the police. “The contraband substance was to be handed over to a peddler in Uklana but the crime investigation agency (CIA) team of Sector 10A intercepted the truck at KMP near Panchgaon during a routine checking. The police recovered the cannabis from 70 sacks. The remaining 380 sacks were filled with inferior quality fodder,” said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). An FIR was registered at the Manesar police station under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the suspects were taken on a two-day police remand, the police said. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said, “This is the largest recovery of drugs in the last three years in the district. We have adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards drug trafficking in the district. The main reason behind the spurt in the drug-peddling cases is the rise in the demand. After the lockdown was lifted, the demand has increased and therefore drug peddlers are more active nowadays. However, crime units and police teams are working very hard to nab the peddlers and the middlemen involved in the trade.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cannabis-worth-11-crore-recovered-from-truck-on-kmp-expressway/story-SNo02xPBXuOb1qFq3XgJxO.html

The police said they tried to stop them but seeing a police vehicle, they accelerated. Sangwan said that the police team chased them and tried to intercept the SUV but they started speeding up. “After the vehicle crossed a temple in Bhondsi, the criminals started firing on the police vehicle, following which the police tried to fire back at their tyres,” he said The police teams, meanwhile, informed the control room, which alerted the teams deployed at the check points at Bhondsi and Sohna.Sangwan said when the police team signalled the driver to stop, the occupants started firing at them. “They used narrow lanes to flee towards Rithoj village but the teams chased them. After a while, the SUV hit a stone as the rear left tyre got busted after the police team fired at them,” he said. When cornered, the suspects allegedly tried to run away on foot while shooting at the police.  The police said the suspects fired 50 rounds, while the police fired 30 rounds in retaliation. The police managed to nab two of the criminals. However, the remaining three managed to flee the spot taking advantage of the dark. During the firing, two police officers, exempted assistant sub-inspector Kapil and head constable Sandeep, received bullet injuries on their arms. They were immediately rushed to the Civil Hospital, where they were administered first aid. The suspects were identified as Sandeep Singh (24) of Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, and Sunil alias Sonu (29) of Dadri in Haryana Sangwan said two countrymade pistols with six live cartridges were recovered from them and so was the stolen car. The three other suspects have also been identified and raids are being conducted to nab them.  In the last three months, this is the fourth such alleged encounter that ended with the arrests of the suspects. On November 3, six people, including four policemen, were severely injured in retaliatory firing by a group of suspected criminals in Nuh’s Punhana during a raid to arrest a 30-year-old man, who was accused in several cases of ATM theft, robbery, cattle smuggling and carjacking. Earlier, on October 10, the police had arrested two alleged criminals in Manesar after an exchange of fire out of which one died undergoing treatment. Two countrymade pistols, 20 live cartridges, a backpack and a Swift car were allegedly recovered from the possession of the criminals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-including-two-police-officials-injured-during-a-shoot-out-near-bhondsi/story-an5DAtmJweLTOroyvnDUmM.html

04-01-2021||Gurugram||Afternoon shower leaves several areas flooded; portion of Sohna Road caves in||Spells of rain on Sunday and Monday left several low-lying areas of the city waterlogged. A small portion of Sohna Road, near Central Park Resort, also caved in following the rain over the weekend.The city witnessed light rain from around 3.30pm onwards on Monday that continued till 8.30 pm on a sporadic basis.Waterlogging was reported from low-lying areas, such as sectors 27, 28, 54, 47, 49, 50, 10A, Hero Honda Chowk, Khandsa Road, Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road and the Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. More than 100 officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were deployed across the city, along with 30 motor pumps and suction machines, to drain out rainwater. Till 9pm on Monday, officials of the MCG were still present at various places prone to waterlogging, such as Vatika Chowk and Khandsa-Narsinghpur stretch, anticipating more spells of rain.“It rained after 3.30pm on Monday. Since the intensity was low, the rainwater naturally receded towards stormwater drains in most areas. At some points, where the drains were either absent or choked, officials of the MCG were deployed along with necessary machines to channel rainwater towards the nearest outlet,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.Sharma said that motor pumps were installed by the MCG at Sector 10A, Khandsa-Narsinghpur stretch, Sector 27, Hero Honda Chowk, among other areas to drain out rainwater.“With the prediction of more rain, motor pumps will continue to operate at these locations as a precautionary measure so that they can be turned on as soon as it starts rainwater and heavy water accumulation does not occur. Until the weather clears up more than 100 of our officials have been directed to stay on continuous alert,” said Sharma.Portion of Sohna Road caves in Earlier in the day, around 6am, a small portion of the road, opposite Central Park Resort on Sohna Road, caved in following the rain on Sunday.As per traffic police officials, due to the ongoing construction of Sohna elevated road, only basic re-carpeting had been done on the main carriageway. The rain on Sunday eroded the top bitumen layer and the movement of heavy vehicles led to a small cave-in on the rightmost lane of the carriageway carrying traffic from Vatika Chowk towards Subhash Chowk.Traffic police officials said that they had placed a truck, prior to the cave-in, as a precautionary measure and also placed traffic cones to alert commuters.With one of the three lanes barricaded, the cave-in also resulted in congestion on the stretch.By 3pm, traffic police along with a few daily-wage earners from the construction site filled the cave-in with a gravel layer. Later, the entire stretch was subsequently opened to traffic.“The cave-in was minor. It was less than two feet deep and two feet wide. After being alerted about the same, we had placed a truck before the affected spot as a precautionary measure. With the assistance of workers from the contractor, we quickly filled the stretch with mud, gravel, and stones and opened it for traffic movement. After the overcast conditions are over, the affected spot will be repaired,” said Jitender Rana, traffic inspector, Gurugram traffic police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/afternoon-shower-leaves-several-areas-flooded-portion-of-sohna-road-caves-in/story-efkpfJebRcuURydbfVcq9I.html

Since Gurugram and Manesar have seen cleaner air throughout the winter, it’s not surprising that the air is cleaner than in other parts of the NCR,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality... has improved significantly owing to rain and better wind conditions favourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to remain in the moderate to satisfactory category on 04.01.2021 and 05.01.2021. The air quality is likely to remain in the moderate to poor category on 06.01.2021.” Winds are expected to originate from the east or southeast of Delhi at speeds between 15-20 kmph, with a generally cloudy sky, thundershowers and moderate to dense fog in the morning, over the next two days.While Gurugram’s automatic weather station did not capture any temperature or rainfall data over the past 24 hours, data from the IMD’s nearest AWS at Palam (in Delhi) showed the minimum temperature to be 12.3 degrees Celsius on Monday, while the maximum temperature stood at 20.4 degrees Celsius. As per Palam data, 5mm of rainfall had been received until 8am on the morning of January 4.While these are warmer conditions than the region was experiencing just a few days ago, the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram predicts another cold wave around January 7, when the minimum temperature is expected to dip to about 9 degrees Celsius and maximum to 18 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-satisfactory-for-first-time-in-over-three-months/story-O9xW541e3g3a91hVmfah6M.html

The march that started on December 30 from Ateli and reached Gurugram on Monday, with protesters covering a distance of about 100 kilometres so far.Punjab and Haryana are locked in a dispute over the sharing of the Ravi-Beas waters for decades. While Haryana wants its share, as was decided when the state was carved out of Punjab along with Himachal Pradesh 50 years ago, successive Punjab governments have refused to share the water. The 212km-long SYL Canal was to carry Haryana’s share of water to its dry and arid southern part, with 121 kilometres of the canal to run through Punjab and the remaining 91km through Haryana. The Haryana portion was completed in June 1980, but Punjab is yet to complete the canal. While addressing a press conference in the city on Monday, Samiti chairman and former Ateli MLA Naresh Yadav said that farmers of Ahirwal region in southern Haryana were in need of water, but the Central government had not taken any steps in this regard. “Despite the Supreme Court ruling in favour of Haryana, Punjab is not ready to share water with Haryana. Farmers of the region are struggling due to this, “ said Yadav. He said that thousands of acres of land had turned barren in the Ahirwal region due to shortage of water and that construction of the SYL Canal was the only solution. “We demand that the Central government immediately starts construction of the SYL Canal to save farmers in the region,” said Yadav. He said that thousands of farmers will surround Delhi on January 7 if the Central government failed to take action on the construction of the canal soon. BJP spokesperson Raman Malik said that the Punjab government needed to build the canal and the central government will take care of everything else. “SYL is the lifeline for South Haryana. The construction of the canal is needed for the people here. However, we need to take cognisance of the fact that the Supreme Court has already given some orders. The Punjab government needs to complete the canal. We will look into the aspects of how and when to bring the canal,” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/former-mla-to-march-towards-delhi-seeking-syl-canal-construction/story-EE5j97AN3yqicmfyor6nbK.html
04-01-2021||City||Farmers angry with Haryana govt over being hit with tear gas||A day after Haryana police lobbed tear gas shells at farmers on their way to Delhi, angry farmers accused the Haryana government of “behaving like a tyrant” and attacking them for no reason.Farmers said that expired tear gas shells were used on them due to which at least three people sustained serious injuries while 30-40 farmers had breathing troubles due to toxic foam. The Rewari police denied that having used expired tear gas shells.Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, since December 13. Last Thursday, a section of farmers had crossed the barricade at Shahjahanpur and entered Rewari on the Delhi-Jaipur highway. They were joined by their counterparts from Hanumangarh and Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan on Sunday after which they tried proceeding towards Delhi but were stopped by the Rewari police.Over 1,000 farmers, mostly from Hanumangarh and Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, who were stopped from proceeding ahead, are now camping near Dharuhera.Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops.Sukhjeet Singh, a farmer from Padampur in Shri Ganganagar, who sustained injuries to his leg during Sunday’s standoff, said, “We have farmers as old as 70 years of age with us, but the police didn’t take anything into account before going on the offensive and subjecting us to expired tear gas,” said Singh. He demanded that an inquiry be initiated to investigate the alleged use of expired tear gas.He said that the police had blocked the route by placing containers, trolleys and trucks. “They even removed the steering wheels of some trucks and deflated the tyres so that we are unable to move ahead,” said Singh.He said that the Haryana government was being undemocratic in stopping farmers from proceeding ahead. “Are we not citizens of this country? Do we need a special ID card for the Haryana government to allow us to proceed?” said Singh.Jalandhar Singh, a 25-year-old from Ganganagar, had sustained injuries after a tear gas shell landed on his foot. “Along with the others, I was trying to ward off the tear gas shells when one of them landed on my leg. There was no time to react. The shots were being fired one after other, “ said Singh.Zakir Hussain, a farmer from Pir Kamariya village in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh, said that protesters had requested the police to allow them to proceed peacefully. “The police started lobbing tear gas from the bridge above. All these shells were dated from 2017 to 2020. For nearly two hours, they continued to fire tear gas,” said Hussain.Resham Singh, a farmer from Hanumangarh, said that the police had fired hundreds of tear gas shells and some of them had landed in trolleys with gas cylinders. He said that two trolleys had caught fire but was contained by farmers. “The police was lobbing shells from the top. One of them fell into our trolley that contained gas cylinders. There could have been a big blast but the police didn’t stop. Without any provocation, the police acted ruthlessly with us,” said Singh.Harvinder Singh Gill, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar, said that the goal was to reach Delhi border but the Haryana police were blocking their path. Gill said that farmers would continue to camp near Dharuhera for the next two days and wait for the Supreme Court hearing and the ongoing talks, before deciding on the next course of action. “Our goal has always been to reach the Delhi borders. We will wait for the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to decide if and when they want us to proceed. Until that, we will camp here,” said Gill.Farmers camping at the new site were also inconvenienced due to the downpour. While those with trolleys are using their vehicles for shelter, tarpaulin tents were put in place for those without vehicles.Hazoor Singh, a 61-year-old, sitting under a makeshift tarpaulin arrangement, said that while farmers had been protesting at Singhu and Tikri as well, the Haryana government had been the least cooperative. “The Haryana government bothers us a lot. They are lobbing tear gas shells on those who produce food. The government is being arrogant,” said Singh, a native of Jagtewala in Shri Ganganagar.Rajesh Kumar, DSP, Bawal, said that the police did not let the farmers move ahead from their camp on Monday. Kumar said that the police was well prepared with the deployment. He denied that expired tear gas shells had been used on the protesting farmers.Due to traffic diversions, commuters also faced trouble in reaching Dharuhera on Monday.Neeraj Kumar, 26, said that he had to walk for 15 kilometres to reach Dharuhera. “I took a bus from Pachgaon but we couldn’t proceed ahead since the route was closed by the police. I will start walking now and hope to reach my workplace in two hours. We were not given any explanation about the diversions,” said Kumar, who works with an automobile manufacturing company. Bharatiya Janata Party’s Haryana spokesperson, Raman Malik, said that while the government was engaging with farmers to address their concerns, it needed to maintain the law and order situation as well. “Unlike certain political leaders, who are looking towards disruption, the government is aiming towards resolving the farmers concerns in a constructive manner. The government is looking into the interests of all farmers and not a handful of farmers, and while doing so, it has to maintain the law and order situation as well, “ said Malik||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-angry-with-haryana-govt-over-being-hit-with-tear-gas/story-yXJkhV0fBeAqTbsOVKPHpI.html

During the 45-minute training session, the teachers will be told about the selection procedure and practical training required by candidates. They will further train government school students under the Jai Jawan Project started by the state government.The aim to train the PE teachers is to make optimum use of the resources so that they can guide students adequately.The teachers will prepare interested students for the written and physical tests to join the Armed Forces, which will include 400-metre run, sit ups and pushups, psychological test and interview. The students will also be informed about the various entrance examinations which they have to clear.The department of physical education will conduct the online training for PE teachers of Jalandhar and Kapurthala also on January 6.District education officer (elementary cum secondary), Rajinder Kaur, said, “We have very talented students in government schools. This initiative of the higher authorities will surely help them choose the Armed Forces as a career. The training session will prove beneficial for PE instructors as they can now guide students interested in joining the Armed Forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jai-jawan-project-physical-education-teachers-in-ludhiana-to-be-trained-to-guide-army-aspirants/story-fZDeA3wGSB4OQGOaSgVfrO.html
04-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram ready to start Covid-19 vaccination from next week||The district health department is planning to start the Covid-19 vaccinations in Gurugram from the next week, as part of the country’s biggest immunisation exercise to tackle the coronavirus disease, according to the senior officials.More than 250,000 people in the district are likely to get the Covid-19 jab in the first phase, which includes over 36,000 healthcare workers who will be vaccinated initially. Ahead of the vaccination, the district health department is also preparing to conduct a Covid-19 vaccine dry run drill on January 7.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “In all likelihood, the vaccination exercise can start from next week. Since healthcare workers of the government and private hospitals will be covered first, the department is working on taking up at least 81 session sites for the vaccination. It will include at least two to three big private hospitals having more than 7,000 healthcare workers to facilitate vaccination. It is, however, yet to be finalised.”The department has currently identified 181 vaccination sites. With the increase in the vaccine beneficiaries count, the session sites will also increase. In the first phase, healthcare workers, frontline workers, residents aged above 50 years and those below 50 years of age but with co-morbidities will be prioritised.According to Yadav, the data collection of frontline workers, which includes municipal corporation workers, police and defence personnel, is yet to start. Combining all the prioritised population, over 6.5 million beneficiaries will be covered in the first phase across the state, with more than 250,000 from Gurugram alone.Dry run at six sitesIn gearing up for the vaccination, the district health department is also holding a dry run on January 7 at six sites. Earlier, the drive was to be held at three sites. On Monday, three more sites were added, according to Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer, to make the existing system robust before the vaccination starts next week.Three additional session sites added to the dry run drill of Covid-19 vaccination include the community centre in Sector 56 (Tigra urban primary health centre), Government Senior Secondary School in Daulatabad and another in Chauma. The other three sites confirmed on Sunday were urban primary health centres of Wazirabad and Bhangrola, and Government Senior Secondary School at Basai Enclave.On Monday, vaccinators and medical officers of the identified urban primary health centres received training from the state health department. A dry run has already been conducted in Panchkula on January 2. Singh said the thrust is on the usage of Co-WIN, a digital platform that provides real-time information on every aspect related to Covid-19 vaccination.“From the availability of vaccine to giving jabs to the beneficiaries, the portal will be used at every step. For the dry run, over 150 healthcare workers are already registered. On the Co-WIN portal, their details are uploaded. It is only after the verification and the vaccination (as a part of the demonstration) that they are supposed to receive an SMS on getting the next vaccine jab,” said Singh, mentioning that teams are already been trained to work on Co-WIN platform.At each of these sites, at least 25 healthcare workers will be part of the demonstration, along with a team of four vaccination officers and a vaccinator.Requirement of workforceTo arrange for the necessary workforce at the sites — from police personnel to data operators and assisting staff — the health department officials on Monday met the deputy commissioner to discuss the requirement.Singh said, “The women and child development department has agreed on providing ASHAs and ANMs, while the health department will use its own data entry operators along with vaccinators for the dry run.”A request for more than 1,400 additional workers to assist 286 vaccinators, once the vaccine is rolled out, has already been placed with the district administration.Senior officials of the state health department for vaccine procurement were unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-ready-to-start-covid-19-vaccination-from-next-week/story-iXl4lHnyYIgKTeF4UmqIdJ.html
04-01-2021||Gurugram||Health dept expands antigen testing to zero in on possible clusters||In a bid to detect clusters of Covid-19 infections in the district, the health department has expanded the reach of antigen camps to four more healthcare centres — at Naharpur Roopa, Fazilpur, Firoz Gandhi Colony and the department’s polyclinic in Sector 40’s Jharsa village — this week, taking the coverage of rapid antigen camps to 35 PHCs/UPHCs in Gurugram.This is up from the 31 camps held the previous week and 28, a fortnight ago. A total of 15 such camps are being organised daily, up from just under 10 per day last month, according to information shared by the district health department.Department officials said that rapid antigen tests (RATs) will continue even in areas which are no longer notified as containment zones, where their use was recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research.“Earlier, we were using rapid tests to quickly isolate positive cases from hotspot areas and break the chain of transmission. After the decline in new cases from mid-November, we are using antigen tests more as a surveillance tool. We are trying to cover as many localities as possible so we may detect any small outbreak, at which point more RT-PCR tests and contact tracing will be done in that place,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer for Gurugram.This was the case in Bhangrola, for instance, which does not feature in the district administration’s list of notified containment zones. “The number of antigen camps under the Bhangrola primary healthcare centre (PHC) has been doubled this week, from five to 10, because we started seeing more positives coming from that area through contact tracing. Anganwadis, public schools, and health subcentres have been roped in to administer rapid tests to anyone walking in with symptoms. In case antigen positivity rises in the area in the next week, then we know that we have an outbreak on our hands,” said Dr MP Singh, the nodal officer for antigen campsites.However, antigen positivity rates are presently at an all-time low. “We are doing between 150 and 200 RATs per day, of which not more than two or three are testing positive for Covid. And the cases are also scattered across Gurugram, so we are able to say with surety that we are not missing any significant clusters,” said Dr Sharma.In areas like Bhangrola and Badshahpur, where most new cases are concentrated, Sharma said that the number of antigen camps has increased, but not yielded any evidence that there is unchecked transmission happening in the area.There are currently no plans to roll back the frequency or geographic coverage of antigen camps in Gurugram. “In our experience, clusters of infection are detected faster when we create access to testing. Antigen camps will continue as a pre-emptive measure. All PHCs and UPHCs will be covered on a rotational basis,” said Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer for Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-dept-expands-antigen-testing-to-zero-in-on-possible-clusters/story-Y6BeyNu5tBIM18lUffhzYP.html

Following the revelations through the audit report, the state government has now asked MC to recover the amount from the contractor and submit a report. The corporation has also been asked to provide clarification on certain points, including revision of design and non-approval of some rates by the competent authority.The points highlighted in the audit report include extension of indirect benefit for non-compliance of performance security clause, excess payment on account of rate allowed beyond awarded rates, excess payment on account of carriage of rubble, no credit for steel against dismantled reinforced cement concrete and avoidable expenditure for excessive thickness of parapet wall, among others. “Notices will now be issued to MC officials concerned and the contractor citing the recommendations of the audit. The process to recover the amount will be initiated after receiving a reply to the notices,” said MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, who has also directed additional commissioner Rishipal Singh to submit an action-taken report in this regard by January 15. Singh was not immediately available for his comments despite multiple attempts to reach him. In August last year, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu had raised objections over the alleged Rs 77-lakh discrepancies in the retaining wall construction project, which was being carried out at a cost of around Rs 2 crore. Sandhu had alleged that certain officials had sought permission to increase the project cost by Rs 44 lakh on the pretext of design change, prompting the state government to order an audit. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillors led by leader of opposition in MC General House, Harbhajan Singh Dang, had also sought action against the officials for the alleged discrepancies.Amid the row, the historical, bowstring-girder bridge, constructed in 1888, was thrown open to traffic in October following repairs lasting over four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagraon-bridge-retaining-wall-construction-ludhiana-mc-paid-contractor-44-7-lakh-in-excess-finds-audit/story-8gtL41y6tqIqWdfpF1WqjN.html

04-01-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana police intensify crackdown on sale of plastic kite string||With incidents of mishaps caused by plastic kite strings increasing, police have chalked out a plan to rein in their illegal sale. Special teams have been formed to conduct sting operations and raids to arrest sellers of the banned string. The teams, formed at police station level, will keep a check on the shopkeepers who have a history of selling plastic kite strings despite a ban by the police commissioner. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said the teams will move around in civil clothes and approach different shops to buy the banned string and take action against those selling it. As part of a special drive against the string’s sale and storage, at least 50 cases have already been lodged against shopkeepers violating the ban.He added that apart from lodging an FIR under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of Indian Penal Code against violators, sections of wildlife and environment Acts will also be added, as the string was harmful for animals, birds and the environment. Balwinder Kumar, 38, of Shimlapuri, said he and his 10-year-old son had a close shave after the string got tangled around his neck while riding a two-wheeler. Kumar, who runs a mobile phone accessory shop, said his son and he were going to Nakodar to pay obeisance at a shrine on December 21, last year. When they reached the elevated road near Jagraon Bridge, the plastic string got entangled around his neck.“It started slashing my throat like a blade. I lost control on my motorcycle. However, I applied brakes, and managed to stop the vehicle. I freed myself and went to the hospital for first aid,” he said. He demanded a ban on the sale of plastic kite string.Another victim Sandeep Kumar 28, of Haibowal said on January 2 when he was crossing Laxmi Nagar on his motorcycle, a string got stuck to his face. When he tried to free himself, he suffered injuries on his hand, fell on the road and suffered more injuries, which could have led to his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-police-intensify-crackdown-on-sale-of-plastic-kite-string/story-hM0Yr7EOc5iT3Cnhahi9AP.html

Initially, the Deccan Gymkhana bus stand was modified and upgraded, while now the Hinjewadi bus stand will be developed by the organization. From e-charging point to CNG filling station, modern signage boards and several other passenger facilities will be added to the stand. “As the unlock process began and we resumed our services for the common public, we’re finding new ways to increase our revenue. As a part of it, we are going to now develop the 1.5 acre plot inside Hinjewadi Phase 2 I-T park. There are many IT and industrial companies in Hinjewadi and daily thousands of people come here for work. So for their benefit, as an easy mode of transport and also to increase our revenue, the current temporary bus stand at the spot will be developed,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD). Two years back, the PMPML got this land of 1.5 acres from MIDC inside Hinjewadi phase 2. A small bus shed has been built at the spot for bus operations and the land was used for parking of buses. As it was not developed, the number of bus routes and schedules were limited, and now when it will be modified with modern facilities it will benefit the passengers. “Currently most of the IT and industrial companies in Hinjewadi have given their employees work from home option, so there are fewer passengers. But we hope that soon the picture will change and the employees will return to routine. Looking at the increasing number of passengers, we will be developing this 1.5 acre land into a modern bus stand,” added Jagtap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmpml-to-develop-state-of-the-art-bus-station-at-hinjewadi/story-qxIwDhMu97muIvun8cKDbO.html

India is yet to be declared a polio-free country; however, the massive pulse polio drive has gained accolades around the globe. The pulse polio drive aims to target around 3.08 lakh kids in the city alone and amidst the Covid-19 vaccination program, which is likely to go on for months, the civic body is now planning for vaccine carriers and storage facilities for both large scale immunisation programs and manpower requirements. The pulse polio drive will begin on January 17 and will go on until January 22, 2020 during which the civic body will vaccinate 3.08 lakh kids. The first day round will primarily include vaccinating kids at the booths set up in various places while on the remaining days, kids would be vaccinated through home-to-home immunization, railway stations, bus stops and other crowded places. The civic body will have around 1,500 booths dedicated to the polio vaccine and will need 4,500 personnel to man these booths. The PMC has estimated it would need 25 cold chain equipment and 520 vaccine carriers. The city task force meeting which met to discuss the polio immunisation drive listed the major challenges involved this year would be a shortage of manpower as schools and colleges are shut and also there is an urgent requirement of vaccine carriers. As a solution, the task force recommended that the other PMC departments especially the solid waste management and women and child departments can supply volunteers. Dr Archana Patil, director health services, Maharashtra said, “We do not know exactly as to when the Covid-19 vaccination would start but we are preparing for our annual polio immunization program which runs for about five days and covers one crore kids in the state. We have enough cold storage capacity, walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-laced refrigerators, and vaccine carriers, but they would be engaged for the polio drive. Covid vaccination would eventually cover the entire population and would go on for months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-stares-at-staff-and-machinery-shortage-as-polio-and-covid-vaccine-drives-overlap/story-kCQBUZfajHqjLxVt6UFAhO.html
04-01-2021||Pune||Local tekdi lovers welcome court order||While the PMC plans to resume work on clearing the debris and demolishing the kuccha road once they get the court order, the local residents who took up this issue and persevered to protect the hills of the city have mixed reactions. “The 35,000 Punekars who petitioned against any construction activity on this tekdi are grateful to PMC for their strong affidavit in court rejecting permission to MIT. As per the rules, very limited construction is allowed on the Hill Top Hill Slope zone. It’s surprising that MIT is so bent on constructing a road just for students to water plants up on the hill. There are better ways to carry out plantation drives on hills without disturbing the hill topography and destroying the biodiversity and I am sure many green NGOs will be happy to guide MIT students on this,” said Sushma Date, member of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti who was one of the members who pursued the issue with PMC. Days after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) asked the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) to clear debris gathered on Vetal tekdi which exists because of a road being built on the hill slope, area residents met municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar with a delegation of residents from Erandwane, Deccan, and Kothrud, to urge him to deny permission to MIT to build the said road, citing DC rules 2017, that disallowed any construction on hill slopes. While the residents living in the vicinity of MIT are not entirely content with the order pointed out that MIT acts with arrogance with locals and the officials might try to go to higher courts. “As the tekdi is in the green zone on the hilltop hill side, they are not supposed to put any kind of debris on the hill. Still, they have done it. After getting rejected by the court also they will try to do all types of mischievous things on site. Actually, they should remove the entire debris they have dumped on site. It is really dangerously dumped. It can cause casualties in the future,” said Aniruddha Khandekar, a resident of Kothrud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/local-tekdi-lovers-welcome-court-order/story-syi5ziRTW99r7gmz5RVpHO.html

Civil judge junior division AB Tahsildar rejected MIT’s application thus giving a green signal to the PMC to continue its work of clearing the debris and demolishing the kuccha road that was being built by the college at Vetal Tekdi. Lawyer for PMC Sanjay Murkute said, “Today the court rejected the application for temporary injunction sought by MIT. The only remedy available to the plaintiff (MIT) is an appeal under section 47 of the MRTP act to the state government and therefore the plaintiff cannot be permitted to ride two horses at a time. On this background, the order of status-quo which was granted earlier by the court is vacated and as of date, there’s no order stay on the action as per section 53 of the MRTP act. The copy of the order is awaited.” According to Murkute, PMC had submitted in the court on MIT’s application for temporary injunction on the very ground that no development of any kind of whatsoever nature is permissible on the lands included within the Hill Top Hill Slope Zone (HTHS) is permissible under the relevant statutory provisions and the provisions of the Development Control and Promotion Regulations, 2017 (DCPR2017). On 22 December 2020, the court heard both sides and further directed the counsels to submit written notes of argument. Manjusha Idhate, chief law officer, PMC, “We welcome the decision of the court. We will not allow any development in the green zone.” After repeated attempts to contact MIT, there was no response from the administration. On November 19, 2020, the PMC served a stop-work notice to the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT), citing unauthorized work on the hill slope at survey no 123 in Kothrud whereas the MIT denied reports that any norms are being flouted while carrying out the work. Following the campaign by residents which within 48 hours managed to get more than 30,000 signatures for a petition for saving the Vetal Tekdi, which is also marked by PMC as a draft heritage site, PMC issued strict instructions to MIT officials to excavate the ‘internal road,’ as well as clear the debris collected nearby housing societies. A stop-work notice was issued to MIT citing unauthorized work on the hill slope at survey number 123 in Kothrud, and following which the PMC had dug up the road being constructed and ordered the institute to clear the debris within two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/vetal-tekdi-road-work-pune-court-rejects-mit-s-plea-seeking-stay-on-pmc-action/story-GQdIxaNjhy3kMTLQao5LCJ.html

04-01-2021||Pune||Majority of schools await confirmation from PMC before starting school||On Monday, many parents in the city were confused about whether to send their child to school or not as many private schools in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits continued to take online classes. A majority of private schools in PMC have not received a confirmation yet whereas others are awaiting inspection and official letters from the civic body. Suresh Jagtap, additional commissioner, PMC said only 42 schools of 529 schools have received written permission from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to start offline school from Monday. “Some schools have been inspected and some are yet to get permission. In this week, as schools get permission, they will start offline classes,” Jagtap said. Archana Panch, vice-principal of New English School said there are a total of 713 students in class 9 and class 10 combined. “Many parents have given consent. We have asked students to carry consent form when they are coming. However, we are still in online classes mode as the PMC has not yet sent a confirmation for starting school. As soon as we get that we will start offline classes. We are eagerly waiting to start offline classes,” said Panch. She further added that offline classes will be held on alternate days as the strength of the school is high. “Alternate classes will be held. Moreover, there are all the precautions that we are taking that the PMC has asked. Our teachers are all tested for Covid. The results are awaited. We have only asked teachers who have tested negative to attend school. Others are asked to stay at home until their reports come,” she added Vidya Galinde, principal, HHCP Huzurpaga girls high school said that the school and teachers are very eager to start offline classes. “We have to submit the list of preparations done by us to the PMC. After this, the PMC will issue a permission letter to us and we can start offline classes. Meanwhile, we are constantly in touch with parents and communicating with them about the situation,” Galinde said. She added that about 59 per cent of parents have consented to send their daughters to school. “Class 10 is important for the child. As we start offline classes soon, we will be focusing on writing more as due to online classes, writing did not get due emphasis. Moreover, practical is also important for students. As we begin alternate offline classes, we will be starting practical as well so that girls have a fair amount of experience before appearing for their examination,” Galinde said. Medha Sinnarkar, principal at Apte Prashala said that the school is ready for inspection and the PMC was expected to conduct a visit on Monday itself. “We are ready with all the required precautions. We have made different seating arrangements so that social distancing is followed. The consent by parents is very low with us. But we are hopeful as schools open up, parents would be willing to let the children attend the school,” said Sinnarkar. She added that the school has also made an emergency room, in case there is a student who needs immediate care. “We have kept a bed, sanitisers, masks and gloves in this room. Should anyone need immediate medical attention, we have all the necessary things in that room until the child is taken to the hospital,” said Sinnarkar.

More than, 2,400 birds of different species have been found dead at Pong Lake over the past week. Over 600 of them died on Monday. The reports of samples sent to laboratories are expected on Tuesday. Preliminary results of five samples of Bar Headed Goose received for avian influenza testing at High-Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal have tested positive for the H5N1 virus, says a communication by the NIHSAD. The wildlife officials at Dharamshala, also confirmed the report on condition of anonymity. Wildlife authorities had sent 17 samples to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, and five samples to the High-Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL), Bhopal, to ascertain the cause of death. Earlier, the initial sample reports received from Veterinary Lab, Palampur and Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar also pointed out flu- like symptoms. Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati, who chaired a meeting with wildlife authorities to take stock of the situation said that Pong Lake area was already shut for activities like grazing, fishing, and tourism. “As a precautionary measure, sale of poultry products and fish has been also banned in Fatehpur, Dehra, Jawali and Indora subdivisions,” said Prajapati. The DC said that the samples were also being collected from poultry farms in the area and people have been told stop grazing and farming activities in peripheral areas. BAR-HEADED GEESE WORST HIT Most of the fatalities are being seen among bar-headed geese, the world’s highest-flying birds that migrate from far-off Siberia and Mongolia. Birds from other species such as the common teal, shoveler, river tern and black-headed gull were also found dead. The Kangra district administration has banned all kind of activities, including fishing, grazing and boating, in 1-km area of the lake. The next 9-km area has been declared a surveillance zone. The divisional forest officer (wildlife), headquarters, Devinder Singh Dadhwal, who has experience working in Pong Wetland, said that never have such a large number of bird deaths been reported from the area. “If it turns out to be avian flu, it would be for the first time in Pong Wetland,” he said adding that the wildlife sanctuaries and zoos in the region have also been put on alert. The Pong Dam Wetland — an international Ramsar site — hosts more than 1 lakh migratory birds of 100 species that fly thousands of kilometres from Mongolia, Siberia, trans-Himalayan region and Central Asia in winter every year. ANNUAL BIRD CENSUS MAY BE SUSPENDED The wildlife authorities may have to suspend the annual avian count conducted in Pong wetland if the situation is not under control. The three-day mega exercise is conducted in January and February. The Pong Dam Lake, constructed on the Beas river in 1960, was declared a bird sanctuary in 1983 and given the status of the wetland of national importance in 1994. In 2002, it got the status of a Ramsar site. Last winter, 1.15 lakh birds of 114 species were spotted on the wetland. The bar-headed geese are most plentiful in Pong. Other prominent avian visitors include the northern pintail, Eurasian coot, common teal, common pochard, northern shoveler, the great cormorant, Eurasian pigeon and the ruddy shelduck. The fortnightly census conducted on December 15, 2020, recorded around 57,000 migratory birds. Since 1988, as many as 425 bird species have been sighted in Pong wetland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/avian-flu-suspected-behind-migratory-birds-death-at-hp-s-pong-dam-toll-rises-to-1-700/story-udxEKkf2YlnKg9rob0LO3N.html

The economy of the state is ruined and the government does not seem to be worried about it. They do not have any control over rising unemployment and inflation,” said Rathore.Raising questions over the CM’s silence on farmers’ movement, Rathore said that Thakur should clear his stand to farmers as the new agri laws as against the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/governance-in-himachal-completely-collapsed-rathore/story-2RhSpxo4E1fqYQfDYdE8wL.html
04-01-2021||Pune||PCB to form town vending committee before it goes ahead with street vendor registration plan||Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) plans to form a town vending committee comprising elected board members before carrying out a hawker survey as per the directions of the ministry of defence. Nineteen cantonment boards across the country have received directions from the defence ministry to carry out survey and complete the paper work for implementing the PM Swanidhi scheme for street vendors where a soft loan of Rs 10,000 is extended by the Centre to bona fide street vendors. There are over 1,000 hawkers in Pune Cantonment area.PCB chief executive officer (CEO) Amit Kumar said that the board administration has to find out details of vending and non-vending zones in the area before it goes ahead with the task. “Also, we have to form a town vending committee of whom CEO is the chairperson empowered to take a decision. The committee will be formed as per the central act,” he said.The committee will play an important role in complying eligibility and criteria prescribed by the Cantonment Act. Also, the registered vendors will be eligible for availing benefits under the PM’s Street Vendors Atma Nirbhar Scheme. Under the centrally sponsored scheme, street vendors can avail Rs 10,000 one-time interest and guarantee-free bank loan with a provision to return in 12-month instalments and the vendors who repay the loan before one year will get seven per cent interest and digital payments of loan instalments will provide cashback between Rs 50 and Rs 100. The pilot project was launched in Ambala cantonment in August and is being replicated across nineteen cantonments of the country.Under the central government project, smart cards given to registered street vendors will carry their name, address, age and photograph and also specify whether it is a stationary vendor or mobile vendor as registered, according to the cantonment administration records. The central government hopes that crowded public places, including busy roads and streets in cantonment areas, will be freed of congestion caused by the unregistered hawkers.A major chunk of cantonment hawkers are located at Fashion Street, Kumbharbavdi vegetable market and Chhatrapati Shivaji Market. Similarly, during last one decade hawkers have occupied prime spaces on the road near Aurora towers, MG road and Bootee street. The Nuisance Prevention Squad (NPS) has proved to be less effective in curtailing the mushrooming growth of hawkers in the cantonment area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pcb-to-form-town-vending-committee-before-it-goes-ahead-with-street-vendor-registration-plan/story-qfpDC3lQtf85xh361KiuaO.html

The elections for the panchayats in Himachal are slated for January 17, 19, and 21.An example has been set-up by nine out of the total 13 panchayats in the snow-bound Spiti region where only four panchayats will witness the secret ballot elections as the rest have already reached consensus on the posts of pradhan and up-pradhan.The polling for panchayats in Spiti is slated for January 17.Even the Bharatiya Janata Party’s national president JP Nadda’s native panchayat, Vijaypur, which falls in the Bilaspur district, had set an example of sorts by electing its new representative by a community consensus.The filing of the nomination papers was closed on January 2 and the last date of withdrawals is January 6.“This time the tribals tried hard to evolve consensus amongst the aspiring candidates even as both the major political parties Congress and BJP are backing their own workers. People in the region realised that elections in the pandemic were more challenging for them and tried their level best to evolve consensus,” said Gian Sagar Neg, additional district magistrate, Kaza, who himself played a vital role in convincing the candidates. “In many panchayats, the post of pradhan and up-pradhan and other members were decided through a toss, he said. In Tabo, which is one of the biggest Buddhist learning centers in the Lahaul and Spiti region, the local leaders owing allegiance to Congress and BJP evolved consensus to select the candidates.When the Centre had only imposed the lockdown on March 24 last year, Spiti valley had begun formulating strategies, raising awareness, and holding discussions about the virus in February 2020.Locals formed a committee for preventive measures and sustainable development (CPMSD) comprising youth, women, local panchayats, gram sabhas, social action groups, and lamas from five monasteries.“Campaigning door-to-door may lead to a spike in the Covid-19 cases and the region still lacks medical facilities,” said Lara Tesring, a local tour operator in Kaza. The committee decided to shut all hotels, dhabas, and transport services in the area before the national lockdown was imposed. However, in spite of the different strategies to check the pandemic, the virus claimed three lives and 519 persons tested positive of the total 5,298 who were tested. As of now, there are 19 active cases in the region. Spiti region gripped by intense cold wave after a fresh snowfall, the night temperature in the region dips to -18°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pri-polls-9-of-13-panchayats-in-spiti-choose-village-heads-through-consensus/story-0wbJ0KHwQ10Sm84kMPg3cM.html
04-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC to bring resolution against farm bills in West Bengal assembly||The ruling Trinamool Congress will bring a resolution at the West Bengal legislative assembly against the three contentious farm bills, party supremo and chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday. “We would hold the assembly session for one or two days and there we would bring a resolution to withdraw the farm bills. We would try so that the resolution is passed unanimously. I know the BJP will not support it. But I expect other parties would support,” Banerjee said. Banerjee had earlier lent her support to the farmers and had even sent a team of MPs to meet the protesting farmers at Singhu border. Over the phone, she even spoke to farmers protesting in Delhi against the Centre’s new agriculture laws.Meanwhile, the tussle between the centre and the state over release of funds under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi program to farmers in West Bengal continued. Also read: Farm laws won’t be repealed, govt tells farmers; next round of talks on Jan 8Banerjee alleged that the centre is depriving the farmers of West Bengal by not sending funds under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi program. Under the scheme, an income support of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal instalments is provided to small and marginal farmer families having combined landholding or ownership of up to 2 hectares.“I had urged the centre to send the money to the state government so that we could distribute it to the farmers. But they want to send it directly bypassing the state. I called the Union agriculture minister a few days ago and asked him why the centre does not believe in the state government,” she said. Earlier, the BJP had hit out at the TMC after the Calcutta High Court had directed the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India to perform an audit of the distribution of relief materials and compensation in the aftermath of cyclone Amphan that hit West Bengal in May last year. Alleged nepotism and malpractice by the TMC panchayat leaders involved in the distribution of compensation had turned into an issue in poll-bound West Bengal. The state had later moved the Supreme Court against the order.BJP leaders had earlier alleged that the Mamata Banerjee administration was not allowing the centre to send funds directly to farmers as it would prevent the state and TMC leaders from siphoning off money.On November 6, the centre had informed the Mamata Banerjee administration that around 21.7 lakh farmers from West Bengal had enrolled themselves for the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi program in the union government’s portal and that the state government was yet to complete the verification process. “I want the farmers to get the funds and so we have already written to the Union government to share the details of the farmers who have enrolled themselves, so that the state can start the verification process,” said Banerjee. BJP leaders in the state have hit back saying that the CM was presenting things in a wrong manner. “The Centre had repeatedly asked the state to provide the names of farmers and their bank accounts. The state didn’t send. Union home minister, during his visit to the state, had said that if the state sends the data, the Centre would immediately release the funds. The centre had sent funds after cyclone Amphan had hit the state. What happened to that money?” said Jaiprakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-to-bring-resolution-against-farm-bills-in-west-bengal-assembly/story-yQWe7oWq5lBxVdCnWIp5tM.html

04-01-2021||Noida||Walkway that connects Aqua and Blue lines to be dismantled||Noida: The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) has planned to dismantle the 300-metre walkway connecting Delhi Metro’s Blue Line (Sector 52 station) with Aqua Line of Noida Metro (Sector 51 station) and develop a new walkway to facilitate commuting of passengers. The move comes after the Noida authority recently allocated the land between the two stations to a private company, NMRC officials said. “The authority has allotted the land between the two stations to a private company. The company is likely to develop a commercial building at the spot, so the walkway needs to be dismantled,” said Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC. NMRC has issued a fresh tender seeking application to develop the new walkway. According to the NMRC’s tender documents, the walkway project will be developed in the next two months at the cost of Rs 1.49 crore. Sharma said that the existing walkway will soon be dismantled. At present, the e-rickshaw service between the two stations is continuing, the officials said. When asked, the officials said that NMRC also plans to make a skywalk in future once the neighbouring area is developed. Praveen Mishra, executive director, NMRC, said that the land has been allotted to a Swedish company dealing in furniture and kitchen appliances. “This is a planned development. The existing walkway will be dismantled and a new walkway will be developed in the neighbourhood,” he said.NMRC had inaugurated the two-metre wide walkway for pedestrians and a five-metre wide pathway for e-rickshaws to ferry passengers between Aqua Line and Blue Line on August 18, 2019. The Noida Metro had also provided 10 free e-rickshaws on this stretch to facilitate connectivity. While the Aqua Line connects Noida to Greater Noida, the Blue Line provides connectivity to Dwarka in Delhi. The walkway plays an important role in facilitating commuters of Aqua Line and Blue Line. Mishra said that NMRC recently engaged a urban transport consultancy firm to conduct a study on how to increase Aqua Line’s ridership. “The company has submitted its report. NMRC has also formed a committee to evaluate the report and take necessary measures. The report recommends launch of feeder bus service, seamless connectivity, parking facilities, etc. NMRC will work on these issues to improve ridership,” he said.On March 22 this year, NMRC had suspended Aqua Line services in view of the Covid 19 pandemic and the subsequent guidelines issued by the government. On September 7, it resumed partial operations on the Aqua Line while on September 12, it commenced full operations. The average daily ridership of Aqua Line before the lockdown in March last year was 22,758, while the average daily ridership in December stood at 7,915.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/walkway-that-connects-aqua-and-blue-lines-to-be-dismantled/story-dMT7L2MAEvKWRWlxoeVxBN.html

This year the Ganga Sagar mela - the second largest congregation of pilgrims in India after the Kumbh Mela in Prayag - would be held between January 8 and January 16. Millions of pilgrims are expected to take the holy dip between 6:02 am on January 14 and till 6:02 am on January 15. “We would try to limit the mela this time because of Covid-19. Last year five million pilgrims had attended the mela. Even if a million or two come this year, it could trigger a pandemic. We would not be able to stop anyone from coming. We need to stay alert and work responsibly,” said Banerjee, urging officials to discourage pilgrims from attending the fair this time. Also read: Farm laws won’t be repealed, govt tells farmers; next round of talks on Jan 8Screening camps at 13 entry points of the mela ground, a 600-bed Covid-19 hospital, six wellness centres, eight safe homes, 11 quarantine centres and five isolation centres are being set up as a part of an elaborate Covid-19 management plan. Drones, water ambulance and air ambulance would be pressed into action. “As pilgrims would be coming from across the country it would be better if they could be made to undergo RAT the moment they enter the state. Camps with RAT facilities could also be set up at various locations en route so that there is no rush at the camps on the Island,” Banerjee said. She asked officials to coordinate with other state governments so that the West Bengal government could have prior information on the number of pilgrims expected to arrive in Bengal. “We would form a dedicated team comprising 800 volunteers which would help pilgrims maintain the safety protocols such as wearing masks, maintain social distance and use hand sanitisers. The team has been named Sagar Bondu (Sagar Friend),” the chief minister said. For the first time, provisions have been made for pilgrims to take the holy dip sitting in the comfort of their home (e-snan) and be part of the mela via the website. Pilgrims can book online a tirtha samagri pack comprising Ganga Jal in a container, prasad and the holy tika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/800-volunteers-to-help-ganga-sagar-pilgrims-maintain-covid-19-norms-in-bengal/story-2eQWANPxtpeyjkwzD0S5TN.html

As many as 16,810 vehicles were registered in October while 21,076 vehicles were registered in November and 15,855 vehicles were registered in December 2020.

In the months of November and December in 2019, the numbers of registered vehicles were 29,745 and 16,270 respectively.In the car market because of the affordability and availability in the market, there is a rise in the sale of used cars. “There is a waiting period to buy a new car and many people can’t afford it. So we have seen a growth in the transaction of used cars after lockdown,” said Kiran Ingale, CEO, Car Galaxy, a second-hand car dealer in the city.“Now useful financial services are also provided to buy used cars,” he said.Registration of e-vehicles, meanwhile, was more in 2020 as compared to 2019. In 2020 a total 1,458 e-vehicles came on the road, while in 2019, 1,001 e-vehicles were registered.In 2020 e-motorcycles saw a substantial rise especially in November and December, said officials.Sanjay Sasane, deputy regional transport officer, Pune RTO, said, “The increase in the registration of e-vehicles is a positive move. There are still issues faced by common people regarding e-vehicles. There is the issue of affordability, battery capacity and lack of charging facilities. If battery replacement policy will be rolled out then we expect a boost in e-vehicle sale.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-continues-with-trend-of-fewer-vehicle-registrations-sales-in-2020-reduce-by-38-16-over-2019/story-qQUCGsKsm5MvjBSJU8QlAJ.html

We children would huddle there munching on nuts and dry fruit after a long day of fun and play”.Dhawan has been relieved and thrilled in equal measure to learn that the threat to demolish the haveli has been averted and that the Pakistan government with the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtoonwala now plans to renovate and turn it into a museum. Two years to build haveliAunt to the great showman Raj Kapoor, though two years younger to him, Dhawan says, “My father Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor would tell us that it took two years to build the mansion which was completed in 1922. In fact my brother Trilok Kapoor and nephew Raj were born here. However, destiny took us to Kolkata and then Mumbai when Prithviraj Bhapa became a star. But I remember every nook and corner of the haveli the way it was,” she says.Dhawan’s adolescent school years were spent Kolkata and adulthood in the glamour of Mumbai with yesteryear heroines like Nargis, Meena Kumari and Munawar Sultana for friends. After marriage she moved to Jamshedpur with her engineer husband and brought up her two sons and two daughters there. Now living with her younger son in Gurgaon, she says: “Of late I still see the Peshawar home in my dreams with its floral patterns and jharokhas hanging over balconies and the large inner courtyard where I learned to hop, skip and jump. I yearn to go there just once as I am the last living Kapoor for whom it was home.”When Raj Kapoor’s sons visitedEarlier in 1990, actors Randhir and the late Rishi Kapoor, sons of Raj Kapoor, had visited the haveli and requested that it be preserved as a museum. It was after Rishi Kapoor’s death last April that the Pakistan government started finding ways and means to preserve the building as well as thespian Dilip Kumar’s family home close by. The final go- ahead for the museum came at the instance of Pakistan premier Imran Khan.Dhawan recalls, “Both Raj and Dilip Kumar were Peshawar friends and the friendship blossomed in Mumbai when both struggled and then rose to great heights in films. I am a witness to that era from Peshawar to stardom”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/prithviraj-kapoor-s-sister-wants-to-visit-father-s-peshawar-haveli-now-to-be-a-museum/story-to74E9LCCiig0pBGoGYLtL.html

Identified as Tanishk Vishal Lodha (16), the teenager has suffered a fractured right leg and has sustained injuries on his back and head. Officials of the fire brigade rushed to the spot and rescued the teenager from the water body at the bottom of the stone quarry, located beside the hill, with blood running down his face. Sanjay Bhavekar, an official of Erandwane fire brigade division who is posted at the tower located atop Vetal Tekdi was the first one to respond.The teenager had come to the hill with friends and he was wearing sports shoes. His friends told the officials that his foot slipped and he fell.“The children who generally come to run in that area came to my office near the tower and informed me. I went down and found him in the water body. We moved him around 30-35 foot and took him to the opposite bank because the water was deep on the side where he fell. His right leg was fractured. So, one of the men held his leg. Before entering the water, I had informed the control room. He had hit his back and his head,” said Bhavekar.The visitors who regularly visit the trail said that incidents like this one are rare.“Vetal tekdi is generally a safe place unless someone takes undue risks. A lot of youngsters go there regularly. Such incidents are rare. However young children, should always be accompanied by an adult,” said Sushma Date, a regular visitor at Vetal Tekdi.However, the fire brigade official said that he gets two-three such cases every year.“There is a sign post board, but people try to peep and enter the water too. Plus, excess rainfall had ensured that the water-level at the shallow part was waist-deep,” said Bhavekar.As a word of precaution, Onkar Oak, a trekker and a coordinator of multiple rescue groups said that basic caution needs to be observed by the visitors.“This is the first incident that I have heard of at Vetal Tekdi. The ones who visit the quarry are trained rock-climbers who go there for practice. Besides the route near the quarry, the rest of the patch is safe. Basically, it is a well trodden route. The ones who have recently started going there should follow the GPS-tagged route. First timers should go with a known person and everyone should return before dark. The people visiting the quarry side should not try to challenge the edge near the quarry. People should avoid wearing floaters or heels. Unknown routes should not be followed by the new and young ones at least. Share live location with the people who know you,” said Oak.Another part of Vetal Tekdi was recently in news for the excavation work done by the Maharashtra Institute of Technology (MIT) to build a road. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had put a stop to the road work and asked MIT to clear the debris from the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/teenager-falls-into-quarry-off-vetal-tekdi-fractures-leg/story-q4ngn7lyUpqOUoonR5GnNN.html

The strategy was drafted by the city’s first task force chaired by the PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar. The vaccination process would be carried out in multiple phases and also based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability, as per the draft report.The task force has drafted the strategy after it met on December 29. Based on the central government’s guidelines, the Covid-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers, persons above 50 years of age, persons younger than 50 years of age with 14 associated comorbidities based on the evolving pandemic situation. Finally, the remaining population will be vaccinated based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “This is just a draft policy. Whenever the vaccine is finalised and we begin the drive, for the first month we will vaccinate Covid warriors and frontline workers. Then, under the third phase, we will prioritise senior citizens and those with comorbidities.”The PMC currently has a cold storage space adequate to cover eight lakh population at a time, including the transportation vehicles i.e. an insulated vaccine van available for Pune Municipal Corporation, 22 cold boxes and 700 vaccine carriers are available under the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) for vaccine transportation to intermediary stores and delivery to outreach session sites respectively. The civic body needs 40 cold boxes and 1,500 vaccine carriers. Gap analysis is being conducted by the immunisation department. The Pune Municipal Corporation has also placed it’s requirement order with the state government and will also purchase some at the PMC level and through CSR, which will fulfil the additional demand for existing UIP and for Covid-19 vaccination programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-plans-to-vaccinate-44-lakh-in-6-months/story-QDNRDUYDf6zpI1GsegAsCI.html

04-01-2021||Dehradun||Madan Kaushik ran away from debate: Manish Sisodia on Uttarakhand minister’s no-show||A day after Uttarakhand urban development minister Madan Kaushik wrote a four-page open letter to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader and Delhi deputy chief minister (CM) Manish Sisodia calling him a “tourist politician”, Sisodia on Monday alleged that Kaushik “ran away from the debate as he had nothing to talk about on development in Uttarakhand.”Sisodia had reached Dehradun for the open debate challenge on Monday on which he had earlier written an open letter to Kaushik. Sisodia, during his first visit to Dehradun last month, had asked the Trivendra Singh Rawat-led BJP government to list “only five development works in its three-and-a-half years of tenure so far.” Also Read: Most parents don’t want schools to begin until April: SurveyTo that Kaushik had said that he could list “not just five but over 100 such works” in a debate not in Uttarakhand but AAP’s den, Delhi. Following that, Sisodia had said that he would be in Dehradun on January 4 for the one-on-one debate with Kaushik. Sisodia reached the pre-decided auditorium for the debate on Monday morning but Kaushik didn’t appear. “After Kaushik accepted the debate challenge, I was happy that this would be good for a healthy democracy as leaders from two different governments would come face to face before the public and talk of their development works. But by not coming today [Monday], Kaushik seems to have run away from the debate,” said Sisodia. Alleging that Kaushik didn’t come because he had “no development work” to list, Sisodia said the BJP government has done nothing for the people of state. “The 100 programmes that Kaushik was talking about must be only on paper. If they would have been implemented, then Kaushik would have come here today [Monday]. He didn’t come because none of the programmes have been implemented,” said Sisodia. Addressing the gathering of AAP workers in the auditorium, the Delhi deputy CM termed BJP governance as the “sting model of governance” in a jibe on a sting on alleged corruption allegations on CM Rawat. “While our governance model in Delhi is the [Arvind] Kejriwal model of governance, the one here in Uttarakhand is the sting model of governance. We have worked to improve Delhi’s schools, hospitals, power and water supply and to generate jobs. All this can’t be done by the BJP government because it is neck deep in corruption and focussing on stings,” said Sisodia. During the event, he asked the AAP workers to prepare for the 2022 assembly elections. “It is clear that the contest in 2022 would be between BJP and AAP and nobody else because it is only the AAP which can fulfil the dreams of Uttarakhand,” said Sisodia. He also invited Kaushik to Delhi on January 6 for the debate. “If he comes to Delhi, then I will show him our works in education, health, power, water, women security and others.”Despite several attempts, Kaushik couldn’t be contacted for a reply. BJP state vice-president Devendra Bhasin meanwhile, termed the debate challenge in the auditorium as “mere drama.”“AAP and Sisodia did drama there by putting up their hoardings and gathering their own party members. They are not serious in state politics. We are always ready for a debate in a neutral forum and with a serious environment,” said Bhasin. Countering Sisodia’s “sting model of governance” jibe, Bhasin said, “Kejriwal’s model of governance is tell lies and spread misconceptions. Their governance is also of betraying their own like what they did to Anna Hazare.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/madan-kaushik-ran-away-from-debate-manish-sisodia-on-uttarakhand-minister-s-no-show/story-gKhjoAZKkOSnOml7IAxJKK.html
04-01-2021||Pune||How, why and why not? Track-ing use of dedicated cycle spaces in Pune||PUNE The Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM), a Pune-based NGO, has conducted a survey to establish a baseline about usage of cycle tracks. The survey seeks to enable PMC to identify reasons for low usage and to take steps to improve the same. The survey concludes that between 8% and 18% of city cyclists use the tracks, depending on location and time of the day. The survey was conducted at six cycle tracks in western Pune. The survey showed that the number of cyclists on the road, in general, is as high as 25% during the early morning hours. Save Pune Traffic Movement is a non-governmental organisation, promoting transport projects aimed at making the city safe, convenient and attractive for Puneites, by adopting sustainable modes like walking, public transportation and cycling. The survey was carried over two weeks – from the last week of October till the first week of November. The survey states that the design of these cycle tracks is expected to follow guidelines set forth by Pune’s Urban Street Design Guidelines or the Urban Cycling Design Guidelines, included in the Pune Cycle Plan, which differ only slightly from each other. The cycle tracks, adjacent to footpaths, largely conform to the guidelines, except for one important design element. The tracks are expected to be 5cm lower than the footpaths. However, the survey claims that all new cycle tracks and the adjacent footpaths are at the same level. SPTM director Harshad Abhyankar said, “SPTM strongly advocates decisions supported by data rather than conjecture. We conducted this survey to establish a baseline about usage of tracks. PMC should identify reasons for such low usage and take steps to improve it. We intend to repeat the study and we hope we see the numbers improving.” The survey findings have been submitted to PMC’s non-motorised transport (NMT) committee. PMC cycle plan head and executive engineer, Lalit Bode, said, “As the per directions of the PMC commissioner we have sought a budget from the PMC and immediate repairs will be carried out in a first phase and later, new tracks will be constructed. We will take the survey findings into consideration while going ahead with plans.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/how-why-and-why-not-track-ing-use-of-dedicated-cycle-spaces-in-pune/story-awGFu5tIAxK3KTcNa6GiBK.html

04-01-2021||Mumbai||PMC Bank scam: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s wife joins ED probe||Shiv Sena Member of Parliament Sanjay Raut’s wife Varsha Raut on Monday joined the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) probe in the alleged money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case.Varsha Raut reached ED’s Fort office in South Mumbai on Monday afternoon. ED officials are to question her in connection with “suspicious” transactions that cropped up while the officials were scanning Pravin Raut’s transactions. Pravin Raut is Sajany Raut’s friend and former director of Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL), which is accused of defrauding PMC Bank of over Rs6,670 crore by fraudulently obtaining nearly 70% of the bank’s overall loans.During an investigation into PMC Bank case and the involvement of HDIL, ED discovered that Rs95 crore had been siphoned off through HDIL by Pravin Raut in “active conspiracy and connivance” with various persons. The sources of the funds were illegally availed loans or advances etc. by HDIL from PMC Bank. There was no document or agreement in support of these payments made to Pravin Raut. Further, as per the HDIL’s ledger, the funds were given to Pravin Raut for acquiring land in Palghar, the ED said.Also Read: Ask Congress why it is against renaming Aurangabad, instead of questioning us: Sanjay Raut to BJPPravin Raut paid an amount of Rs1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri from the proceeds of crime. Madhuri then transferred Rs55 lakh in 2010 and 2011 as interest-free loan to Varsha Raut. The amount was utilised to purchase a flat in Dadar East, the ED said.Investigation further revealed that Varsha Raut and Madhuri are partners in Avani Construction. Varsha Raut received Rs12 lakh from this entity as overdrawn capital converted into a loan on a contribution of mere Rs5,625. The loan amount of Rs12 lakh is still outstanding. ED officials wish to question Varsha Raut regarding these transactions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has already provisionally attached Pravin Raut’s properties worth Rs72 crore under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the PMC Bank fraud case.Pravin Raut was also arrested by the Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) in February in connection with the Rs1,034 crore redevelopment fraud case, in which Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) is the complainant.ED’s money laundering probe in the PMC Bank case is based on the Mumbai EOW’s September 2019 FIR registered against HDIL, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, the bank’s former chairman Waryam Singh and managing director Joy Thomas and some other accused for allegedly causing losses worth thousands of crores to the bank to reap gains for themselves.Previously, Sanjay Raut had termed ED’s action as a witch hunt.

As the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) failed in their intention, they are now targeting our family members,” Sanjay Raut alleged.On September 23, 2019, RBI had barred PMC Bank depositors from withdrawing money after it came to light that PMC Bank’s top management had allegedly sanctioned around 73% of the bank’s loans to Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) group unlawfully and concealed the firm’s non-performing assets (NPAs). The RBI regulator had first capped the withdrawal limit at Rs1,000. Later, depositors were allowed to withdraw money upto Rs50,000 in a six-month period, which was further increased to Rs1 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-scam-shiv-sena-mp-sanjay-raut-s-wife-joins-ed-probe/story-csX9udxCO0wjpK7m56MiQN.html

04-01-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Another deadline missed: Rs1,000 crore BRTS sinkhole||If politicians and officials have scant concern for public money going down the drain, Pune’s Katraj-Swargate Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is a classic example. It’s been 14 years and with an expenditure of over Rs1,000 crore on a stretch just 5.5km, the civic body in Pune has added very little to improve the lives of commuters using the road. For the past four years, this stretch, dedicated for Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses, has been out of use. Neither is it being utilised fully by private vehicles. This has resulted in an additional traffic load on the rest of the carriage way. In 2016, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) decided to revamp it – by revamp, the civic body meant setting up big bus stops and a bit of other works, including realignment. In four years, and even after spending Rs 100 crore, it has missed several deadlines to be ready in service; the latest being January 1 when the Pune Mayor boastfully announced its reopening. However, within a day, Pune’s public transport body disposed of his plan and expressed its inability to run its buses on the stretch, citing safety concerns. The BRT corridor was originally introduced here in December 2006, when no other Indian city had experienced it. Jaipal Reddy, the then Union Urban Development Minister, said during the inauguration that the modern public transport will to beat traffic chaos on this busy road. Instead, it added more chaos, as PMC struggled to keep it running without hitch. This was due to hasty implementation, ill preparedness and indiscipline of commuters made the stretch risky, with accidents becoming regular phenomenon. So, every time when there was mishap on this stretch, the civic body carried out some or other repair work. On every occasion, crores of rupees were spent by PMC, that has early budget of Rs 6,000 crore for a city with population of 35 lakh, covering 331 square km (before the merger of 23 villages). In over one-and-a-half-decade, the Katraj-Swargate route on Satara road has been a laboratory for the PMC to carry out various road experiments; each one failed to provide a positive result. The splurge of public money has attracted the attention of activists and common citizens on multiple occasions, but in vain, as their anger could not convert PMC’s apathy into empathy, beyond the ordering of audits. Involved in this great saga are bureaucracy and various political outfits, which governed the civic body at some point. When the project was launched, the city’s politics was controlled by former Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi, with his party at the helm of affairs in PMC. Post 2007 till 2017, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) under Ajit Pawar controlled the reins. In 2017, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) snatched power from the NCP by electing 98 elected representatives in the 165-member civic body. The blame, as corporators point out, lies mostly with officials for, a) their lackadaisical approach, and b) lack of coordination. The Katraj-Swargate road, however, is not the only example of public money being splurged in Pune. Some of the fancy beautification projects or flyovers – have been bigger problems than solutions. The recently demolished flyover at SPPU junction is a classic example of how it added to traffic chaos rather than solving the problem, because of its faulty design. Another flyover at Wakad, constructed on the Katraj-Dehu road, too, has failed to solve the traffic due to design flaws.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-another-deadline-missed-rs1-000-crore-brts-sinkhole/story-gTcK3JoV5mKgL8He29KVtI.html

The department on Monday issued an advisory in this regard and zoos have been asked to follow the guideline issued by the wildlife division of Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change on Sunday. The Centre has asked all the states including Jharkhand to take all possible measures to prevent the deaths of birds. The division in its letter, a copy of which is with HT, said, “Although the exact reasons for the deaths are being ascertained, preliminary report indicates that it is a case of avian influenza virus.” Jharkhand chief wildlife warden Rajeev Ranjan said, “Though Jharkhand has not yet reported any such death of birds, it is being reported from various states of the country. An unconfirmed report suggests that the virus has also killed some birds in West Bengal. So, we need to be on high alert.” He said they have issued an advisory in this regard to all zoos and bird sanctuary asking them to take all necessary precautions to prevent the transmission of the disease. “We have also asked to keep a close vigil on the health of the animals in the zoos,” Ranjan said. Also read: Jaishankar to fly to Sri Lanka tomorrow, sked includes meeting with Prez, PMRajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Madya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have recently reported deaths of hundreds of birds. The Centre has asked all the states to report incidences of animal mortalities to the Centre. Ranchi’s Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park, popularly known as Birsa zoo, at Ormanjhi block, has enhanced the routine spray and health check of animals in the zoo. The birds are being served amino modulator drug in water and food to make their immune system stronger against the diseases. Spread over an area of 104 hectares of land, the zoo has over 600 birds of 37 species kept in five big enclosures. “We have doubled the anti-virus spray. Earlier, it was done once in a week. From this week, it will be done twice in a week. Similarly, the check-up of animals’ health, which was done once in a week, will be conducted twice in a week,” said the zoo director YK Das. He said the health of the animals is also being monitored through CCTV cameras installed in the zoo. As many as 156 CCTV cameras, a closed-circuit television surveillance system with video data analysis, have been installed for more than 80 animal enclosures and sensitive points. The zoo saw deaths of five peacocks in November. However, the zoo director said, “All the five peacocks had been rescued from Dhanbad and they were seriously injured. They were sent to Birsa zoo but they succumbed to injury during treatment. They did not die of any disease or virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/bird-flu-jharkhand-zoos-on-high-alert-after-reports-of-bird-deaths-in-different-states/story-jPLB46j5CYxRFs0PZjCAKK.html

04-01-2021||City||Assam: Underground passage on Indo-Bangla border sparks fears of infiltration, smuggling||The discovery of a passageway below the fencing on the India-Bangladesh border in Assam’s Karimganj district has sparked fears about possible illegal infiltration, smuggling and other criminal activities. The district police had found the passage, initially reported as a 200-metre-tunnel connecting both countries, last Friday while probing a case of the alleged abduction of two Karimganj residents. Officials of the Border Security Force (BSF) entrusted with manning the border area clarified that the so-called tunnel is actually a hume pipe (a concrete tube) placed underneath the border fencing to drain water. Also Read: Assam to conduct class 10 and 12 board exams in May, results in JulyOn December 28, police in Karimganj’s Nilam Bazar received a complaint that two persons from Karimganj had been abducted and taken to Bangladesh. During investigation into the complaint, police detected the underground passage. “We have arrested three persons in connection with the case and are conducting further investigation. These persons have a connection to cow smuggling,” Karimganj superintendent of police Mayank Kumar said. In a statement, BSF’s Mizoram and Cachar Frontier mentioned that a hume pipe measuring around 30-40 feet in length and 3 feet in diameter was laid prior to construction of the international boundary border road (IBBR) and international boundary border fence (IBBF) to allow the flow of water from India to Bangladesh. The BSF also contradicted the police version about abduction and said that the “abducted” persons had actually taken money from a Bangladeshi national to smuggle cows across the border. But when the duo failed to smuggle in the cattle, they were detained in Bangladesh. “They may have crossed into Bangladesh by themselves and the allegations that Bangladeshi miscreants abducted them and took them to Bangladesh as claimed by the individuals seems to be false and fabricated,” said the statement. The statement added that when the family members of the two individuals came to know that the BSF was aware about the duo’s presence in Bangladesh their families lodged a FIR claiming they had been abducted. “BSF has been making all efforts to curb infiltration/exfiltration and smuggling of all types in the border areas without bothering (about) the extreme climate and unforgiving conditions,” it said. In May 2018, police in Karimganj had detected a similar tunnel while probing a case of cattle smuggling. Karimganj shares a 92km-long border with Bangladesh and there are 22 unfenced patches. “In the present case, criminals could have been using the passage to cross over to Bangladesh and vice versa. There have been incidents in the past of criminals committing crime in India and going to Bangladesh and also of citizens of that country entering our territory,” said a senior police officer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-underground-passage-on-indo-bangla-border-sparks-fears-of-infiltration-smuggling/story-MOicWmUcZGUrzPXEn5c2KO.html

The cause behind the mortality of birds in the neighbouring hill state over the past few days is being investigated as the reports of samples sent for testing is awaited. Ferozepur divisional forest officer, wildlife, Nalin Yadav said on Monday that teams have been deputed to ensure extra vigil around Harike Pattan to spot any incident of bird casualty. “Around 60,000 migratory birds are estimated to have already arrived at the wetland. Though no avian has been found dead in and around the water body so far, our teams are on alert in case of any suspicious incident,” he said. The Harike wetland is located on the border of Ferozepur and Tarn Taran districts, where the Sutlej and Beas rivers merge. Besides migratory birds, including gulls, terns ruff and reeve, Harike attracts resident migratory birds such as black-headed ibis and woolly-necked stork every winter. Yadav said he is in touch with the wildlife authorities at Pong Dam for any development. “The Himachal Pradesh authorities have sent samples to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Bareilly to ascertain the cause of the birds’ death. There is still no indicator behind the sudden avian mortality,” he said. In November 2019, over 18,000 migratory birds perished due to avian botulism, a bacterial disease, at Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan. According to experts, avian botulism does not transmit to humans but this fatal bacterial infection is fatal for birds. It spreads through carcasses of fish and other aquatic life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-harike-pattan-wetland-on-alert-after-bird-deaths-at-pong-dam-in-himachal/story-m7Oy6Oro0WmWDtvwvUYTdK.html

But Ganguly himself never made his intentions quite clear about taking the political plunge.He underwent angioplasty after a “mild” heart attack on Saturday. He is under treatment in a private hospital in Kolkata.“Some people wanted to use Ganguly politically. That probably exerted pressure on him. He is not a political element. He should be known as Sourav the sporting icon,” Bhattacharya, the BCCI presidents longtime family friend, said.“We should not create pressure on him (for joining politics). I had told Sourav last week he should not join politics and he did not oppose my views,” Bhattacharya who visited Ganguly at the hospital said.Reacting to the former minister’s comments, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Some people see politics in everything due to their sick mindset. Like millions of his fans, we only wish that Sourav recovers fully.” Senior Trinamool Congress leader and state minister Sobhandeb Chatterjee, who also visited the former cricketer at the hospital, said that there had never been any effort to induct Sourav “into our party. We are proud to have him as the icon of sports.” Ganguly’s former teammate and state minister Lakshmi Ratan Shukla, TMC MLA and daughter of late BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, Baishali Dalmiya, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya and several others also visited him.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday visited the hospital to enquire about his health.Ganguly had met Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan a week back “in a courtesy visit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cpi-m-leader-says-sourav-under-pressure-to-join-politics-triggers-storm/story-7r5Q2wSnYV5t7TQ9uuuFtN.html

04-01-2021||Mumbai||Ask Congress why it is against renaming Aurangabad, instead of questioning us: Sanjay Raut to BJP||Amid a row over renaming Aurangabad Sambhajinagar, the Shiv Sena on Monday said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) should question Congress on its opposition to the renaming of the city in Marathwada region, which is due for civic polls soon. Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said his party’s stand on renaming Aurangabad Sambhajinagar has been clear for three decades. Sena’s partner in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government Congress is opposed to the move to rechristen the city saying that instead of emotional issues, the party should focus on matters concerned with people’s livelihood and development during elections.Also Read: Women farmers start Maharashtra’s first rural home kitchen in Ahmednagar“BJP, Congress, [Samajwadi Party legislator] Abu Azmi, AIMIM, all the political parties in the country know what is Shiv Sena’s stand on renaming Aurangabad Sambhajinagar. Hinduhriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed it 30 years ago; now the government has to give its stamp which will happen,” Raut said while speaking to media on Monday. Raut added that the renaming should have happened under the previous BJP-led government. “If BJP is really worried about renaming Aurangabad then they should question the parties that are opposing it, rather than question the Shiv Sena,” he said. “Instead of questioning us, BJP should ask Congress why it is against the proposal. This is not a political fight. They should convince AIMIM as well.”The Congress’ opposition to the renaming is being looked at as another flashpoint among the ruling MVA allies. However, the Sena has dismissed speculation that the matter could cause a rift and affect the stability of the state government. In an attack on BJP, the Sena Rajya Sabha MP asked why the BJP-led central government not cleared a proposal to rename Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhaji. “The proposal to rename Aurangabad airport as Dharmavir Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj International Airport was sent to Centre nearly a year ago. BJP should go to Delhi and ask the government why this proposal has not been cleared,” he said.Chhatrapati Sambhaji was a son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, who was killed in the custody of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. In June 1995, the Auranagabad municipal corporation, which has been run by the Shiv Sena for over three decades now, had passed a resolution recommending a change in name of the city. While successive governments failed to bring about a conclusive end to the issue, the Devendra Fadnavis-led state government, too, did not change the name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ask-congress-why-it-is-against-renaming-aurangabad-instead-of-questioning-us-sanjay-raut-to-bjp/story-SnNYmF6diNrlEm5NpWUeVP.html

04-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC attacks Vijayvargiya over misogynistic tweet against Mamata||Women leaders of the Trinamool Congress have slammed BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, accusing him of posting a misogynistic tweet against West Bengal Chief Minister and party supremo Mamata Banerjee.Vijayvargiya, also the saffron party’s Bengal minder, shared a photo of Banerjee, in which she is seen cooking in a tribal village, on Twitter and, in an accompanying statement, said in Hindi, “Didi has already started doing the work she will have to do after 5 months.” Banerjee’s photo was taken at Ballavpur village where she had stopped for some time while returning to Kolkata from Birbhum district last week.The assembly election in the state is due in April-May this year. Reacting sharply to Vijayvargiya’s post, TMC MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar claimed that the country is filled with misogynists from the BJP who think the place of a woman is in the kitchen.“If you are a woman and you have aspirations to join active politics, remember - our country is plagued with MISOGYNISTS from BJP like these who plan to send women back to the kitchen,” Ghosh Dastidar tweeted.“Can’t imagine the lack of respect that women in Kailash Vijayvargiya family must be facing,” the doctor turned politician said.West Bengal minister Shashi Panja said, “BJP shows their true colors again! This is what they think of the only sitting female CM in India. No wonder our women are not safe under their rule! Before your misogyny strikes again, remind yourselves of the Chaiwala who’s now your boss!” Actor turned party MP Nusrat Jahan said “Shri Kailash Vijayvargiya’s comments are OUTRIGHT MISOGYNISTIC! BJP crossed the mark by insulting every single woman who cooks, provides for families and has aspirations. Mamata Banerjee is the only female CM in India at present and once again, BJP targets and abuses her. #Shameful.” BJP Mahila Morcha state president Agnimitra Paul, however, wondered how that tweet of Vijayvargiya could be misogynistic.“Cooking cannot be a demeaning job. Our mothers and grandmothers cooked for days to sustain the family. Millions of women - working or housewives - cook with passion for their near ones every day. There are thousands of male chefs who are proud of their work. How can the tweet be demeaning or misogynistic?” she told PTI.Paul, also a fashion designer, claimed that at a meeting in the past, TMC MP Abhisek Banerjee had asked the crowd if they will wear sari and bangle if attacked.“Isn’t that demeaning to Indian women? Wearing sari and bangle is the pride of Indian women. What would the TMC women MPs have to say about that?” Paul asked.Mamata Banerjee made a sudden detour and entered the tribal village while returning to Kolkata after wrapping up a two-day visit to Bolpur in Birbhum district on December 30.She joined tribal women and cooked vegetables during the surprise visit to the village.Vijayvargiya on that day had said the chief minister’s sudden visit to the village was nothing but a “drama”. His alleged misogynistic tweet was posted on the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-attacks-vijayvargiya-over-misogynistic-tweet-against-mamata/story-kkNt52VMmDGOXgu8UVDJpK.html

In addition, noise pollution, temperature, humidity and ultraviolet rays can also be detected by these sensors. The dust sensors are based on nanotechnology and are also capable of measuring the amount of fine dust particles in the air,” he said.A team of experts maintains the data and if any datum does not confirm to the standards, the information is immediately sent to higher authorities.These systems detect the dust particles and poisonous gases that pollute the environment and are also harmful to it.

04-01-2021||Delhi||Illegal tree felling in Gandhi memorial, police register FIR||Several trees were cut illegally at the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi compound near the National Gandhi Museum at Rajghat, prompting the police to register a first information report. The Delhi police have also sent a report to the Public Works Department (PWD) since it is responsible for the maintenance of the road, along which the trees have been felled. According to the report, seen by HT, the police had received information from an informer about tree felling at the memorial. A police visited the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi compound on December 27, and found at least 5-6 recently chopped trees. Roots of some of the trees were burnt and cleared with a plough.The police collected evidence, took photographs and submitted a report to the Public Works Department. Police have also registered a first information report (FIR) under sections of Delhi Tree Conservation Act against unknown persons at the IP Estate police station.A senior PWD official said that it was protocol to inform the land owning agency, if action was being taken on an offence relating to their jurisdiction. He said the proceedings in the case will “completely depend on the police”. “Since the trees were on the side of PWD road, we were informed of the legal action that the police initiated. It is protocol,” the official said.The memorial building is situated along the Ring Road. According to police’s report, the police team found a man using tree cutting machine to chop the trees. Police said the gates were locked from inside when they reached the spot.“There were chopped tree logs in the compound. On inquiry, the man cutting the tree said that he was instructed to cut the trees by a senior member of the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi trust. Our team inspected the spot and found that many trees had already been cut. The roots were also burnt and covered using sand. We asked the people at the spot if they had permission but they were unable to produce it so we registered an FIR,” said a police officer privy to the case details, who did not wish to be named.The Gandhi Smarak Nidhi trust said there was a miscommunication because of which the trees were chopped. Sanjay Singh, the chairperson and secretary of the trust, said, “There are electrical lines on the top of it (trees).Therefore, I asked the gardener to trim the branches. Because of that the tree has fallen. The gardener misunderstood and he cuts some other tree. There was some miscommunication. Our principle is growing more trees. In a month or two, we will plant more trees in that space. But immediately we have taken action and now we are planting more trees in the area.”For cutting a tree in Delhi, it is mandatory to submit an application to the government’s Tree Officer about the number of trees to be cut and the reasons. The officer then visits the site before granting permission. On October 9, the Delhi cabinet had approved the transplantation policy for the preservation of trees in the Capital. Under the new policy, 80% of trees affected by a construction project will have to be transplanted. Construction agencies will also have to ensure that 80% of transplanted trees survive after being relocated. The policy also mandates that for every tree cut, 10 saplings must be planted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/illegal-tree-felling-in-gandhi-memorial-police-register-fir/story-EfMiu5DN5OYhGD6dTjtHDK.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale| Her solitude was her companion||Her arms were covered with bangles, her ears decked with shiny stones, and stones were adorning her fingers too. She could be heard approaching from a distance, because of the chhan-chhan sound of her anklets.For more than 20 years, Suhana Begum lived alone, homeless, in central Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti. She died on the first day of this new year. “She was discovered lifeless, late in the morning, on the street where she would usually sit,” says Imtiaz, a kebab seller in the vicinity.Ms Begum’s age was not known but she was white-haired and seemed advanced in years. She often spent her days wandering around the Basti lanes. Sometimes she would step inside Hazrat Nizamuddin’s dargah, the area’s famous sufi shrine, and enjoy a brief nap in its sunlit marble courtyard, or silently sit in a corner there and busy herself arranging her bangles, nose ring, and necklaces.Although she off-and-on stayed in a homeless shelter nearby, Ms Begum would most frequently sleep at night on the broad pavement in front of a car repairing workshop. Once, before the coronavirus pandemic, she talked to this reporter while seated on a mattress laid on her sleeping place. That night, she was wearing a golden yellow sari, and was ornamented in her usual fashion. She was just done with dinner—the food stall owners in the neighbourhood gave her meals for free. Playfully waving her arm to make her bangles jingle, she said that she bought all her jewels “from a shop for almost nothing.” She insisted that her home was this entire Basti. “I’m lawaris (belonging to no one) but I’m under the protection of Nizamuddin Baba,” she had said, referring to the aforementioned Sufi saint.But she wouldn’t tell why she was lawaris? “My father… My mother… their stories are over… my childhood days were spent with my saheliyan (women friends).” Though she did reveal that before arriving in Delhi she used to live in Jabalpur, in a Sufi shrine there.Not appearing to be overwhelmed by her solitary life, she didn’t put much premium in having a husband or a friend. “When your heart aches, you have to comfort it yourself.”The last encounter with her took place a few nights ago. She was sitting in a street corner and being teased by the neighbourhood’s young boys, who were calling her by a nickname they knew she despised. “The day she died, those very boys were seen with tears on their faces,” says Rashid Jung, who lives on that street. A few hours after her passing, Ms Begum was buried in the nearby Panj Peeran Qabristan. Her final journey included 30 people, all of whom were from the Basti, informed the graveyard’s caretaker, while showing her fresh grave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-her-solitude-was-her-companion/story-edJM3WNL83MQICoOoXG7dP.html

Three farmers, including a woman, sustained injuries in the clash. The police claimed three of their personnel also were injured.The farmers opposing the centre’s agriculture laws were trying to march towards the residence of district BJP chief Randeep Singh Deol where Ashwani Sharma was going to address a meeting of party workers over the upcoming local bodies elections in Punjab. Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) Sangrur block president Gobinder Singh alleged that police used force against farmers and punctured their tractor-trolleys at the behest of BJP government at the Centre. “It is unfortunate that the BJP leaders come secretly and hold meetings in towns. They should know that their policies forced the farmers to come on the road. If they want to rule in the country, they should communicate with the common man,” he added.Davinder Singh, a protester, said, “The BJP chief is holding meetings with fake farmers in an attempt to establish that the new laws are pro-farmer. We condemn lathicharge on farmers at the behest of the Punjab governor and the director general of police (DGP).”Kirti Kisan Union district youth wing convener Jasdeep Singh alleged that the police brutally beat a farmer, Gurpreet Singh, a resident of Bahadurpur village, who was admitted to the Sangrur civil hospital.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vivek Sheel Soni said the farmers held a peaceful protest but a bunch of youths tried to break the barricades with tractors which caused injuries to cops. “There was no lathicharge but only a scuffle between police and youths. Three cops and a youth named Gurpeet Singh sustained injuries in the scuffle,” he claimed.Ashwani Sharma said, “Everyone has the right to hold a protest in a democracy. But we also have the right to hold meetings. We hope that the farmers’ concerns will be addressed in a meeting called by the central government on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-canecharge-farmers-protesting-against-punjab-bjp-president-s-visit-to-sangrur/story-ShuglyiUGmQ0IAELptZ32H.html
04-01-2021||City||Personal finance: It’s good to go into debt (funds)||If you’ve been reading this space, you’d know about the fundamental questions you need to ask yourself before investing (short goal, long goal, risk appetite, age of retirement; and then, revisit them at a later stage) and the different kinds of mutual funds there are. Today, we’ll talk a bit about asset allocation, or to put it differently, why debt funds could be an important element in your investment portfolio.As we mentioned last week, mutual funds give better returns over a period than the average inflation rate and equity funds are best suited for investors inclined to benefit from the highs and lows of the shares market. However, is it wise to opt for equity funds alone? Returns on equity stocks may leave you inclined to say, why not. But there is always the risk of loss of capital. The wisdom of the herd derives from stock market crashes and therefore, preaches reliance on fixed-income assets like fixed deposits, government bonds, etc.Domestic equity indices tanked hard in September 2020 after their US counterpart received a hit following the poor performance of the American economy. Amidst the fear of resurging coronavirus cases in the European countries, Indian investors witnessed a slump in both the indices as the country’s domestic economy mirrored the sentiments of its western counterpart. A debt allocation would have perhaps saved from such unforeseen losses.The underlying instruments of most debt funds sold in the market are fixed income deposits and money market instruments. Manish Kothari, co-founder and CEO, ZFunds, an online mutual fund platform in India said, “It is true that currently, debt instruments are earning interest rates that are lower than inflation, but they can provide a safe investment option with a fairly stable income. Equities can turn volatile as we have seen many times in the past and sometimes for very long periods too. In order to make your portfolio less correlated to stock market falls, a portion of one’s assets should be invested in debt instruments.”What’s more, if you break a debt fund (for an emergency, or to meet a short-term goal), you would not need to sell your higher returning but more volatile equity asset and incur a loss. “It is recommended to add some fixed income instruments like fixed deposits, Post Office Schemes, government schemes, etc. offering guaranteed returns and debt mutual funds,” Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra, an online comparison portal for loans and credit cards, said.Here’s what to look for when you’re picking out a debt fund: Consistent performance, corpus size (the total amount of money invested by all investors in a debt fund; a big corpus fund indicates greater stability), risk factors involved like credit and interest rate risks, growth in returns over time and expense ratio (fund’s operational expenses divided by its average assets; the lesser the better).There’s also hybrid fund, which invests in both equity and debt instruments — the high-risk factor synonymous with equity is balanced with stable returns from fixed interest-bearing instruments. Depending on your risk appetite, one can choose between aggressive hybrid funds (up to 75 per cent exposure to equity and 25 per cent exposure to debt) and conservative hybrid funds (roughly 70 per cent exposure to debt and 30 per cent to equity).How does one decide which sort of hybrid fund to invest in? According to Kothari, it comes down to two things: risk appetite and time horizon. For investors looking for a regular stable income in their portfolio, a conservative hybrid fund is surely suitable. However, for investors who can afford the ups and downs, an aggressive fund could generate higher returns. If the investment horizon is short, a conservative fund would score over an aggressive hybrid fund, because the latter can see lower returns or even losses in the short to medium term, as they invest predominantly in equities. For longer time horizons of say five years or more, aggressive hybrid funds can provide much higher inflation-beating returns.At any rate, staying invested in debt and hybrid funds for long periods (10-15 year cycle) is the key to earning returns that not only beat inflation rates but also help meet financial goals. New first-time investors investing for say five years can earn returns good enough to buy a car. The risk of volatility is low since a part of the investment is debt funds.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-s-good-to-go-into-debt-funds/story-6Q7oOc2yzbaPaS6xEnxCjK.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||Women farmers start Maharashtra’s first rural home kitchen in Ahmednagar||To supplement the uncertain and often meagre income earned from traditional agriculture, a group of women farmers in Ahmednagar’s Shrirampur town have started Maharashtra’s first rural home kitchen. The women cook and pack traditional Maharashtrian snacks and finger foods at the kitchens for customers from Mumbai and Pune, with whom they are connected through a digital marketplace called KisanKonnect. Started by a group of 11 farmers from Rahata, Shrirampur and Junnar areas of Maharashtra, KisanKonnect is a farmer producer company (FPO). It was started as a digital platform to deliver fresh farm produce such as vegetables and fruits directly to customers’ homes in Mumbai and Pune in April, a month after the country went into lockdown owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. Following the lockdown, farmers began suffering huge losses as markets were closed, and the supply chains for fruits and vegetables were broken owing to the restrictions. Customers were also unable to get vegetables and fruits easily. Farmers then set up their own digital space and supply chain, took orders from customers online and delivered fresh produce directly to the doorstep of customers during the lockdown. The kitchen was started around Diwali in a small, 400-square-feet room at the MIDC area in Shrirampur by a group of 20-25 women as a part of the already functional KisanKonnect. It started using the digital platform’s supply chains, call centre and customer care services over the past few months and tapped customers from Mumbai and Pune. For around three months now, the KisanKonnect kitchen has retained all its old customers and has also gained new ones, and produces up to 100kg of snacks a day, which are packed and transported to customers within 48 hours after receiving the order online. Gauri Raje, a founding member of KisanKonnect, said, “We started by cooking only Diwali snacks. But our customers insisted we continue selling snacks after Diwali as well. So we have branched out to produce other food items such as chutney, aachar, Maharashtrian and Gujarati sweets and finger foods after Diwali, too. The platform has not only helped us earn a supplementary and stable income apart from the income from farming that our families earn, but it has also given the women employees a sense of empowerment and financial independence.” Vandana Rashinkar, another founding member of the kitchen, said that the platform has boosted their confidence. “I have observed that women who work at the kitchen have developed a sense of confidence and tremendous financial independence. I used to believe we are not as educated as women who work in firms in big cities. But now, we are still able to earn money independently just like them. Seeing that we bring money home every month, our families are also supporting the venture.” Before working with the KisanKonnect Kitchen, these women have been farmers working along with their other family members on their family’s farms. “The income from farming is volatile and based on many external factors such as the climate, market connectivity, healthy growth of crops etc. During the complete lockdown months, it was difficult to keep this income stable,” Raje said. Families of these women earn up to Rs5-6 lakh per annum from farming. Many of them are large joint families, depending on a single farm land for the household income. With KisanKonnect, these women earn up to Rs10,000 a month by doing a convention seven-eight hour shift. If women wish to work over time, they are paid extra money per hour. All expenses of the kitchen, raw materials and salaries of the women who work at the kitchen are managed through the profit earned from selling the snacks. KisanKonnect Kitchen is soon planning to branch out into other nearby cities such as Nashik and Aurangabad. Currently, KisanKonnect has over 400 farmer members, with over 2,000 farmers supplying their produce and making a turnover of over Rs4 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/women-farmers-start-maharashtra-s-first-rural-home-kitchen-in-ahmednagar/story-y3poBtgyBOa2oqsl4DouhJ.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||HSC exams after April 15, SSC tests after May 1: Maharashtra minister||The higher secondary certificate (HSC) exams are likely to be held after April 15, while those for the secondary school certificate (SSC) are mostly to be held post-May 1, Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad said on Sunday. “The exams will be tentatively held during this period and the state board will come up with a detailed timetable with respect to this soon,” said Gaikwad. Usually, exams for HSC (Class 12) begin in February, while those for SSC (Class 10) begin in the month of March. However, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown, the education department has decided to push the exams to April and May. While the Maharashtra board is currently accepting the registration forms for HSC and SSC exams, it is expected to give more clarity on the nature of exams soon. Teachers had requested for more clarity on the exam pattern and other specificities, especially because schools continue to remain online in many parts of the state. The board had earlier announced a 25% reduction in the syllabus for Class 1 to Class 12. Gaikwad said a decision with respect to reopening schools for the lower classes (Class 1 to Class 8) will be taken soon. “The decision will be taken after assessing the situation in the state and based on the guidelines issued by the health department from time to time,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hsc-exams-after-april-15-ssc-tests-after-may-1-maharashtra-minister/story-2veTU1lMc3EXT3vYsNWwMM.html

At the time of the incident, the hosiery unit owner was in his factory, while his family members had gone out.The police verification of the help, who had identified himself as Rahul, had not been carried out.Complainant Suresh Rana, 46, said that his family had asked their locality’s gardener, Lalit Parsad, to find a domestic help for them. On December 25, 2020, Prasad sent a 14-year-old boy named Sonu for work. But after two days of trial, the family asked Sonu to send someone else as they were not satisfied with his work. On December 27, Sonu came with a youth and introduced him as his elder brother, Rahul. The family found Rahul’s work satisfactory and hired him. On January 1, when Rana returned home, he found that the main gate of the house was open and there was no one at home. His wife had left for Delhi to meet some relatives earlier in the day, while his son and daughter were out shopping. When Rana entered the house, he found the LPG cylinder leaking, and an almirah kept in the bedroom ransacked. The thieves had taken away at least Rs 6 lakh in cash, some gold and diamond jewellery, he claimed. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, West) Gurpreet Singh said the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed in the house had captured Rahul and his two accomplices taking away the valuables. Rana does not have any details about domestic help’s address and he is not even sure if Rahul is his actual name, said the ACP. The ACP added that the police have questioned the gardener, Lalit Parsad, but he said that he had found Sonu roaming around in the locality for work and sent him to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domestic-help-aides-steal-rs-6-lakh-jewellery-from-hosiery-owner-s-house/story-QeAcZtjhCUeISIZ0p0vzhJ.html

The FIR was finally lodged on Sunday, but that too after the matter was brought to the knowledge of a senior police official.

The accused, identified as Gurjant Singh, is currently on the run. Complainant Paramjit Singh, 28, a farmer, said that one bullet pierced through his shoulder while the other hit his brother, Sikandar Singh, 31, in the thigh. Paramajit said the confrontation took place on the evening of December 31, when a panchayat member, Balkaran Singh, had come to his house to discuss a property deal. Balkaran had parked his Mahindra Scorpio car outside their house, over which the accused raised an objection. Paramjit’s mother told him that he shouldn’t have an issue as the car was not parked outside his house. Following this, Gurjant allegedly started hurling abuses at the complainant’s mother. Hearing the commotion, Parmajit and his brother rushed outside and tried to intervene. But Gurjant suddenly took out his gun and opened fire at the brothers. On seeing them injured, the accused fled the scene. Family members then rushed them to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), where they are now recuperating. Sub-inspector Manjinder Kaur of the PAU police station, who is investigating the case, said that a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 25/ 54/ 59 of the Arms Act has been registered against Gurjant and a manhunt launched for him. The victim added that Balkaran had defeated Gurjant in the panchayat elections earlier, due to which the latter had been nursing a grudge against him, and so started a fight over a petty issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-man-shoots-neighbour-his-brother-over-parking/story-OB6M7f0gLJ2EZCjkpahuXJ.html

04-01-2021||City||Four farmers from Punjab, Haryana die at Singhu, Tikri||Four protesters, three of them farmers, who were camping at Delhi’s borders to demand a repeal of three contentious farm laws passed by the Parliament in September last year, have died in the last 24 hours, police said.Police records showed that a total of nine people, including Sikh saint Baba Ram Singh, have died at the Kundli-Singhu border, while 10 have died at Tikri border so far. Farmer leaders, on the other hand, said 46 farmers had sacrificed their lives across all of Delhi’s border points.As per records, 18-year-old Jashanpreet Singh of Punjab died of ‘heart attack’ and Jagbir Singh, 65, of Jind died due to biting cold on Saturday night at Tikri border. At Kundli-Singhu border, Kulbir Singh, 52, a resident of Gangana village in Sonepat was found dead on Sunday in a tent and Shamsher Singh, 45, a resident of Sangrur also died at civil hospital in Sonepat, after his health deteriorated. Shamsher of Lidhran village is survived by wife, two young sons and a daughter. Village sarpanch Jaspal Singh said Shamsher went to the border 4-5 days ago to join farmers’ protest against three agriculture laws.Family members of Jashanpreet Singh said he left with a group of 30 residents of Chauke village from Bathinda on Saturday morning to participate in the ongoing farmer agitation. He collapsed while walking with his friends. Jashanpreet was studying in Class 12 at a private school in Chauke village. He was the only son of his parents.Rohtak’s PGIMS spokesman Dr Gajender Singh said Jashanpreet was referred to the institute from Bahadurgarh civil hospital on Saturday night after he suffered a heart attack. “After reaching here, he passed away. Another farmer, Jagbir Singh, who suffered a cold stroke, died here on Saturday night. We have conducted their post-mortem examinations and handed over their bodies to their family members,” he added.Shamsher Singh, investigating officer of Kundli police station, said the protesting farmers had spotted the body of Kulbir Singh at a tent near the protesting here on Sunday morning.“The farmers said he had complained of body pain and gone to bed on Saturday night after eating langar. After receiving news of his demise, his co-villager Yudhishthira suffered heart attack and was rushed to civil hospital in Sonepat, from where he was referred to a private hospital, where his condition is stated to be critical. Another farmer, Shamsher Singh from Sangrur in Punjab, also suffered a heart attack and died during treatment at Civil hospital here. He had joined the stir five days ago, according to farmers. We have handed over the bodies to their family members after conducting autopsies,” he added.Singh said nine people, including Sikh saint Baba Ram Singh have died at Kundli-Singhu border so far, most due to heart attack or the cold.Inderjit Singh, vice-president of Akhil Bhartiya Kisan Sabha 46, said farmers had “sacrificed their lives” in the ongoing agitation.“These people are those who died either on borders or on their way to the stir,” he added.District vice-president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) Motu Singh Kotra said Jashanpreet’s family was active members of the association and he had been participating in the agitations against the central laws in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-farmers-from-punjab-haryana-die-at-singhu-tikri/story-eP3lBRFy7is9jownSqTLPP.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||Not many parents in Mumbai open to idea of restarting schools: Experts||Reopening of schools in the city, which are shut till at least January 15 amid the fear of a new strain of the virus causing Covid, is likely to receive a mixed response, according to experts. Several government and aided schools are looking forward to the reopening, citing loss of learning in online mode. Private schools, however, are considering continuing with the online mode, as parents are willing to send their children only after the vaccination. Private schools said they have a Covid-19 protocol in place in case they are allowed to physically open, but not many parents might opt for the plan. “We have all the resources for online learning and over the past few months, our students have been able to cope up with the new normal. While we do have the preparedness to reopen, we have doubts about parents sending their children to school, as there is still a lot of anxiety about the virus. We have not taken their views as it makes sense to do so only after permissions are given to reopen physically,” said Rohan Bhat, chairperson, The Children’s Academy Group of Schools, which has schools in Kandivli and Malad. Some schools said they are still exploring the possibility of calling some students only for exams and practicals. “For the higher grades – Class 9 and Class 10 – we are hoping that students get a practice of writing an actual exam and would thus like to call them in case the authorities permit. Most of our parents are ready to send their children for this purpose,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle. The school has also prepared its campus by ensuring regular sanitisation, putting up information banners on rules with respect to social distancing on each floor. Fr Francis Swamy, principal of St Mary’s School (ICSE), Mazagaon, said that while the institute is planning to continue its learning modules online, it is exploring the idea of calling students for select interactions if authorities permit. “Children are cooped inside their homes for a long time now and we want them to come and interact with the teachers and with each other and do some activities together with due precautions,” he added. The scenario is different at government-run and aided schools, which are awaiting guidelines from the local authorities to start offline classes. Many schools said that while online learning was interesting in the beginning, it is slowly losing its charm as teachers are not able to gauge how much a child has understood. “As the class size is big, it becomes difficult to know if children have understood in the online mode. We are eager to start offline teaching because children, especially from Class 10, require paper-solving practice,” said Jagdish Indalkar, principal of KVK School, Ghatkopar. The school has purchased sanitisation machines and has installed hand wash stations in every washroom. The principal of a civic school in the eastern suburbs said that while the attendance is likely to be average in the initial few days, it will slowly pick up. “Parents need to get the confidence that it is safe to send their children to schools and that will only happen if we take a decision to reopen partially,” she added. Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA (parents-teachers’ association) United Forum said that while parents are gradually trying to make peace with the fact that offline schools would have to start, many who have the option of continuing online may still opt for it. “Parents, especially from low-income families, might want to send their children to schools if the institutes take adequate measures because learning is taking a hit without offline classes. A blended learning model seems to be the way to go,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-many-parents-in-mumbai-open-to-idea-of-restarting-schools-experts/story-C9GHfUDh5EEBNOuctDaNGI.html

A detailed post-mortem report is also awaited. According to the autopsy report, the victim was brutally assaulted around 2.30am and had injury marks on thighs and hips. The cause of death was stated as head injury.Khar police had placed the victim’s alleged boyfriend Shree Jodhankar, 24, and a friend, 19-year-old Diya Padankar under arrest for murder and assault on Saturday. The police said the arrests were made based on circumstantial evidence and witnesses’ statements. Trimukhe said they are probing the reason behind the murder. They have taken down the initial statements of the 12 people present at the party. But as all of them were in an inebriated state, they are yet to record the actual statements. They also found alcohol bottles from the rooftop. The police officers also suspect that those who attended the party, including the accused, had also consumed drugs. “We have taken blood samples of all the party attendees and have sent them for analysis,” added Trimukhe.Jodhankar also sustained injury marks to the back of his head and is undergoing treatment at Cooper hospital. The police said, as per the initial inquiry, it appears that Jodhankar fell during the scuffle and sustained the injury.In his statement, Jodhankar said he does not remember the incident and that he had left the building at 2.10am to meet a friend at Sion, said a crime branch source. He also told the police that Kukreja had fallen down the stairs at night during the party and was in hospital. He also said that he did not remember anything else and was unsure how he had reached Sion, said another crime branch source. Jodhankar’s bike was parked in the building throughout the night, said the source.When his friend asked Jodhankar how he had sustained injuries on head, he said he had fallen down. He also said his friend had taken him to Sion hospital, where he received first aid, added the source. Crime branch officers said those who were present at the spot revealed that Kukreja had left the rooftop of Bhagwati Heights building around 2.30am after a heated argument with her alleged boyfriend and the girl he was with. However, after allegedly killing her, Jodhankar and Padankar returned to the party, which led the others attending the party to think that Kukreja had gone home, said the police. It was not until 6am that the murder was discovered. Officers at the crime scene said a woman from the building was walking her dog when she saw blood dripping from the staircase. Following this, the police was informed about the crime.“Until then, the party was still on and the murder went unnoticed, as people used the elevators and not the stairs in the building,” said the officer.The organiser of the party revealed that Jodhankar and Padankar had a fight with Kukreja before she left the rooftop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-found-dead-in-khar-building-mumbai-police-to-probe-attempt-to-rape-angle/story-IQ8QCTL5e0wawUaUmqqetN.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena denies show of strength outside ED office following notice to Varsha Raut||The Shiv Sena has denied that it was planning a demonstration outside the Enforcement Directorate (ED) office at Ballard Pier on Tuesday. The clarification was issued after a few reports claimed that the ruling party had planned an agitation outside the office of the investigating agency, with thousands of workers scheduled to attend. The Sena has been aggressive against the ED since it sent notice against Varsha Raut, wife of its member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut, and had started mobilising its workers for the demonstration. However, the reports were dismissed by Raut. “These news are false. We will come on streets when required but not for this reason. Such acts of vengeance will be answered by legal means. Why should we fear when we have [done] nothing wrong?” tweeted Raut. The Sena leader further said that he had the support of his party’s workers, but there was no reason for such a show of strength at this moment. He underlined that he understood the anxiety of the workers. The demonstration was being planned on the lines of the one put up by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) during its chief Sharad Pawar’s scheduled appearance before ED officers in September 2019. According to a senior Sena leader, there was a strong section of the party which was against taking on the ED. “Many Sena leaders have entered into questionable financial dealings and just infuriating the ED will not serve us any purpose. It’s better to tackle this case legally instead of aggravating the situation,” said the leader, on condition of anonymity. Varsha is expected to visit the ED office on January 5, after she asked for it to be rescheduled. ED had summoned Varsha concerning the transfer of ₹50 lakh from the accounts of Pravin Raut, an accused arrested in connection with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case, which is also being probed by ED. Pravin was one of the directors in Guruashish Constructions, a subsidiary of Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL). He was arrested along with the HDIL directors for illegally availing loans from PMC Bank. Raut has been accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of running a campaign to destabilise the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-denies-show-of-strength-outside-ed-office-following-notice-to-varsha-raut/story-wvFs6cX7i4NfuQK4ZDuPYJ.html

The agency is also on the look-out for a second dealer who fled during one of the raids. According to the NCB officer, they first laid a trap at Gurunanak Marg near Bandra (West) railway station on Saturday and arrested Chand Shaikh. During his search, 400g mephedrone (MD) was found in the storage compartment of Shaikh’s two-wheeler. After questioning Shaikh, NCB got another lead, and on Sunday a team raided the Crown Business Hotel near Golden Nest Circle in Bhayander (East), where they nabbed the actor. She was with alleged drug supplier Saeed Shaikh, who managed to flee before the NCB could nab him. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed the development and said, “Contraband drugs were seized from the hotel and we are inquiring with the actress for further details.”The drugs recovered from the hotel were allegedly sourced by Saeed, a resident of Mira-Bhayander. It was learnt that he is allegedly the main supplier of MD in Mumbai and Thane, said an NCB officer. NCB has registered an offence against Shaikh and Saeed under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, while the actor is being questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-raids-across-mumbai-actor-detained-2-drug-dealers-booked/story-MbguapAZUMwC9ux6w4FmXM.html
04-01-2021||City||Bhiwandi: Attack on 2 ahead of gram panchayat elections||In two separate incidents in Bhiwandi, gram panchayat election candidates were attacked recently. Two unknown bikers opened fire on Deepak Mhatre, 48, Shiv Sena shakha chief in Kalher, Bhiwandi, early on Sunday while he was exiting his car with his wife. The Sena leader escaped the firing. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras near his house, and police are searching for the two accused. R Wani, inspector, Narpoli police station, said, “The incident occurred around midnight on Sunday. Deepak Mhatre is safe, and no one was injured in the incident. We have registered a case and our team is searching for the accused.”“I noticed that a biker was following me, but I didn’t realise that they have this intention. After we parked the car and got out, the pillion rider fired one round at us. I first tried to make sure my wife was safe. Later, I tried to throw stones at them till then they fired two more rounds before fleeing. I don’t know who these people were but only know that they have done this because of the election,” said Mhatre.In the second incident, panchayat member Bhanudas Patil, 51, and his brothers Santosh and Vinod were beaten up by 20 youngsters and are receiving treatment in hospital. Santosh is contesting in the upcoming gram panchayat election. Narpoli police are investigating both matters. The brothers were on their way to the hospital to meet their aunt on Saturday when the group of attackers beat them and threatened to shoot them for opposing their party leader. Narpoli police have registered a case but are yet to arrest the accused. In 2017, Congress corporator from Bhiwandi, Manoj Mhatre was murdered at his residence before the civic elections. Seven accused persons allegedly fired at him, and also assaulted him with a sharp weapon on February 16. The conspiracy was allegedly planned by Mhatre’s cousin Prashant Mhatre who was later arrested by police along with the other accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-attack-on-2-ahead-of-gram-panchayat-elections/story-OIMtELIGkNksqHcw9Pa1bI.html

The water cut will be in effect from 10am on January 5 to 10am on January 6.According to BMC, except for a few areas in the eastern suburbs, all areas in south Mumbai and western suburbs will be impacted due to the water cut.The water cut is being undertaken due to repairs of the chlorine injection points at Yewai in the water supply network, which supplies drinking water from Vaitarna lake. The BMC said all areas in the city except Mulund, Dadar East, Parel and Matunga will remain unaffected due to the planned water cut.This is the fourth time that the BMC has undertaken water cuts in the last few months. A civic body official said, “There are several activities that are being undertaken to ensure the drinking water quality in the city does not get affected.”The BMC has appealed to citizens to cooperate with the civic body and to ensure sufficient water due to the planned water cuts.The civic body supplies around 3,750 million litres of water daily, against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres. Meanwhile, the seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems, the Vaitarna system supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-face-15-water-cut-on-january-5-and-6/story-UR7JZMbin5gxa4NqROhXLM.html

These will be replaced by high-resolution IP cameras, which don’t require a recording device. Divisional railway manager Gurinder Mohan Singh had earlier said that they plan to have a system of 80-100 cameras to cover the railway station premises.For the safety of women, lady coaches of mainline electric multiple unit (MEMU) trains will have emergency talk back (ETB) system. “In case of emergency, passengers can press the ETB button in a coach to directly speak to the driver and guard. Multiple such buttons will be placed in lady coaches,” said station superintendent Anil Aggarwal.To illuminate the coaches of Chandigarh Shatabdi (train number 12045/46) better, LED lights will be used. Besides, the Ambala railways division also plans to install three elevators at the Mohali railway station.“Tenders have yet to be floated. If there are no delays, the projects should be complete by December 2021,” Aggarwal said.The Rs 136-crore makeover project for the Chandigarh railway station has already been delayed by a year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Along with beautification, the project aims to bring an “air concourse”, on the lines of airport terminals at all six platforms, and subways to segregate passenger flow. While this was earlier set to be finished by December 2021, the deadline has been moved to December 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/advanced-cctvs-emergency-talk-back-systems-at-chandigarh-railway-station-by-2021-end/story-USMfNleqnousevZAhCbAkK.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: 5,500 fliers from Europe and Middle East spared quarantine, says Mumbai civic body data||Almost two weeks after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) started screening passengers arriving from Europe, Middle East and South Africa for new Covid-19 variant, over 11,000 passengers have arrived of which around 50% passengers were exempted the mandatory hotel quarantine, considering they had further travel plans or resided in other states. Some were exempted owing to emergency travel, states the BMC data.The civic body started quarantining incoming passengers from many countries from December 23, as a precautionary measure to detect a new variant of Covid-19 that was first reported in the United Kingdom (UK).According to BMC’s data, over 11,000 passengers have arrived from Europe and the Middle East between December 23 and January 1, of which over 5,500 passengers were allowed to leave Mumbai as they were from other states, had future travel plans or were given exemption due to emergency.A BMC official said, “We are regularly testing passengers on completion of the seventh day, and positive samples are sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for further investigations. However, not a single passenger is tested for the new strain of Covid-19 yet. We are going to continue testing until further guidelines on the same from the state or central government.”As per BMC’s protocol, every passenger has to be kept at mandatory quarantine facilities and undergo a Covid-19 test on the seventh day. Further, the passengers are hospitalised if they are tested positive. If they are tested negative, the passengers are allowed home quarantine for seven days.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, last week, said, “We are quarantining and testing incoming passengers from Europe and the Middle East, and have not found any case of the new strain. Around 50-70% of the total incoming passengers daily, are not from Mumbai, hence there is no question of any load on the civic body.” Meanwhile, starting last week, the BMC also opened up its jumbo Covid-19 centre in Byculla for those passengers who cannot afford to quarantine at hotels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-5-500-fliers-from-europe-and-middle-east-spared-quarantine-says-mumbai-civic-body-data/story-yMDOHypLHmrKn0CskoK7CI.html
04-01-2021||Noida||Noida traffic police issued 4.96 lakh fines last year, recovered ₹3.43 crore||Noida: The Gautam Buddha Nagar traffic police issued almost five lakh fines last year worth almost ₹18 crore of which ₹3.43 crores have been deposited by violators. This is in contrast to the figures from 2019, during which the traffic police had issued almost double the number of fines – 9.07 lakh – while the amount they totalled was lesser – ₹11.04 crore – but revenue collection through the fines was more – ₹5.51 crore.The reason behind the uneven figures, according to Noida traffic inspector Ashutosh Singh, is that last year the government had revised penalties for traffic violations, which is why the total compounding fee was higher in 2020 as compared to 2019’s figures.The annual data provided by the district traffic department shows that at over 1.3 lakh, the number of people riding motorcycles without helmets tops the list, followed by 1.2 lakh unauthorised parking penalties, over 72,000 wrong side driving cases, 37,000 cases of driving without seatbelt, more than 22,000 fines for jumping traffic signals, over 16,000 pollution check violations and over 14,000 cases of driving without drivers’ license. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Gutam Buddha Nagar, said: “Officials also issued fines for speeding, tripling on motorcycles, using phones while driving, black film (on car windows), rash driving, insurance, hooter/siren, and drunken driving.”Singh said that the traffic police department issued fines throughout the year. “In January, the traffic police issued 55,424 fines for different violations. From February onwards, the number of fines decreased due to the outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. In February, March and April, we issued 27,245, 19,823, and 11,581 fines, respectively, as people had restricted their movements due to the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown,” he said. However, from May onwards, vehicular movement increased and so did the penalties. In May, June and July, traffic officials issued 19,402, 56,434, and 60,180 fines, respectively, 48,488, 51,491 and 49,806 fines were issued in August, September and October, respectively. In November, 56,540 penalties were issued and in December, 39,663 penalties were issued.Saha said that the traffic police department organises awareness programmes to sensitise people to follow traffic rules. “We have also started appointing traffic volunteers in different sectors and societies to ensure they help enforce traffic rules in their neighbourhood,” Saha said. According to Singh, this year more CCTV cameras will be installed on Noida roads, which will facilitate automatic issuance of fines for speeding and other violations. “These cameras will be networked and connected to the traffic control and command centre in Sector 94. The violators will be issued fines. They can pay these off at the traffic police’s office, online or at the court,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-traffic-police-issued-4-96-lakh-fines-last-year-recovered-3-43-crore/story-4fZ7qgj8aZiHiwg0fz2bmK.html
04-01-2021||City||UP govt plans ‘new Noida’ on 20,000 hectares||NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government has asked the Noida authority to work out a plan to develop a new Noida area on 20,000 hectares of land. Noida’s boundaries will expand till Bulandshahr, which is an adjoining district, and the city will double its size for which 20,000 hectares will be acquired, officials of the Noida authority said. The move is aimed at creating more opportunities for industries in Noida, where no more land is left for industrial purposes, said the officials. This 20,000 hectares of land is located between Greater Noida and Bulandshahr, and was notified (earmarked for development) by the UP State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) about 10 years ago, they said. However, UPSIDA, a public sector undertaking of the Uttar Pradesh government spearheading the development of industrial infrastructure in the state, could not develop the notified area because it is already occupied in other industrial zones located elsewhere in the state, the authority officials said.“Since the industrial development is almost saturated in Noida with hardly any land left to be allotted for industrial use, the Noida authority can carry out the development on this land once the UP government finishes required formalities on this,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer, Noida authority.The UP government is likely to finalise the ‘model of development’ for the new area in the next four to six months and hand over the land to the Noida authority if all goes well, said the authority officials. The government had started the process for developing a new Noida area two months ago.The state government is yet to decide the exact area of land to be earmarked for industrial, residential, mixed-land use and commercial, among other purposes.At present, Noida is spread on 20,000 hectares of land surrounded by Yamuna and Hindon rivers. It has around 16,000 hectares of urbanization area, of which 47% is for residential development, 13% industrial usage and rest of the area is developed for other usages that include commercial, institutional, and green purposes. It has left with at least 250 hectares of land, which is earmarked for the industrial usage but yet to be acquired from the farmers, the officials said.“We have investors who want to buy the land and set up business. But land is an issue because against our target of 500 acres, we could only acquire 125 acres in last one year. The problem is that the land is located at different patches and has legal issues. If we get a chance, the authority can develop and meet the demand for the industrial land in this region,” said Maheshwari.Realtors and industrial unit owners have welcomed the move.“Noida is a brand and if expanded, then it will attract investors naturally,” said Surendra Nahta, president of micro, small, medium enterprise (MSME) association, GB Nagar.RK Arora, president of National Real Estate Development Council in UP, said, “If the Noida authority developes land for the industrial use, it will create jobs and fuel the local economy. It will positively impact the real estate sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-plans-new-noida-on-20-000-hectares/story-8iWpLx3nVis6YAhtI9eulK.html

Among others, co-morbidities like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, bronchitis and asthma were found.” He added that it was found that the first four-five days after having been infected with the Sars-Cov-2 are the most critical for Covid-19 patients. “During this time, the virus infects the lungs and other parts of the body. That’s why health officials have been asked to track cases as early as possible,” Dr Ohri said. The CMO added that male patients account for nearly 76% of the total deaths in the district. “So far, only 22 female patients in the district have lost their lives due to Covid-19. Also, only 20 out of the 90 Covid-19 deaths were from rural areas. This indicates that either the rate of spread of virus is exceptionally high in urban areas, or that the people living in rural areas have better immunity,” he said. The audit also revealed that out of the 90 fatalities, as many as 57 patients, (nearly 64% of the tally) belonged to the age group of over 60 years. “None of the patients, between the age group of 0 to 20 years, succumbed to the virus. However, among those 57 deaths in patients above 60 years of age, as many as 48 had co-morbidities,” the death audit said. Among the 13 Covid-dedicated healthcare facilities in the district from where deaths have been reported, while Sharda hospital reported 31 deaths, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) reported 25 deaths. “As many as seven deaths were reported from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College in Meerut, while the remaining 34 deaths were reported from other hospitals,” the CMO said. When contacted, Ajit Kumar, joint registrar of Sharda University Medical College, said that the turnout of Covid-19 infected patients has gone down significantly in the recent past as the general public has become more aware about maintaining safety and sanitisation. “We have certainly crossed the alarming stage. Even our doctors and paramedics are no more afraid of the treatment of infected patients, realising that it’s not an incorrigible disease. The number of daily new cases reported in our hospital has also come down to three-four now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/90-covid-victims-in-noida-had-comorbidities-reveals-death-audit/story-IRIk2r6AeRpIRmj3k1FWpO.html
04-01-2021||City||NGO helps marginalised women in Noida villages overcome poverty using awareness||NOIDA: Thirty-nine years old Ameena, who belongs to the economically weaker section of society, is certain about one thing that she will get ₹1,000 monthly as pension once she crosses 60 years. Ameena, a tailor who lives at Morna village in Noida, is not alone. There are at least 50 in her cluster who have got included in different pension and life insurance schemes of the government. This could become possible due to a campaign by a group of professionals from different backgrounds that includes IITians, lecturers and housewives, among others. They formed a not-for-profit organisation -- ‘myloktantrafoundation’ -- in August last year after they found out that many women belonging to the EWS category were ‘unaware’ of the financial schemes that can change their lives. The outfit, which has now more than 20 volunteers, started educating such marginalized women about the different government schemes to empower them economically.“We were not aware of the schemes. But now we are happy to get a pension scheme,” said Ameena.Similarly, Malina’s family has opted for PM Jivan Jyoti Beema Yojna at an annual premium of ₹330. “I started working as a maid in 2015. But I managed to open a bank account last month and got a life insurance done at ₹1 per day with help of the volunteers,” said Malina, who resides in Noida. Since August, the organisation has managed to help 700 people via 15 camps that they organized in slums of Noida’s sectors 10, 15, 16, Nithari, and Morna, among other areas. The organisation that was started by four people -- Vimlesh Gangwar, a retired lecturer, Usha Dubey, a housewife, Abha Dubey, an associate professor, and Smita Singh, additional commissioner of income tax, has now grown into a bigger force with volunteers in more than a dozen sectors to help the needy. While Vimlesh, Usha, and Smita are residents of Noida, Abha is from Indirapuram in Ghaziabad.“Our job is of providing the right information about government schemes to such women that can give them financial security and secure their lives after they cross 60 years. During my work at a Covid support group desk, I realized how vulnerable these people are due to lack of information about schemes. So we formed this group to help them,” said Smita.The group, which aims to cover all slums and villages in Noida by 2025, organizes camps on Saturdays and Sundays in places, where it finds the needy.“Most of the domestic helps cannot even open their accounts with the banks due lack of documents. We have partnered with banks and got accounts opened of those who do not have one,” said Abha Dubey, associate professor at MMH College, Ghaziabad.The group members spend money from own pockets to organize camps and educate them about the importance of Aadhar and bank account, and inform them about small savings scheme, Sukanya scheme and schemes on life cover.Now, Anand Gupta, an IITian who also runs a school for slum children in Sector 16, has come forward to help the cause. “The good thing with this campaign is that it talks about the financial inclusion of those people who cannot get benefit of these schemes because they do not have an address as most of them live in slums,” said Gupta, an IIT-Kanpur passout and a management consultant.The group now plans to set up camps at housing societies to cover more maids. “For example, there are at least 200 maids in our society and most of them do not have Aadhar, or any life cover or saving plan. This campaign is for them,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngo-helps-marginalised-women-in-noida-villages-overcome-poverty-using-awareness/story-WeFrpCTxNjGMpqMI2YWUMK.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees three Covid-19 deaths, a first since March||The city on Sunday recorded three deaths – lowest in the past nine months – due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 11,135. At 0.5%, the city also saw the lowest case fatality rate (CFR) for a day so far. Mumbai’s cumulative CFR is presently 3.7%. On Saturday, Mumbai reported seven Covid deaths and on Friday, Mumbai reported nine deaths. On March 30, Mumbai recorded one death due to Covid-19. The first Covid death in the city was reported on March 17, while the first covid case in Mumbai was reported on March 11. By the end of March, the city had reported a total of seven deaths due to Covid-19. By April 3, Mumbai reported 18 more deaths, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in charge of the civic body’s public health department, said, “Sunday’s number of deaths is the lowest deaths due to Covid-19 reported in the city since March. The civic body’s interventions, such as Mission Save Lives, a studied strategy launched by BMC on June 30, have worked.” On June 30, Mumbai’s CFR was 5.8%. According to the data from the state government, subject to further reconciliation, Mumbai reported 109 deaths in April, 984 in May, 3,237 in June, 1,722 in July, 1,260 in August, 1,236 in September, 1,281 in October, 566 in November, and 223 in December. Mumbai on Sunday reported 581 Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of cases in the city to 2,95,241. There are 8,916 active Covid-19 cases in the city. The recovery rate in Mumbai is 93%, and the overall growth rate is 0.21%. The doubling rate of Covid cases in the city is now 356 days. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a city- based public health expert, said, “The interventions by the civic body and the state have helped reduce the case fatality rate in the city. Increased awareness among citizens regarding seeking timely medical help in case they develop symptoms, the extra care taken by co-morbid patients have also contributed to reducing the number of Covid deaths in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-three-covid-19-deaths-a-first-since-march/story-8o9PL4jHHVSB0wnWTpi3HM.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||Marginally better air in Delhi, AQI in ‘very poor’ zone||Rain and strong winds helped improve Delhi’s air quality marginally on Sunday. The air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 354 in “very poor” category, a marginal improvement from Saturday’s AQI of 443 in “severe” category. Scientists said that the air quality was likely to improve further on Monday and remain in “moderate” or “poor” category till January 9.“The air quality is improving, but at a very slow pace because of high moisture levels. Pollution particles tend to become heavy and cling together when moisture levels are high. But we are expecting further improvement by tonight. More rain is expected and winds are likely to be strong for a week. So air quality is not likely to deteriorate significantly till January 9,” said VK Soni, scientist at India Meteorological Department’s air quality division.An AQI of 201 to 300 is considered poor while an AQI of 301 to 400 is considered very poor and can cause respiratory illness in people on prolonged exposure.According to the air quality early warning system of ministry of earth sciences, the winds are likely to be coming from east-southeast direction of Delhi with a speed 10-18 kmph on Monday. There is likely to be light to moderate rain and thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (20-30 kmph) and possibility of hailstorm at isolated places. The ventilation index is likely to be 5000 m2/s on January 4. The wind speed on Sunday was around 15 to 20kmph.The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse pollutants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Faridabad, Hisar, Noida, Narnaul, Meerut and Moradabad also recorded “very poor” category air even after the rains while Lucknow’s AQI was in severe category on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-improves-slightly-slips-into-very-poor-category/story-yYDXrvOgE4U4HLZcd8aX8H.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||DCGI nod for Covid-19 vaccines: Doctors give thumbs-up, but flag minor issues||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday approved two Covid-19 vaccines for restricted emergency use in India. Doctors across the country have given a thumbs up to the decision, but have also flagged ‘minor issues’ that need to be addressed in the long run. In the state, over 19 lakh people have been infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, since its outbreak in March 2020. Almost 50,000 have succumbed to the virus and over 80% of them are above 50 years of age. Scientists around the globe have been racing not only to find a cure, but also a vaccine to stop the chain of reaction. Finally, after days of waiting, DCGI, apex drug-regulating body, on Sunday approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ‘Covishield’ and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use in India. But fear and anxiety among public clouds the landmark day in medical history. “How can I trust the efficiency of the vaccine? It generally takes 10-12 years to produce a vaccine. Whereas, this vaccine which hasn’t even cleared the third trial, gets approval. We might be a mere guinea pig in their experimentation,” said Shruthi Mishra, 27, an architect and resident of Borivli. Vaccine is the only hope To answer this question, Dr Rajesh Mishra, general secretary at Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, said new advanced technology has helped shorten the time process of identification of the virus and production of its vaccine. “In 2009, when the swine flu pandemic started, within six-seven months, the vaccine was produced. Now, after 11 years of it, why is it so surprising that we have been able to produce a vaccine within a year? We are yet to get a few answers about the longevity of the vaccine, but at present, at least, it will help to stop the chain of reaction,” he said.Dr Anthony Fauci, the top United States (US) infectious disease expert, told The Associated Press, “The speed is a reflection of years of work that went before...That’s what the public has to understand.”To fight with any pandemic, it is essential to attain mass immunity as also called herd immunity to stop the spread of the virus through a chain reaction. “This can be done through two ways- natural herd immunity, where a substantial part of the society contracts the virus and develops immunity. But this can lead to a large number of deaths of the infected patients. Secondly, it can be achieved through vaccination. At present, it is our only hope to bring back life to normal,” said Dr Dhruva Chaudhry, head of the department, pulmonary and critical care medicine, University of Health Sciences Rohtak and Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19.Another important thing that has been highlighted by doctors is that Covishield is a vector-based vaccine and the chance of acquiring Covid-19 is zero. “The Covishield vaccine has been produced by taking a part of a viral vector-borne disease to produce antibodies in our body. Also, Covaxin is an inactivated intramuscular vaccine where the inactivated (killed) version of Sars-CoV-2 is injected to produce antibodies. Thus, the beneficiaries cannot get infected with Covid-19 from the vaccine,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants (AMC). Dr Baid who was also part of the dry run trial at the civic-run Rajawadi Hospital on Saturday said, “These vaccines are logistically more viable as it doesn’t require -70-degree Celsius refrigerators for preservation.”Citizens are also questioning the need for two dosages. Experts opine that the first dosage just induces the antibodies. While the second dosage, boost the antibodies.‘No severe side effects’In August, during the first phase of the trial, an adverse effect of the vaccine was reported. A patient was hospitalised after receiving a dose of the Covaxin. The issue was reported to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation-Drug Controller General of India (CDSCO-DCGI), within 24 hours of its occurrence. “The adverse event was investigated thoroughly and determined as not vaccine-related,” the spokesperson of Bharat Biotech said in a statement.On September 6, AstraZeneca which is developing a Covid-19 vaccine—Covishield along with the University of Oxford, temporarily had to halt the phase 3 trials around the globe, after a participant reportedly developed severe adverse reactions. Later, the company resumed clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine candidate after confirmation from the regulatory authorities that it was safe to do so.Doctors sharing their personal experiences said they haven’t witnessed any severe reaction among volunteers. “Several of my doctor friends in the US and UK have taken the two dosages but none has witnessed any serious adverse effect. It would have been impossible to hide such incidences from media and drug regulating bodies,” said Dr Mishra.Dr Chaudhry sharing a recent incident stated that one of the professors from his university took part in the clinical trial. Following which, she complained of uneasiness and discomfort. “She had a 99’F fever with body ache. But with paracetamol, she recovered within a day,” he said. “So, people may develop a few reactions, but its severity will be extremely minor,” he added.“The vaccines have been certified 100% safe, however, some side effects like mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine, so do not worry and get your vaccine shot,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospitals, Mumbai, and member of state’s Covid-19 task force.Doctors flag minor issuesHowever, doctors demand a few questions be answered which are still unknown to the medical fraternity. For instance, the questions include how long the vaccine remains effective, whether already infected patients need to take the vaccine, how many doses a patient with the history of infection needs to take, how it will work on children, pregnant women and immune-compromised patients.“We still need clarity on how long the vaccine-induced immunity will last in our bodies. Also, it is unclear if a beneficiary can be a carrier after some months of the vaccination,” said Dr Mishra.There is also a confusion among the public and doctors if people with a history of Covid-19 infection, need to take the dosages. Citing an example, Dr Chaudhry said that he (53-year-old) contracted the infection in July. It has been five months since the infection. Now, he is puzzled if he needs to get vaccinated. “Even if I get vaccinated, I am not sure if I should also get the second shot,” he said.Also, there is no clarity if immune-compromised patients can undertake the vaccine. “We have to optimise the vaccine for such patients. The dosages have to be defined as per their need,” said Dr Chaudhry.Dr Pandit said those with compromised immune systems need to first take approval from their doctors before they take the vaccine shot. “As of now, no data is available for vaccination of children and pregnant patients; an advisory in the UK suggested that pregnant patients can take the vaccine only if they are at a high risk of contracting the disease and that it should be taken as late in pregnancy as they can,” he said.Doctors also emphasized on conducting long-term research and epidemiological studies to understand its sustainability. Dr Chaudhry which calls this as an ‘urban phenomenon’ states that already overcrowded slums like Dharavi have developed antibodies among over 60% of the population. “So, we need epidemiological studies to decide if we need to include urban or slums into the list of priority for vaccination,” he added. In the third phase of Covaxin, 30% of the volunteers have been selected with above 50 years of age, he said.Senior state health officials said that to earn the trust of the public, the manufacturers need to bring more transparency. “We know that Covishield has 70% efficiency rate, which is fine, as no vaccine can provide 100% protection against any virus. But we still don’t know about the efficiency rate of Covaxin. We are still unaware if we can vaccinate health workers with severe comorbidities. These things need to be cleared so that we can also convince people to come forward for vaccination. It is a voluntary process and we can’t force anyone to get vaccinated,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dgci-nod-for-covid-19-vaccines-doctors-give-thumbs-up-but-flag-minor-issues/story-QX7BIVL1P0eTaqqHOQIxIM.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||Stop registration of rum, whisky brands cheaper than Rs 140, suggests Delhi govt panel||A committee set up by the Delhi government to help augment excise revenue, check malpractices and transform nature of liquor trade in the Capital, has recommended that the state government discontinue the registration of new rum and whiskey brands below priced ₹140 for a 750ml bottle in order to ensure “better quality options”.“With regard to registration and the eligibility of the brands registered in Delhi it has been observed that the existing licensing fee regime has not been revised since long. One of the mandates of the committee is to transform the nature of liquor trade commensurate to the changing stature of the national capital. The consumer in Delhi needs to be provided with better quality options across different price segments,” said the report.It further said, “This would require facilitating registration of not only niche low-selling high-value brands in the national capital but also protecting the consumer at entry segment from denial of his choice by way of brand pushing or pushing of brands with negligible national presence. Therefore, the committee is of the view that economy brands of whiskey and rum with MRP up to Rs 140 should be discontinued.”The report does not mention what should happen to whiskey and rum brands that are already in the market and are priced below ₹140. Brands, however, need to renew their registration on a yearly basis. The report has been uploaded on the excise department’s website and currently open for feedback from the public and industry stakeholders till January 21. Once the feedback process is closed, the committee will help the government drafting Delhi’s 2021-22 excise policy, which the Delhi cabinet will then consider for approval. The committee also made recommendations aimed at bringing a shift from hard liquor like whisky and rum to soft liquor such as beer and wine. In the report, which HT has seen, it has asked for restructuring of duties on soft liquor brands to ensure a drop in their maximum retail price (MRP).The committee has also recommended that bars in Delhi be allowed to stay open till 3am, serve liquor on rooftops and terraces, allowed to serve full bottles on the table, the legal drinking age be brought down to 21 years, number of dry days be reduced to three a year and that liquor stores be distributed more equitably across the city.The committee has also recommended that the Delhi government take full charge of wholesale trade of liquor and minimise its presence in retail trade.Delhi has around 720 liquor stores and around 800 hotels, restaurants and bars with licenses.Once the feedback process is closed, the committee will help the government drafting Delhi’s 2021-22 excise policy, which the Delhi cabinet will then consider for approval.The committee was set up in September by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the finance and excise portfolios, to augment Delhi’s excise revenue, simplifying liquor pricing mechanism, checking malpractices, ensuring equitable access, and helping the government in its ease-of-doing-business policy.Delhi’s estimated excise revenue for 2021-22 is ₹7,651 crore — up from the previous three-year average of ₹5,068.7 crore, said an official in the finance department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stop-registration-of-rum-whisky-brands-cheaper-than-140-suggest-delhi-govt-panel/story-GiX3E8qnb0qypsQJ5xj6CI.html

Ikram lived with his wife and children and worked at a private water treatment plant. Ikram, investigators said, had a business rivalry with his neighbour Arif.On Friday afternoon, Ikram and his son Mohsin were riding a motorcycle and were headed towards Bhajanpura for some work when they received a phone call.“Ikram got off his motorcycle to take the call. His son walked to a nearby restaurant to buy snacks. When Mohsin returned to his father, he found two men pointing their guns at him,” said another police officer.Before Mohsin could react, one of them allegedly shot Ikram. “The shooting immediately alerted the locals who managed to catch hold of one of the shooters, identified as Shadab. Shadab, while trying to escape from the crowd, fired another shot whose pellets hit a passerby in his face. He was eventually overpowered,” said the officer.Shadab was later handed over to the police and Ikram rushed to a hospital, where he was declared brought dead.The police have registered a murder case at Bhajanpura police station and are searching for Arif.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-shoot-man-dead-in-front-of-his-son-in-bhajanpura-over-business-rivalry/story-MZjafBE6rNvgysGnpAo4JO.html
04-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad roof collapse: Victim families demand strict action||Families of the victims of a roof collapse in Muradnagar in Ghaziabad district have demanded stern action against the contractor, alleging that there were lapses in the construction, leading to the incident that left at least 24 dead. “The incident was likely due to the poor quality of construction, because the entire roof came down in one go,” said Udham Singh, one of the survivors. Like him, other families also demanded strict action. “I lost my father, who was a daily wage worker and the only earning member in the family. The incident was a result of shoddy construction and should be investigated. We demand strict action against the contractor and officials,” said Pawan Kumar. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in a video statement on Sunday said he has directed the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police to take up relief and rescue work and ensure the injured are given the best treatment. “A report has been sought in connection with the incident. I have even told district officials to send a report to the state administration so that the causes of the incident come to light and accountability can be fixed,” Adityanath added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey confirmed that there were 24 deaths in the incident. The Ghaziabad police on late Sunday night registered an FIR under the Indian Penal Code’s sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 (causing hurt to any person by doing any act rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (causing damages) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant etc) of IPC. “The FIR names the contractor, executive officer of Muradnagar Nagar Palika, a junior engineer, a supervisor and several other unidentified officials and persons,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Officials of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika, who asked not to be named, said the construction cost around ₹55 lakh, the contract for which was awarded to one Ajay Tyagi. Of this amount, around ₹40 lakh has been paid so far. Tyagi could not be reached despite repeated attempts to reach him. The officials added that the work order was issued on February 4 last year. The work order mentioned that work was to be completed within 60 days, but was put on hold due to the nationwide lockdown. “Construction of the shed and quality control checks were pending. The quality checks were to be taken up by the appropriate agency. The tender was awarded after due procedure and the contractor is based in the city,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-roof-collapse-work-of-shelter-remained-pending-despite-completion-time-of-60-days-victim-families-demand-strict-action/story-iXMUuYOoerIEIfeE60KodN.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||BJP campaigns to demand MCD funds, AAP hits back||Delhi BJP on Sunday held a public awareness campaign on the funds it claimed the Delhi government owed the three municipal corporations, demanding immediate release of Rs13,000 crore.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) rubbished the BJP campaign, saying the figure of Rs 13,000 crore is “imaginary”. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta along with MPs and other senior leaders held a protest and distributed pamphlets informing people about how the corporations are unable to pay salaries and pension to its employees.Gupta said, “We want to tell people of Delhi that the government is not releasing the pending dues to the corporations. This has made the life of the corporation employees difficult. Delhi’s sanitation system, mid-day meal for school children, pension of retired employees, salaries of doctors, pension of elderly and widows, maintenance of parks are affected, but CM Kejriwal is doing nothing to address these problems.”In December last year, the mayors of the three municipal corporations had sat on an indefinite protest outside Delhi chief minister’s residence. They had to call it off following a Delhi high court order. The BJP had then said that it will continue the protest in a different way.Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that this protest was part of the BJP’s continuous campaign to demand MCD dues from the government. “The corporations have been facing financial problems and the government has turned a blind eye to their demands. On Sunday, our leaders and party workers protested at the booth level and will now be going from door-to-door to distribute pamphlets to inform people how the government owes the corporations Rs 13,000 crore.”Khurana said that the party aims to connect with 50 lakh people during its campaign.The AAP said the BJP is spreading lies. “Due to the rampant corruption in the BJP-ruled corporations in the last 15 years, they have no other way of hiding their failures than spreading a lie regarding the AAP government. The claim that the AAP govt owes an imaginary Rs 13,000 to the corporations is a mere drama by the BJP. Citizens of Delhi gave BJP the responsibility of the MCD so they were supposed to take care of the sanitation of Delhi; they did not perform their duties but made MCD a den of corruption. AAP has run the Delhi government efficiently and if the citizens of Delhi give us the responsibility, we will do the same in the municipal corporations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-campaigns-to-demand-mcd-funds-aap-hits-back/story-YjZIP0ULyyqA63ahMldACJ.html

At the primary units, which will store the vaccine in large quantities, paramilitary forces and Delhi police personnel will secure the premises. The security audit of the other places is on to ensure that there are no law-and-order problems.”The reports of the security audit, which has already started, will be shared with the district deputy commissioners of police for necessary action. The number of police teams at each store will depend on the findings of the audit. At places there are CCTVs which are non-functional. Some other places are poorly lit. Police have mentioned all such shortcomings and are working with government agencies to fix them. All such security loopholes will be fixed in a week, the first police officer said. Read more| Healthcare, frontline workers to be vaccinated in first phase in Delhi: Satyendar Jain as Centre approves 2 vaccinesA second police officer, who did not wish to be named, compared the security of the primary storage centres to that of polling booths or centres where ballot boxes are kept. “Outside the main centres, local police will ensure that there is no traffic congestion or crowding. There will be barricades and CCTV cameras will monitor all the main gates. The happenings inside the main centres will be relayed to the control room in real-time. In smaller centres, it is important to ensure that only registered people come for the vaccination drive. In congested colonies, it is possible that unregistered local residents visit the centre and ask authorities to give them the vaccine shots first. At such specified locations, a quick reaction team will be present,” the second officer said. Police have also drafted a detailed transportation plan for the safety of the vaccine. Special commissioner of police (operations) Muktesh Chander said vans from the Police Control Room will escort and tail the vehicle in which the vaccine is transported. “We are yet to be intimated about the day when the vaccines will arrive. It can come by train, by road or by air. But the security protocol will stay the same. PCR vans will escort and tail it. The traffic police on the road will also create a traffic-free corridor. The local police will guard the storage centres round-the-clock. This drill will be followed even when the vaccine is transferred from the primary to the local ones.” Read more| Delhi govt to vaccinate all residents free of cost, says health minister Satyendar JainOutlining the Capital’s plan for the first phase of the vaccine roll-out, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said last week that the government had identified 5.1 million people who will be the first to get Covid-19 shots under the Central government’s “priority category”. The chief minister said that registration is currently underway for people identified in three priority categories – health care workers, front line workers and at-risk population – and an SMS will be sent to a person’s mobile number notifying them about the date, time and place of vaccination.Following the chief minister’s announcement, the 80,000 strong Delhi police had started a registration drive and begun updating the phone number of all members of the force. Special commissioner Chander, said that police have also given details of the date of birth of each police officer. “It is an automatic process, in which those above 50 will be the first to get the vaccine shots. Apart from that we also sought information from police personnel who are below 50 years in age but have co-morbidities,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/paramilitary-armed-delhi-police-men-to-guard-all-vaccine-storage-sites-in-delhi/story-6C409d4BSAsukzAg51DtbK.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi prepared to start vaccinations, says health minister Jain||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said that the Capital is “fully prepared” to start vaccinating its masses, a day after the Drug Controller General of India granted approval to the Covid-19 vaccines of the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. “Delhi is fully prepared to start vaccinations. In the first phase, it will be administered to health care and front line workers. Delhi has around 300,000 health care and 600,000 front line workers. After that we will administer the shots to people aged above 50 years and those with co-morbidities,” said Jain.The city government had earlier estimated the number of people who would be administered vaccines in priority at 5.1 million – of which the number of people aged over 50 years and those with co-morbidities was pegged at 4.2 million.“The dry run was successful. It shows that Delhi is ready for vaccination. We have planned for 1,000 vaccine centres. While we will start with 500 of them, the numbers will be scaled up to 1,000 in phases. Now that the approval has been given, we hope that the vaccine will be available in a week’s time,” said Jain.Each centre is supposed to administer 100 vaccine shots a day under the current plan.After the dry-run on Saturday, Jain had said that not only health care and front line workers — as announced by the Central government — but all residents of the city, who are eligible, will get the Covid-19 vaccines for free.Jain’s announcement was slightly different from the one made by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who said the Covid shots will be free for the most prioritised beneficiaries —one crore health care and two crore front line workers in the first phase.Both Jain and Vardhan inspected Saturday’s dry-run at separate centres in Delhi. Three locations were chosen for the exercise – a private hospital, a government hospital and a government clinic.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College, who also leads a committee helping the Delhi government with the preparations for Covid-19 vaccination, said: “Delhi is ready for vaccination drive. The dry run has taught us that we have to concentrate our efforts on three specific areas – managing crowd at the vaccine centres, verification of those registered for the vaccine and monitoring patients for 30 minutes after the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-prepared-to-start-vaccinations-says-health-minister-jain/story-eQUTVNjxl1ogYzprznXPhN.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||AAP accuses BJP of graft in waste segregation||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday again accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) of corruption and irregularities worth “crores” in the process of waste segregation involved in work related to road construction.The BJP, however, was quick to dismiss the allegations as “baseless”.“The BJP-led MCDs has indulged in corruption in the waste segregation process. They pay Rs 1,450 in excess for every tonne to private contractors for segregation of waste concerning work related to road construction. When tenders were floated, the work was evaluated at Rs 1,800 per tonne. However, the MCDs are paying the private contractors Rs 3,250 per tonne. They did not follow any due process in arriving at this figure. It has been flagged in an audit report,” said the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.He added, “The scam is worth crores. The matter should be thoroughly investigated. The BJP leaders clearly have a role in this corruption. Action must be taken against them. If they claim that they are yet to see the audit report, I shall send it to them.”The BJP’s Delhi unit spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Mr Pathak has a habit of flaunting the possession of irrelevant papers. His allegations, as usual, are baseless. Waste segregation with regard to road construction works were taken over by government companies long ago. In the last many years, none of the MCDs have made any payment for segregation of waste related to road construction works.”Earlier, the AAP had accused the MCDs of Rs 2500 crore scam. The Delhi government has also ordered an inquiry into the allegations. The Delhi BJP has denied the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-accuses-bjp-of-graft-in-waste-segregation/story-oTbjPzSrwKTlhle1ewSkvO.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||65 nabbed from Rohini for serving, consuming hookah||At least 65 people —including customers, owners and staff — of a cafe and a restaurant in outer Delhi’s Rohini were arrested between Friday and Saturday after the Delhi Police launched a crack down on two premises for allegedly serving hookah, illegally. PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) said that while one of the premises was a cafe in Prashant Vihar, the other was a restaurant. “Both the premises did not have licence to serve hookah and the gathering was in violation of Covid-19 guidelines,” said Mishra.

A total of 27 people — 22 customers, four employees and the owner —were arrested from there for either consuming or serving hookah. The second raid happened at a restaurant in Rohini Sector 8 on Saturday and 38 people were arrested. These included 29 adult and three minors. Six staff members and the owner of the restaurant were also among those arrested. The DCP said that this premise also didn’t have a licence for serving hookah and Covid-19 guidelines were being violated. The police have booked the arrested people for disobeying an order passed by a public servant and under the Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/65-nabbed-from-rohini-for-serving-consuming-hookah/story-ey5HiZ5BWenGq231h5JnVI.html
04-01-2021||Delhi||North MCD demolishes temple in Chandni Chowk||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation demolished a temple in Chandni Chowk early on Sunday morning on the directions of the Delhi high court, sparking a political blame game between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Aam Aadmi Party. The temple, located on the road which is being redesigned only for pedestrians only as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan, was declared “illegal” by the high court and the order for its removal was passed in 2015. While the BJP, which rules the north MCD, blamed the AAP for not making attempts to save the temple; the AAP said the demolition has exposed the real face of the BJP. The AAP on Sunday also held a protest against the BJP. A senior north corporation official, who wished not to be named, said, “The temple was demolished to avoid contempt of court. We just followed the court order.”A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the matter.Work on the the long-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, which visualises a decongested and pedestrianised heritage market along the 1.5-km road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, had begun in 2018. A special body, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), had been set up to execute the project. A senior north corporation official said the planners had noted several encroachments on the road, including the temple. In 2015, while taking stock of the progress of the redevelopment plan, the high court had directed the North MCD and the Delhi government to remove all encroaching structures, including the temple. The Delhi government’s religious committee had recommended to the architects to include the temple in the redevelopment plan. The government, in November 2019, petitioned the high court to modify its directions regarding the removal of religious structures. However, the court, overruling the stand of the religious committee of the Delhi government, ordered the removal the unauthorised temple. The order was challenged by the Delhi government in Supreme Court, which disposed it of after the government said it would move “a suitable application before the high court for further directions, as may be warranted”.In November 2020, the high court refused to entertain a plea by the Shri Manokamna Siddh Shri Hanuman Seva Samiti, saying that any request to intervene must come from the AAP government itself.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash alleged that the demolition was carried out “under pressure” from Delhi government “We have written several times to the SRDC not to tamper with the religious places in Chandni Chowk and include them in the redevelopment work and beautify them. Through a letter on August 8, 2019, the Delhi government directed the corporation to remove the encroachment in shape of temple in Chandni Chowk. From 2019, till now we have taken careful decision in this regard and did not demolish the temple but a hearing in this connection was scheduled on January 12 and the officials had to submit a report to the court so they took the action on court directions,” he said.AAP’s Durgesh Pathak, however, said in an affidavit before the high court, the north MCD had expressed its willingness to abandon the temple. Pathak said, “The BJP-ruled MCD, in its affidavit, had clearly expressed its willingness to abandon the Hanuman temple and last night it completed whatever it had stated. Now, the BJP is telling a lie before the media. If it is not true, why is the BJP silent even though such a huge incident has taken place? Why has there been no protest by any BJP leader on this incident so far?”AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that it is a matter of great regret that the north civic body has demolished the Hanuman temple in the Chandni Chowk.“Lord Rama will never forgive the BJP people. The BJP-ruled MCD sought the protection of the police in the darkness of night and demolished the Hanuman temple when it was raining late at night and people were sleeping in their homes. The BJP should respond to the people of the country, what was the hurry to demolish Hanuman temple? The misdeeds of the BJP will not hide in the darkness of the night,” Bharadwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-mcd-demolishes-temple-in-chandni-chowk/story-GMAd01udDTXsLL0nGLrUYJ.html
04-01-2021||Pune||Metro trial run from PCMC to Phugewadi successful||Pune Metro successfully conducted a six kilometre trial run between Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to Phugewadi. It is a priority stretch of Pune Metro and services are expected to start commercial operation on this stretch soon. Last year, Pune Metro completed a successful trial run on the same route in one kilometre stretch from PCMC to Sant Tukaramnagar station. According to Pune Metro officials, Covid-19 had disrupted the work for six to seven months. Nevertheless, this important stage was passed by the Metro on Sunday. Pune Metro completed 45 per cent of work. Metro has sped up the work in PCMC to Swargate reach-1 and Swargate to Ramwadi reach-2 via duct, station and underground routes work is in progress in these two reaches. On Sunday, the metro departed from PCMC station at 1.30 pm and it reached Phugewadi station at 2.00 pm. DD Mishra, executive director, Ravi Kumar, chief project engineer and metro officials Sandeep Sakale, Shriram Manjhi, Raja Raman and Ravi Tata were present. Chetan Phadke operated the train. The test was successfully completed by observing the safety of the railway track. This is an important step of the Pune Metro to complete work within the deadline. For the trial run, the Metro used three coaches. Dr Brijesh Dixit, managing director Mahametro said, “It is the success of hard work. Due to support of all Punekars, it has happened.” Hemant Sonwane, general manager of Pune Metro said, “This is the first time we have conducted a trial run of Metro train on a 6-kilometre stretch. Earlier, it was only one kilometre trial run from PCMC to Sant Tukaramnagar. PCMC to Phugewadi is our priority stretch which we want to start on a commercial basis as soon as possible.” Pune Metro has applied to Pune Metro Research Design Standardization (RDSO) commissioner of metro railway safety and railway board to seek permission. This test is one of the crucial parts to get permission from the agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/6-km-metro-trial-run-from-pcmc-to-phugewadi-successful/story-mkmakOK8I11chowhy3McKI.html
04-01-2021||Kolkata||Eyes on Bengal polls, Owaisi seeks help from anti-TMC leader Abbas Siddiqui||Making his first significant move to emerge as a threat to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the assembly polls due in West Bengal a few months, Asaduddin Owaisi, leader of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) on Sunday met a popular young Muslim leader, who, in recent months, has emerged as the most vocal critic of the ruling party. On a tour of the state for a day, Owaisi drove down to Hooghly district in the morning to meet Abbasuddin Siddiqui, the young scion of the Siddiqui family which is the custodian of the famous Furfura Sharif shrine, one of the most popular places of pilgrimage in Bengal. After a two-hour meeting, Owaisi said Siddiqui will decide how the AIMIM will contest the polls while he will stay behind the young leader. Though Siddiqui kept his cards close to his chest, saying he will announce his next move later, the news of the meeting triggered reaction among Muslim leaders and TMC ministers. They alleged that Owaisi’s sole intention is to split Muslim votes and help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which has set the target of winning more than 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats. Also read: Won’t go back till laws are repealed, say farmers before 7th round of talksAbbas Siddiqui, in recent months, has accused the TMC of not doing enough for the minority community and using it as a vote bank instead. Significantly, other members of the Siddiqui family, especially Toha Siddiqui, the most prominent among the elders and whose support helped the CPI(M) and TMC in the past, maintained silence on Owaisi’s visit. But Toha Siddiqui made it clear that he will not support any move that will help the BJP. “Hindus comprise 70 per cent of the state’s population. If they wanted to, the BJP could have come to power long ago. We will not do anything to let our Hindu brothers down,” he said. Furfura Sharif is built around the mausoleum of Pir Abu Bakr Siddiqui. It also has a mosque built in 1375. Furfura Sharif draws millions from across the country during the Urs festival and the annual fair dedicated to the Pir. “The AIMIM will stand behind Abbas Siddiqui. We will work with him and strengthen his cause. I have decided to leave all decisions to Siddiqui. I am confident that our performance will be comparable to what we achieved in Bihar. Only the minority vote is not our target. We want to fight for tribal people and other backward classes as well. If anyone can stop the BJP, it is Siddiqui,” Owaisi told the media after the meeting. Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01 per cent during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30 per cent now. The Muslim population is concentrated mainly in Murshidabad (66.28 per cent), Malda (51.27 per cent), North Dinajpur (49.92 per cent), South 24 Parganas (35.57 per cent), and Birbhum (37.06 per cent) districts. In Darjeeling, Purulia, and Bankura, where the BJP won Lok Sabha seats last year, Muslims account for less than 10 per cent of the population. Most of the new branches of the AIMIM are located in Murshidabad, Malda and North Dinajpur, while Siddiqui’s followers are spread across southern Bengal. Swing in Muslim votes can influence poll results in more than 100 seats, according to surveys by the BJP and election strategist Prashant Kishor’s I-Pac. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee roped in Kishore for the 2021 poll preparations after the BJP won 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Also read: ‘Tourist politician’ - Uttarakhand minister’s dig at Manish SisodiaSiddiqullah Chowdhury, a minister in the TMC government and leader of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the most prominent Muslim organisation in Bengal, told HT that Owaisi has no place in the state’s politics. “AIMIM does not belong to Bengal. These are tactics to create divisions among Muslims but it will not work. Moreover, where was Abbas Siddiqui when thousands of Muslims were killed in political skirmishes during the Left rule? I am sure the other members of the Siddiqui family will not support Abbas,” said Chowdhury. Urban development minister Firhad Hakim said, “Neither Siddiqui nor AIMIM can rule Bengal. They can only help the BJP. We saw it happen in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.” Talking to reporters on the sidelines of a rally, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “Owaisi can go to any party or contest polls anywhere. The BJP is not concerned. The TMC is worried because it treats the Muslim vote bank as its property. If the TMC really worked for the welfare of Muslims why should it be worried?” Owaisi reiterated that he or his party have nothing to do with the BJP. “AIMIM did not contest the Lok Sabha polls and yet the BJP won 18 seats. How did that happen? Mamata Banerjee cannot even manage her own party. Her MLAs and MPs are joining the BJP every day. Our aim is to stop the BJP,” said Owaisi. In the Muslim-dominated Murshidabad district, Manoj Chakraborty, the three-time Congress legislator from Berhampore said, “Owaisi is an agent of the BJP. His only job is to split Muslim votes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/eyes-on-bengal-polls-owaisi-seeks-help-from-anti-tmc-leader-abbas-siddiqui/story-gI03fwrvtwQtsVQCX7pKGL.html
04-01-2021||Pune||Pune civic body admits gaps in Swargate-Katraj BRTS||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has admitted that India’s first pilot Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) corridor between Katraj-Swargate had several lacunae as a result of which civic body had to revamp it.The report prepared by PMC road department following instructions from standing committee stated that pilot BRTS project was 6.2 kilometre in 2006-07 and it was designed in the middle of road and the bus stops were designed at the one side of the BRTS. It started functioning in 2008 though it faced multiple hurdles, often forcing the civic body to suspend PMPML service here.The eight-page report, a copy of which is with HT, was submitted on Tuesday and lists out various repair work carried out on the stretch.According to the new design, the position of BRTS bus stops changed and it was placed in the middle of the road. There are ten bus stops in the stretch from Swargate to Katraj. Earlier, there was a lane for private vehicles along with service lane near Katraj. Now, it has been completely revamped and there is the addition of another lane in the mixed traffic lane. Footpath and cycle track has been shifted to the corner of the road. Earlier, it was adjacent to the BRTS route, according to the report.Hemant Rasne, chief, standing committee chief said, “Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had given instructions to restart a BRTS from January 1. However, due to some reason, it has not been restarted. On the other hand, the road department has tabled a report to the standing committee which we will discuss soon.”After Mohol announced about starting of bus rapid transit corridor (BRTS) corridor from Katraj and Swargate on Satara road from January 1, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) submitted a letter to PMC to put in place basic passenger safety facilities before reopening the route. The letter stated if these things are completed then only the bus service will be started on this route.Amar Shinde, executive engineer, road department, who is handling BRTS work, said, “We have completed all necessary work to start BRTS on Swargate-Katraj route. We have also written letters and conducted meetings with PMPML officials about starting the route.”Satish Gavane, traffic superintendent, PMPML, said, “It will take some time to make the route operational as the corporation has not fit automatic doors to BRTS bus stops, but, it will start soon.”Aba Bagul, Congress leader, said, “Mere visit and announcement of restarting BRTS is not enough. The work of Swargate-Katraj BRTS has not been completed. It is too early to reopen the stretch for public transport buses.”Qaneez Sukhrani, secretary, Nagrik Chetan Manch, said, “PMC has not executed a BRTS, but a mixed transport system and pulled funds on the wrong pretext. Now, it will have to further waste expenditure on BRTS which is a risk to the public as it is a failure in the city since it is not compliant with BRTS global concepts and features.”The report further states that in the pilot project, there was no provision of the stormwater drain, drainage lines, electrical cables and utility services. Over the period, the corporation laid down the stormwater drain, drainage and electrical cables, street lights along with new water pipelines. The corporation has spent Rs 6.5 crore for utility services.In the pilot project, the corporation had spent Rs 127.48 crore in 2006-2007. After that, PMC spent Rs 85 crore for revamping the entire stretch with changing cycle track, footpath, winding mix lane, and placing the bus stop at the middle of BRTS lane.Reason for delayed of workRestructuring of water pipelines, drainage lines, electrical cables, street lights, removal of encroachment of Dhankawadi-Balajinagar structure for footpath and cycle track has delayed the process of revamping Swargate-Katraj road and BRTS stretch.According to the report, flyovers, underpasses and right-hand door buses of BRTS have created obstacles to complete work within deadline.Deadlines missedMay 31, 2018; August 1, 2018;December 2018; March 2019; May 2020; January 1, 2021||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-admits-lacunae-in-swargate-katraj-brts/story-ouGAWLpUjco0JSQ748wXZJ.html
04-01-2021||Pune||50mn doses ready as DCGI approves Serum’s Covishield||Pune-based Serum India Institute’s (SII) gamble to start producing vaccine shots at its Manjri-based facility eight months before when the efficacy of Covishield vaccine was not established,has finally paid off as they got the approval from Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday. Minutes after DCGI issued a statement, approving Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use, SII said it is ready to roll out the vaccines in India. Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of SII, tweeted, “Happy new year, everyone! All the risks Serum institute took with stockpiling the vaccine, have finally paid off. Covishield, India’s first Covid-19 vaccine is approved, safe, effective and ready to roll-out in the coming weeks.” Director DCGI VG Somani said on Sunday, “The subject expert committee of central DCGI met on January 1 and 2 and made recommendations based on the proposal for approval of restricted use in emergency situations of Serum institute’s Covishield vaccine. It has approved the use with adequate safety and restricted used in emergency situation. The committee included experts from various medical fields.” As of date, the institute has over 50 million doses ready and the vaccine manufacturer has set a target of producing 500 million doses by July 2021. In his earlier interaction with media, Poonawalla had stated that most proportion of the vaccine would be set aside for the Indian market, as per the institute’s deal with Melinda Gates foundation, which has also invested in the project, the vaccine would also be supplied to the Covax countries, including African nations. Umesh Shaligram, director of research and development at SII, at a webinar on Thursday however claimed that the vaccine producer has stockpile of 75 million doses. It was in early May when Pune-headquartered SII received an original vaccine seed from the UK and started production of Covishield, the Oxford-developed vaccine which was yet to get even preliminary approvals by Indian and UK authorities. To produce vaccine at a mass level considering the urgency of its requirement, SII expanded its capacity at its Manjri plant in Pune. According to SII, the manufacturer has assembly lines to crank out 500 doses per minute. This even as India was yet to face the first severe wave of Covid-19. This huge risk has now reaped huge benefits for the institute as DCGI approved the vaccine on Sunday. The emergency use authorisation will now allow the vaccine to be administered on a mass scale. When the institute had begun the mass production with its own investment and had called it a huge risk as the vaccine candidate was yet to get any approval even from the government in the UK where the vaccine was being produced, Poonawalla said, “it’s a gamble, he is willing to play” . The institute had invested about a $100 million in this project.Over the eight months, the vaccine production went on smoothly even as it met with a controversy when a volunteer from Chennai alleged that he faced neurological damage due to the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/50-million-doses-ready-as-dcgi-approves-serum-institute-s-covishield/story-WqBYY1VOKEwMUrvbDhdOEI.html
04-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Wall of Humanity’ set up to help needy in Kalyan||In an initiative to provide clothes and essentials to the needy, a wall in Kalyan’s civic garden, Rani Lakshmi Bai Park at Karnik Road, Kalyan, has been transformed into a Wall of Humanity where residents can simply donate wearable cloths, toys or any other items that the needy can pick them conveniently and take away.This idea of the Wall of Humanity was supported by the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) when Sachin Raut, 28, founder of the NGO Helping Hands approached the civic commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi to help provide a wall in KDMC vicinity.Raut said, “I saw a similar wall at Karjat that served as an inspiration for a similar wall in my own city. I approached the civic commissioner who immediately gave a go ahead. The wall was inaugurated on January 1.”Around 12 racks have been fitted to the wall where one can leave the clothes or toys or any other items that they want to donate. Since the last two days, around 25 individuals including children have visited the wall and taken away donated clothes.“People have donated toys that I will be putting in a dedicated drum so that children can pick them easily and take away. Our members keep checking the wall and look after its maintenance so that it is not misused. Along with the security guard of the garden, we ensure that the donated items are not taken by thieves or miscreants,” added Raut.The NGO that works for the betterment of underprivileged by providing education, donating clothes and cycles for tribal children since the last three years have 40 members.The racks fitted to the wall are made of waste furniture items. In future, the NGO also has plans to take up more such walls in the city.“We have also checked two other walls in Wayale Nagar and Yogidham to provide the same facility. I am sure a lot of people will be benefited by this,” added Raut.The NGO has approached the nearby shops and residents to donate. In the coming days, they will also keep a suggestion box at the wall so that people can suggest changes or other requirements to make this initiative better.Milind Gaikwad, deputy engineer, waste management department, KDMC, said, “We liked the idea when the civic commissioner asked us to implement it. It actually motivated us to come together for each other’s help, especially when we all are fighting a pandemic. We will come up with more such walls in the future. The NGO has agreed to maintain the wall and also reach out to people. We are also trying to spread awareness among more people.”People can donate at:Rani Laxmi Bai Udyan, Karnik Road, Syndicate, Kalyan (W)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wall-of-humanity-set-up-to-help-needy-in-kalyan/story-y7WWcaabbUk0xSZMtxEpHJ.html
