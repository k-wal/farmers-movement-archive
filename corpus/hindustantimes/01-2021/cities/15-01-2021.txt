With the health department unable to receive the link to send messages to registered individuals, officials at vaccination centres were forced to call individual beneficiaries and provide the requisite information."Due to some technical glitches, the server of the Co-Win application has slowed down, Thus, we aren’t able to send the message to registered beneficiaries. Following which, we have created a WhatsApp group where all beneficiaries of respective districts have been added and we are sending a message to those groups informing them about the vaccination centres and timing," said Dilip Patil, state immunisation officer.Also read: 'Seek approval before initiating action against poll officials' - EC tells statesThis raised concern among the in-charge of the vaccination centres. “We have got the application but we haven’t got the link yet.

15-01-2021||Noida||Noida tops the chart as the most polluted city in country||Noida was the most polluted city in the country on Friday as the poor ventilation led by unfavourable weather spiked the pollution levels over seven times higher the safe limits. The city’s air, along with that of neighbouring Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, had turned severe on Thursday; again aided by calm wind and high local emissions. On Friday, Greater Noida was the third most polluted city in terms of air quality index (AQI) while Ghaziabad was the fourth most polluted. According to the weather analyst, meteorological conditions are expected to remain unfavourable for the next two days at least, which will reflect on the cities’ deteriorating air quality as particle pollutants will remain trapped in the air due to lower temperatures and foggy conditions. “The wind speed on Friday dropped further with peak speed reaching only 5 kmph. The weather condition may get even more harsh by Saturday, with mercury set to fall again. This would lead poor and unsupportive conditions for dispersion that may further increase the pollution levels,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). He added that the weather conditions may improve by January 18 when the wind directions would change and temperature would increase. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Friday was 475 –highest in the country – against 412 on Thursday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 464 against 410 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 458 against 429 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The major pollutant or PM2.5 in the region also spiked to over seven times the standards. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Friday 425.37 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 321.39 µg/m³ on Thursday µg/m³. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 402.37 µg/m³ against 277.97µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 427.67 µg/m³ against 322.58µg/m³ a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m³. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate further with region seeing year’s first prolonged extreme air pollution event. “Surface winds are calm and the minimum temperature is likely to fall further. The AQI is forecasted to deteriorate further and rapidly. SAFAR forecast reveals that AQI will continue to be in the severe category with increasing magnitude for 16-17 January. This is likely to be the first prolonged extreme air pollution event of 2021. Marginal improvement is expected only by 18th January but within the lower end of Severe to higher end of Very Poor. Relief is expected only thereafter which will be updated tomorrow,” said SAFAR on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-tops-the-chart-as-the-most-polluted-city-in-country-101610735022157.html

The police have registered an FIR at Link Road police station in this regard. The suspects were identified as Rahat Ali, Rajendra Kumar, Raees Ahmad, Mohammad Javed, Arif Ali, Mohammad Afzaal and Shan Mohammad, who are residents of Ghaziabad, Meerut and Hapur districts. They were booked under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) and 482 (using a false property mark) of IPC. “They had been operating the buses for the past couple of months and got private 52-seater buses painted in the red and white scheme. They also painted monogram and slogans of the UPSRTC. With this, their buses looked similar to UPSRTC buses. The suspects were operating them from outside the Kaushambi metro station and charged between ₹30-100 for a trip to Meerut. They did not issue any tickets and packed buses to capacity despite the Covid-19 pandemic,” said AK Singh, regional manager (RM) of UPSRTC.Three buses have been seized so far. Whether the suspects ran more such buses is being investigated.Officials said that operators of UPSRTC buses, due to the pandemic, do not allow passengers more than the 52-seating capacity while private buses ferry as many passengers as their can, flouting Covid-19 protocols.The RM said that a trip to Meerut in a UPSRTC bus costs about ₹60 and it is estimated that each of the three private buses seized by the police minted about ₹10,000 per day. On an average day, a UPSRTC bus makes about ₹1,000 a day. The fleet makes about 80 trips. Each private bus allegedly run by the suspects made four-five trips a day, said officials.“Their general modus operandi was to ferry as many passengers as they could and charge them ambiguous amounts of money in the name of fare to Meerut. They revealed that on days when there was rush, they would charge more from passengers. They operated these buses up to the bus stand in Meerut before returning to Ghaziabad. Their operations also led to loss of revenue to government buses,” he added. Traffic officials said that those arrested were allegedly bus owners, drivers and conductors, and that more such raids will be conducted in coming time.“They have been operating for the past few months, usually from near the ISBT at Kaushambi, from where they would pick up passengers. After they were arrested, an FIR was registered against them at Link Road police station. We also seized the three buses. We are planning to conduct checking operations at other locations too,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic).The registration plates of two of the buses showed Meerut numbers while the third had a Ghaziabad number. “We will check the registration details with the help of the transport department,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-fake-upsrtc-buses-seized-seven-arrested-101610735021308.html

Later, DNA sampling of the remains and blood of victim’s parents also matched,” said JP Sharma, CBI public prosecutor. He said that the prosecution produced 38 witnesses in the case.The prosecution, during final arguments in all previous cases, had demanded death penalty for Koli while terming the killings as “rarest of rare”.

The redevelopment work of the terminus is likely to start from December 2021 and is expected to be completed by 2025.RFQ is a process to shortlist and qualify applicants who will be asked to submit financial bids for the redevelopment.Firms which submitted RFQ include Adani Railways Transport, Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty, ISQ Asia Infrastructure Investments, Kalpataru Power Transmission Ltd, Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holdings Ltd, Brookfield Infrastructure Fund IV, Moribus Holdings Pte Ltd, and Keystone Realtors Pvt Ltd. After shortlisting companies under the RFQ, ISRDC will invite request for proposal (RFP), after which redevelopment of the terminus will begin. “The work on the redevelopment of the terminus will start by December 2021 or early 2022. A detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared and permissions required from the heritage committee will be sought. Initially, the work will be done on the outstation train side of the terminus and later on the suburban section,” said SK Lohia, managing director, IRSDC.CSMT will be redeveloped through the public private partnership (PPP) model. The redevelopment plan will involve construction of commercial spaces including restaurants and cafes along with vehicular parking for passengers inside the terminus.Segregation of outstation and local train passenger movements with the help of interconnecting decks has also been planned. Shifting of harbour railway platforms to P’D Mello entrance of the terminus will be undertaken as part of the redevelopment. ISRDC has also planned for the construction of an underpass for passengers near the present pre-paid taxi stand near the divisional railway manager’s (DRM) office at CSMT. This will be done by dismantling railway buildings that comprise the main reservation office and railway offices adjacent to DRM office. Additional holding area for passengers will be created at the P D’Mello Road entrance along with the current main entrance for the outstation terminus.The body will also be undertaking redevelopment work at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Kalyan, Andheri, Dadar, Borivli, Bandra Terminus and Thakurli railway stations in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-csmt-redevelopment-10-firms-show-interest-work-likely-to-start-in-december-2021-101610734843125.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||Ahead of boards, private schools to call students for practical sessions||Private schools in the city have started calling students of board classes (classes 10 and 12) for practical sessions and revision, following clarity on the timeline of board exams. While some schools started practical sessions this week, other schools will be calling students in small batches for classes from next week. Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank had earlier announced that CBSE board examinations for classes 10 and 12 will be conducted between May 4, 2021 and June 10, 2021. The practical examination will begin on March 1 and the results will be announced by July 15, 2021. Following the announcement, schools had said that they would initiate practical sessions from January. Schools across the country were closed in March last year amid the outbreak of Covid-19. Voluntary visits to schools for doubt-clearing sessions were initiated by the Haryana government in September ast year followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. While most government schools saw students turning up for these sessions, private schools had largely continued with online classes. In November, the Haryana government decided to shut schools till November 30 amid a spike in Covid-19 cases among students of government schools. Government schools reopened from December 14 for students of classes 10 and 12 and from December 21 for classes 9 and 11. Delhi Public School, Sector 45, initiated practical sessions for class 12 students in batches from Thursday. The school has capped the number of visiting students at 12 to meet physical distancing concerns. “We are calling students in three batches, one each during morning, midday and afternoon. The sessions are nearly for two hours. While the practical sessions take up one-and-a-half hours, the remaining time is used by students for interacting with each other. We have kept some time for interaction since students are keen on meeting their teachers and classmates,” said Aditi Misra, school principal. Salwan Public School, Sector 15, started remedial classes and practical sessions for students on Friday. Only half the students from board classes were asked to visit the school on Friday. “Today being the first day, around half the students visited the school for sessions. We are expecting the strength to go up from Monday,” said Rashmi Malik school principal. She said that the requirement of a medical certificate was acting as a deterrent to an extent. “While we have our own indemnity bond and seek consent from parents, we are also seeking a medical fitness certificate as sought by the government. More students are likely to join after getting the health clearance,” said Malik. The school has capped the number of students in a single classroom at 15 in view of physical distancing norms. Students of different classes are only allowed in the lab in turns to avoid crowding. “We called two sections of class 10 today. These students were accommodated in four different classrooms so that there is ample physical distancing among students,” said Malik. She said that the school would monitor the feedback it receives from parents to these classes before taking a decision on calling students of class 9 and 11 for physical classroom sessions. “Today was only the first day. We will monitor the feedback next week. If everything is comfortable, we might start calling students from class 9 and 11 too since their exams are coming up,” said Malik. Nidhi Kapoor, the principal of Euro International School, said that the school will be starting classes for students in classes 9 to 12 from Monday. “Classes will take place from 10am till 2pm. We have mentioned students’ roll numbers on the desks and only a select number of students will stay in a classroom,” said Kapoor. She said that besides practical sessions, revision classes for theory subjects will also take place Monday onwards. Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14, said that the school would be calling students from classes 10-12 from next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ahead-of-boards-private-schools-to-call-students-for-practical-sessions-101610734841331.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||600 Covid-19 warriors to take vaccine jab||The district will kick off its Covid-19 vaccination drive with 600 front-line health care workers, who will take the jab on Saturday as part of the nationwide vaccine launch. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to connect with the vaccine beneficiaries of Wazirabad session site, among others, through a video conference, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will connect with the health care workers of Medanta Hospital during the launch.At 10:30am after the vaccine launch by the PM, inoculation will begin at six vaccination session sites in Gurugram, said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “Appropriate arrangements have been made at all the six vaccination sites, including the government primary schools in Wazirabad, Daulatabad, Medanta Hospital in Sector 39, SGT Medical College in Chandu Budhera, urban primary health centre in Chauma and the primary health centre in Bhangrola. At each site, 100 front-line health care workers will be vaccinated.”He said that based on the requirement, vaccine doses will be supplied to the nearby cold-chain points set up at urban primary health centres. On Saturday morning, after 8:30am, required doses will reach the sites in a vaccine carrier. A single vial of Serum Institute’s Covishield vaccine has 10 doses. It will be given to all vaccination sites, except for Chauma where Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin will be provided. Each Covaxin vial has 20 doses. Only 0.5 ml will be given to a beneficiary as an intramuscular injection.“Covaxin beneficiaries will have to sign a consent form before the inoculation as per the directives issued by the Central government,” said Yadav. According to him, each site will get additional doses considering there can be 1.1% wastage of the vaccine due to breakage. The district on Thursday received over 49,150 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, comprising 44,950 doses of Covishield and 4,200 doses of Covaxin to inoculate 44, 950 healthcare workers in the next four weeks. Yadav along with deputy commissioner Yash Garg will be present at the Wazirabad session site and Medanta for the communication with the PM and CM. “At each site, preparation has been done for live telecast of the vaccine launch. At Wazirabad vaccination site, since PM is likely to interact with vaccine beneficiaries, a two-way communication system has been set up in an open area within the government school premises,” Yadav said.The vaccination will continue till 5pm where registered health care workers after verification on Co-WIN platform will get the inoculation. They will have to wait for 30 minutes in the observation area. From Friday evening many health care workers who are to be vaccinated started receiving SMS regarding date, time and location for the inoculation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/600-covid-19-warriors-to-take-vaccine-jab-101610734841785.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||City air continues to remain toxic||Air quality in the city remained in the “very poor” category of the air quality index (AQI) for the second consecutive day on Friday, with 367 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) AQI bulletin as against 364 the day prior. While the AQI in Gurugram remained better than most other major NCR cities, experts warned that the AQI is likely to be higher than official figures, given the fact that two of the city’s four air quality monitors did not reflect any pollution data on Friday. Confirming this, Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, Haryana Pollution State Control Board(HSPCB), said, “Data from two monitors, one near the Gurugram Faridabad Road and another in Sector 51, would not have been considered in Friday’s AQI. The monitors are working, but due to some connectivity issue they have did not transmit any data to the central server. I will have it checked out.” Meanwhile, air quality around the HSPCB’s monitoring station in Vikas Sadan recorded “severe” air, with an AQI reading of 420 as of 4pm, while another on the Gurugram-Faridabad Road recorded an AQI of 343 (in the very poor category), as of 4pm on Friday. “If you average these out, you get an AQI in the upper end of the very poor category. But this is not a very accurate picture. Other, privately operated monitors across the city have also recorded severe air quality,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. Data from private monitors shows that this was indeed the case. According to one monitor located in Sector 57, the level of PM2.5 on Friday touched as much as 470ug/m3 (in the upper end of the severe category), while another in Sector 24 recorded PM2.5 levels as high as 456ug/m3. Yet another privately operated monitor in Sector 43 saw PM2.5 levels as high as 436ug/m3 at 12pm on Friday.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR,”Air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in Severe category on 16.01.2021 and 17.01.2021. The slow winds and ventilation conditions are extremely unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants which will lead to deterioration in air quality.” Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in Gurugram rose considerably to settle at 9 degrees Celsius on Friday morning, up from 4.9 degrees Celsius a day prior. The maximum temperature also increased slightly, touching 19 degrees Celsius, up from 18.2degrees Celsius a day prior, according to data from the IMD’s nearest weather station in Delhi’s Palam area. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the region, shallow to moderate fog is expected to persist for another week, and may gradually dissipate as temperatures rise. The maximum temperature in Gurugram is expected to touch as much as 22 degrees Celsius in the next week, whereas the minimum is expected to hover around 10 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-air-continues-to-remain-toxic-101610734782325.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP carries out sealing drive in Sun City||The department of town and country planning(DTCP) on Friday carried out a sealing drive in Sun City after complaints were lodged with department regarding illegal constructions. DTCP officials said that two properties were sealed after it was found during inspection that rules were flouted.RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement), said that in one of the plots, the officials sealed four floors that were under construction. “In the second plot, the team found that construction was being carried out without any permission from the department. Action would be initiated against the owners and contractors under urban development rules. We will be conducting random inspections in the colony to check for such violations,” he said. The department also said that action against illegal guest houses operational in private colonies is being intensified. On Friday, the enforcement team sealed two large guest houses operational in Sushant Lok -1 after complaints were lodged by locals. The department estimates that there are around 1,500 guest houses that are still operational in the city and the department has repeatedly asked the owners to get them regularised. Bhath said that these guest houses were operating as commercial entities and hosting guests in violation of rules. “The guest houses cannot operate without getting a permission for CLU (change of land use) from the department. A new policy has already been notified for guest houses for registration. In case, the violators don’t follow rules more such sealings will be carried out,” said Bhath, adding that the drive was slowed due to lockdown caused by Covid -19 pandemic. In a related development, the state government on Thursday gave additional charge of DTP(planning) of MCG to Bhath, who also is the planning in-charge of GMDA and Municipal Corporation of Manesar. He also has the additional charge of DTP(enforcement) Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-carries-out-sealing-drive-in-sun-city-101610734782806.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||50% of Covid-19 vaccine doses to be reserved for second shot||Out of the 49,150 doses of Covid-19 vaccine — including both Covishield and Covaxin — allocated to the district, the health department will reserve 50 percent stock for the second dose until the next batch of vaccine is allocated by the Central government, said senior health officials. In the first phase, roughly 25,000 front-line healthcare workers will be vaccinated out of the total workforce of over 45,000, as both the vaccines have to be administered in two doses. Officials said that the plan is to inoculate all health workers with the first dose within the next four weeks. “The target is that by the time the first round is over, vaccine beneficiaries who got the inoculation in the first week can get the second dose on time. The current Covid-19 vaccine stock will be maintained in a manner until the next batch of vaccine arrives,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, mentioning the strategy will be applicable across all 22 districts of Haryana. The district health department has also prepared a micro plan for the vaccination drive from January 18 onwards, where every day over 4,600 health care workers will get the Covid-19 vaccine. “The inoculation will take place three times in a week — Monday, Thursday and Friday — at 46 session sites. At these sites,100 people will be vaccinated daily, who have worked in Covid-19 wards directly dealing with patients. Almost 50% of the vaccine will be reserved as per the plan is to inoculate only 25,000 front-line workers in the first phase,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer(CMO). Across Gurugram, over 44,950 health care workers have to be vaccinated, who are already registered on the Co-WIN platform. Of them, 43,070 include both private and public healthcare workers. Nearly 1,820 are those commissioned by the Central government, while 60 health workers are under the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS). Based on the count, the state health department on Wednesday allocated 44, 950 doses of Covishield and 4,200 doses of Covaxin. Yadav said that all health care workers will be inoculated in four weeks. For this, 46 vaccination sites will function in the first two weeks starting from January 18. At least 31 sites will function in third week while 28 will operate in the fourth week. “In at least 19 private hospitals, actively handling Covid-19 patients, 32 vaccination booths will be set up to inoculate front-line health care workers. Likewise, at the 14 public sites, government health care workers will get the vaccine jab,” Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said.On Friday, a district level Covid-19 task force meeting was held with the representatives of the private hospitals where the vaccination sites would be set up in the first week. At the identified sites, inoculation will start from 9 am onwards. An SMS will be sent to the beneficiary mentioning the date, time and location of vaccination. Yadav said, “At every session site, different teams of vaccination officers and vaccinators are finalised. Still, representatives from private hospitals should visit the sites where vaccination will be conducted on January 16. This would help in conducting hassle-free vaccination drive in their facilities.” He also directed the private hospitals to ensure health care workers should reach the vaccination site timely to avoid any chaos at the session site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/50-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-be-reserved-for-second-shot-101610734781846.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG to end practice of manual scavenging||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has been directed to end the practice of manual scavenging and cleaning of septic tanks on an immediate basis — a release issued by the civic body on Friday stated.The direction was issued to the MCG by Yogita Swaroop, joint secretary, ministry of social justice and empowerment, during a loan fair organised by the civic body at Rangbhoomi Theatre in Sector 29. The loan fair was organised under the Safai Mitra Challenge and Swachhta Udyami Yojana launched by the union housing and urban affairs ministry.There have been 11 fatalities due to manual scavenging or cleaning of septic tanks since 2017.Although the civic body has two robots, two super-suction machines, two jetting machines, and nearly 20 suction tankers for cleaning sewers and septic tanks across the city, the practice is often carried out by the civic body’s outsourced sanitation workers during an emergency or in the absence of such machines. Taking cognisance of this matter, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, in an internal order issued a month ago, had directed his staff to ensure that the practice of manual scavenging and cleaning of septic tanks is completely eliminated and make estimates to procure necessary machinery accordingly. “Over the last few years, the MCG has gradually phased out the practice of manual scavenging and cleaning of septic tanks. However, in a few cases, especially during emergencies, we were informed that this practice was still being used. MCG officials have now been directed to stop this practice altogether even during emergencies, and use machines instead. We are making arrangements to procure adequate machinery,” said Singh.He further said that a team has also been constituted to prepare estimates and identify the total number of machines the MCG needs for this task and, subsequently, initiate the procurement process.Singh said that the MCG is also looking to carry out awareness programs to alert residents about the harms of this practice.“Residents can alert the MCG if they spot the practice of manual scavenging or cleaning of septic tanks at any point in the city so that we can immediately send out officials to stop the activity and take action against the violators. Our main objective is to save lives,” said Singh.MCG officials also announced that under the Central government’s sanitation scheme, entrepreneurs can obtain loans ranging from ₹5 lakh to ₹15 lakh at a four percent interest for a period of 10 years to procure necessary machinery to clean tanks and sewerage lines.“Financial assistance is being provided by the Central government for arranging mechanised sanitation equipment under the Swachhta Udyami Yojana to eliminate the practice of manual scavenging. The objective of the government is to protect people and raise their standard of living. The government aims to fully mechanise 100 urban local bodies in this matter. Training will also be provided by the government to sanitation workers regarding the operation of the machines. During the training, a one-time amount of ₹1,500 stipend will also be given,” said Swaroop.Naresh Kumar Malkat, secretary for the Haryana Nagar Palika Karamchari Sangh, and a sanitation supervisor in the MCG said that the scheme should also be applicable to workers.“Besides contractors, the MCG should also ensure that the scheme allows sanitation workers to procure small machinery on loan on their own. This way, they will have machines readily available and prevent them from entering manholes or septic tanks,” said Malkat.BOX: Fatalities due to manual scavengingJune 2018: Three workers died while laying a new sewerage line in Pataudi.May 2018: A 25-year-old sanitation worker died in Sector 9 after he had entered a manhole to save two co-workers, who were facing difficulty in breathing.

15-01-2021||Mumbai||Be vigilant on institutions flouting norms, Bombay HC asks Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the government to take due cognisance of mushrooming of schools and junior colleges that do not meet eligibility criteria and infrastructural norms, and said it expected the state to keep strict vigil on such institutions and crack its whip on officials who facilitate their functioning.The court also asked the government to crack down on persons running and operating such institutions.The court said that as it found that the petition which challenged an order of the education minister allowing Rao Educational Trust to operate five junior colleges was filed with vested business interest by a rival trust, it vacated an earlier stay on the implementation of the order and dismissed the petition along with all interim applications. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, was hearing the petition filed by Manju Jaiswal, a Mumbai resident and trustee of an educational trust, seeking a stay on a December 18 order that allowed Rao Educational Trust time till academic year 2021-22 to comply with infrastructural norms for junior colleges as per the Maharashtra Self Finance School (Establishment and Regulation) Rules, 2020. The December 18 order had been passed by education minister Varsha Gaikwad wherein officials were directed to grant an index number to the trust so that 672 Class 12 students could appear for Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination. Thereafter, a provisional index number was granted to five junior colleges run by the trust at Andheri, Borivli, Sion, Kharghar and Thane. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for Jaiswal, had sought cancellation of permissions granted to coaching classes for starting junior colleges as they failed to conform with eligibility and infrastructure norms and urged the court that the state be restrained from granting permissions to any new self-financed junior colleges. In light of this, the court had on January 4 restrained the state school education department from granting final permission to the five junior colleges. Advocate SC Naidu, for Rao Educational Trust, sought dismissal of plea and submitted that the petition was filed with vested interest and students enrolled in the colleges would be deprived of appearing in ensuing examinations. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the petitioner approached the court hiding her identity as she did not disclose that she was a treasurer of a rival education trust. The bench further said that it was pained by the conduct of petitioner of not disclosing her association with the rival trust. The court also observed that the directions issued by a previous bench in January 2020 asking the state to formulate rules for renewal and approval of proposals by educational institutions was complied with after new rules were framed in October 2020. The court then referred to the interest of the students in Maharashtra and the adverse impact of mushrooming schools and junior colleges, and said it was the responsibility of the state to keep strict vigil on all such institutions which were allowed to operate in breach of statutory requirements. The bench concluded, “If indeed the state wants to honour its obligations enshrined in part IV of the Constitution, it is the need of the hour that the state crack its whip on current officers and persons responsible for operating schools or junior colleges in breach of the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/be-vigilant-on-institutions-flouting-norms-bombay-hc-asks-maharashtra-govt-101610734722650.html
15-01-2021||Gurugram||GMDA shelves plan to concretise Aravalli creeks||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has shelved its plans to concretise four Aravalli creeks lying upstream of Golf Course Road (GCR). Spillover from the creeks was identified as one of the major reasons for the unprecedented waterlogging on Golf Course Road last year. The plan to shelve the concretisation was taken at the recommendation of experts from the TERI School of Advanced Studies, who recently conducted a hydrogeological study of the area at the behest of the city-based NGO, IAmGurgaon. VS Kundu, CEO, GMDA, said, ‘We met with TERI last week and took their recommendation to retain these creeks as kachha (natural) drains. As per our detailed project report for drainage in Gurugram, which is still being executed, these channels were to be concretised as box drains. But since they are natural waterways that can aid in recharging groundwater, they will be left as is and cleaned thoroughly before the next monsoon. This will mitigate the risk of flooding on GCR.” An interim report produced by TERI in November last year recommended a range of sustainable solutions to conserve rainwater and prevent urban flooding of GCR and neighbouring localities. The measures include building recharge wells along the length of the Wazirabad bundh, establishing green corridors along existing drainage channels and reviving naturally existing catchment areas to hold run-off water during monsoon. TERI’s study, titled Blue Green Interventions for Addressing Flooding Along Golf Course Road and Neighbouring Sectors in Gurugram, was undertaken in the wake of unprecedented waterlogging in Gurugram on August 19, during which GCR was among the worst-affected areas. A central part of TERI’s study was the assessment of four drainage channels that originate in the Aravallis just above the GCR, and traverse its carriageway before draining into a water body that collects along the nearby Chakkarpur-Wazirabad bundh. The first of these natural creeks, which is also the lowest lying, runs through Sector 26, while the other three are located in sectors 42, 54 and 56. These are classified as creeks 1-4, respectively. As per the GMDA’s detailed project report for drainage, these creeks were to be concretised and covered. However, in its final report presented to the GMDA last week, researchers at TERI wrote, “It is to be noted that creating box drain drastically reduces the cross section and carrying capacity of the erstwhile channels, and also prevents groundwater recharge. This also adversely affects the natural greenery and biodiversity in the surrounding area of the channels.” Fauzia Tarannum, of the School of Regional Water Studies, TERI-SAS, said, “Leaving the drains as earthen structures is definitely a sensible step to take. Once cleaned up, they can play a significant role in mitigating flood risks and conserving rainwater in the project area. A large amount of waste and construction debris has been dumped in these creeks, and some restoration work has already begun. It will be important to ensure no further dumping of waste is allowed to take place there.” TERI’s final report also calls for increased protection of the Aravalli hills located upstream of the GCR. “Gurgaon is highly concretised. This is especially true along the GC Road, where the green belts have been sacrificed for road expansion and the projects along the GC Road have a high level of paved areas which generate higher levels of run-off,” the report states, adding that the Aravalli hills above the GCR are an important groundwater recharge area and a green zone for the city. “These should be earmarked as a forest and recharge zone where no construction is allowed, as any further construction and concretisation in the Aravallis upstream will increase the storm water run-off and increase the flood risk downstream,” researchers have noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-shelves-plan-to-concretise-aravalli-creeks-101610734723114.html

This money was meant for government departments and schemes. The Delhi government has given loans to the BJP-ruled MCDs several times in the past six years. But rampant corruption by BJP leaders have driven the MCDs to bankruptcy -- they cannot even pay their employees. The BJP should resign from the charge of the MCDs immediately,” said Atishi, AAP MLA from Kalkaji, at a press conference at the party head office in central Delhi on Friday.Employees of the three MCDs in Delhi – from teachers and doctors to horticulture staff and sanitation workers – have been on strike, on and off, for several months now, protesting against the delay/non-payment of salaries. On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said the government would give ₹938 crore to the MCDs for payment of employee salaries.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said: “The allegations by MLA Atishi are baseless. The party is misleading people by portraying as if the ₹938 crore is some sort of a “special grant”. The amount is actually less than one-third of what the Delhi government owes the three MCDs for the third quarter of 2020-21. The government owes ₹13,000 crore to the three MCDs in total.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-drove-mcds-to-bankruptcy-alleges-aap-govt-still-owes-mcds-12-000cr-counters-bjp-101610734661791.html
15-01-2021||Other||3,000 armed security personnel, private guards to keep an eye on vaccination centres||Nearly 3,000 armed security personnel along with civil defence volunteers and private security guards will form a security ring at 81 vaccination centres in Delhi, where 8,100 frontline medical warriors will receive vaccination doses on Saturday, as the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive kicks start across the country.Four to five police personnel will remain present at each vaccination centre and their prime duty will be to maintain law and order and prevent people, whose names are not there in the list, gathering and insisting on getting vaccinated, senior police officers privy to the security arrangement plan said on Friday.Apart from security personnel, deployment of patrolling vans and emergency response vehicles (ERVs) will also be done around the vaccination centres to handle any untoward or emergency situations, which the police officers believe, is unlikely because the vaccination will be done in a “staggered way”. The monitoring of the vaccination drive will be done through CCTV cameras installed at the centres, the officials said. “Those going for the vaccination have got the time when they are required to be present at the concerned vaccination centres. Since only 100 people will be vaccinated at each centre and at different times throughout the day, the chances of over-crowding is minimal. So, the prime responsibility of our personnel will be to manage the queue and assist the staffers involved in giving the doses,” said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police, central district which has nearly 40 vaccination centres under its territorial jurisdiction.Since the vaccination sites are at hospitals, police said the hospital’s private security guards will also be used apart from a security cordon being provided by the Delhi Police. In some bigger government hospitals, the staff of already existing police posts will be involved in the security arrangement. All concerned beat police staffers have been directed to carry out bike and foot patrolling in and around the vaccination centres.“Depending upon the situation and requirements, the number of police staff at the vaccination centres may be increased or decreased,” said DCP Singh.The city police have already been taking care of all the vaccine storage centres, the transportation of the vaccines from Delhi airport and further to vaccination centres. “We have round-the-clock and adequate deployment of security personnel at the storage centres,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3000-armed-security-personnel-private-guards-to-keep-an-eye-on-vaccination-centres-101610734661286.html

The crime came to light on December 31, when one Prince (identified by his first name) and his friends were caught violating mask norms by the three suspects at Talkatora Stadium.The three claimed they were working on behalf of the New Delhi SDM to prosecute violators. “The two mask violators were fined ₹4,000 and asked to pay up. Since they did not have cash, they were provided a phone number to pay through PayTM,” said Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi). The three civil defence volunteers slipped away from the spot after receiving the money. But Pankaj said he suspected the veracity of the receipt, and approached the North Avenue police station.The police registered a case of cheating and approached the SDM office for help with the phone number on which the money was received. “We were informed that the number belonged to a civil defence volunteer named Sunny. We caught Sunny and at his instance his colleagues, Yashwant Rathi and Lucky,” Singhal said. The police’s probe revealed that the trio had been misusing their position as volunteers. “They had captured the photos of the original Covid-19 challan receipt and used it to obtain coloured printouts. They then went about visiting public places to target people without masks,” Singhal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-arrested-for-forging-covid-19-penalty-receipts-pocketing-fines-101610734604387.html

The civic administration also lodged a complaint against the employee, Dinesh S Gawande, with Sahar Airport police station, following which he was arrested by the police. A civic official said, “The sub-engineer has been suspended pending enquiry. A case has been lodged against him by the civic administration. We received information that the police arrested him.” Since December 21, 2020, BMC has been institutionally quarantining international fliers from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Italy, and other European and Middle Eastern countries who land in Mumbai to detect if they are infected by the new, more transmissible Covid-19 strain, which originated in the UK. So far, 49,362 passengers have been quarantined. To facilitate this, civic employees have been stationed at the airport in three shifts. BMC suspected that there were malpractices in the process of quarantining these passengers and informed the airport administration to discreetly monitor the process. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at the airport was accordingly informed. The staff notices one civic employee and two other persons, who are not civic employees, have been taking bribes from international passengers. CISF then informed an official from BMC’s H-West ward, following which a surprise inspection was organised. BMC officials caught Gawande with some money and a fake stamp.The civic official quoted above said, “This sub-engineer also made a fake stamp to stamp the hands of passengers and send them home for quarantine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-sub-engineer-suspended-arrested-for-illegally-taking-money-exempting-international-passengers-from-quarantine-101610734603803.html

After 12 years of wait, orders have been placed by DTC to induct 1,000 low-floor AC CNG buses. All these buses will be on-road by Sept 2021. Delhi government is committed to a pollution-free Delhi by building a world-class public transport system,” Kejriwal tweeted on Friday.In another tweet he said, “With these 1,000 buses, (the) total DTC fleet (size) will increase to 4,760 and the total bus fleet of Delhi (DTC and cluster) will increase to an all-time high of 7,693. Despite several obstacles in procurement in the past years, our government has persisted and delivered.”The decision to induct 1,000 new buses in the DTC fleet was approved by the DTC board, chaired by transport minister Kailash Gehlot,on January 6.Gahlot said on Friday, “Despite many obstacles and hurdles, we have once again delivered. We have kept our promise. Expectedly, by May 2021, Delhi residents will have the first lot of these state-of-the-art buses which will be environment friendly, too, as they will be BS-VI compliant.”The tenders for the batch of 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses were first floated in 2019. The contract was signed in 2020 but there were delays because of Covid-19 and the revenue shortage that it brought about. The letter of intent was issued to the manufacturer after the board’s approval.The 1,000 new buses in the DTC fleet is part of the government’s larger plan to scale up Delhi’s existing bus fleet by 4,000 -- in DTC and the cluster network operated by concessionaires -- and also by introducing electric buses. Delhi, according to transport experts, needs at least 11,000 buses to cate to its population of nearly 20 million.In December, the DTC also issued a tender to create a real-time passenger information system (PIS), which will enable commuters to access information on bus routes, estimated time of arrival, fare, location of nearest buses which a passenger wishes to board, availability of seats and best options for interchange -- all on their mobile phones.The government has plans to have equipment fitted in the new buses to conform with the real-time PIS system, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dtc-places-order-for-1-000-new-buses-another-promise-delivered-tweets-kejriwal-101610734602341.html

Their collective fight, the women managers said, is finally drawing to a close. The 250-bed Max Smart Hospital in Saket was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 centre on May 9 and now that the Covid patients are fewer and far between, the hospital has gotten the nod to restart non-Covid services in 102 beds. The hospital will start inoculating its staff members at one of the three sites on its premises on Saturday. “With the hospital ready to vaccinate its staff and open its doors to non-Covid patients, it feels like Covid-19 is finally coming to an end. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. There were three phases in our fight against the infection. First, was in January, when we had first set up a screening centre; as the disease was not even in India people wondered what we were doing. Second, was when hospitals started getting overwhelmed with the number of Covid patients and people started following all precautions. And, the third, is this,” said Bindu Sharma, assistant general manager, Saket Max Smart Hospital. Nursing head Manju Devi said this was the beginning of the end of all struggles -- of staying away from loved ones; living in fear of contracting the deadly virus; of dealing with the loneliness felt by patients admitted to the Covid wards who could not speak to their family members. The team, led by medical superintendent Dr Sahar Qureshi, however, managed to save countless lives and will now be among the first ones in India to receive the vaccine shots. Her sentiments were echoed by Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. “It is like a long-awaited festival for us,” he said. Staff and technicians at Lok Nayak hospital worked till late evening on Friday to ensure that the vaccination drive on Saturday goes without a hitch. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will flag off the vaccination drive from the hospital at 12 noon. A doctor, a nurse, and a safai karmachari will receive the jabs in the presence of the CM, according to sources. Two large halls have been created in the middle of the out-paient seating space for the inoculation drive. Alternate seats on the blue coloured sofas have been crossed out using white medical tape to ensure social distancing between recipients. Another of at least three vaccination sites at the hospital has been set up on the first floor of the outpatient department. Two rooms with oxygen support and all emergency medications have been created at the site itself for managing any adverse event. The vaccines reached the hospital on Friday afternoon and were stored in deep freezers on the fifth floor of the same building, doctors said. “We are fully prepared for the vaccination drive and all our staff are very excited. They have been treating the very sick Covid-19 patients since last March,” said Dr Kumar. At Safdarjung Hospital, red arrows from the Ring Road gate marked the way to the vaccination site on the first floor of the old emergency building. The three room site was abuzz with activity on Friday afternoon. Across the road, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will flag off the drive at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. India’s is one of the largest vaccination drives in the world and will immunise 300 million people across the country by August. Prime Minister will flag off the massive exercise through virtual conferencing at 10.30am on Saturday, when 81 sites in Delhi will start immunising their health care workers. Each centre aims to immunise 100 persons. The immunisation drives will happen on four days a week till everyone under the booth is covered; the booth will be reopened after 28 days to administer the second shot of the vaccine. There are around 300,000 health care workers – doctors, nurses, paramedics, safai karmacharis, security guards, and administrative staff of the health care facilities – who will be immunised in the first phase. This will be followed by an estimated 600,000 front-line workers (police, paramilitary staff etc), and 4.2 million people above the age of 50 years. Delhi has currently received 274,000 doses of the vaccine, which will cover less than half of the health-care workers. More vials are en route, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/city-hospitals-in-mood-for-celebrations-on-eve-of-vaccine-rollout-101610734601247.html

Firefighters, however, managed to rescue six others, who were stuck on the terrace, in the second incident.In the first blaze, the fore department received a call for help at 10.50pm and were informed that a fire had started at a furniture shop. But when the firefighters reached the scene, they found that the fire was at a scrap godown, constructed over a 100 square yard plot, and the building had three shanties above it, where people working in the godown lived, said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services. “Although we reached the spot within minutes of receiving the call, residents of nearby shanties were busy trying to control the blaze and had rescued most occupants from the shanties above. But we were told that a drunk man and a boy were still trapped inside. One local man even entered the burning building to rescue the trapped people, but ended up getting trapped himself,” said Mohit Kumar, station officer of Shankar Road fire station. The blaze raged on due to the presence of a large quantity of plastic and foam in the godown, Kumar said. The impact of the blaze was such that the roof of the godown collapsed in the midst of the firefighting operation. Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west), said when the fire was doused and a search for survivors began, two charred bodies were found inside. “One was of a man in his 20s and the other was of a boy. They remain unidentified,” the DCP said.The authorities continued the search for survivors and found another body in a drain. The DCP said it was of the local man, Rohit (20), who worked as a driver. “It appears that Rohit got trapped in the blaze and ended up falling into the drain, adjacent to the godown,” Purohit said. He said the godown belonged to a 50-year-old man, Tony Mahto. “We have registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder at the Kirti Nagar police station. Mahto is absconding and we are searching for him,” the DCP said, adding that the trigger appeared to be an electrical short-circuit. In the second incident, reported from a six-storey building in north Delhi’s Rohini just hours later, a 42-year-old woman and a firefighter were injured.Garg said the call about the blaze was received at 5.35am Friday and four fire tenders were rushed to spot. Garg said the blaze began on the ground floor which is used to store and pack goods for an e-commerce platform.Paras Kumar, the fire officer who led the operation, said the six-storey building in Rohini’s Sector 6 was constructed on a 32 square yard plot. “When the fire began on the ground floor and spread to the first floor, the occupants of the building ran to the balcony to escape the flames,” Paras Kumar said. The firefighters struggled to break open the locked doors of the building and by the time they could control the blaze, the flames had already consumed the ground and first floors. “We accessed the terrace where the occupants were trapped and rescued them through the two balconies of an adjacent building,” Paras Kumar said. A woman received burns to her limbs and a firefighter, Sunil, sustained injuries to his leg while trying to break into the building. The police are probing how the blaze started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-dead-two-hurt-in-two-separate-fire-incidents-101610734421268.html

So far, the infection has been found in ducks and crows in Delhi, but no other bird.All wholesalers and retailers could sell poultry on Friday, and they could get live birds and packaged chicken from outside Delhi too. There were no restrictions on restaurants serving chicken too.Traders, however, expressed concerns over declined demand, with a large section of people apparently avoiding consumption of chicken in the light of the avian influenza, cases of which has been confirmed in at least 10 states across the country so far. They also fear that a prolonged decline in demand will bring down the price of both raw and packaged chicken – a trend that Delhi has witnessed in earlier instances of bird flu in 2006 and 2016.Delhi’s daily demand is around 350,000 live birds a day. Most of the supply arrives from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh – both currently impacted by the outbreak.“The demand for chicken and eggs will witness decline. It happens each time there is a bird flu scare. Even though live birds that arrive at the authorised wholesale markers are medically examined on departure and arrival, there is fear among people. The decline often brings down prices. However, we are thankful to the administration that they have removed all restrictions on trade immediately after report came negative on samples taken from poultry birds,” said Iqbal Qureshi, a poultry trader and vice-chairperson of the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur.Siddhant Wangdi, CEO at Meatigo.com, said: “Though raw chicken sales went down 10% over the past few days, other products such as pork, mutton and ready to eat products have substituted the lost chicken sales. All our products are sourced through a network of private farms, where not a single case has been reported in the past 30 days. So our chicken has always been and will always be safe. We would like to urge everyone to check the source of the chicken before buying it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghazipur-poultry-market-reopens-even-as-bird-flu-scare-looms-101610734361256.html

The suspects main intention, police spokespersons claimed, was to install malware in these phones and installed banned software in them.The two Chinese women, Chaohong Deng Daoyong, 27, and Wu Jiazhi, 54, were arrested from Lajpat Nagar.“The suspects would use a malicious app to make phone users knowingly or unknowingly ‘follow’ social media accounts. This could be used later to manipulate and influence Indian users,” said Roy, adding that tens of millions of Indians had downloaded these “malicious” apps and there were at least 40,000 confirmed victims who had lost their money to this fraud within two months.Investigators claimed that two other Chinese nationals, who the police believe to be the kingpins of the racket, are on the run. “They moved out of India in early 2020,” said Roy.Roy said the fraud began when users started receiving WhatsApp messages containing encrypted URLs from international numbers. “These messages promised good, easy money in return for clicking the like button on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, and for following social media accounts,” said the DCP.Clicking on the website link would lead to a link to download an app, Roy saidUpon registering on this app, users would receive social media videos to like and accounts to follow. They would be paid ₹6 for each such action. The number of tasks and amount paid for each action would rise substantially if the users opted for a “VIP membership”, by paying between ₹1,000 and ₹50,000.The DCP said the gang floated this fraud as a multi-level marketing scheme, in which users could earn a percentage of a money made by people referred by them.The police said tens of thousands of people ended up investing thousands of rupees each. Their earnings reflected in their accounts on the app, but was allegedly never handed over to their bank accounts.By doing this, the gang made crores of rupees which were routed to shell companies in which Indians as well as Chinese people were found to be directors. “The Indians who were made directors were people like accountants, office boys and drivers working for the Chinese people,” Roy said.Next, the social media accounts being promoted were being passed off as belonging to celebrities, but were actually freshly created accounts with unknown origin and ownership, the DCP said.“When these social media accounts would receive a large number of followers, they could later be used to manipulate and influence Indian social media users,” Roy said.While all this could be easily detected by the police, much more allegedly happened once the users downloaded the app. “The app would seek dangerous permission of users to discreetly install several software packages and apps. One of these apps was the QQ Browser app which belongs to the QQ family of apps banned by the Indian government in June last year,” said Roy.The DCP said that the app itself was a malware that would make users “follow” thousands of social media accounts without their knowledge.The website and app being used in the fraud were hosted to IPs found to be attached to Chinese companies, the DCP said.The police said they began probing this fraud after receiving complaint from a woman who lost R50,000 .Subsequently, on Wednesday, the police raided several places in Delhi-NCR to arrest the twelve suspects. The police have allegedly recovered ₹25 lakh in cash from them and froze several accounts containing nearly ₹4.75 crore of the duped amount||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12-including-two-chinese-nationals-held-for-floating-malware-apps-on-phone-101610734301334.html

Farmers said on Friday, the ninth round of talks also failed with the government and every failed negotiation had only further strengthened their spirit and has fuelled the ongoing agitation. Nothing less than repeal of the three contentious farm laws were acceptable to them, they said.Dr Darshan Pal, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said farmers are coming in large numbers to all the border points of Delhi. “In Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, there are frequent tractor marches and a large number of farmers are reaching Delhi. The enthusiasm of farmers has increased due to the huge support we have received…this movement is fanning out across the nation. Under the banner of ‘Mumbai for Farmers’, the Maharashtra farmers’ organization, along with other progressive groups, are organizing a huge rally,” he said. Pal said, farmers in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are continuing with an indefinite sit-in strike. “Kisan Delhi Chalo Yatra started from Odisha on January 15. The march will reach farmers at Delhi borders on January 21 after travelling via West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Kisan Jyoti March was started from Pune on January 12 and will reach Delhi on January 26,” the farmer leader said, adding that more than 500 farmers from Kerala have already reached the Shahjahanpur border. On Thursday, protest at Singhu border continued to be peaceful with farmer groups raising slogans, carrying out marches, cooking and distributing food at langars and delivering speeches. Manmeet Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar, who has spent almost ten days camping at Singhu border, said more people known to him have joined the protest since he left home. “Whoever I talk to, back home, say they are ready to come. Some, who had come left for their homes in December are again planning to come with more ration and cloths. They all plan to be here before Republic Day. Not everyone will march. We plan to support them from here by continuing the movement,” Singh said. Delhi Police continued to maintain their usual deployment with senior police officer ensuring round the clock presence at the posts that have been set up temporarily since the protests began. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said the deployment remained same as usual and will be stepped up as and when required. “The situation is being monitored continuously. We are also using drones for surveillance.

The 29-year-old errant driver, Gunmant Singh was arrested on Saturday, two days after the mishap took place near the Rajouri Garden flyover. His Hyundai 1-10 car involved in the mishap was seized from his home in west Delhi’s Vishnu Garden. Singh is employed in the office of an architect in Delhi, the police said.Police said Singh had allegedly jumped the traffic signal and hit the scooter that 26-year-old victim, identified by his first name Sachin, was riding. The accident took place at around 3 am on January 12, when Sachin, who dealt in supply of cosmetic items, was returning home after work.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said the police control room had received a call that an unknown car had hit a scooter near Rajouri Garden flyover. A police team reached the mishap spot and found a scooter lying on the road in damaged condition while its rider was already shifted to a nearby hospital.“A case of rash and negligent driving causing hurt was registered and investigation was taken up. The injured man, Sachin, succumbed to his injuries on Saturday. The case was converted into negligent death causing death,” said DCP Purohit.During the probe, a senior investigator said, the investigating team scanned all the CCTV cameras installed around the mishap spot. However, none of the cameras had captured the accident or the offending vehicle. A list of vehicles seen in the cameras was prepared and its owners were contacted.“One such owner Saran, who works in a call centre and was driving his Baleno car, said that he had witnessed the mishap and everything was captured in the camera installed on the dashboard of his vehicle. We saw its recordings and found the entire sequence of events leading to the mishap as well as the colour and model of the car that had hit the scooter,” the officer said.The camera recording showed that the scooter rider was waiting for green light at the traffic signal. The car having the dashboard camera was next to the scooter. As the traffic signal turned green and the scooter rider moved ahead, a silver car that jumped the red light while coming from the right carriageway hit the two-wheeler at the road intersection. The scooter rider flung into the air and then landed on the road.According to the officer, the investigating team checked nearly 20 cameras install on the routes that the driver of the offending vehicle had taken after the mishap. “This technical effort helped us trace the offending vehicle and nab its driver,” the officer added.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dashboard-cam-helps-police-crack-fatal-rajouri-garden-road-accident-case-1-arrested-101610733941184.html

Amit Kumar, an ambulance driver at the IGIMS, would be the second to be vaccinated, he added.The government has planned to vaccinate those above 50 years of age, having no co-morbidity, on the inaugural day of the vaccination.A total 300 session sites (vaccination centres), of which 259 were public sector institutions and 41 private, had been selected for vaccination on the inaugural day, said Pandey. The government would gradually scale up the number of session sites, but vaccination would be restricted to 100 beneficiaries per team at a session site.Also read: 'Seek approval before initiating action against poll officials' - EC tells statesPandey urged the media to help dispel any myth surrounding the two vaccines — Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“Both the vaccines have passed all international safety standards of trial and they are absolutely safe. It's a matter of pride for India to have its own vaccine,” said Pandey.He also urged beneficiaries not to become complacent after taking the first shot of the vaccine. A recipient who had taken the first shot will have to continue to maintain social distance, wear mask and continue handwashing habit. Antibody will develop after 14 days of taking the second shot of the vaccine. The gap between the two shots will be 28 days, added Pandey.The minister, however, evaded a direct response to the query whether beneficiaries could choose between Covishield and Covaxin, saying those who get the first shot of a particular vaccine would get its second shot as well on the 28th day. He assured the state had sufficient vaccines for its healthcare workers, to begin with.Earlier, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit, said those who do not enrol on the CoWin portal would not be vaccinated.He said frontline workers, comprising police and armed forces personnel, home guards, prisons staff, volunteers of disaster management department, civil defence, organisational and municipal workers, including outsourced municipal staff, could register on the CoWin portal till January 25. Their vaccination would be taken up in the second round.Prioritised population of 50 years and above or those younger than 50 years with co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, lung disease, etc., would have to self-register when the portal opens later, added Amrit.Giving a lowdown of the vaccination programme, which the government had meticulously planned, Amrit said syringes and vials would be properly disposed through the common bio-waste treatment facility (CBWTF) after vaccination.Fifteen districts were attached to the CBWTF facility at Muzaffarpur, 11 districts with the facility at Bhagalpur, six at Gaya and the remaining six districts with the facility at the IGIMS, Patna.He said vaccination would be done four days a week — Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday — in the state, excluding holidays.Amrit reiterated the need to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour after vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/sanitation-worker-driver-to-be-first-in-bihar-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101610728884078.html

The samples have been sent to a Bhopal-based facility for further confirmation even as bird flu has been reported in 11 states across India so far.An official told news agency PTI that the samples collected from the poultry farms in Dera Bassi area of Mohali district were initially sent for testing at Jalandhar’s Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL). The samples were then sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal, the official added.Also Read| Ban on Delhi poultry markets lifted after samples test negative for bird fluThe Congress led-government in Punjab on Sunday had temporarily suspended testing for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at the RDDL in Jalandhar and restored the laboratory for testing suspicious cases of bird flu. The state's health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had said that Covid-19 testing operations at the laboratory had been suspended as more than enough testing capacity was available at a distance of one hour. “RDDL will revert to testing for Covid-19 once bird flu threat is over,” the minister added.Earlier, Punjab had imposed a complete ban on the import of live birds, comprising poultry and unprocessed poultry meat, for any purpose till Friday. The state government had also instructed officials to intensify sampling, testing and surveillance of suspected cases. Neighbouring states such as Haryana and Delhi have already reported bird deaths due to avian influenza.Meanwhile, the Union animal husbandry ministry said on Thursday that all state governments had started undertaking bird flu public awareness campaigns by the way of social media, newspapers and advertisements after the Centre had issued several advisories. It also requested the Union aviation ministry to allow uninterrupted transportation of samples for rapid testing in designated facilities.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-reports-first-suspected-cases-of-bird-flu-sends-samples-to-bhopal-lab-101610726254952.html

These are seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and have 80 per cent of more Matua population.“A team has been formed. We will hold meetings with the Matuas in four assembly seats. We have a long-standing relationship with them. We will speak to their leaders and members of the Matua community,” said Mullick.The Matua community is spread over at least 70 assembly seats in the state, comprising at least seven Lok Sabha constituencies. The community is the deciding factor in five assembly seats.Also read: 'Seek approval before initiating action against poll officials' EC tells statesIn the 2019 elections, the Matuas had extended their support to the BJP. Contesting on a BJP ticket, the sect’s young face, Shantanu Thakur, defeated his aunt, TMC’s Mamata Bala Thakur at, in the Bongaon seat.For the Matua community, which hosted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first election campaign in Bengal before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, permanent citizenship is a longstanding demand. But with the BJP going soft on the issue, Thakur had recently expressed his disappointment.The TMC immediately stepped in with its overtures and Mullick went to the extent of inviting Shantanu Thakur to join the TMC. Later senior BJP leaders, however, stepped in to restrain Thakur from voicing his dissatisfaction.“They (Matuas) have certain demands. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already met some of their demands. We also have some appeals to the community. But this should not be seen as a counter meeting just because Shah is coming. We have a long-standing relation and team will just revise and reactivate those bonds,” said Mullick.This is however not the first time that Shah would be visiting the Matua stronghold. On November 6, he had lunch with a Matua family in North 24 Parganas. The BJP, however, downplayed the TMC’s outreach.“Anyone can visit and do anything. But whatever needed to be done for the Matuas has been by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” said Mukul Roy, BJP national vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmcs-to-send-crack-team-to-secure-matua-votes-ahead-of-shah-s-bengal-visit-101610725158581.html

Parents assembled outside the school and demanded that the school waive-off at least some percentage of the total fees owing to the current situation. “We have been requesting the school to reduce fees at least for the current year considering that many of us are struggling to pay fees due to pay cuts and jobs losses. We hope that the school takes note of our demands. We are just asking for a reduction in the overall fees,” said a parent of a Class 5 student from the school. School officials said they were awaiting guidelines from the government in this regard. “Currently, the case concerning fee hikes by private schools is pending in the court and the matter is thus pending. We cannot decide to reduce fees in the absence of order either from the court or the education department. We have on the other hand allowed parents with genuine issues to pay in instalments and we have not even imposed a hike for the current year. Parents have been offered all the necessary support in this matter,” said Sunita Goenka, chairperson of the school’s governing body. Meanwhile, parents have decided to approach the education department in this matter. “We are collectively going to request the department to intervene in this issue. We are ready to pay fees for tuition but demand a reduction in the other heads,” said a parent. An official from the state education department said that the department is yet to receive an official complaint in this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/goregaon-parents-demand-reduction-of-fees-protest-outside-school-101610713780239.html

Nitish was at an inauguration function, when journalists sought his reaction to Rupesh murder case, eliciting a sharp response from the CM.“Do you know who killed Rupesh? Don’t link (the murder) it with law and order situation. Crime doesn’t happen after taking permission,” a visibly irked Kumar told media personnel.He suggested media should talk to the state’s police chief, Sanjiv Kumar Singhal, over the developments in Rupesh’s murder case probe.When informed that none of the top police officials, including the director general of police (DGP) were picking their official phones, the chief minister spoke to the DGP, asking him to provide details of investigation to the media.“I spoke with the DGP, a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed (to probe the murder case). Don't demoralise the police. Police is doing their job. If someone doesn't carry out their duty, action is taken,” he said.Kumar attacked the Opposition led by RJD and suggested that they should look at the crime record when they were in power in Bihar.“What used to happen before 2005? There was a lot of crime. Is it the same today?,” he asked and added, “Why don’t you ask those, whose 15-year stint saw the crime graph soar? It is not so today. Show the condition in those days.”Taking further jibe at RJD’s rule in Bihar, he said, “Pati-Patni rule was known for crime only and the scenario has changed now.”Defending the state’s crime record during his regime, the CM said that Bihar was ranked 23 in the country on number of crimes reported. He added that the law of the land was being followed in Bihar. “Police are finding out more information. A speedy trial will be done, so that stringent action is taken against the culprit on time. I have been assured by the DGP,” Nitish said.The Bihar CM also directed the DGP to ensure immediate arrest and tough action against the assailants. "I will not tolerate any kind of crime in Bihar. The police should not hesitate in taking strict action against criminals," Nitish said.Officials familiar with developments said that the CM was himself monitoring the developments in the murder case, which is being used by the Opposition parties to target him over law and order situation in the state.“I have been saying this repeatedly. He (Nitish Kumar) is a selected and a nominated CM. He has been selected and nominated by the BJP. Bihar had never seen two deputy CMs but now, we have two deputy CMs from a single party," said Tejashwi Yadav, leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly.“Who is the maharaja of jungle raaj? Where is the PM now? The selected, nominated CM is a tired man. He is unable to run his department,” Yadav said, continuing his attack on the Nitish government.Rupesh was shot multiple times by bike-borne assailants outside his apartment in Punaichak area in the state capital on Tuesday evening. Rupesh left behind his wife and two children.Rupesh’s elder brother Nandeshwar Singh has sought a CBI inquiry into the murder, a job for his wife and arrangements for his children’s education.While talking to media persons at his Chhapra residence on Friday, Nandeshwar said that despite the chief minister's assurance, Patna police failed to make any breakthrough in the four days after the incident.“So, CM should hand over the case to the CBI, as we are not at all satisfied with the police inquiry,” he said and alleged that no police officer had bothered to apprise the family of any developments in the case.“Whatever information we are getting, is from the media,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/upset-with-questions-on-indigo-manager-murder-case-nitish-tears-into-opposition-101610704928062.html

Dhadis are traditional performers who sing ballads of war heroes with a sarangi, a stringed instrument, and a dhad, a small drum.The live streaming of the performance is being done on its Facebook page as of now with a smartphone. Professional equipment is being arranged, said an official of the apex gurdwara body. The move is being seen as the SGPC wanting to make use of information technology to spread principles of Sikhism and be present on all technology platforms. The ballads are sung at the highest temporal seat of Sikhs from 9am to 4pm daily under the tradition launched by sixth Sikh master Guru Hargobind, the founder of Akal Takht, to instil chivalry in the Sikhs and prepare them for fighting wars. The IT wing said that this telecast is drawing a good response from the public.“Dhadi performance is a rich tradition of Sikhism. In modern times, however, it is losing popularity especially among the young generation. To uphold the warrior spirit in the community, this tradition needs to be safeguarded.

15-01-2021||Lucknow||Gujarat cadre IAS officer Arvind Kumar Sharma may be made minister in Yogi govt||Former Gujarat cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Arvind Kumar Sharma’s induction in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has led to speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle in the Uttar Pradesh government after the biennial election to 12 seats in the UP Legislative Council is over.Considered a close aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sharma joined BJP in a programme organised in the state unit office in Lucknow on Thursday. Indicating a major role for Sharma in the government, BJP state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh said Sharma has worked with the Prime Minister for 20 years and will play an important role in the state government and the party.After joining the BJP, Sharma thanked the Prime Minister and BJP national president and said, “I come from a backward village located in Mau district of eastern UP, I have no political background, the BJP has honoured me, I will do the task entrusted by the party”.A BJP leader said that Sharma is likely to file his nomination paper for the legislative council on Friday. The BJP has 310 MLAs and it is hoping to win at least 10 council seats with the support of ally Apna Dal and rebel BSP and Congress MLAs. Along with Sharma, the party has also cleared state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma and senior leader Laxman Acharya for nomination to the council. The remaining six candidates will be announced after the approval of the party’s central committee. The legislative council election is scheduled for January 28.After the legislative council election, the Cabinet is likely to be expanded before the crucial 2022 Assembly election, said the BJP leader quoted above.The party is likely to utilise Sharma’s services in UP government since he has held top positions in the Gujarat government when Narendra Modi was the chief minister. Later, he moved to the Prime Minister’s Office after Modi became the Prime Minister in 2014. Before taking voluntary retirement, Sharma was handling the MSME (micro small and medium enterprises) department, key to PM’s plan for revival of the economy post Covid lockdown. Sharma has also handled Vibrant Gujarat projects.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had met PM Narendra Modi in Delhi on January 8, when Cabinet expansion and Sharma’s induction was discussed, the BJP leader added.Apart from inducting Sharma in the Cabinet, the party might move some ministers to the organization with the responsibility for elections. To maintain the caste and regional balance, some fresh faces are likely to be inducted in the Cabinet while some ministers of state are likely to be rewarded with promotion to the Cabinet rank, the BJP leader said.At present, there are 54 ministers in the UP Cabinet including the chief minister, 23 Cabinet ministers, 9 ministers of state (Independent Charge) and 22 ministers of state. Uttar Pradesh can have a maximum of 60 ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/gujarat-cadre-ias-officer-arvind-kumar-sharma-may-be-made-minister-in-yogi-govt-101610695502344.html

15-01-2021||Other||Raj Bhawan versus state govt: Haryana governor finds own govt opposing him||Haryana governor Satyadeo Narain Arya, the executive head of the state government, was left embarrassed after the state government termed his orders to extend the services of the general secretary of Haryana branch of Indian Red Cross Society ‘illegal’ before the Punjab and Haryana high court. As per Article 154 of the Constitution, the executive power of the state is vested in the governor. Appearing for the state government and secretary to the governor, Haryana advocate general (AG) BR Mahajan told a single judge bench of the high court that “the order passed is illegal and, therefore, the extension could not be granted.” The governor, who is the president of the Haryana branch of the Indian Red Cross Society, had on June 2 extended the term of DR Sharma as general secretary, Indian Red Cross Society and state secretary, St John Ambulance, Haryana State Centre, Chandigarh, until his superannuation on April 30, 2022. Chief Minister, ML Khattar is the vice-president of Haryana branch of the Indian Red Cross Society. The extension was subsequently challenged before the HC. While a single bench of the HC had on January 6 set aside the extension granted to Sharma stating it is clearly beyond what has been provided in the Staff Rules, 2017, a division bench headed by chief justice Ravi Shanker Jha on January 12 stayed the single bench’s order. “It is important to note here that the Haryana advocate general has taken a stand that the decision of the president of the society has not been ratified as required under rule 6 although a meeting of the managing committee has already taken place,” reads the January 6 HC order. When asked why the state government opposed the governor’s orders before the high court, the AG said the state merely reiterated the stand taken by the national body of the Indian Red Cross Society. “The national body has also taken a stand that the extension order passed was illegal,’’ said Mahajan. Advisor to the governor Akhilesh Kumar, on being asked about state government’s opposition to the governor’s orders, said, “As of now a division bench has stayed the orders of the single bench. We will have to deliberate on this extension matter. I will be able to comment only after discussing it with officers,’’ he said. Secretary to governor G Anupama refused to comment on the development. Anupama, who was also represented by the AG in the high court, is the senior-most officer manning the governor’s establishment. She is also an administrative secretary to the government. Officials familiar with the development said it is quite absurd that while representing the secretary to the governor, the AG committed the impropriety of terming the governor’s orders ‘illegal’. “Without going into the merits of the governor’s order, it is preposterous for the government machinery to take a contrary stance and that too in a trivial matter pertaining to a society,’’ said an official, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/raj-bhawan-versus-state-govt-haryana-guv-finds-own-govt-opposing-him-101610681977412.html
15-01-2021||Bhopal||Retd Air Force officer was drugged in MP before set on fire, 6 arrested||Six arrests have been made in the murder case of 53-year-old retired Indian Air Force officer Rajesh Sahu, whose semi burnt body was found in a car in Chhindwara district on December 27, according to police.The accused, including Naresh Gurjar, Ashok Agrawal and four others injected Sahu with a drug and later poured petrol over his car and set it on fire with him trapped inside, said Vivek Agrawal, superintendent of police (SP), Chhindwara.Police arrested the accused under section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), said the SP.Sahu, who lived in Bhopal, left for Chhindwara on December 26 to see his parents who reside at Guraiya Marg in the city. However, his dead body was found in his car in a semi burnt condition, away from the road in a 20-foot deep ditch between Jhirpa and Rainikheda under Mahuljhir police station on December 27.“It took more than two weeks to nab the accused. The accused confessed to their crime and said they killed Sahu over a dispute over ₹5 crore that the deceased was demanding from Naresh Gurjar, one of the main accused. Naresh Gurjar, a resident of Bhopal, hatched the plan to kill Sahu with the help of Ashok Agrawal. The duo requested Sahu to take them to Chhindwara. Inside the car, they forcibly injected him with a drug that knocked him out. Then they poured petrol on his car and set it on fire to kill Sahu,” said the SP.According to the officer, the deceased and Gurjar used to deal in properties while Ashok Agrawal maintained the accounts. When Sahu checked the records he realised that he was supposed to get ₹5 crore from Gurjar. Since then he had been putting pressure on him to pay.The accused were arrested on the basis of their mobile phone locations and call records. Police are interrogating them and will produce them before a court on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/retd-air-force-officer-was-drugged-in-mp-before-set-on-fire-6-arrested-101610677322535.html

Wear a mask and follow social distancing to keep yourself and your family safe,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Twitter.Delhi reported the first case of the infection on March 2, with the first death coming on March 13 when a 68-year-old woman from west Delhi’s Janakpuri died after contracting the infection from her son who had travelled to Switzerland, Japan, and Italy.The seven-day average of daily deaths, also known as the death rate, is now at 11 fatalities, the lowest since May 21. The number of deaths has been declined drastically over the past few weeks. At the start of December, for instance, Delhi was reporting 91 deaths a day on average, according to the data shared by the Delhi government.The highest number of deaths due to Covid-19 recorded in a day was 131 on November 18 when Delhi saw its third and worst surge in the number of cases ever recorded.Experts said the trend in Delhi was largely in line with the Covid trajectory across the country.“The number of deaths and infections has gone down not only in Delhi but across India. If you look at the data from across the country, the number of cases has been going down steadily September onwards naturally, showing that a majority of the population has already been exposed to the infection. In Delhi, the surge in November was because of large-scale mixing of the infected and uninfected populations during festivals,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at the Christian Medical College-Vellore.To be sure, Delhi has seen a much larger proportion of Covid-19 patients die than the national average. Delhi has a case fatality rate (proportion of confirmed Covid patients that die from the disease) of 1.7% against India’s average of 1.44%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-adds-four-covid-19-deaths-least-in-248-days-101610656601728.html
15-01-2021||Other||3 phases of vaccination will be completed in 3 months: Maharashtra health minister||State health minister Rajesh Tope, in an interview with HT on Thursday, said the number of vaccination centres was reduced to ensure the machinery would be set to sustain any reaction of the vaccine and handle it effectively. He said they would know only after two months when the general public can get the vaccine. The minister also said though they received fewer doses than expected, the Centre is expected to allot another consignment in the next few days. Edited excerpts:You have complained that the state has received fewer vaccine doses than required. What was the demand?We were expecting 1,750,000 vials to vaccinate 800,000 health workers in the first phase in the wake of the Centre’s direction that two doses of same vaccine should be given in the stipulated timeframe of 28-45 days. Against it, we have received 9,63,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 of Covaxin. This would cover about 500,000 or over 55% of the health workers enrolled for vaccination. But we are sure the Centre will allot us second consignment of doses in the next 8-10 days.The state had to reduce the number of vaccination centres from 511 to 358 after Centre’s direction. Would it delay the vaccination drive?The reduction in the number of centres was a strategic move by the Central government as it wanted to implement the drive in a cautious and calibrated manner and without any haste. We want the mechanism to be robust to handle any untoward incident or Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) effectively. We are expecting the first two phases of immunization of healthcare and frontline workers to be completed in a month. It could have been completed in 15 days, had we started with 511 centres. All three planned phases, including people above 50 years of age and comorbidities, will be completed in about three-and-a-half months.When is the general public expected to get the vaccine?During the video conference on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told us that there would a review of the drive once 60% of the two phases meant for healthcare and frontline workers are done with the vaccination. The clarity over availability of the vaccine for general public is expected in the next two months, when we are done with these phases.You have been talking about free vaccine for the poor….Yes, we are determined to do it. Actually, vaccination is the responsibility of the Centre and it should bear the cost of vaccine for poor. We have demanded it, but if the Centre does not concede, the state government will bear the cost for vulnerable people below the poverty line (BPL). Our 35% population is BPL and of it 50% or roughly 15 million people will need to be given vaccine for free. This section of society can’t afford the vaccine even if it is priced at ₹210-220. If they are left to bear the cost, they would opt to avoid it and end up becoming a source of infection.Another frequently asked question is if everybody needs to be vaccinated.We discussed this in our department and they are of the opinion that not all will have to get the vaccine doses. The population in the age group of 18-40 is considered healthy and can sustain the infection. Barring comorbid people, others can avoid taking the vaccine.People in areas with high percentage of infection will be given vaccine in routine course?Yes. People from the highly dense areas like Dharavi where a large population has antibodies, too, will be given vaccine as per the routine plan.There are doubts being raised over the efficacy of Covaxin. What is your take on it?Both the vaccines, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute’s Covishield, have been given emergency use authorisation in India. Covishield could complete phase-3 clinical trials as volunteers from other countries like the United Kingdom were involved in it. Covaxin is yet to complete its phase 3 trials and requires consent of the beneficiary. The third clinical trial needs it to be administered on 40,000 people to judge the reaction and efficacy. The indigenous vaccine will soon complete it. In fact, the technology and basis of Covaxin is more effective, we have been told. As such, both the vaccines are safe for use.Why is the government wary about health workers backing out from vaccination after enrolling for it?As there is reservation for vaccination among some health workers, there are people who ask us why they are not getting it in initial stages. There are reactions such as swelling, giddiness, uneasy feeling to abdominal pain in some people. We are ready to handle all such reactions. I would appeal to the health workers and other beneficiaries not to be afraid of it and come forward for the vaccination. Though Covid-19 cases are under control, they are still high in a few districts. What is the reason?Maharashtra’s weekly case fatality rate has dropped to 1.5%. We are the 10th number in the country in growth rate, which is 0.12%. Our doubling rate has gone to almost one year. The number of cases is reducing in the state, while in other states like Kerala, Punjab the growth rate is on the rise. In the past one month, our daily caseload ranged between 2500 and 3500. It is true that in some districts like Parbhani, Nagpur and Nandurbar, the positivity and case fatality rates are high for various reasons. We have asked the district administrations to increase the tracing, tracking and testing at local level to keep the deaths under control. Early referral of the infection can save lives and arrest the spread. We have also directed to increase the daily testing to 1.5 lakh so that the number of patients decrease further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-phases-of-vaccination-will-be-completed-in-3-months-maharashtra-health-minister-101610655934686.html

On Thursday, several members of the Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA) protested with a green band while conducting online classes, asking the government to allow them to reopen with certain standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place. Members of the MCOA said that despite requesting the government on multiple occasions, they were still awaiting a green signal to start operations. “We understand the risks involved after we reopen, and are equally concerned about the health of our staff and the children. However, classes have lost a substantial amount of revenue as enrolments have gone down by up to 70% this year. We also have rents to pay and with poor business, it is becoming difficult for us to sustain,” said Santosh Vaskar, a class owner and the president of MCOA. Classes protested by tying green bands on their wrists in their online classes and said that they would continue to do so until Saturday. “We have requested the government to come up with SOPs for us. In many parts of the state, the local administration has allowed classes to partially reopen, but in Mumbai, no decision has been taken yet, even as the schools are likely to start soon,” said Vaskar. Since September, members of MCOA have been meeting government officials and ministers, requesting them to allow the reopening of classes. In December, the Coaching Classes Teachers’ Federation, a pan-Maharashtra body of classes, wrote to the department urging them to allow classes to reopen. Officials from the education department said that they were awaiting instructions from the state government in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allow-us-to-reopen-coaching-class-owners-in-maharashtra-urge-101610655454113.html

However, Rajesh and several other final-year MBBS students studying in Chinese universities are staring at a bleak future as they stand to lose a year of their career. According to the rules in China, MBBS students have to immediately complete a 52-week physical internship in assigned hospitals after finishing their final-year course to be awarded their MBBS degree. While the first, second and third-year MBBS students are currently attending lectures online, the final-year students are at a loss, as their internship can only be completed once the lockdown restrictions are lifted. “I had started my medical internship last January at the First Hospital of Jilin University, when the Covid-19 situation in China started getting out of control. By February, our families back home started getting worried and most of the foreign students flew back home as the country was under severe lockdown restrictions,” said Rajesh, a Santacruz resident, who has been home since February 2020.“We’ve been writing to several authorities at the university as well as to the Indian Embassy in Beijing for help, but to no avail. Now, the situation in China is much better and we all are ready to abide by the quarantine rules to go back and complete our internship, without which, we stand to lose an entire year of our career,” added Rajesh.The Embassy of India in Beijing recently released a notification, stating that as of now, there stands no update on the situation. “With reports of resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China, authorities have further reinforced epidemic controls and restrictions on travel and entry into China. The suspension of visas of Indian nationals is an instance of enhanced controls. Chinese authorities have also denied permission for operation of any chartered flights between India and China, citing their strict control measures,” stated the notification.Another final-year MBBS student, Ishwari Chandran, studying in Zhejiang University at Hangzhou, China, returned to India last January for her winter break and has not been able to go back to finish her course since then. With only a semester and a year-long internship to go to get her degree, Chandran was also to graduate in July 2021. But the graduation of her batch of 25 students, seems to have been deferred indefinitely with foreign students yet to be permitted into the country. “I need to complete my 52-week internship. As I can’t return to China, our university has asked us to go ahead with our internship in any other country and submit proofs of completing it by March,” Chandran said. However, to pursue a medical internship in India, those studying abroad need to clear the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE) held twice a year. “We missed the earlier round of exam held in the first week of December. The next round will be in June. What do we do till then?” said Chandran, who has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking relaxation in the FMGE rule for internships. Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy notification also stated that with the Chinese authorities repeatedly saying that the restrictions are unlikely to be relaxed in the coming months, students should continue education through online mode. “While the embassy is aware of the difficulty of undertaking courses in medicine in online format, students are advised to take note of the restrictions in place and make appropriate arrangements for continuing their education.”Neha S (name changed), a third-year MBBS student at Jianghan University, Wuhan, said, “We’ve studied two semesters online. Now we’ve been told another semester will be online. Medical students learn more from practical experience rather than theory. Other countries have started taking back foreign students but China hasn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mbbs-students-enrolled-in-chinese-universities-fear-losing-year-101610655093864.html

The active caseload in the state also rose marginally on Thursday from 52,365 to 52,558. The number of active cases had slipped below 50,000 on January 4, but later rose to 54,179 on January 10. Health department officials have attributed the surge in the active cases to delayed accounting of recoveries, as the daily cases have not shown any significant jump. In the past 24 hours, 61,104 samples were tested, after which the number of total tests rose to 13,623,298. The positivity rate stands at 14.55%.Meanwhile, Mumbai reported 607 new cases on Thursday, taking its Covid-19 tally of 301,081.

According to civic officials, the nine designated vaccine centres of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), with capacity to vaccinate 14,000-15,000 people each day or about 100,000 a week, would be able to vaccinate a little over five million citizens against Covid-19 in the next one year. Civic officials said the number of beneficiaries is expected to rise in the coming months once the vaccination for the general public starts, as the civic body will increase its capacity with additional supply of doses. BMC’s executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said, “The nine centres with a total of 72 booths have a capacity to vaccinate at least 14,000 people a day. Once the drive is launched, it will continue every day until the beneficiaries shortlisted for phase-1 are vaccinated. We’ve not received information on when phase-2 will start.”The nine centres are four major hospitals (King Edward Memorial Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper hospital and Sion hospital), four peripheral hospitals (Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli) and the Covid facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex.BMC plans to kick off its phase-1 of vaccinating 130,000 healthcare workers from Saturday at these nine centres. A dry run for the phase-1 of the immunisation process is expected to be undertaken on Friday.However, top civic officials are cautious about setting any deadlines. Additional civic commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “I can’t give a timeline as to when the entire city will be vaccinated or by when the general public will get the vaccine. It depends on factors such as availability of vaccine doses and also if private institutions are given permission for the immunisation. Without this information, it will be futile to decide on a timeline.”According to officials, citizens above 50 and those with comorbidities, who constitutes around 30% of the total 12.4 million citizens can be vaccinated in about four months, if the supply of the doses is adequate. “After this, we can start vaccinating those between 18 and 50 years. If we consider only BMC’s capability, a significant number of the population can be vaccinated in the next one year,” Kakani said, adding that there is no decision if the vaccine will be free.Meanwhile, Dr Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said the entire city can be vaccinated even in six months if private and government infrastructure are completely utilised. “We should wait for the results of the vaccines that will be administered to healthcare and frontline workers. Once they are out, I am sure it will boost citizens’ confidence,” he said. Dr Sathe added that the real challenge for India will be if the vaccine provides immunity against Covid-19 for less than a year. “This might create a new challenge of frequent vaccination. But I feel the vaccines will provide immunity for one-two years,” he added.Dr Om Shrivastav, who is part of the state’s Covid-19 task force, said, “Looking at the current pace of things, I think vaccines will be made available to general public soon. BMC can maintain a steady pace for the process by roping in private hospitals, in case they get permission from the state to do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/half-of-mumbai-s-population-to-be-vaccinated-in-a-year-101610654560952.html

To borrow the utensils residents must approach the municipal corporation through the area councillor. The utensils, once washed, can be returned to the MC facility in two days. The facility has been opened at the Zone C office of the municipal corporation and initially around 500 plates, glasses and spoons have been stocked. Swachh Bharat Mission state project director Puran Singh says, “Large quantities of single-use plastic and thermocol disposable waste is generated during social events. As the use of single-use plastic and thermocol has been banned by the Union and state governments, this initiative has been taken to provide an alternative to residents. The use of disposable cutlery results in littering and pollution, which defeats the Swachh Bharat Mission.” Not only is the use of single-use plastic bad for the environment but it also chokes the sewer lines. The MC is planning to initiate an extensive drive against banned products and an awareness drive to sensitise the people. Officials said if the facility at Zone C received a good response, more such facilities will be opened in other parts of the city. The MC will also approach corporate houses so that utensils can be purchased under the Corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives.MC sanitary inspector Jasbir Singh said, “The facility was opened in the last week of December. The utensils were used during a prayer ceremony organised by the MC to mark new year celebrations at the Zone D office on January 1. However, the initiative has so far garnered a tepid response from residents due to lack of awareness. The utensils are being provided free of cost on the recommendation of councillors or MLAs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-mc-opens-utensil-bank-as-alternative-to-single-use-plastic-101610654074139.html

The teachers can leave for the day only after thoroughly checking the classrooms. The guards or other school staff responsible for locking the rooms, including laboratories, should also make sure that no student is left behind after school. Further, it will be the responsibility of the teachers to open the classrooms in the morning and they can let the students in only after ensuring that the classrooms have been properly cleaned. “All school heads and teachers have made extra efforts to increase enrollment in our schools. And now it is our responsibility to take care of the children coming to study here,” said the DEO. She added that incidents such as the one that took place in the Gill village school can be avoided if school authorities and teachers are vigilant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-school-suicide-2-days-on-deo-instructs-all-teachers-to-check-classes-before-leaving-101610654013838.html

On Thursday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also directed the officials to submit a proposal on the Pune-Nashik semi high-speed rail corridor to the state cabinet. The decision of the committee came following a meeting held by Thackeray, on Tuesday with officials from the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to review the Versova-Virar project that is expected to cost around ₹32,000 crore. The project will offer faster connectivity to Vasai-Virar regions and areas up to Dahanu and spur the growth of this area. According to a government official, who was part of the sub-committee meeting held on Thursday, the state road corporation will now go-ahead with the appointment of a consultant to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) on it. “A pre-feasibility report was undertaken for the project, which was also presented to the chief minister on Tuesday. Now, we will undertake the DPR,” the official said. According to the pre-feasibility report, which HT had highlighted earlier, the sea-link will be built with connectors at Charkop, Uttan, Vasai and Virar. The 4+4 lane main bridge will connect Versova to Virar with 3+3 lane connectors at these four locations. With the coastal road, the Bandra-Worli sea link, Bandra-Versova sea link and the Virar extension, the state is looking at reducing the travel distance from Nariman Point in south Mumbai to Virar (almost 30 km from Borivili) from the current three hours to one hour by car. The report also estimates 76,762 PCUs (passenger car unit) by 2026 on this extension. There are toll plazas proposed at every interchange. A one-way toll from Versova to Vasai at the time of commercial operations (2026) is estimated to be ₹814 for a car and ₹1,669 for a bus. In a meeting with officials from the Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (MRIDC) on Thursday, chief minister Thackeray also directed authorities to present the proposal for a semi high-speed rail corridor between Pune and Nashik before the cabinet. The corridor is expected to cut the travel time between the two most important cities of the state from six to seven hours currently to two hours. The corridor is further expected to boost agriculture, tourism and industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-committee-gives-a-go-ahead-to-mumbai-s-versova-virar-sea-link-101610653473585.html

Finally, he has fulfilled his promise by inaugurating this cow shelter.”This shelter will be taken care of by Madhav Gaushala Trust.City mayor said, “It is our misfortune that cows have to stray on roads.

As in Punjab the government gives financial aid for the maintenance of cow shelters, similar request has been made to the assembly speaker.”He said that one would need ₹2-3 crore for the maintenance of the shelter.

Mutton went from ₹550 per kg to ₹700 per kg now. Kumar, however, added that the rise in prices would have happened regardless of the avian flu outbreak as people preferred to eat mutton and fish during peak winter season.Meanwhile, the price of broilers that had crossed ₹200 per kg around the start of the month is now between ₹140- ₹150 per kg, and sales continue to remain below half at the meat market in Sector 21.Prices up in Mohali, Panchkula as wellAs per Ricky, the owner of RS Chicken in Phase 5, Mohali, the sale of chicken in Mohali hasn’t been affected as much as in Chandigarh, however, the prices are dropping there as well. “We have had a 25% drop in the sale of chicken, but people prefer to buy mutton even here.“The price of mutton starts at ₹700 per kg here and some premium cuts can go for as high as ₹800-900 per kg.” He added that mutton curry cut had become the most-sold item in his shop.In Panchkula, people were preferring fish, as per proprietor of Bedi Chicken in Sector 2, Panchkula, Harsimran Bedi, who said, “People prefer boneless cuts of cold-water fish like Basa, which sells for ₹200 per 250 gram. The cheaper cuts of fish with bones don’t do that well.”Cooked chicken, eggs safe to consumeSaying that it was unfortunate that people weren’t buying eggs and chicken and the shopkeepers were suffering because of this, joint director of the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, Dr Kanwarjit Singh, said, “It is safe to consume both chicken and eggs if they have been cooked over 70 degrees Celsius. Boiling them is the safest option. The strain of avian flu identified in Panchkula doesn’t spread easily and people can safely consume chicken or meat products that have been cooked properly,” he said, adding that grilled chicken may be avoided, but gravy dishes were okay to eat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prices-of-mutton-fish-rise-as-people-turn-away-from-chicken-in-chandigarh-and-around-101610653293700.html

The petition has claimed that as Munde did not disclose details of his two children in form 26 of his election affidavit, hence an FIR should be registered against him under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course.The petition filed by Hemant Patil, a resident of Pune, who is also an RTI activist has stated that Munde, in his affidavit filed before the election commission for the 2019 general assembly election, had mentioned that he had only two daughters. The petition states that Munde has admitted on a social media site that apart from his wife and two daughters, he has a relationship with another lady since 2003 and had two children - a daughter and son from her. This fact, the petition states, had not been disclosed by Munde in his election affidavit.The petition states that Munde intentionally did not disclose the facts about this, and thus committed an offence under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and various provisions of the Representation of People Act, 1951. Patil has claimed that after the fraud came to light, he had tried to lodge a complaint with the concerned police station at Parali and the superintendent of police at Beed, but they refused to take cognisance. Patil has averred that even the Directorate General of Police and the Chief Election Commissioner also failed to take appropriate action against Munde and hence the petition.The petition has prayed for directions to the concerned authorities to register an FIR against Munde for concealing and furnishing false information in form 26 of the election affidavit thus committing an electoral offence. The petition has also sought inquiry and investigation into his complaints. The petition is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/register-fir-against-ncp-leader-dhananjay-munde-seeks-petition-101610653053312.html

This is the biggest such order in terms of the contract value, for any Indian equipment manufacturer for drones.ideaForge, which beat top Israeli and Indian drone manufacturers to get the coveted contract, will be providing an undisclosed number of drones that can operate at higher altitudes, to the armed forces, the company announced on Thursday in a statement. A high-altitude variant of the company’s Switch UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) will be delivered over a period of a year, the statement read. “An inspiring story of a start-up turning into an enterprise and creating world-class innovations and products. A real trail blazer,” Sanjay Jaju, joint secretary to Government of India at the department of defence production, tweeted. ideaForge was incubated in 2007 at the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE) at IIT-B by four alumni members—Ankit Mehta, Rahul Singh, Ashish Bhat and Vipul Joshi. While initially, they built hand-cranked chargers, the enterprise soon shifted gears to building a hovercraft and eventually entered the drone manufacturing market. The company is a licensed manufacturer of UAVs approved by the Ministry of Defence.Based in Mumbai, currently, the company offers seven UAVs that are used in a range of applications including mapping, traffic management, surveillance, crowd management and security. Some of these drones are already in use by the armed forces. The Switch UAV is a fixed-wing vertical take-off and landing UAV that can be deployed at high altitude and harsh environments for day and night surveillance in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. It is man-portable and has the highest time on target compared to any other UAV in its class, said chief executive officer (CEO) Mehta, a dual degree holder in computer-aided design and automation from the 2005 batch of IIT-B. “The Switch UAV is a culmination of insights and knowledge we have gained over years of experience in helping the Indian Forces operationalise UAVs in their ranks. The trials saw about a dozen national and global players compete to meet the operational requirements. Switch UAV is the only product that cleared the Indian Army’s stringent product trials and surpassed expectations. It is a testimony of the fact that our systems are built like a bird and tested like a tank. Our systems are fully ready to serve nations that seek to protect their territorial sovereignty,” said Mehta hinting at the company’s plan for exporting the drones. “This is a classic example of how government-funded start-ups can help the country grow. We at SINE provided a seed fund to ideaForge from the grants we received from the government. It is now prudent that the government itself is reaping the benefits,” said Poyni Bhatt, chief executive officer, SINE.BOXThe Army has placed an order for the advanced high-altitude version of SWITCH UAV, a vertical take-off and landing drone.

The court directions came on the petition by seven former Panjab University (PU) senators, seeking directions for continuation of the present varsity governing bodies, including the senate and syndicate, till their elections were held. The former senators had moved court on December 22 last year, seeking its urgent intervention, stating that in the absence of the senate and syndicate, there will be no administrative body left for decision-making and the varsity administration will “collapse”. The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31, and the syndicate’s term got over on December 31. But, the varsity deferred the senate elections twice in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Members of the syndicate, which is the varsity’s executive body, are elected from among the senators.In their December-22 plea, the petitioners had demanded holding of senate polls and quashing of the varsity vice-chancellor’s orders deferring the elections indefinitely. They had alleged that the political party at the Centre and people affiliated with it were deliberately delaying the polls. It was also demanded to examine whether the V-C could defer the elections of the senate without approval of the syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senate-polls-hc-fines-panjab-university-50-000-for-delay-in-response-to-ex-senators-plea-101610652333389.html
15-01-2021||Chandigarh||Senate elections: Vice-President’s office asks Panjab University for further course of action||The office of the Vice-President, who is the chancellor of Panjab University, has sought a proposal from the varsity on its further course of action with regards to senate elections.The proposal was sought in a letter addressed to PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar on December 31. It came after the higher education department of the Union ministry of education asked the Vice-President’s secretariat to take up the matter with PU on conducting the senate elections or granting extension to the senate and syndicate.The term of the senate, the apex governing body of PU, ended on October 31 last year. But, the varsity deferred the senate elections twice in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The term of the syndicate, PU’s executive body, also ended in December 31. Its members are elected from among the senators. Hence, the university is now functioning without a governing body.PU wrote to UGC in NovemberIn November, the varsity had written to the University Grants Commission (UGC), with a copy to the Union ministry of education and secretary to the Vice-President, seeking a plan on the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP-2020).As no fresh elections to the PU senate have been held so far, the former senators were apprehensive that the governing structure of the university may change due to the NEP-2020, which has recommended that a Board of Governors (BoG) be appointed as the governing body in higher educational institutions. Vice-President’s office had forwarded PU’s letter to the ministry of education for their advice.Responding on the matter on December 29, the ministry’s department of higher education stated that PU was an inter-state body corporate under Section 72 of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, and governed as per provisions of the PU Act, 1947.UGC has already informed the varsity that it may initiate governance reforms in accordance with provisions of the PU Act. However, these cannot be implemented without the approval of senate.“In view of the above, the matter may be taken up with PU to decide, in light of ground situation, further course of action for conducting the elections or granting extension to the senate/syndicate,” the ministry’s letter stated.Series of demands for immediate pollsEver since the PU senate elections were postponed – first in August and later in October last year – there have been a series of protests on the campus demanding immediate polls.Besides syndicate members, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Sukhbir Singh Badal have also written to the Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu asking him to direct the varsity to immediately conduct the senate polls.PU registrar Vikram Nayyar was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senate-elections-vice-president-s-office-asks-panjab-university-for-further-course-of-action-101610652213437.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar questions composition of SC appointed committee on farm laws||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has questioned the composition of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to discuss contentious farm laws and give their recommendations. Pawar welcomed the intervention in the issue by the Apex court but said that the members of the committee have supported the three farm laws in the past, thus farmers do not trust the committee. He said that the committee should have been independent in a true sense.The Supreme Court (SC) has formed a four-member committee to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court on Tuesday. It comprises Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agriculture economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana).“I welcome the intervention made by the SC and express discontent over the way the Centre handled the farmers’ agitation. But if you see the composition of the committee, all the members have supported the farm bills at different points of time, in some or other way. This is the reason farmers do not have faith in the committee and believe that nothing will come out of the discussions with it, and I share the same view,” Pawar told reporters outside YB Chavan in south Mumbai on Thursday.“It would have been better if the central government would have understood the seriousness of the issue. An independent means, in a true sense, the independent committee should have been appointed,” said the former agriculture minister.Regardless of severe cold wave in Delhi, the farmers along with their families are protesting at Delhi borders since the last 50 days. They want the farm laws to be repealed by the central government, he added.On January 12, the SC stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws that have brought tens of thousands of protesting farmers to Delhi’s doorstep and constituted a four-member committee.But the farm unions are unimpressed and have insisted that the protest would continue. They have pointed out that all members of the court-appointed committee had previously indicated their support for the controversial laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-questions-composition-of-sc-appointed-committee-on-farm-laws-101610651973477.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students’ claims on fees are objectionable, says TISS||Less than a week after a group of students from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) demanded the institute for a discount in fees for the upcoming semester, TISS management shared a detailed statement discrediting claims of students that the institute was ‘making profit’ by charging full fees from their students. Last week, a group of students from the institute released a statement against the institute’s decision of charging full fees from all, for the upcoming semester. Students said many institutes have considered the non-usage of several facilities on campus for the last eleven months of the lockdown and have reduced the fees for the upcoming semester, while TISS administration was still charging the full fees. “Statements by some student groups alleging that the institute is “profiteering from distress” and “privatising education” are highly objectionable and unacceptable,” said the statement released by TISS. It further added that not only has the institute reduced fees across courses, it has also not charged fine on delay in fee payment. “Fee is not charged for on-campus experience, but for imparting education. The online education is not on a free virtual platform, but the institute is paying for the software,” added the statement. The institute also highlighted how at present, only 45% students of the second semester batch and 27% students of the fourth semester have paid the fees. In a statement shared with media last week, the TISS Progressive Students Front had highlighted that since the classes have been conducted online for almost past eleven months, fees should be reduced accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-students-claims-on-fees-are-objectionable-says-tiss-101610651740092.html

15-01-2021||Mumbai||Janhvi Kukreja murder: Accused had a violent streak, says Mumbai Police||The two accused arrested for killing 19-year-old Janhvi Kukreja at a party on New Year’s Eve have been remanded in judicial custody on Thursday. The accused, Shree Jogdhankar and Diya Padalkar, were earlier remanded in police custody for 13 days. The investigating officer of the murder case told the court that Jogdhankar had a previous criminal case against him for assaulting a pan shop owner a few years ago, which proves that he had a streak of violence. According to statements of Jogdhankar’s friends, he was short-tempered and got into fights often. “One of Jogdhankar’s friends said in his statement that he was not shocked when Jogdhankar came with cuts on his body as he got into fights earlier too,” said a police officer. Khar police had presented the post mortem report of Kukreja’s body stating that she had 48 wounds on her body including a skull fracture which led to her death. Officers suspect the railing on the staircase of the building was the weapon as the couple allegedly banged Kukreja’s head against it. The police have found blood stains on the railing. However, the forensic report is yet to confirm whether the blood was Kukreja’s. The post mortem report further stated that Kukreja had injuries on her legs caused by dragging, and injures on her hip due to fisticuffs. Advocate Trivankumar Karnani, for Kukreja’s parents, urged the court, “Maximum opportunity may be given to the police to complete custodial interrogation and we must not incapacitate them.” “Accused no 1 Shree Jogdhankar will be sent to Taloja jail and accused no 2 Diya Padalkar has been sent to Byculla jail,” added Karnani. Police sources also said that Yash Abuja, who had organised the party, had bought drugs from a supplier in Bandra for the party. The supplier was arrested by Khar police in a separate case with 150 grams of MD. “We are now waiting for medical reports of party attendees to confirm the consumption of drugs as we did not find any at the party or the murder spot,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/janhvi-kukreja-murder-accused-had-a-violent-streak-says-mumbai-police-101610651253794.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Owner of popular tea brand targeted by sextortion gang on dating app||Marine Drive police registered a case based on the complaint of the owner of a popular tea brand who was trapped by the fraudsters on a dating app. The fraudsters had first recorded a nude video of the complainant and then uploaded the same on social media to extort money from him.The complainant is a 21-year-old resident of Marine Drive who looks after the tea brand segment of a company owned by his family.According to the police, earlier this year when the complainant was browsing through a dating app, he came in contact with a 25-year-old woman who identified herself as Riddhi Srivastava and the two started chatting. After a while, she asked the complainant for his mobile number.“On January 11, the complainant received a video call from the girl. During the conversation the woman tricked him to get naked. After some time, the complainant received a call from a person who threatened the complainant saying they have recorded his nudes and demanded money for not publishing the video on social media platforms,” said an officer from Marine Drive police station.The complainant then realised that he had been cheated by cyber fraudsters and discovered that Srivastava was actually a member of a sexortion gang, the officer added.As the complainant refused to pay the money, the accused uploaded the compromising photos on social media platforms in order to defame him. Following this, the complainant approached Marine Drive police.The police have registered a case under sections 384 (extortion) and 503 (threatening to defame) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections of the Information Technology Act. The police are in the process of obtaining details of the accused from the service provider.Recently, a superintendent rank officer of GST was also targeted in a similar manner.

15-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government adds 1,388 ha of mangrove area in Thane as forest land||The Maharashtra government has notified around 1,388 hectare (ha) of mangrove area in Thane as forest land under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927. This has taken the state’s total reserved forest area tally to 16,700ha. In a gazette notification issued on Tuesday, the state revenue and forest department announced that 1,387.39ha of mangroves land across 14 villages in Thane has now been declared as deemed reserved forest area. “It’s positive news for the conservation of mangroves. This notified area is now deemed forest land. Following the legal process, revenue officials will visit these areas, and in time they will be notified as reserved forests,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests and an ex-officio executive director of the state mangrove foundation. The areas notified are from villages in Thane district and taluka.In another notification, the state has also notified 1,575.16ha of mangrove land along the Maharashtra coast that is likely to be handed over to the forest department for better conservation (under section 20 of IFA, 1927), almost 16 years after the Bombay high court (HC) directed the government to do so. These mangroves are in Raigad, Sindhudurg, Mumbai suburban and Thane districts. In 2005, in an interim order, the HC had said that all mangrove areas on government land were to be handed over to the forest department. The HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018. However, while district bodies are yet to hand over 1,592.8ha, state agencies such as the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) have failed to transfer approximately 1,147ha falling under their jurisdiction to the forest department. In December last year, an environment group issued contempt notices to all Konkan district collectors, the Konkan divisional commissioner and JNPT for failing to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction, to the forest department. Last week, Vanashakti, an environmental NGO, filed a petition in the HC seeking immediate transfer of all mangrove lands to the forest department. Environmentalists, however, were upset that Uran was missing from the list of mangroves to be handed over to the forest department. “The list does not notify the mangroves of Uran and Navi Mumbai, where we have been highlighting the destruction of mangroves through illegal constructions,” said Stalin D, director of Vanashakti. “The reckless construction of roads straight on mangrove and marshy lands resulted in the highway developing huge cracks, which is a big lesson for the project proponents,” said BN Kumar, director, NGO NatConnect Foundation.Tiwari, however, said that discussions were on with government bodies such as Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) and City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) for transfer of ownership of mangrove areas to the forest department. “More such notifications are expected in the coming months,” said Tiwari.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, who held a meeting with the forest department on Thursday, tweeted: “I am happy to say that we have so far added 6,500 ha mangrove area to reserved forest land under section 20 of IFA, 1927, in less than a year. By June, we expect that it will increase to 10,000ha.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-adds-1-388-ha-of-mangrove-area-in-thane-as-forest-land-101610650954478.html

Price of one litre of petrol in the city was ₹91.32, and one litre of diesel was ₹81.60.The last hike in price, wherein diesel crossed ₹80 was in 2018 when it was priced at ₹80.10 a litre. On Wednesday, the fuel prices in the city crossed ₹90, with petrol costing ₹91.07 and diesel at ₹81.34 per litre.There has been an increase in fuel prices across metro cities in India after oil prices witnessed a rise throughout last week. Citizens have urged the Centre and Maharashtra government to reduce the fuel prices in the city. “Fuel prices have increased for the second day in a row this week. If the government does not do anything immediately, the price of petrol could cross ₹92 in Mumbai. The Central and state government should immediately take some action as the constant increase in fuel prices is difficult for residents financially as we are trying to recover from the pandemic,” said Ankita Sinha, an Andheri resident. In 2018, when fuel prices increased across cities in India, the Central government had reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petrol-price-in-mumbai-up-to-91-32-l-diesel-rises-to-record-8160-101610650837578.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Cannot hear petitions challenging rejection of poll nomination forms: Bombay HC||Putting to rest questions on whether the high court (HC) was in a position to entertain petitions that challenge rejection of nomination forms by returning officers, a full bench of the Bombay HC has observed that it cannot do so in light of article 243-O (b) of the Constitution and cannot be considered in the scope of article 226 as well. The full bench comprising of chief justice Dipankar Datta, justice AS Gadkari and justice GS Kulkarni in their judgement have, however, held that allowing a challenge in a writ petition regarding rejection of nomination form to contest an election may not always amount to intervention, obstruction or protraction of the election. A division bench, while hearing petitions filed by disgruntled candidates whose nomination forms for Bhose grampanchayat elections in Solapur were rejected by the returning officer (RO), was informed that their nomination forms had been rejected arbitrarily and hence sought to set aside the same and to allow the candidates to contest the election or stay the elections till the petitions were decided. After hearing the petitions and on the objection to the maintainability of the petition by the state, the bench referred the petitions to a larger bench seeking clarity on whether such petitions could be heard by the HC. The questions before the larger bench were as follows: Whether a challenge in a writ petition to rejection of nomination form to contest an election and granting the relief claimed by setting aside such order of rejection would amount to intervention, obstruction or protraction of the election or is it a step to facilitate the process of completion of election? Second, whether rejection of nomination form would attract the provisions of article 243-O (b) of the Constitution of India? And third, which of the two previous orders of the court in similar cases represented the correct view in law? While the counsels for petitioners contended that courts could hear such petitions in the absence of proper redressal mechanism, the state held that as per the Constitution, the court could not hear the petitions as the redressal for the aggrieved candidates was in the form of election petition after the conclusion of elections. After hearing the submissions, the bench, however, held that such a petition could not be entertained in view of clearly applicable article 243-O (b) of the Constitution which provides that no election to any panchayat shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority. The court also observed the lack of provision related to the appeal against rejection and said, “If indeed the issue is so serious that ROs are inefficient and incapable of discharging the solemn duty entrusted to them, it is for the state legislature to make appropriate provisions in the Maharashtra Village Panchayats (MVP) Act, 1958.” The full bench concluded its judgement stating that petitions against rejection of nomination papers prior to polls are not maintainable and the same ‘represents the correct view of law’. In light of this, the full bench directed the division bench to decide on the issue of the candidature of the petitioners in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cannot-hear-petitions-challenging-rejection-of-poll-nomination-forms-bombay-hc-101610650653191.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu confirmed in Maharashtra districts of Beed and Nanded; state death toll soars to 3,378||Avian influenza, or bird flu, is spreading to more parts of Maharashtra. On Thursday, samples of poultry birds from Beed and Nanded districts tested positive for the virus. Pune’s Western Region Disease Diagnosis Laboratory (WRDDL) has confirmed the cause of the birds’ deaths in both districts to be the H5 strain of bird flu. The state laboratory also said crow samples from Nashik and Nanded districts had tested positive for bird flu.On Thursday, 382 bird deaths were reported from different districts in Maharashtra, pushing the count to 3,378 across the state. Of these, 331 are poultry birds (namely, chickens). This is in addition to nearly 15,000 poultry birds that were culled to contain the spread of avian influenza after cases of bird flu were confirmed in Parbhani and Latur districts. As of Wednesday, bird flu cases had been confirmed in Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed and Latur districts.“As soon as the samples confirmed bird flu, the district administration declared an alert zone within a 10-kilometre (km) periphery of the areas where mortalities of poultry birds and crows were reported in Beed, Nanded and Nashik districts,” said state animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh.Of the 331 poultry bird deaths reported on Thursday, 110 are from Nagpur; 86 from Chandrapur; 50 from Satara; 47 from Latur; 25 from Gondia; 10 from Yavatmal; and three were reported in Raigad district. In addition, mortality has been observed in 44 other birds in Amravati, Solapur, Nashik, Yavatmal, Nandurbar, Pune and Jalgaon districts. Bird flu has led to mortalities in birds like herons, sparrows, parrots, crows and peacocks. Approximately eight peacocks died at Hinganghat in Wardha district, said officials.In Beed and Nanded, culling of birds will start only after receiving a confirmation from the ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal, a nodal body for testing bird flu cases. Samples have already been sent to the national laboratory and results are awaited, Singh said.“The Centre has allowed implementing a containment plan in the respective districts if a report from the state laboratory comes positive for bird flu. However, it has restricted the administration from starting culling of poultry birds, saying it can be started only after receiving a confirmation report from ICAR-NIHSAD,” said Singh.Considering the seriousness of the situation, the state government on Wednesday empowered all district collectors to immediately implement containment plans if they suspect bird deaths are due to avian influenza.According to the containment plan prepared by the Centre, the local administration will cull poultry birds within a one-km radius of the particular poultry farm where bird deaths have been found due to avian influenza. A surveillance zone within a periphery of 10km will be created, which means no birds can be sold or purchase in this area. As a precaution, the particular village where the affected poultry farm is situated will be declared a prohibited area, which means no one can enter or come out of it, including local villagers. A medical team must be set up to examine locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-confirmed-in-maharashtra-districts-of-beed-and-nanded-state-death-toll-soars-to-3378-101610650533170.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Amid other leaders’ complaints, NCP won’t ask Munde to resign||State social justice minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde may not have to quit from his post, amid allegations of rape by a woman. The NCP took the decision in a late-night meeting of core committee members as leaders from other parties alleged the same woman had tried to “honeytrap” them too, said insiders.Earlier in the day, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the allegations against Munde were serious and the party will have to take a decision. However, he would discuss the issue with his senior colleagues before reaching a conclusion. Pawar’s statement was seen as an indication that the party leadership may ask Munde to tender his resignation. Munde said he was ready to accept any decision taken by the party. In a copy of a complaint uploaded on her Twitter handle, the woman mentioned that Munde made sexual advances towards her without her consent since 2006. “He (Munde) promised to get me launched as a singer in Bollywood,” the complaint states. Following the post, Munde issued a public clarification on his social media account and said that the woman and her sister, with whom he was in a relationship with, were blackmailing him since 2019. Her brother is also involved in the alleged conspiracy, he said. Pawar told reporters: “The allegations being made against Munde are serious. Being a political party, we will have to discuss it and take a decision considering everybody’s views. Munde has explained the matter in detail and it is my responsibility to convey it to the senior leaders and take the next step as soon as possible. I don’t think this should be delayed.”However, leaders from other parties, too, made similar complaints as Munde. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former MLA Krishna Hegde accused the same woman of harassment for years and filed a complaint with the Amboli Police. “The woman used to call and say we are in a relationship, but I kept avoiding her. It started in 2010 and continued till 2015. I blocked her many times, but then she used to call me from another number. I didn’t know her intention, so I did some background check and found out things were not very right. But didn’t want to come out and say anything about a woman, as it also didn’t concern me because I never met her. But when this episode of Mr Munde came to the fore, I realised she is a serial offender. I felt this needs to be stopped and so registered an official police complaint,” Hegde said.The woman refuted the allegations on her Twitter handle. She said, “I was never involved in any honey trap activity as alleged. Infact Mr. Krishna Hegde started the conversation with me. He met me at the birthday party of Mr. Pratap SirNaik (MLA). The allegations made by Mr. Krishna Hedge is false, bogus and baseless.”Another leader Manish Dhuri from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) also alleged the woman tried to honeytrap him by calling him to her flat in Andheri a few years ago. He felt that someone else was also present at the flat, and left her house. Dhuri also filed a complaint with the Amboli police. In view of the allegations, senior NCP leaders felt that asking Munde to step down without any investigation was not right. “There was a possibility that the same would be repeated with others as well,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.The meeting was held at Praful Patel’s residence in south Mumbai where state NCP chief Jayant Patil, Supriya Sule, Anil Deshmukh, Sunil Tatkare, Nawab Malik, Hasan Mushrif and Rajesh Tope were present. Later, Munde was also called to join the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-munde-may-have-to-step-down-ncp-chief-says-allegations-serious-101610649272985.html

Instead, the young farmer has been at Delhi’s Singhu border for the past 50 days and is among the protesters who haven’t returned to their homes even once. For over a fortnight now, Karanpreet has a new duty – carrying out fumigation drives at the protest spot.“What is the point of going back to our village if we lose our livelihood? We have postponed the wedding for now. We will not return till the three farm laws are repealed,” he said on Thursday while carrying a fogging machine across the protest spot stretching up to several kilometres. He is also a part of the security patrol team at Singhu protest site.Farmers from the Mianpur village in Rupnagar district of Punjab pooled in money to buy the fogging machine. Surinder Singh, 37, who has also been on the protest site since November 27, said, “We had operated similar machines in Punjab during Covid for sanitizing and fumigation purposes so we knew how to operate it. The villagers pooled in ₹31,000 to buy the machine and it has been here for two weeks now.”Surinder also said that they had decided to buy the machine after noticing the sanitation issues at the spot. “One of the major concerns that emerged during this agitation was maintaining sanitation and cleanliness. We have teams who engage in cleaning and sweeping of the roads. The fogging drive is carried out by the two of us,” he said. While the engine of the machine runs on petrol, the farmers mix diesel with the disinfectant to fumigate. The farmers insist that they have consulted with doctors in their village before taking upon the drive.Every day, the two farmers wear a PPE suit and carry the fogging machine along the seven-eight kilometre stretch on the Kundli highway twice a day. “To operate the machine for an hour, we need at least 90 litres of diesel along with the additional charges of disinfectant which brings the total cost to around ₹6,000 per day. Other villages from several districts of Punjab and Haryana came forward to help with these costs,” Surinder said.Chajju Ram, 65, a protesting farmer from Sisla village in Kaithal district of Haryana, said, “There are a lot of flies and mosquitoes around which caused discomfort and posed health risks. The fumigation has helped us.”Officials from North Delhi Municipal Corporation said in a statement that the Public Health Department is also carrying out fogging and fumigation at the protest spot at regular intervals to check the mosquito menace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/draped-in-ppe-suits-farmers-carry-out-fumigation-drives-at-singhu-101610648192067.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Nod for protest can’t be given as prohibitory orders in place, police inform HC||The Delhi Police told the Delhi high court that AAP MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlena cannot be granted permission to protest outside the residences of home minister Amit Shah and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal as political gatherings are prohibited by the state disaster management authority, DDMA, till January 31.The police also said their commissioner had taken out a standing order in 2018 with respect to the protests at important places in accordance to the orders passed by the Supreme Court. They added that prohibitory orders have been issued under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for the entire central Delhi where the two residences are located.The submissions of the police came in response to a plea by two AAP leaders, challenging the denial of permission by the police to hold protests outside the homes of Shah and Baijal.The matter was listed on Thursday before justice Prathiba M Singh but no hearing took place as the counsel for the police had sought an adjournment as the proceedings were to be held in person at the court. The counsel urged the court to list the matter for hearing via video conferencing.In their affidavit, the police have also said protests in the national capital can only be held at two locations -- Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan -- which are designated for the purpose and nowhere else.However, in view of the DDMA notification of September 2020, which was extended from time to time and now stands extended till January 31, no political gatherings of any number of persons is permitted in the national capital.Both AAP MLAs wanted to stage a sit-in protest outside the residences of Shah and Baijal on December 13, 2020, to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, but they were denied permission. They were detained by police the same day along with some other AAP leaders, for attempting to protest at the two sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nod-for-protest-can-t-be-given-as-prohibitory-orders-in-place-police-inform-hc-101610647892402.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Govt schools flag concerns over teachers on Covid duty||With thousands of teachers still deployed on Covid-19 related duties across the city, officials at several government schools have raised concerns of staff shortage ahead of the school reopening next week, after a gap of 10 months.The Delhi government, on Wednesday, had allowed schools to call in students of classes 10 and 12 from next week so that they can prepare for the upcoming board examinations.According to the government teachers’ association, at least 10,000 to 12,000 of their colleagues are on Covid-19 duties, including door-to-door surveys, vaccination drive, and identification of travellers from abroad at the airport, among others. They include primary teachers, trained graduate teachers (TGTs), and postgraduate teachers (PGTs). While TGTs can teach up to class 10, PGTs are eligible to teach classes 11 and 12.Officials at several schools said it would be difficult for them to reopen when they are short of hands. The principal of a government school in west Delhi’s Madipur, on condition anonymity, said all their science, mathematics and social science teachers (TGTs) are currently on Covid duty. “We have one guest teacher each for science and mathematics, and there are four sections of class 10. We will have to divide one section into four in order to maintain social distancing. How can one teacher look after 16 sections? Besides, there is none available to teach social science,” the principal said.The principal of another government school in Karawal Nagar, also on condition of anonymity, said, “Twenty-eight of our 33 permanent teachers are currently engaged in Covid-related work. This time, the reopening of schools will require more staff as we will have to divide classes into smaller sections to maintain social distancing. We are struggling to figure out a way to make do with so few teachers.”Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of government school teachers’ association, said they will write to the government to relieve teachers of classes 10 and 12 from Covid duty. “It will be a mere formality if schools reopen without sufficient staff. We can’t call students back to schools after 10 months and not have enough teachers to guide them.”Officials at the Delhi government’s education department said efforts are being made to help schools reopen amid the pandemic. “We are trying to provide all possible help to schools before they reopen. Guest teachers have also been provided in many districts to bridge the gap. The zonal and district education officials are also taking several measures to help schools,” one such official said, on condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, some deputy director education (DDE) offices have started asking schools for a list of teachers on Covid-19 who are required in schools. For instance, the DDE’s office of zone west-A has asked schools under its jurisdiction to provide such a list by Friday evening.Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar, said the school has provided the names of teachers they needed for reopening. “We welcome that the DDE’s office has sought details of the required staff from us.” At least 20 teachers from her school are in Covid-19 related work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-still-on-covid-19-duty-govt-schools-raise-concerns-over-school-reopening-101610647833290.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||‘Vehicles, unclean household fuels major CO sources’||New Delhi: Vehicular emissions and the use of unclean household fuels are the major sources of carbon monoxide (CO) in Delhi, a study conducted by the Union ministry of earth sciences and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) has found.The study, which focuses on the sources of CO in Delhi and Mumbai, recorded the levels of the pollutant during the Covid-19 lockdown — when vehicular movement, industrial operations and other financial activities were restricted severely — and compared it with emissions on regular days, when all of these sources were operational and contributing to emissions.The findings show that the total CO emissions in Delhi during the Covid-19 lockdown showed an 86.39% drop compared to regular days, as opposed to a 62.14% fall in Mumbai. It also showed that the biggest reason behind this reduction, especially in Delhi, was restrictions in traffic movement.In the Capital, CO emissions from vehicular movement fell from 31.01 gigagram/month (Gg/month) on regular days to just 3.1Gg/month during the lockdown. The use of unclean household fuel was the second biggest CO in Delhi contributor, adding 1.35 Gg/month when no curbs were in place. Notably, however, this number showed no deviation even during the lockdown.“The major sources of CO in Delhi were transport and household during normal time. Transport was completely shut during the lockdown except for vehicles from law enforcement agencies, emergency services and that of essential supply chains. Not more than 10% of total vehicles were on the road, as also cross-checked with the total sale of petroleum products,” the study reads.CO, a colourless and odourless gas, is highly toxic and produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, oil, coal, woods, and natural gas. Scientists said CO was more harmful than particulate matter, as it has the potential to persist in the atmosphere for a longer period and does not get washed away by rain as PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 (PM with diameter less than 10 micrometres) do.“Exposure to CO is particularly harmful for the elderly, children and people who suffer from medical conditions such as heart and lung problems. We have examined the scientific processes responsible for the variability in CO during the Covid-19 lockdown in two of the largest megalopolises of India and the role of transport in influencing its concentration during the lockdown, and to understand the role of biofuel emissions,” said Gufran Beig of System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (Safar) at IITM, who headed the study.Beig added, “The CO data was collected from continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) under the Safar network.”Another important observation made by the study was the contribution of CO levels in Delhi’s air from neighbouring states. The findings of the study showed that because of the Delhi’s landlocked geography and the long lifespan of pollutant, the sources from long-range transport also added to CO levels in the city.“CO has a long life and hence a significant contribution can come by the long-range transport from surrounding regions. The long-range transport of CO in Delhi, whereas wind reversal combined with emissions from slum clusters in Mumbai played a major role during the lockdown period,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vehicles-unclean-household-fuels-major-contributors-of-co-in-delhi-govt-study-finds-101610647832894.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Spas allowed to reopen after almost a year by HC, with strict guidelines||The Delhi high court on Thursday allowed spas in the national capital to resume their operations, subject to a slew of guidelines to maintain social distancing. The court also said that the services offered by spas were similar to the salons that have already been permitted to function.Justice Pratibha M Singh also said that the livelihood of those working at the spas is getting affected for almost a year because of the closure and said that they can be allowed to operate with appropriate safeguards.According to additional standing counsel Anjum Javed of Delhi government, the court on Thursday ordered that spa employees maintain all the norms of social distancing and should thermally scan themselves every day. He said that the employees should be tested through RT-PCR every 15 days to rule out spread of Covid-19, in compliance of the court’s direction.A detailed order in this regard is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi High Court.The court was hearing two pleas moved by several persons who run spas, which have been shut since the first lockdown was enforced in Delhi. They had contended that when a maximum number of businesses, like salons, gyms, restaurants and bars, have been granted permission to reopen and even Delhi Metro restarted, then why were spas being forced to stay shut.The petitioners have also claimed that the spas in other states were running with full safety measures.The government had earlier opposed the plea stating that the government has decided not to allow the services of the spas because of the increasing number of the Covid-19 infections in the city.Listing out reasons for not allowing the spas to re-open, the government had also said that while the final decision of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had not been received on the opening of spa, the L-G had declined to grant the permission/ modify status quo as the number of cases were increasing and no physical distancing is possible in the spas.The spa owners, in their pleas, had contended that even in salons, the six feet distance cannot be maintained while questioning the permission granted to salons to operate. They also alleged that the Delhi government was discriminating against them as only their businesses had not been permitted to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/spas-allowed-to-reopen-after-almost-a-year-by-hc-with-strict-guidelines-101610647772036.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi airport gets genome sequencing lab to check for new virus strain||The Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) on Thursday got its first genome sequencing laboratory, which will be used to test samples of all travellers who arrive in the country and test positive Covid-19 upon landing.The samples will be sequenced to identify and check for a mutant variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that was first detected in the United Kingdom in early December and is thought to be more contagious.So far, since flights between India and the UK resumed on January 8, at least seven returnees from the counrty have tested positive at the Delhi airport after they underwent a mandatory RT-PCR test on their arrival. India had, on December 23, suspended all flights to and from the UK up to December 31 in order to stop the arrival of the new. This ban was later extended till January 7.The portable testing laboratory has been set up near the multi-level car park at T3 by SpiceHealth, a health care firm that has tied up with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), which is a constituent member of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) recently announced by the Union health ministry.The laboratory was inaugurated by Dr VK Paul, member, NITI Aayog and chairman, National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC).Dr Shekhar C Mande, director general of the CSIR, who was also present, said the launch of the genome-sequencing lab at the airports will be “a game-changer”. “I compliment SpiceHealth for being instrumental in introducing the dry swab direct RT-PCR testing developed by CSIR-CCMB, at SpiceHeath’s mobile labs,” he said.Avani Singh, CEO, SpiceHealth, said early detection will be crucial to stop the spread of new mutant viruses from potentially entering the country. We are working relentlessly with a range of authorities while offering them all possible support to implement this on-ground, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-airport-gets-genome-sequencing-lab-to-check-for-new-virus-strain-101610647711919.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt gives ₹938 crore, says BJP ‘bankrupted’ MCDs||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the Delhi government would provide ₹938 crores to the three municipal corporations for paying salaries to their employees, adding that the civic bodies have gone bankrupt because of the corruption by councillors of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Sisodia, who is also the finance minister of Delhi, said the BJP-led central government owes ₹11,500 crore to the MCDs but has not paid a penny because of a “lack of trust”. He said that the MCDs owe the Delhi government ₹6,276 crore but they are in no position to repay the amount.The BJP and the MCDs dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and said that the Delhi government owes them much more than what was announced on Thursday for the financial year 2020-21.“Seeing the suffering of the MCD employees, the Delhi government has arranged ₹938 crore. This money was meant for government departments and other schemes. I appeal to the employees to ensure that the money is not embezzled by MCD councillors. The BJP came to power (in MCDs) 14 years ago, and it has completely bankrupted the three municipal bodies. Now, only ₹12 crore are left in the bank accounts of North MCD, while East MCD has only ₹99 lakh in its account,” Sisodia said at a press conference.Thousands of employees of the civic bodies, mostly from the North corporation, are on an indefinite strike since January 7 against non-payment of their salaries for the last 3-5 months.Sisodia said the government arranged the money for the MCDs despite a shortage of funds.“The MCDs owe the Delhi government ₹6,276 crore. The BJP bankrupted the MCDs to such an extent that they don’t even have the money to pay their own employees. Now, we are the ones giving them money again, despite facing shortage of funds. The MCDs should get ₹11,500 crore from the Centre. But the BJP leaders in the Centre believe that it cannot be given to them because the leaders in charge of MCDs will embezzle the money. Even the Centre is not giving funds because of the rampant corruption and lack of trust despite CM Arvind Kejriwal writing on several occasions to the Union government to provide funds to the MCDs,” the deputy CM said.Sisodia said despite loss of revenue due to the pandemic and the fact that the government had no liability, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered funds to be arranged because he believed that the employees must be paid for their work.He added, “The chief minister said that it is not the fault of the employees --- if they’ve worked, they should be paid. Therefore, he took this decision to help the employees and ordered that funds should be arranged. Even the Delhi government is short of funds. We’ve also had to stop many schemes to budget. However, ₹938 crore is being given for the salary of the employees, despite the Delhi government having no such liability.”While the MCDs have claimed that the Delhi government owes ₹13,000 to the civic bodies, the Aam Aadmi Party government has alleged misappropriation of funds to the tune of crores in the MCDs and maintained that it has paid all funds to the civic bodies.According to civic officials, there are around 1.5 lakh municipal employees in Delhi. The north corporation alone has a workforce of around 55,000 and it spends nearly ₹360 crore every month on salaries and pensions. There are nearly 35,000 employees in EDMC and its expenditure on salary is approximately ₹184 crore per month. The SDMC has about 45,000 staff and it spends nearly ₹210 crore on salaries every month.AP Khan, convener, Confederation of MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of 45 unions of civic employees in three municipalities— said that the financial assistance being given by the state government was “not sufficient” and the agitating employees will go ahead with their plan of taking out a march from civic centre —headquarters of north and south corporations— to the Delhi Secretariat on Friday (January 15).“The government decided to release funds only after our ultimatum to gherao the secretariat and boycott the vaccination programme. It’s a small amount which will barely help the three civic bodies in releasing only one month’s salary. We want a permanent solution to the crisis. This move is only to divert our attention from the real issue of fund crunch in MCDs,” he said.The BJP leaders in MCDs said the government already owed the money and that the amount was not enough.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “They have made this announcement to divert attention from agitating employees. The funds they are giving is already earmarked for the third quarter of the financial year 2020-21. They are yet to pay our dues for the second quarter. In the second quarter of the fiscal year 2020-21, we were supposed to get ₹1,024 crore from the government but got only ₹400 crore. ₹624 crore are still due. When will we get this amount?”East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor Nirmal Jain said, “The Delhi government has decided to give ₹938 crore to all the three MCDs. If they further decide to deduct to adjust previous loans, as they claim, it will be reduced further and will literally serve no purpose,” Jain said.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said, “The government is terrified because now the public knows that they are deliberately stopping funds of the municipalities. They have to pay our dues of ₹13,000 crore.”The commissioners of the MCDs did not comment on the matter.BJP leader and spokesperson RP Singh said the state government should first release the funds that it owes the MCDs. “The local government owes the corporations about ₹13,000 crore. Of the ₹13,000 crore, they have so far paid only ₹9,068 crore,” he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “Firstly, the allegations are baseless and we condemn the kind of words the deputy CM has used for elected leaders in a press conference. The funds released by Delhi government are not even equal to one-third of the funds the Delhi government owes to MCDs for the current financial year. It is also irresponsible of him to say that the Central government is not giving to MCDs the per capita annual grant which it gives to most other civic bodies in the country because the Centre doesn’t trust municipal leaders. Truth is that the 14th Finance Commission on whose recommendations the Centre gives annual grant to civic bodies has kept Delhi’s municipal corporations out of its preview. The 14th Finance Commission’s recommendation says Union Territories which have local state government will not be eligible for the grant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-releases-rs-938-crore-for-mcds-say-bjp-s-corruption-has-rendered-civic-bodies-bankrupt-101610647352412.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||5th sero survey begins in Delhi, likely to last 10 days||State government officials have started collecting blood samples of over 27,000 people for a fifth round of the serological survey to assess the population’s exposure to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).This is the first serological survey being undertaken after the October round, and will likely reflect the surge in infections that took place in November, when Delhi saw its third and worst wave of Covid-19, when the Capital dealt with a severe spike in new cases and deaths. During that month, Delhi added its highest single-day case spike, adding 8,593 infections on November 11, as well most single-day deaths, logging 131 fatalities on November 18.The collection of samples began on Monday and is likely to last for 10 days.“Around 100 samples will be collected from each ward for the current round of the serological survey. This time, sample collection will take longer because of the vaccine roll-out,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.In the October round of the sero survey, the population level prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 virus increased only marginally from the previous round by 0.4%. This meant that there were only 4,000 infections per million population between early-September and mid-October.In the round before that, the recorded seroprevalence actually dropped four percentage points from 29.1% in August. This fall was likely due to a change in the technique of sample collection.However, the authors of the sero survey also warned of diminishing antibodies in those who had the infection months ago.“During the previous round of the survey, we realised that antibody levels were becoming undetectable in people who had the infection months ago. Some studies show that antibodies can last up to 90 days. So, this time around, we will be able to judge the exposure during the November surge,” said one of the researchers involved in the project, who asked not to be named.In June-end , 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This shot to 29.1% among the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 people sampled in September. In October, it had gone up to 25.5% with a sample size of 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fifth-sero-survey-kicks-off-in-delhi-101610647351930.html
15-01-2021||Delhi||Early lockdown in Delhi had less impact on air quality: Report||The first Covid-19 lockdowns led to significant changes in urban air pollution levels in Delhi and other major cities around the world, but the changes were smaller than expected, a new study by an international team of experts led by the University of Birmingham has concluded.Published in ‘Science Advances’ on Thursday, the researchers evaluated changes in ambient NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), O3 (ozone) and fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations arising from lockdown emission changes in 11 global cities: Beijing, Wuhan, Milan, Rome, Madrid, London, Paris, Berlin, New York, Los Angeles and Delhi after developing new corrections for the impact of weather and seasonal trends.The experts discovered that the beneficial reductions in NO2 due to the lockdowns were smaller than expected, after removing the effects of weather. They also found in parallel that the lockdowns caused (weather-corrected) concentrations of ozone in cities to increase.Scientists at Birmingham used machine learning to strip out weather impacts and seasonal trends before analysing the data: site-specific hourly concentrations of key pollutants from December 2015 to May 2020.The study also revealed that concentrations of PM2.5, which can worsen medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease, decreased in all cities studied except London and Paris.Lead-author Zongbo Shi of the University of Birmingham said: “Rapid, unprecedented reduction in economic activity provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of interventions on air quality. Emission changes associated with the early lockdown restrictions led to abrupt changes in air pollutant levels but their impacts on air quality were more complex than we thought, and smaller than we expected.“Weather changes can mask changes in emissions on air quality. Importantly, our study has provided a new framework for assessing air pollution interventions, by separating the effects of weather and season from the effects of emission changes,” the expert added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-lockdown-in-delhi-had-less-impact-on-air-quality-report-101610636612255.html
15-01-2021||Mumbai||NMIMS files complaint, forms panel to look into online harassment complaints from Mumbai students||Days after at least four female students of the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) complained about being harassed online during their exams, the management has set up a committee to look into the complainants. This matter came to light last week after some students of NMIMS took to Twitter to share screenshots of messages shared by proctors on the personal mobile phones of the female students. Four proctors working with Mercer Mettl, the online examination conducting company hired by NMIMS, was fired by the company after receiving reports of harassment. In a statement released late Tuesday night, a spokesperson for NMIMS said, “The university has formed a committee to resolve the issue. The deans have also spoken to students on the issue.” In their complaints to the institute, students shared screenshots of several messages and photos shared by some proctors after the exam on students’ personal phone numbers. In the current academic year, examinations for all education institutes had to be conducted online due to the ongoing lockdown and in most cases, colleges have hired an independent software company to conduct exams and proctor the same online. Mercer Mettl was hired by NMIMS and has been working with the institute for more than a year now. During exams, a student has to appear for the exam by keeping their computer camera on, to avoid any malpractices during the exam.Students also have to show his or her identity card at the start of the exam on the camera and shared that these accused proctors picked students’ mobile numbers from this identity card and contacted the students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nmims-files-complaint-forms-panel-to-look-into-online-harassment-complaints-from-mumbai-students-101610567364297.html
