The announcement was made during a press conference organised to highlight the achievements of the university over the past six months, since acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi took over from suspended vice-chancellor Yogesh K Tyagi, who was accused of misconduct and dereliction of duty. “There will be a mixed (online and offline) convocation ceremony on February 27. The postgraduate students who completed their course in 2019-20 will be awarded degrees along with MPhil and PhD scholars who completed their course the same year,” Joshi said.The acting V-C announced that the university will soon launch an academic cooperative system, “Vidya Vistar Scheme (V2 Scheme)”, between DU colleges and departments and remote Indian universities. “Through the initiative, DU has proposed to make available its faculties, library, and other academic facilities to the partnering institutions for academic cooperation and collaboration. The V2 Scheme has already started; letters have been sent to all colleges and departments. Now, we are giving them the freedom to choose,” Joshi said.“We are talking about all our online resources for now. In the coming years, we will see if we can invite researchers to our campus and share our labs and other facilities with them,” he said.The acting V-C also announced the launch of another initiative, “DU encyclopedia”, from March this year to mark DU’s 100th anniversary. “We are constituting a committee that will be involved with the 100-year history of DU and work on the DU encyclopedia. There are so many people who have been a part of DU, but we don’t know much about them since we weren’t working in that direction,” he said.Addressing the media, Joshi said the university has constituted a 42-member committee for the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. DU also issued digital degrees to 19,821 students and provisional certificates to 3,885 students in the past six months, the acting V-C said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/du-to-hold-convocation-ceremony-on-feb-27-in-blended-mode-101611080815805.html

Teams from a number of vaccination centres and health officials overseeing the city’s inoculation drive said at least 1,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccines have been wasted in Delhi so far. Health officials attributed the wastage mostly to fewer people coming up to get the jab. “As per the guidelines, vials of both Covishield or Covaxin have to be used and discarded within four hours of being opened. Each Covishield vial has 10 doses, and the low turnout is only adding to the wastage. If the hesitancy was not as high as it actually is now, then people would be queueing up and we could have grouped them in slots of 10 to reduce wastage,” said a senior health official. Although Delhi government officials said it has not yet compiled data on the total number of doses discarded so far, health department officials said initial estimates indicate that on an average five doses are being wasted at the 81 vaccination centres each day. At Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital, 9 doses were wasted on Day One, 6 on Day Two and 2 on Day Three. The Delhi State Cancer Institute discarded 14 doses in three days. “Today (Tuesday), we had to open the third vial for just one beneficiary and the rest of the nine doses had to be discarded as no one else came by the end of the day. We have strict instruction from the government that no body can be turned away from the vaccination centres,” said Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer at Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI).But, Dr Ravinder Pal Dhingra of Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, another vaccination centre, described it as “a number game”. “Even if the turnout is as high as 91 at a centre, still 9 doses would go waste on that day. It’s mostly a game of numbers. But it is true that if more people were willing then we could have scheduled 9 more people for the day and shifted the remaining ones to the next day. At our hospital, we have vaccinated around 39, 49 and 55 people in the past three days,” said Dhingra. A senior doctor from Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital said the government anyway already considers that 10% of the total stock of doses would go in vain either through wastage or breakage.“However, to ensure that not too many doses go waste, after about mid-day we wait for a few people to come in before opening any new vials,” said the doctor.To ensure fewer doses are wasted each day, many centres started walk-in vaccination from Tuesday. While Ram Manohar Lohia hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical Colleges allowed this from Monday, several others such as DSCI and GTB hospital started it from Tuesday. “Today, 24 healthcare workers got the jabs at our centre as per the list generated by the Co-WIN app. But, by 4pm our district administration allowed us to vaccinate even those healthcare workers who are not in the list but are registered and verified in the Co-WIN app. So, to ensure minimum wastage of doses, I took the shot and so did two additional medical superintendents and one senior doctor of the hospital. So, only one dose was discarded today,” said Dr Sweta, the nodal officer of the vaccination programme in GTB hospital. A senior official from the Ministry of health and family welfare said the shelf life of unopened vials of both Covishield and Covaxin is six months from the date of manufacturing. “Irrespective of which vaccine is being used, every vial, once opened has to be used within four hours at a temperature between 2 and 25 degrees Celsius. Open vial policy has not been allowed in India yet,” said the ministry official on condition of anonymity. With 75 of the 81 centres giving Covishield jabs, Delhi primarily is using these doses over the Covaxin doses which is being used in only six centres. While each vial of Covishield has 5ml of the vaccine with each dose being 0.5 ml, which is equivalent to 10 doses, a Covaxin vial contains 20 doses. Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the government should consider increasing the duration of usage of each opened vial of Covishield vaccine from the existing 4 hours to 6 hours. “Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Covishield vaccine says an opened vial can be used up to a maximum of 6 hours. The government should allow centres which are able to maintain the desired room temperatures to use vials up to 6 hours instead of 4,” he said John suggested that the open vial policy can still be considered for Covaxin, but stated the same can never be possible for Covishield.“Reusing the vial is called open vial policy. Covishield vaccine contains live virus because of which no preservative can be added to it. Therefore, an open vial policy cannot be allowed. But, Covaxin does not contain any live virus and it has a preservative called 2-phenoxyethanol. Therefore, the government should declare an open vial policy for Covaxin at least. This will ensure reduction in wastage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hesitancy-causes-wastage-of-1-000-vaccine-doses-in-delhi-say-health-officials-101611080696750.html

With 4,936 beneficiaries receiving the shot, Delhi saw the highest turnout in terms of absolute numbers on Tuesday. However, the number only accounted for 48.75% of the 10,125 health care workers who were scheduled to get the jabs, with the government having increased the number of beneficiaries each of the 81 sites could vaccinate, data seen by HT suggested. In comparison, 4,319 people had received the jab on Saturday – the day the nation-wide roll-out happened – accounting for 53.3% of the beneficiaries selected to receive the vaccine. On Tuesday, the turnout was much higher for the centres administering Serum Institute’s Covishield – 50.6% — when compared to the centres administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – 27.4%, as per data. With more centres administering Covishield, 15 of the 16 adverse reactions noticed were in those who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot on Tuesday. All the adverse events were minor ones such as rashes, headaches, and fever. In the three days since launch, 12,853 health care workers have taken the shots, out of a targeted 26,397, government records showed. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said, “The current turnout is not low if one compares it with other states and the overall average in the country. Confidence building will take some time. The Delhi government is leaving no stones unturned in confidence building drives and increasing the turnout ratio in vaccination centres.” On Tuesday, the CoWIN app was tweaked, allowing the ‘add beneficiary’ option to incorporate walk-in immunisation for registered health care workers leading to an increase the number of people getting vaccinated across the city. Max hospital, Saket, and BL Kapur hospital both saw 100% immunisation on Tuesday. The number of people who received the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences jumped to 55 on Tuesday from just eight a day ago. Hospitals that have consistently seen low turnout, like Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital , asked its senior faculty members to come forward and take the shot. “The hospital has issued a circular asking senior doctors and administrators to take the shot and motivate those working under them also to take it. Four of the senior doctors from the hospital received the shot today. This should instil confidence about the vaccine, among others,” said a senior doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which had seen 24 people being vaccinated on Monday and 28 on Tuesday. A similar communication was sent to doctors at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur as well. “The glitches in the app did create problems, but it is the hesitancy in the minds of the people that is leading to a low turnout at the hospital. So, we have asked senior doctors to lead by example and motivate those working under them to also take the vaccine,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity. There were just nine people vaccinated at the centre on Tuesday, down from 20 people vaccinated on Monday. Of the 11 revenue districts in Delhi, the highest turnout (62.18%) was in south-east Delhi, where 638 of 1026 targeted beneficiaries were vaccinated, closely followed by the north-west district (61.72%) where 899 out of 1,457 targeted beneficiaries were vaccinated. Shahdara district vaccinated 169 (27.25%) of a total registered group of 620 persons -- the lowest among the 11 districts, showed government data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/senior-docs-told-to-take-covid-shots-as-vaccination-number-falls-101611080695810.html

The farmers, however, turned down the proposal but assured the police that it would be a peaceful protest and stay confined to only the outer Ring Road in Delhi. While special commissioner (intelligence) Deependra Pathak led the police team from Delhi, seven leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, including Balbir Singh Rajewal and Darshan Pal, represented the farmers.Since no consensus could be reached on issue, another meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday morning, a senior Delhi Police officer who was present in the meeting said, requesting anonymity.“We told the farmers representatives that the tractor rally may lead to law and order issues and traffic and security chaos and asked them to cancel it. Since they refused, we suggested that the rally could be shifted to the KMP expressway. They remained adamant on taking out their rally for 50-60 kilometres on Delhi’s outer ring road,” the officer said.This was the second meeting between the police and leaders of farmer unions since Monday, when the Supreme Court refused to pass any order on the Delhi Police’s plea for stopping the tractor rally. On a plea by Delhi Police, the top court had said that entry of farmers into Delhi is a law and order problem and any decision in this regard should be taken by the Delhi Police. Tuesday’s meeting was held at a farmhouse in Delhi, nearly a kilometre away from the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws. The farmers’ agitation entered 55th day on Tuesday.“The farmer leaders in fact asked the police officers if they would be granting permission for their Kisan Tractor Parade on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road about which the officers said that they were not the deciding authority. The officers showed their concerns regarding law and order, traffic, and security issues that our tractor rally may cause. However, they were assured that our rally will be peaceful and it will not disrupt the official Republic Day parade,” said Harpreet Singh Kahlon, convener of Krantikari Kisan Union.On Tuesday, the farmers also shared the route map of their proposed tractor rally and said that the parade will touch all the borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be participating in the tractor rally, they said.“Our parade will be similar to that of the national parade where tableaux of different states are shown. The farmers of different states would be showcasing their traditional style of farming and agricultural tools they use in agriculture. All tractors will have the national flag and our rally will start after the parade on Rajpath is concluded,” said Parmeet Singh, a farmer from Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-urge-farmers-to-shift-tractor-rally-to-kmp-eway-101611080575841.html

The authority in December last year had floated an EOI for preparation of techno-feasibility study and a detailed project report for the project which will provide better short-distance mode of commute and also serve as feeders for the metro system in the city.The authority, in its EOI, had specified three routes – New Bus Adda to Ghaziabad railway station, Mohan Nagar to Vaishali, and Electronic City to Vaishali – for the ropeway project. GDA officials said they are focussing to connect the New Bus Adda metro station to the Ghaziabad railway station as it is one of the most congested stretches in the city. “Two proposals had come for the EOI, but there were some technical issues. We have now refloated the EOI. We intend to connect the New Bus Adda metro station to the Ghaziabad railway station as commuters often face traffic issues after de-boarding metro. The per kilometre cost of the ropeway is estimated about ₹70-80 crore and will be much lower than the per kilometre cost of extending the metro,” said Ashish Shivpuri, authority’s chief architect and town planner. The New Bus Adda metro station area is also proposed to be a multi-modal transport hub as one of the stations of the Regional Rapid Transit System is also proposed nearby and will be connected to the metro train system.The officials said that the proposed project will involve 30% of funds each from the Centre and the state government, while the local agencies will share the remaining 40% of its cost. Once the DPR gets prepared after selection of an agency, the authority will send it to the state government for final approval. The project is being envisaged as the UP chief minister had told the officials during a video conference in December to find out alternate modes of local commute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-development-authority-reinvites-eoi-for-urban-passenger-ropeway-project-101611080455802.html
19-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Realtors, buyers ask govt to reduce stamp fee||Realty estate developers and homebuyers on Tuesday demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government reduce the stamp fee levied on execution of registry of apartments.They met state government minister for state (independent charge) for stamp fee, registration and court fee Ravinder Jaiswal in Noida. They argued that the measure would help in reducing the economic burden on the housing sector badly hit by Covid-19.To illustrate the degree to which the pandemic had hit business, the Gautam Budh Nagar stamp and registration department had a target of collecting ₹3,148 crore in revenue in the financial year 2020-21. However, the department so far could only collect around ₹550 crore. This was much lower then the ₹1,700 crore revenue it earned in 2019-’20 against a target of ₹2,597 crore.“We requested him to reduce the stamp fee from 5% to 2%, not to levy the 1% registration fee and abolish the agreement fee of 1%,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of confederation of real estate developers association of India (Credai), West UP, who met the minister.“We have been demanding the reduction for a long time,” said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension flat owners’ welfare association that also met the minister.“The Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh governments had already reduced the stamp fee in view of the crisis. Reducing it will not only help the sector increase registrations, but also the government through increased revenue,” said Subodh Goyal, secretary, Credai-West UP.Jaiswal said the government will consider the demands.In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway among other parts of the Gautam Budh Nagar district the stamp and registration department levy 5% of total property cost be it flat, plot, house or other property in stamp fee at the time of execution of a lease deed or registry required to transfer the property title. The UP government had in February, 2019 started charging 1% of total property cost as registration fee removing old rule under which only ₹20,000 registration fee was in place. It also made it mandatory that a buyer and developer will execute agreement after paying 1% stamp fee for execution for this legal process required to start a property sale. It means the state charges 7% of total property cost in stamp fee in GB Nagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-realtors-buyers-ask-govt-to-reduce-stamp-fee-101611080335829.html

The corporation will generate funds for the ₹239-crore project by floating bonds, officials said. The corporation officials said that the process for floating of bonds is likely to get complete by March this year. Under the treated water supply project, the civic body has planned to make use of about 40 millions liters per day (MLD) of treated water from its sewage treatment plant (STP) at Indirapuram and supply it through pipelines to the industrial units in Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, the officials said. “The DPR for the project is complete and tenders will be floated once the bond is listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. At present, the treated water from STP at Indirapuram drains out through a water channel and is taken to river Hindon. The officials said that once the water supply project gets complete, the industrial units will make use of the treated water and thereby a lot of fresh groundwater will be saved. “From the STP, we will lay pipeline through which many units will get treated water for their,” Tanwar added. It was in July, 2019, when the Uttar Pradesh cabinet had approved the proposal of floating bonds by the municipal corporations of Lucknow and Ghaziabad to fund their infrastructure projects. During the approval, bonds totalling ₹350 crore, including ₹200 crore for Lucknow and ₹150 crore for Ghaziabad, were proposed to be floated after a process. On December 2 last year, the UP chief minister had participated in an event when the bond of Lucknow municipal corporation got listed on the BSE. The CM then announced that the next would be turn of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-readies-dpr-for-treated-water-supply-to-industries-project-101611080215788.html
19-01-2021||City||Ghaziabad: Sample positivity rate falls below 1% in January||Ghaziabad’ sample positivity rate for Covid-19 fell below 1% this month, which is the lowest it had been since the peak of nearly 20% in June.Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes patients would giver more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples could be higher than total positive cases. However, officials say there may be another reason for fewer cases: People were not coming forward.The Ghaziabad health department had deployed 20 teams across the district to search and find positive cases.“Each team can take up anything between 100-150 samples per day. But they are not getting a positive response from residents. This could be a reason for the drastic reduction in positivity rate, but also the transmission of infection too has come down since December,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. In December, the sample positivity rate was 2.99% with 3034 positive reports out of a total of 101,496 that month. During November, the rate was 4.14% with 4822 positive reports out of a total of 116,399 tests that month. Till January 18, the rate stood at 0.96% and it would take a sudden spurt in cases, like the UK variant of the virus (not yet reported in Ghaziabad) that is said to be 70% more transmissible, for it to surpass December, said officials.In December, there were 372 positive reports out of total of 38836 tests. No fatalities since Dec 29The official state figures for the district say that the last death due to the virus was reported on December 29 and since then the total fatalities had not gotten over 102. According to the official figures of the district health department, the district conducted an average of 2572 tests per day in first 18 days of January which yielded a daily average of about 20 cases. During December, the average number of daily tests was about 3323, and 31 positive cases per day on average. “The arrival of vaccine has sent a positive signal among the population, while the severity of infection has also reduced substantially (through better reporting and care). However, it will take more time for everyone to get vaccinated. Even after vaccination, it takes about one and half months for immunity to develop. So, till the time people get vaccinated, they must continue with Covid-19-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Although the cases have come down, we still advise people to get themselves tested of they have Covid-like symptoms. The infection has come down but not finished.” With the start of vaccination drive on January 16, only 379 people were given the shots while another lot of 11846 have been identified to get the shots on January 22, 28 and 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-sample-positivity-rate-falls-below-1-in-january-101611080155752.html

The case was registered at Rabupura police station in Greater Noida on Monday even as the makers issued an unconditional apology on Monday, saying they did not intend to offend sentiments of any caste, community, or religion. The complainant, Balbeer Azad, is a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) member and social activist. Azad, 60, said the depiction of men in Uttar Pradesh police uniform using abusive language and drinking in their van prompted him to lodge the case. “They have made derogatory comments against lower caste people which is not good for our society. The web series has also depicted Hindu deities in a bad light with an ill intention,” he said. He also said the depiction of the Prime Minister in the web series amounts to an “attack on the democratic system”.‘Tandav’ is a nine-episode Hindi political web series streaming on Amazon Prime Video from January 15.In his complaint, Azad, who said a part of the web series was shot in his native Rabupura area of Greater Noida, has named series director Ali Abbas Zafar; Aparna Purohit, head of India Originals at Amazon Prime Video; producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra; writer Gaurav Solanki; and actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Sunil Grover .The police registered the case against the seven people named in Azad’s complaint under Indian Penal Code sections 153-A(1)(b) (promoting enmity), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings), 505 (1)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause fear or alarm), and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Information Technology Act.“The complainant has alleged that the web series invokes Dalit insult, caste differences, hurts religious sentiments, and also shows people holding constitutional posts in bad lights. The police are conducting investigation into the matter,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.On Sunday, the police in Lucknow had registered an FIR against Purohit, Abbas, and Mehra, among others, on charges of promoting enmity between different groups and insulting religion. ‘Tandav’ director Zafar on Monday tweeted an apology. “The cast and crew of Tandav take cognizance of the concern expressed by the people and unconditionally apologise if it has unintentionally hurt anybody’s sentiments,” he said.There was no immediate response from the officials of Amazon Prime Video to the fresh case. They did not respond to an email for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fresh-case-filed-in-greater-noida-against-makers-of-web-series-tandav-101611079675777.html
19-01-2021||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad most polluted, AQI plunges into severe||Two days after a slight improvement in air quality, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad slipped to “severe” levels once again on Tuesday. The three cities also emerged as the most polluted cities in the country, with Ghaziabad topping the air quality index (AQI) chart, followed by Greater Noida and Noida, respectively. This is the fifth time this year that the cities were breathing the worst air -- previously it was on January 1, 2, 15 and 17.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Noida’s AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Tuesday was 432 against 363 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 434 against 360 or very-poor a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 436 against 381 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the weather department, the wind direction changed form easterly to westerly and north-westerly due to which the speed dropped leading to poor ventilation conditions. “The wind speeds dropped almost to calms as the wind directions changed from comparatively warmer easterly to north-easterly and westerly. Whenever, the wind directions changes, the wind speed drops due to which the particle pollutants also increase and lead to spike in pollution levels,” said an official at India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the pollution monitoring agencies however, the air quality is likely to improve as the wind speed is likely to increase thereby improving the ventilation. The major pollutant or PM2.5 in the region also spiked from three times the safety standards on Monday to five to six times higher than the standards. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Tuesday was 334.71 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) against 220.43 µg/m3 on Monday. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 314.38 µg/m3 against 232.86 µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 346.63 µg/m3 against 220.11 µg/m3 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve slightly over next two days. “Surface winds are north-easterly and low, Surface winds are forecasted to shift in direction from easterly to north-westerly and gain in speed. The ventilation coefficients are likely to improve significantly from tomorrow and AQI is likely to improve to the middle to lower end of Very Poor on 20th January. AQI is forecast to further improve to the lower end of the Very Poor to Poor category on 21st January. Marginal deterioration of AQI to Very Poor category is forecasted on 22nd January,” said SAFAR on Tuesday. The weather department has forecasted that the temperature would drop by two to three degrees over the next two days due to the wind direction. Dense fog conditions may, however, improve and increase visibility from around 50 metres in the morning to about 200 to 300 metres, especially around open areas and expressways. According to the weather analysts, the wind speed is likely to increase over next two days and reach around 20 kmph by Thursday. This will lead to drop in the mercury and improve the visibility. “The cold waves will not return. The minimum and maximum temperatures may however drop below two degrees of the season’s average,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. He added that the mercury may further drop and NCR may see slight drizzling around January 22 and 23 due to a western disturbance. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature in Noida were recorded at 8.9 degrees Celsius against 9.7 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was 20.5 degrees Celsius, against 20.1 degrees Celsius. The average minimum and maximum for NCR, based on Safdarjung observatory was recorded at 6.9 degrees Celsius and 20.4 degrees Celsius, both one degrees below the season’s average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-ghaziabad-most-polluted-aqi-plunges-into-severe-101611079615735.html

"We appeal them to come forward and get themselves vaccinated so that they would be safe as well as their family members. Those who remain absent during the vaccination will be considered subsequently but those who refuse to take the vaccine may not get the same free of cost later,” said Panigrahi.Also read: 9 states, UTs among better performing areas during Covid-19 vaccination driveLast week, more than 15,000 multi-purpose health workers had announced that they would not take the Covid-19 vaccine jab as their demand for promotion had not been met. The multi-purpose health workers have been demanding to be designated as Upakendra Janaswasthya Adhikari.Panigrahi said on the third day of the vaccination drive, as many as 14,291 health workers were immunized in 182 sessions against the government target of 16,261. No vaccination took place in the districts of Bargarh, Boudh and Gajapati.Meanwhile, the second consignment of Covishield vaccine consisting 3,34,500 arrived in Bhubaneswar by a SpiceJet flight. The vaccines will be despatched to various district headquarters in the next three days.

19-01-2021||Mumbai||Beware, Mumbai recorded more cybercrimes in 2020: Data||There were more incidents of cyber crimes in the city in 2020, with spikes in new kinds of online crimes like fraudulent job listings. Statistics released by Mumbai Police show 2,435 registered cases of cyber crime in Mumbai in 2020, which is higher than the 2,225 cases registered in 2019. Of these, 207 or 8.5% were detected in 2020. In 2020, cases of obscene messages and morphed images sent through email, messaging apps and social media increased. Compared to 239 reported cases in 2019, there were 247 cases in 2020, of which 91 were detected. In 2019, 104 of the 239 cases were detected. A marginal increase was also recorded in cases of man-in-middle (MIM) attacks, email spoofing, phishing and hacking. A sharp decline was seen in reported cases of fake online profiles — 30 in 2020 compared to 61 in 2019. Spikes were noted in cases of sexortion (sexual exploitation by coercion), e-shopping fraud as well as fraudulent classifieds and job listings. Clubbed as “other” in police data, there were 1,545 such cases in 2020 and 78 were detected. In 2019, 1,087 cases were reported and 112 were detected.According to Mumbai Police, 558 cases of fraud involving debit and credit cards as well as one-time passwords were registered in 2020, of which 21 cases were detected, while in 2019, 775 cases were recorded, but more cases (40) were detected.Mumbai Police attributed the dip in detection rate to restrictions on movement during the lockdown. Regular police work could resume only in the last quarter of 2020. “We have improved the detection rate at cyber police stations in the last three months and it’s almost 100%. Our aim is to save people’s money, hence we put every possible effort when cyber crime victims approach us. We urge people to report cyber crime within two hours of occurrence so that their money can be saved. Last year we managed to save nearly ₹15 crore for cyber crime victims,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber). She further added that Mumbai Police had recently busted gangs that were operating across states and carrying out online frauds.Requesting anonymity, one police officer from the cyber crime wing of Mumbai Police said acquiring case-related information from telecom companies and internet service providers is challenging. They also said that creating fake profiles is easy since email service providers do not ask for details that would be used to verify someone’s identity. Another reason for the low detection rate is that most email servers are located outside India, said an officer. Detection rates may also be low because many cyber criminals hide their locations using virtual private network (VPN) providers.Cyber security advocate Vicky Shah said, “If the RBI want to curb cyber crime, the present settlement cycle must be delayed at least by 24 hours. Also, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India should make the process of issuance of mobile SIM cards more rigorous as mobile numbers are linked to bank accounts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/beware-mumbai-recorded-more-cybercrimes-in-2020-data-101611079256447.html
19-01-2021||City||Shubman was confident of win at Gabba, says father||The Gill family spent Monday night praying as all eyes were on the Indian opening pair of Rohit Sharma and their 21-year-old lad Shubman Gill during the deciding match of Brisbane Test cricket series. Even so, the nail-biting and prayers paid off when India took the Aussies by storm and pulled off an incredible win and bagged the series.Shubman, who scored a crucial 91 for the team in the second innings, had sounded optimistic on the phone with his father before the match on Monday night. “Shubi was very confident that India is going to win the match as the wicket was playing well. He promised me that he will give his best and help India triumph,” said Shubman’s father Lakhwinder Singh Gill, who celebrated the win with his wife Keart Gill at their Mohali house.Shubman, who scored his second fifty in the Test series on Tuesday, missed hitting his first Test century by nine runs when he was removed by spinner Nathan Lyon. His crucial knock came off 146 deliveries. “It would have been an icing on the cake if Shubi had scored a century in Brisbane. He was looking good throughout the innings. Nevertheless, India won the game and hearts of millions. Rishabh Pant did a fine job in the end,” added Lakhwinder Singh Gill, who has played an important role in shaping Shubman’s cricketing career.The opener made his Test debut at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the second match. With his solid performance and gumption in the Test series, India shattered Australia’s 32-year winning streak at the Gabba and sealed a 2-1 series win with three wickets in hand.Vikram Rajvir Singh, former Indian Test bowler and the last player from Punjab to play Test cricket, also lauded Shubman’s efforts and said, “What a brilliant start to his Test career. He looked so determined, skilful and confident in the middle. India’s opening slot is now booked for some years. Shubman is young dynamite and has a bright future. He is going to win big for India in the coming years. It is not easy to take on fast bowlers on Australian bouncy wickets and dominate, but Shubman has shown the grit. He is here to stay for a long time.”Shubman emerged as the highest scorer for India in the Brisbane Test match and now has an average of 51.8 in three matches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shubman-was-confident-of-win-at-gabba-says-father-101611079196327.html
19-01-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana poultry farmers move HC seeking relief||Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association on Tuesday approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking compensation for dead/culled birds due to the bird flu outbreak.The association in its plea said that compensation should be paid on the spot immediately after the culling is over or at the time of collecting birds from the owners, but no such relief was being provided to them.On January 8, avian influenza was confirmed at two poultry farms in Panchkula’s Barwala belt and the district administration on Sunday completed culling of 81,000 birds at three farms falling in the infected zone.Considered Asia’s second largest poultry belt with over 15,000 workers, Barwala and Raipur Rani have around 110 poultry farms, housing over 77 lakh poultry birds and producing one crore eggs daily. Nearly five lakh poultry birds have died so far.The association has also challenged January 11 order of Panchkula deputy commissioner which declared Narinder Poultry Farm in Kheri village a part of alert zone and animal husbandry department was given powers to carry out activities such as culling to control and contain avian influenza. A response on the plea has been sought by February 2, while ordering that till the next date of hearing no action be taken pursuant to January 11 order in this farm’s case.The plea also seeks quashing of Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (Revised-2021), which provides for stamping out of all the live poultry birds within the infected zone of 1km from the site of confirmed flu cases. It also seeks directions not to destroy the poultry feed kept at the farms and evolve a mechanism for early and “just compensation” to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-poultry-farmers-move-hc-seeking-relief-101611079143233.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Lockdown effect: Deaths on Mumbai’s railway tracks down by 65℅ in 2020||megha.sood@htlive.com The deaths on Mumbai’s railway tracks declined by 65% in 2020, as compared to year before that, owing to the restrictions imposed on traveling on the suburban railway network amid the lockdown. While 1,116 people died and 878 others suffered injuries on the suburban railway lines last year, 2,691 people lost their lives in 2019. The year had also witnessed 3,194 injuries. Data from Government Railway Police (GRP) reveals that of the 1,116 people who died in 2020, 983 were men, while 133 were women. According to the railways, around 6.5 million people travelled on locals in 2011 everyday. In 2018 the number rose to 8 million travelled on the city’s lifeline. After the nation-wide lockdown was imposed, the train services were suspended in March. It resumed in June for those working in the essential services, and later, women and lawyers were also allowed to travel, albeit during non-peak hours. In 2020, around 1.2 million commuters travelled by the locals. According to GRP, an average of seven people lost their lives on railway tracks everyday before the lockdown was imposed. However, during the lockdown, the average deaths per day came to around three. GRP figures showed that maximum deaths were recorded on the Central Railway. The number of commuters who lost their lives between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan in 2020 was 523, as compared to 1,763 deaths in 2019. On the Western line, 369 deaths were reported between Churchgate and Virar, as compared to 928 in 2019 on the same route. Officers said out of the total number of deaths, 730 died while trespassing, while 133 fatalities were of commuters who fell off the trains. One person died by falling off the platform, while two deaths were reported after commuters were hit by a pole while leaning out of a running train. Experts and activists said that though the railways are taking efforts to reduce the deaths, their efforts must continue till the number of fatalities reach zero. “Many illegal entry points have been closed. However, the railways should put up fences between the tracks which connect two platforms, as well to bring down the number of track crossings. It should also conduct more experiments with automated closed doors of local trains to minimise the problem of overcrowding and people falling off trains. Last year was an exception owing to the lockdown, but the numbers have always been alarming,” said Shakil Ahmed, a railways activist.

Its test report was confirmed by National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal.Ropar’s wildlife and forest officer Monica Yadav said the samples of dead bird were earlier sent to Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NRDDL), Jalandhar, following which the repeat samples were taken by Bhopal lab.“Though the bird sample has tested positive, there is nothing to worry as there are no symptoms of the flu in any other birds at the reserve. Moreover, we are thoroughly supervising birds’ activities in around 1-km area where the migratory bird was found dead,” she said.The officer added that the goose might have flown from Pong dam and collapsed while flying over the Siswan reserve.“Two teams of the wildlife department and another one from the animal husbandry department are continuously monitoring the area and conducting random sampling of birds at the reserve,” Yadav said.As many as 15 trap cameras have been installed in last six months over the wildlife area to keep a track of the migratory birds and animals.In the neighbouring Mohali district, the NRDDL had confirmed bird flu in samples from two poultry farms at Dera Bassi’s Behra village last Thursday, but the final confirmation from the Bhopal lab is awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/avian-influenza-migratory-bird-sample-from-siswan-reserve-in-ropar-tests-positive-101611079076260.html
19-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MP Kirron prefers close aides over experts in road safety panel||Member of parliament Kirron Kher has preferred her close aides over technical experts in the newly constituted road safety committee for Chandigarh.The committee has been formed under a mandate of the Union road transport and highways ministry issued through a gazette notification in September 2017. For Chandigarh, transport secretary Mandip Singh Brar issued the order of panel formation on January 14. It is entrusted with the task of monitoring road accidents data, identification and study of causes of road accidents, rectification of black spots and creating awareness about road safety.On Kher’s recommendations, Prabhloch Singh of the Human Rights Protection Group and MFP Federation, Mayank Mishra of Dr GC Mishra Memorial Educational and Charitable Trust and Sanjeev Vashisht of Sewa Bharti have been made members of the committee.All three have been associated with the MP and were part of her core team during the previous general elections.In addition to the three NGO members, the committee also comprises UT officials, including deputy commissioner, mayor, transport director, and senior superintendent of police.However, questioning the intent behind Kher’s recommendations, senior Congress leader and former Chandigarh MP Pawan Kumar Bansal said, “Kher should have nominated road safety experts like city-based Harman Sidhu of the ArrriveSafe NGO to the committee who can contribute actively and positively to Chandigarh’s road safety measures. Then it would not have mattered if the person was a close aide of the MP or not.”Kher couldn’t be contacted.The terms of reference of the committee include monitoring road safety activities in Chandigarh, road accidents data, identification and study of causes of mishaps, providing suggestions to the national/state road safety council, reviewing and monitoring work related to identification and rectification of black spots as per protocol and all road engineering measures, besides ensuring implementation of road safety standards and action plan with specific targets for accident/fatality reduction.The panel would also review speed limits and traffic calming measures to promote road safety campaign in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mp-kirron-prefers-close-aides-over-experts-in-road-safety-panel-101611079020287.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||51,068 crime cases registered in 2020 in Mumbai: Data||The lockdown owing to the Covid-19 pandemic has not impacted the overall registration of crimes in Mumbai much, reveals the data by Mumbai Police. According to statistics, 51,068 cases were registered in 2020 across 94 police stations in Mumbai, compared to 41,931 cases registered in 2019.Data further reveals that although thefts and other petty crimes were fewer in 2020 compared to 2019, the nationwide lockdown failed to contain murders and attempts to murder, as not much difference is seen in the crimes registered in 2019 and 2020.Police officers said the numbers can be attributed primarily to strict action taken against lockdown violators.The data showed that from January 1 to December 31, 2020, 148 murder cases were registered, whereas the number in 2019 was 165. Even attempt to murder cases showed an increase in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, 348 cases of attempt to murder were registered compared to 343 cases in 2019. There were 138 cases of chain snatching filed in 2020, while 156 such cases were reported in 2019.“As people were not moving out of their houses during the lockdown, crimes like robbery and house break-ins declined,” an officer added on conditions of anonymity.According to the police, 766 cases of rape were recorded in 2020, while 1,015 were recorded in 2019. Cases of molestation, too, saw a dip, with 1,943 cases in 2020 compared to 2,678 cases in 2019.S Chaitanya, deputy commissioner of police and Mumbai Police spokesperson said, “Overall the crime figures have declined owing to the preventive measures that we have taken,” Chaitanya added.A significant rise, however, was seen in the cases of motor vehicle thefts. The lockdown year saw around 2,801 vehicles stolen whereas, in 2019, 2,693 motor vehicle thefts were registered.“There were elections in Bihar, which was a prime reason behind the surge in motor vehicle thefts in the city, as many vehicles are stolen from metro cities and transported to Bihar for election rallies and other purposes,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/51068-crime-cases-registered-in-2020-in-mumbai-data-101611078956230.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Public bike-sharing cheapest mode for last-mile in Mumbai: Report||As cycling gains popularity across the world, a recent analysis shows that it could also prove to be the cheapest mode for last-mile connectivity in Mumbai.The recent analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI), India shows that while public-bike sharing (introduced at Mumbai metro stations) costs ₹2 for a five km ride, the same distance costs ₹5 in a BEST bus and local train (second class), ₹50 in first-class and ₹20 in a metro.It gets more expensive if one opts for an auto ( ₹60.67), a black and yellow taxi ( ₹74) or an app-based cab ( ₹115). The analysis has assessed the cycling speed to be around 6km per hour. The newly-introduced public-bike sharing scheme at the Versova and Jagruti Nagar metro station costs ₹2 per hour. For trains, the report looks at the pricing between the Churchgate and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) stations. First and last-mile connectivity — the beginning and end of a commute made using public transportation — has been a huge issue in the city.Prateek Diwan, senior project associate, urban innovative and integrated transport, WRI India said, “Public transportation becomes effective when commuters have a range of last-mile connectivity options, which is usually at a distance of about 2-5kms. Apart from being a low-cost mode of travel, cycling also allows commuters flexibility to change routes and is the most sustainable transport option.” Almost 35% of vehicular trips in India are short-trips (less than 5kms). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) development plan (DP) 2032 also states that 60% of the start and end of public transport trips are by walking and more than 80% of it is for less than 15 minutes, which effectively means that these trips, in conducive weather, can also translate to cycling trips.Pranav Naik, a Mumbai-based urban designer and a cyclist said, “Public bike-sharing will be more effective if there is a network and cycles are easily available at the different Metro and railway stations.” The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is implementing a 337km metro network in Mumbai and its adjoining areas, is also giving a lot of importance to cycling as an attractive last-mile option. Apart from introducing cycling in two metro stations, MMRDA has introduced e-scooters in Bandra-Kurla Complex. MMRDA has also planned cycle bays across all upcoming 200+ metro stations as part of its larger multimodal integration plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/public-bike-sharing-cheapest-mode-for-last-mile-in-mumbai-report-101611078836460.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro 2A, 7 may start operations by May, says Maharashtra urban development minister||Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde, on Tuesday, said that the government is looking at operationalising two metro lines - Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro 7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) by the end of May 2021. Shinde, on Tuesday, visited the Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) manufacturing unit in Bengaluru. The first coach for Metro-2A or the Yellow line will leave Bengaluru on January 23 and reach Mumbai’s Charkop depot on January 27, Shinde said.“The first six trains will reach Mumbai in the next six months. Post which, we will receive three trains every month. We have spent ₹8 crore for each coach, which is the first ‘Made-in-India’ metro train. If we had brought in an international company, we would have spent ₹10 crore per coach,” said a statement released by Shinde’s office.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had placed an order with BEML worth ₹3,015 crore for 63 trains. Each coach can carry 380 commuters. Shinde said that the trains are also enabled with driverless technology. “Though the trains are enabled with driverless technology, we don’t want commuters to feel unsafe. So initially, we will have drivers and introduce technology later on.”Mumbai got its first metro connecting the suburbs of Versova, Ghatkopar and Andheri in 2014. “In the next five years, Mumbai will have a 337km metro network. While the work slowed down after March 2020 owing to the pandemic, it has picked speed again and the government will work towards completing projects on time,” Shinde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-2a-7-may-start-operations-by-may-says-maharashtra-urban-development-minister-101611078596397.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Jail hospital ill-equipped to monitor Varavara Rao’s health, counsel tells Bombay HC||The counsel for P Hemlatha, wife of 82-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, on Tuesday, argued before the Bombay high court (HC) that though Nanavati Hospital had said that Rao was fit to be discharged, Taloja jail hospital does not have the wherewithal to continue close monitoring of Rao’s health. Hence, she said it would be better to allow the Telugu poet to go back home to Hyderabad where his condition could be closely monitored by Rao’s daughter and granddaughter, both of whom are doctors, as per the recommendations by the Nanavati Hospital.Senior advocate Anand Grover also informed the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale that the state government has submitted medical reports of all hospitals where Rao had been admitted since he tested positive for Covid-19, but the Sir JJ Hospital report of May 28 was not provided.Grover submitted that all the hospital reports provided to them had confirmed that Rao had an underlying condition which included urinary tract infection, hypertension, blood pressure, heart problems and low sodium levels, which had been arranged after Rao tested positive for Covid.Grover confirmed that Rao’s health had improved and also agreed to the recommendation of Nanavati Hospital that Rao was fit to be discharged. He, however, submitted that the question was whether Taloja jail hospital was competent and had the required expertise to closely monitor Rao’s condition. He added that the jail authorities were aware that they will not be able to monitor Rao’s condition, hence Rao’s wife’s petition seeking bail on medical grounds should be allowed.Grover further reiterated that Rao was willing to stand trial, and as he suffered from neurological issues, he should be allowed to go home temporarily to be with his family till the trial started.“Rao is 82 years old and if he is sent back to Taloja jail hospital, there is a likelihood that he will die,” said Grover. “He has to take 15 medicines every day for various medical conditions and ailments, hence even though he may be discharged from Nanavati Hospital, sending him back to Taloja jail hospital would not serve any purpose, as there will be lack of close monitoring and absence of facilities. There would be a recurrence of the underlying conditions and Rao will have to be admitted into a hospital again,” said Grover.After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the state government whether Rao suffered from dementia. The court also sought to know from Grover whether the court was competent to replace the view of the doctors at Nanavati Hospital. Grover replied in the negative and said that though the court could not go against the view of the hospital, the conditions post-discharge were such that it required interference by the court.Submissions on behalf of Rao will continue on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-jail-hospital-ill-equipped-to-monitor-varavara-rao-s-health-counsel-tells-bombay-hc-101611078416260.html
19-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram health workers who had missed vaccine jabs on first two days can take them on January 21||More than 2,100 front-line healthcare workers, who could not be inoculated on the first two days of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, will be allowed to take the vaccine jabs on January 21, officials of the health department said on Tuesday. Most of the workers did not receive proper communication through the Co-WIN platform, officials said, while some of them had refrained from the drive due to concerns over the vaccine safety.Due to the poor functioning of the Co-WIN platform, according to officials, many vaccine beneficiaries were not aware of the location to take the Covid-19 vaccine shot. The department has planned to set up nine additional vaccination session sites along with the 36 sites for the upcoming vaccination drive on January 21.“The teams are listing out healthcare workers who were left out in the last two drives. We are ensuring text messages get delivered timely to these health workers, by Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, through Co-WIN without any hassle,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.On January 16, during the launch of Covid-19 vaccines, only 408 of the 600 healthcare workers listed for vaccination had turned up, due to which the beneficiary list was extended to those who were not listed for vaccination on the day. On the second day of the drive, held on Monday, only 2,881 of the 4,836 healthcare workers listed for vaccination had turned up.Until now, at least 2,147 people have been missed out. Since it is a voluntary exercise, many healthcare workers have also been reluctant to come forward. The drive has started in private hospitals too, where the vaccination coverage has been almost 60%, while in the case of public healthcare workers, it stood at 30% on Monday.Officials said that including workers who had missed out will not only increase the coverage but also reduce pendency. For this reason, the department has decided to set up additional session sites.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “In total, there will be at least 45 session sites now for January 21. Decisions are yet to be taken on streamlining the vaccination process so that the majority of healthcare workers are covered in public and private set-ups.”Due to technical glitches on Co-WIN, the health department has been manually compiling the data entry at the vaccination sites. The state health department has permitted districts to keep manual records of individuals taking the vaccine jab at sites and updating it later on the platform. Yadav said that multiple changes are likely to happen in the Co-WIN platform to make it functional during the vaccination hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-health-workers-who-had-missed-vaccine-jabs-on-first-two-days-can-take-them-on-january-21-101611077757520.html

The driver of the vehicle, who was its sole occupant, managed to escape unhurt. No injuries were reported in the incident.As per the fire department, their officials received a call about the incident around 9.39am. Following this, two fire tenders, one each from Sector 29 and Bhim Nagar fire departments, were rushed to the spot.“The driver noticed smoke coming out of the front of the vehicle and parked his car on the side of the road. Within minutes, the entire front portion of the vehicle was engulfed in flames,” said Rajbir Singh, fire safety officer, Gurugram fire department. According to Singh, short-circuit was the cause of the fire.“Our fire tenders were able to douse the flames just in time. The entire front portion of the vehicle was gutted. Flames had started reaching the back of the car. However, the firemen at the spot started the dousing operations and ensured that the flames did not reach the fuel tank at the back. They prevented the vehicle from exploding,” said Singh, adding that the dousing operations continued till 10.25am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/suv-catches-fire-under-rajiv-chowk-flyover-none-injured-101611077757037.html
19-01-2021||City||Farmers with tractors arrive at Haryana border for Republic Day rally||Farmers with tractors from areas such as Nuh, Rewari, Gurugram, Jhajjar, Rohtak and parts of Rajasthan started gathering at the protest sites on the Haryana-Rjasthan border on Tuesday morning, ahead of Republic Day, when the protesters plan to hold a tractor rally in Delhi. Protestors said they have conducted reconnaissance of the neighbouring villages from where they can move towards Delhi through fields without running into police barricades. Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said, “We have identified 20 such stretches from where we can cross the borders without running into the police. These routes, however, are more time-consuming. Since the police will not allow us to enter Delhi via the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway, we have identified routes that will enable us to cross the border,” he said. Nehra added that the heads of the neighbouring villages are supporting the protestors, sometimes even financially. Many farmers who cannot afford to leave their fields have sent their wives and children to take part in the protest and join the tractor rally on Republic Day. Rashid Ahmed, a protestor from Nuh, said that they have been part of the protest since December 12 and will try to bring at least 1,000 tractors for the rally in Delhi. At least 20 tractors have already reached the Masani village near Dharuhera on Delhi-Jaipur highway. “We are approaching all the farmers of our area to join the tractor rally to show our strength. The government is unwilling to take our issue seriously and waiting for us to call off the protest. However, we will carry on the protest even if it takes another six months,” he said. Protestors are expecting a total of 3,000 tractors to take part in the rally and have formed teams of at least 15 people who are visiting nearby villages every day. The police said they are well prepared to control the law and order situation. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said that farmers at Sangwari Chowk broke the police barricades once and tried to move towards Delhi. However, they did not succeed. “We will take all the necessary steps to stop them. If required, we will use water cannons and tear gas to control the protesters. Extra forces have been deployed at all the stretches connecting the district and the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-with-tractors-arrive-at-haryana-border-for-republic-day-rally-101611077756573.html
19-01-2021||Gurugram||HSVP to resolve road issues in sectors 81 to 95 on priority||The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has decided to resolve all land-related issues in sectors 81 to 95 in order to make roads operational soon. Officials will visit the multiple points where roads are blocked or lying incomplete on Wednesday. They said that pending payments would be made and legal issues discussed with landowners to make out-of-court settlements.Senior HSVP officials held a meeting with the stakeholders, land acquisition officials, and the Town and Country Planning officials on Tuesday to discuss the matter in detail. As per the details shared by HSVP officials, issues need to be resolved for at least eight roads — obstructions on the stretch connecting Rampura Road on NH-48 with the Gurugram-Pataudi Road, a stretch in front of Park View Ananda, a land dispute at Sati Chowk, dividing roads of sectors 81/86, sectors 94/95, sectors 82/82A, sectors 90/93, sectors 81A/82A and sectors 86/90. HSVP officials said that due to obstacles on these roads, the residents in these sectors are facing problems in commuting as they have to traverse longer distances or risk using incomplete roads. “We have been getting a lot of complaints due to incomplete roads in these sectors. As such, all efforts are being made to ensure the infrastructure is completed. A detailed discussion was held today and we are going to reach out to the owners to resolve legal issues,” said Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram. He said that incomplete roads in developing sectors would be completed on a priority so that residents of these areas don’t face further problems. A site visit will be conducted on Wednesday morning to check the status and discuss the matter with owners, said Yadav. HSVP officials said that they have also identified all obstacles at these points and the authority will carry out demolitions in the coming weeks. “There are some small structures that can be removed but, on some roads, the buildings are larger as there is a school, a temple and other such structures. Resolving these will take time, but these will also be shifted eventually,” said Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, HSVP, adding that the problem faced by residents of Vipul Lavanya in Sector 81 would also be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-resolve-road-issues-in-sectors-81-to-95-on-priority-101611077755921.html
19-01-2021||Gurugram||Population of migratory birds up at Najafgarh jheel, finds census||Eighty one species of waterfowl, including 13 species red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), were recorded in a census at the Najafgarh jheel. The number is up from 54 species, including six red-listed ones, recorded in a similar exercise last year. In addition to species diversity, the census also recorded an increase in the total avian population at the wetland — from 9,453 birds in 2020 to 27,673 birds this year.Conducted on January 19, as part of the 2021 International Waterbird Census (IWC), by Netherlands-based non-profit Wetlands International, the census also recorded healthy populations of winter migratory birds, with 51 of the 81 species recorded on Monday being non-resident birds. The census also recorded three unusual sightings, of an osprey, greater-white fronted goose and common crane, species which are rarely seen in Delhi-NCR. The Najafgarh jheel is located in a natural depression in South-West Delhi, about 10 kilometres from the Gururgam-Rajokri border on National Highway-48. It is fed by the Najafgarh drain’s sizable catchment area in Gurugram, which includes villages such as Chandu, Dharampur and Daulatabad, all of which were surveyed for the census on Monday. TK Roy, an ecologist and the Delhi state coordinator for the IWC, said, “We have been conducting censuses at important wetlands across north India and have noticed that in most places, the population of birds is declining year on year, due to climate change, deficient monsoons, shorter winters, late snowfall and other reasons. Najafgarh is one of the few places where both population and biodiversity are growing in large numbers. One can say that birds in Delhi-NCR are preferring this wetland than others in the region.” However, the substantial increase in population count isn’t just due to the quality of the wetland, Roy added. “We tend to typically survey exposed areas of the wetland, but this year, we have done the census in three teams, which also covered previously unexplored parts of Najafgarh. In these patches, where there is little human disturbance, we found a very healthy population of water birds,” he said. A report shared with HT on Tuesday noted a large increase in the population of migratory bar-headed geese, of which 2,774 specimens were recorded this year, up from 1,337 last year. Also found in larger numbers were Eurasian coots, whose population has grown from about 3,738 specimens last year to 6,428 this time around. Similar increases in the flocks of common teal and northern shovelers were also reported. Among red-listed migrant species, the census reported the presence of black-tailed godwits, common pochards, greater spotted eagles, northern lapwings, Eurasian curlews and ferruginous ducks, in addition to other species, including common and red-listed ones, which are Delhi-NCR residents. This includes the black-headed ibis, painted stork, Oriental darter, woolly-necked stork, black-necked stork and Sarus crane. Roy drew attention to the fact that Najafgarh still lacks the official wetland status, an issue which has been pending for the past five years after a National Green Tribunal order called for the water body’s protection. “After all these years, the matter is still pending in the court, and there has been little progress in notifying this water body as a wetland. This must be done in order to conserve Najafgarh’s rich biodiversity and to promote scientific research,” said Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/population-of-migratory-birds-up-at-najafgarh-jheel-finds-census-101611077755497.html
19-01-2021||Gurugram||Low visibility, rash driving led to 116 accidents in the last two weeks||Low visibility and rash driving have led to a spate of accidents on Gurugram roads over the last two weeks, with at least 116 incidents being reported from 15 spots, according to the police data.As many as 38 incidents have taken place at four spots on the Dwarka Expressway, of which three were fatal ones. Nine persons have been severely injured and three persons died in these accidents, the police said.According to the police data, 375 deaths were reported on Gurugram roads last year, from as many as 675 accidents. In January 2020, 85 accidents and 45 on-road deaths were reported, which were majorly caused due to poor visibility, said officials. In February 2020, 88 accidents and 37 deaths were reported.The police said that deploying personnel and PCR vans at accident-prone spots has failed to help decrease the accidents, as commuters fail to notice stationed vehicles, steep turns or potholes due to zero visibility during the early hours.On Sunday night, a 38-year-old pilot of Indigo Airlines was killed in an accident in Sector 114, when the car he was driving was rammed by a speeding truck that was being driven on the wrong side. The police said that the truck driver was driving rashly despite low visibility due to fog.In another incident on Sunday evening, a pedestrian died after he was hit by a speeding motorist near Gwal Pahari on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the data includes minor accidents as well, wherein pedestrians and cyclists were hit while crossing the road and while moving on the wrong side of the road. “We have deployed police personnel from all police stations concerned across 33 kilometres of the Delhi-Jaipur highway, starting from the Sirhaul toll plaza to Bilaspur toll plaza, to ensure no truck is stationed on roads at night,” he said.Rao said the have asked those running eateries to ensure that vehicles are not parked on the expressway and to allot parking spaces for truckers, failing which they would face action.However, the police also admitted that rash driving remains a major concern.The Road Safety Authority (RTA) is also analysing the data to pinpoint reasons for the accidents and suggest solutions.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, said that potholes on stretches go unnoticed during fog and the impact of two-wheelers hitting a deep pothole is similar to that of a head-on collision. “We have started distributing reflective jackets to cyclists, bikers and pedestrians to increase visibility in fog and dark, which will reduce road accidents. We have planned to reduce accidents this year and are working towards different strategies to make roads safer for the commuters. We have studied the stretches prone to accidents and have recommended changes to departments concerned,” she said.Yadav said they are coordinating with other civic agencies and the police to crack down on road violations and improve security measures, such as increasing road signage, to reduce confusion among commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/low-visibility-rash-driving-led-to-116-accidents-in-the-last-two-weeks-101611077696017.html

But one of the members, Bhupinder Singh Mann, later backed out of the panel.The SAD would utilise the forthcoming parliamentary session to hold meetings with like-minded parties to work towards “restoration of the federal structure” in the country, Badal said.He also asked the BJP government not to use the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against farmer leaders, saying the NIA was used to counter terrorism and should not be “misused”.Badal said the Congress legislators and officers who were “discriminating” against the opposition and even getting “false” cases registered against them would have to face the music once the SAD comes to power in 2022.“We will form a judicial commission once we assume power and ask it to submit a report on all false cases registered by officers within three months. Prompt action will be taken against such officers”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-laws-sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-says-sc-appointed-panel-can-t-resolve-crisis-101611075578514.html

The time for registration will be from 9am to 12noon and the patients can register themselves on the telephone numbers 0172-2534082 (reception) and 0172-2534070 (enquiry).Upon calling the tele-registration counter, patients will be given a token number; no walk-ins will be entertained. Also, the institute has capped the number of patients to 50 per day in the wake of the pandemic.The Union ministry of health and family welfare had asked state governments and UT administrations across the country to take steps to reopen dental colleges by January 4 after the Dental Council of India (DCI) had made the suggestion. The dental institute of PU had then asked all faculty members to report to the college from January 5. During the lockdown, only emergency cases were attended to at the college.In clinical procedures where an RT-PCR is required, the concerned doctor may request so from the patient. No attendants will be allowed except with patients with disabilities and children. Patients visiting the institute have been asked to wear masks and maintain social distance.The college has already directed the departments to ask postgraduate students to report to the institute. It is likely that final-year undergraduate students and interns will be asked to report too from February.Meanwhile, the dental college has asked its staff members to mark their attendance in the register in the morning and evening till the time biometric is not operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/soon-tele-registration-for-patients-at-panjab-university-s-dental-institute-101611076256607.html

Even diesel price has touched the ₹75 mark for the first time in the city. Records have also been broken in the satellite cities of Panchkula and Mohali (see box). Fuel prices have been going up by a few paisa every couple of days, and according to local dealers, the trend is likely to continue in the coming days.“The hike is out of the dealers’ control. Policies of the central government are causing it,” said Arjan Singh, president, Chandigarh Petroleum Dealers Association.Association’s former president Col HS Kapoor (retd), who owns a filling station in Sector 21, said: “The hike also affects the dealers adversely, as our commission is not fixed. We have to keep a higher working capital for purchasing the same amount of fuel. Chandigarh has a majority of government employees, who have a fixed fuel allowance. With higher rates, we sell a lower volume of fuel and end up earning less.”Sales down by 30% in MohaliSales have been hit in Mohali too. “Our sales have gone down by 30% this month due to the hike. With the price of crude oil likely to rise further, fuel prices will go higher and our sales will be hit further,” said Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali Petroleum Dealers Association.“The fuel price hike will inflate prices of commodities brought by road from other cities,” said BL Sharma, general secretary, Chandigarh Transport Association, while citing the example of onions, which come from Maharashtra and have become dearer in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fuel-prices-at-all-time-high-across-chandigarh-mohali-and-panchkula-101611075835986.html
19-01-2021||City||42% beneficiaries have skipped Covid vaccine shot in Chandigarh tricity area||Only 58% of the beneficiaries identified to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in the tricity since the launch of the nationwide drive on Saturday have got their first dose till Tuesday. Mohali district lags behind at 43%, while Panchkula and Chandigarh have recorded 63% and 61% target achievement, respectively. Experts cite hesitancy among people as the reason, but are confident that the numbers will go up as confidence in the vaccine grows. As the drive resumed in Chandigarh on Tuesday, the percentage of beneficiaries who received the shot dropped to 43.5% against 75% recorded on the first day.Only 174 health workers were inoculated at the four sites against the target of 400. Additionally, 30 defence personal from the air force station were also vaccinated. Meanwhile, one minor adverse reaction was reported at the civil hospital in Sector 45.Only 548 of the targeted 900 people have got their first jab so far. When asked about the poor response, Dr Deepak Chawla, nodal officer of Covid-19 immunisation at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, said there are apprehensions among people about the side effects. “There are no reports of any major adverse impact across the country. All senior doctors have taken the jab and more people will come forward soon,” he said.Dr Pankaj Malhotra, who is monitoring Covishield trial volunteers at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said: “Whenever there is a new immunisation programme, there is hesitancy among people. However, people should not be concerned about mild symptoms after getting the jab, as these point to the fact that the vaccine is doing its work.”Meanwhile, the UT administration on Tuesday received its second batch of Covishield, which contained 11,500 doses. Earlier, 12,000 doses were received for 5,400 health workers. Numbers slide in PanchkulaIn Panchkula, too, the target achievement went down from 95% on Saturday to 61.5% on Tuesday. Of 1,131 health and frontline workers, 713 have got the jab. The target is to cover 6,219 in the first phase, said Dr Meenu, immunisation officer, Panchkula. On Tuesday, 430 of 699 beneficiaries were inoculated at five sites across the district. The authorities had organised a camp at the civil dispensary in Sector 4 on Monday as well, where only 16 of the targeted 150 health workers turned up.Dr Meenu said the drive is voluntary and it takes time to convince people. “Doctors are coming forward and senior health officials have got vaccinated. It will boost the morale of others as well, especially Class-4 employees who are a bit reluctant,” she said, adding that the response in Pinjore was good, where 96 of 118 people were vaccinated.Meanwhile, 65 adverse events have been reported following immunisation to date. “All cases were minor, wherein people reported mild body aches. No admission was required,” said Dr Meenu, adding: “Almost every vaccine causes mild reactions. There is nothing to worry.”Mohali picking up paceMohali district, which has the poorest recovery rate across the tricity, is also lagging behind in the vaccination drive, with only 224 of the targeted 520 health workers covered so far.However, on Tuesday, the achievement rate touched 167% as 167 people were vaccinated against the target of 100 at three sites, including two private hospitals. It had stood at 11% and 19% on Saturday and Monday, respectively. Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, Mohali, said: “People are coming forward gradually. Some of them were hesitant, but we motivating them and now they have been vaccinated.” In the first phase, 11,284 beneficiaries are to be vaccinated in the district. Dr Amit Kumar Mandal of Fortis Hospital, who was the first to be vaccinated at the hospital on Tuesday, said: “A lot has been discussed and debated about the vaccine. It’s about time we take the jab and stay protected. There are two ways of getting the immunity — one is getting the infection and recovering from it and the other is getting the vaccine shot and developing the immunity, which is a wiser option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/42-beneficiaries-have-skipped-covid-vaccine-shot-in-chandigarh-tricity-area-101611075716169.html

While the first day, Saturday (January 16), recorded 58% of the target beneficiaries being vaccinated, the second day (January 19) saw only 48% of the beneficiaries turn up for vaccination. Currently the phase one of the nationwide Covid vaccination is underway exclusively for healthcare workers. The vaccination sites in the district were also brought down from 31 hospitals to 28 hospitals. With a huge number of adverse effects being reported following vaccination and technical glitches in sending messages to beneficiaries, the second day of vaccination saw only 48% or 1,404 out of the 2,900 beneficiaries being vaccinated on Tuesday. On the first day on Saturday, 1,802 beneficiaries of 3,100 targeted were vaccinated which took the percentage to 58%. The vaccination was shut down for two days, Sunday and Monday, due to the technical problems in the central government’s application “Co-WIN” which was exclusively developed to register and keep a tab on beneficiaries. Archana Patil, state director of health services, had said on Saturday evening, “The vaccination drive would begin next week because we need to check the reported technical glitches. We will prepare a report and present it to the Centre. The central health ministry insists on using the Co-WIN app.” On Tuesday, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) shut down three of the four private hospitals for vaccination as the “Co-WIN” site did not function. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “The three private hospitals were not used for day two of vaccination because there are some technical problems at these centres.” The three hospitals which were removed from the list were Deenanath Mangeshkar, Noble hospital and Bharti hospital. Six vaccination sites were used on Tuesday with two sites being created at the PMC’s Kamala Nehru hospital. The rural administration (15) and PCMC (8) did not change the number of vaccination sites operated on day two. Ruby Hall Clinic was the only private hospital which carried Covid vaccination in the city on Tuesday. In terms of adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI), on the first day 303 AEFI incidents were reported, including two hospitalisation, as they were “serious” AEFI as per the central ministry protocol. The second day saw only four such incidents. Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, said, “Only four such incidents have been reported till now and they are minor in terms of symptoms. Pune city and PCMC both have not reported any AEFI incident as of Tuesday late evening but rural has reported four such incidents. We have to wait for at least 24 hours before we get to know the real numbers of immediate reactions.” Of those who were not vaccinated on Tuesday, 1,302 did not report to the site and 120 refused to take the vaccine, according to the district health officer.

An expert team that visited the state in the first week of January had recommended the state to beef up its test rate considerably to contain the spread.With 6,186 new virus cases, the number of active Covid-19 cases went up to 70,259 in the state. At least of 66,259 tests were conducted on Tuesday even as the state clocked a test positivity rate (TPR) of 9.34 per cent, at least triple than the national average. It has also reported 26 deaths taking the Covid-19 toll to 3,506. Among the infected, 69 are health workers, said the state health ministry.Experts have warned people not to lower their guard thinking vaccines have arrived. They say many people are taking pandemic restrictions lightly and slackening of vigil may spell doom. They say health officials are facing a gargantuan task as many resist to line up for tests saying vaccine has arrived.Also read: 9 states, UTs among better performing states during Covid-19 vaccination drive“We have noticed some people behave as if a remedy is around and refuse to take tests.

Time is not ripe to lower our guard,” said state health minister KK Shailaja.Worried, the health department has decided to conduct a Covid-19 density study to gauge the possibility of a fresh virus wave and formulate area-wise preventive strategies.The plan is to conduct a study on a large cluster of population above 18 years of age and samples of high-risk group will also be collected for a comparative study. The nature of the spread, the intensity of infection, recovery rate and post-Covid complications will come under this study, said the health department.

The police found that the original name of the accused is Vijeta.“Since the physical relationship between the two would have exposed Vikas aka Vijeta, the accused befooled the widow and told her that as per a tantric anyone who would see her naked would die.

Meanwhile, delivery executives working with food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy also expressed their fears of spending more money on fuel.Petrol price in Pune touched ₹91.47 a litre while diesel sold at ₹80.58 on Monday. The last peak in petrol price rise was witnessed in 2013 when the fuel was sold at ₹93 per litre. Avdoot Shinde, working with Swiggy, said, “Our commission per delivery is between ₹10 and ₹15 and it is based on drop location. With the price rise, we will have to spend more from our pockets.” he said.Zomato executive Shakeel Saudagar said, “I earn between ₹200 and ₹250 in a day and the hike in fuel price has forced me to spend around ₹80 on travel. So, even a difference of twenty rupees is going to make my life difficult.” Yashwant Jadhav, who works as a delivery agent for Hotel India in Kondhwa said, “I earn around ₹500 in a day and do double duty — food delivery in the mornings, late evenings and sometimes at night. The commission that I get per delivery is around ₹10- ₹15. The hike in fuel price has left me spend ₹50 more on travel and it is eating into my savings.” The food delivery executives have requested a rise in commission by ₹10 to meet the travel expenses following fuel price hike.Meanwhile, according to a Swiggy spokesperson, statements suggesting that delivery partners in Pune make ₹15 per order is inaccurate. “Most active delivery partners in Pune make close to ₹50 per order, with the highest performing partners making up to ₹100 per order. No active Swiggy delivery partner in the city makes only ₹15 per order on an average. The service fee per order is based on multiple factors to adequately compensate our partners, including distance travelled, waiting time, customer experience, shift completion and incentives. We understand the efforts put in by our delivery partners in making Swiggy accessible to consumers and maintain an honest approach in enabling a sustainable service fee,” the spokesperson said. Ali Daruwala, national spokesperson, All India Petrol Dealers Association, said, “This is the highest rise in fuel price since 2013 when petrol was priced at ₹93 per litre. As far as the hike is concerned, a group of central ministers are looking into the issue.” Baba Shinde, president, Maharashtra state goods and passengers transport association, claimed that he had written to Union minister of surface transport Nitin Gadkari seeking immediate rollback of fuel prices. “The transport industry has suffered a major setback during the Covid lockdown. Transporters are caught between fuel price hike and excise duty. We are being forced to increase freight rates and commoners will have to bear the burden of this unjust rise in fuel prices,” he said.Shinde, who is also the director of All India Motor Transport Congress that handles cab services department, said, “Cab operators are also planning to increase fares by 30 per cent to make up for the rising fuel cost expenditure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-and-cab-operators-in-pune-likely-to-hike-charges-following-fuel-price-rise-101611064712111.html
19-01-2021||West||Get a letterhead ready with ‘former CM’ written on it: Adhikari tells Mamata||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari on Tuesday asked Mamata Banerjee to prepare a letterhead describing her as the ‘former chief minster’, a day after the Bengal CM's announcement that she will contest the upcoming assembly elections from Nandigram. “Mamata Banerjee will contest elections from Nandigram. She should ready a letter pad with the words 'former CM' written on it,” Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP recently, said while addressing a rally in Purba Medinipur district's Khejuri.Banerjee had said on Monday she will contest the assembly elections from both Nandigram and Bhawanipore constituencies. Banerjee said that Nandigram is close to her heart and continues to remain special. “Bhawanipore is my elder sister and Nandigram is my younger sister. I will try to contest from both assembly constituencies. The people of Bhawanipore may feel bad. But I don’t want to hurt them. If I can manage (to contest from both constituencies) it is okay. But I will contest from Nandigram,” Banerjee had said at a rally in Nandigram on Monday.The war of words between Adhikari and Banerjee began soon after the chief minister’s announcement. Adhikari challenged Mamata on Monday saying that he will resign from politics if he cannot defeat the Bengal chief minister by more than 50,000 votes. “Write this down and mention the date and time. I will leave politics if I cannot defeat her by half lakh (50,000) votes,” Adhikari said while addressing a rally in south Kolkata on the same day.The Bengal chief minister’s announcement has brought back Nandigram once more into the spotlight. Nandigram remains important for both the chief minister and Suvendu Adhikari as the movement to protect farmers’ lands from acquisition 13 years ago catapulted both of them into the nation’s political stage.Adhikari was responsible for building the Trinamool Congress’ voter base in Jangalmahal, Nandigram and Purba Medinipur as the party’s youth leader. Adhikari since joining the BJP in December has vowed to remove the Banerjee's government from power.Bengal will hold elections this year but incidents of political violence have cast a shadow over the polling process. Buoyed by its performance in the state in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the state’s BJP unit remains confident that it will oust Banerjee from power in West Bengal assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/get-a-letterhead-ready-with-former-cm-written-on-it-adhikari-tells-mamata-101611058069173.html

19-01-2021||Other||Civic Sanskriti: Time to put road safety plans back in top gear||It’s reassuring to see initiatives like the Zero Fatality Corridor on the Mumbai Pune Expressway. Right here in our city, the Save Pune Traffic Movement is working with PMC and the Traffic Police, to repair and install pedestrian signals which provide sufficient time for people to cross safely. The Pune Mayor’s Road Safety Initiative launched last year took a back seat with Covid-19. Now is the time to revive it and give the city a booster dose of Road Safety. Fatal road crashes occur in Pune almost daily. These deaths are preventable. The Mayor’s Initiative can, and must, set clear plans and targets for the relevant government bodies to improve road safety in Pune and save lives. Every day we see people placing themselves at risk, jumping over high dividers while motorists speed by, cursing. This often happens because the next crossing is quite far, or pedestrians are expected to climb two storeys of steps of a foot overbridge. Proudly proclaiming signal-free corridors and not providing safe mid-block pedestrian crossings as mandated by Indian Road Congress guidelines glorifies speed over basic safety. Prioritising motorists’ convenience above safety and comfort of the majority of road users who do not drive – children, elderly people, women, and people with disabilities – is that the vision for our city? Both the number and severity of road accidents can be greatly reduced if municipal corporations, RTOs, Traffic Police, and emergency services work together. They have specific, differentiated roles in improving road safety. Building and maintaining safe roads, enforcing traffic rules that keep us safe, quick medical response in case of a crash are part of a coordinated ‘Safe Systems Approach’. Currently, our city is at the Learner level, as basic road safety provisions are not in place. For safe roads, providing usable footpaths, adequate street lighting, and clearly visible zebra crossings at convenient distances is essential. This, the municipal corporation has to ensure, since it is largely their responsibility to design, construct and maintain city roads. People often say there must be Education about road safety – after all, besides safe roads and safe vehicles, there must be safe road users. Certainly, there should be. RTOs must have much more stringent driving tests, focused on not just mechanical control of a vehicle, but also on whether the driver shares the road responsibly with other users. But, adults who have been driving for years are hardly likely to start attending road safety classes. Getting fined, losing time and money probably serves as a more effective lesson! Better enforcement helps make safer road users. In fact, the most important lesson – which Traffic Police can help with by fining offenders – is that helmets are compulsory for front and pillion riders. Since 85% of deaths in road crashes are of two-wheeler riders and pedestrians, Traffic Police should prioritise enforcement of rules that make these road users safer. Let’s support them when they enforce helmets, speed limits, and stop lines at crossings. Fines in Maharashtra are set to increase as the state implements the related amendment in the Motor Vehicle Act. In case any bike riders are planning to protest, just remember that it’s very easy to avoid the fine – just follow the rules, including wearing a helmet. People can help create a culture of road safety. As pedestrians, walk such that you face the vehicles as much as possible, and never walk along a divider. Be visible, pause before starting to cross, and raise your hand while crossing a road. Gift a good, light weight, BIS marked helmet to bike riders, including pillions, among your friends and family. Residents associations can conduct neighbourhood road safety checks. Ask corporators and ward offices for brightly lit, clearly painted crossings at junctions and mid-blocks, and pedestrian signals with correct time setting. Ask for traffic police personnel to enforce driving safety rules at critical locations. Road Safety is a cause worthy of our lives and time.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education. She writes on urban sustainability and participatory governance.

19-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt reduces ICU beds reservation to 25% for Covid-29 patients in pvt hospitals, HC told||Delhi government has reduced the reservation of Covid-19 ICU beds in private hospitals here to 25 per cent, from 40 per cent earlier.Justice Navin Chawla listed the matter for further hearing on February 2, after the counsel for petitioner Association of Healthcare Providers said he is waiting for instructions from member hospitals on this development and sought some time.The organisation has sought quashing of the government's September 12, 2020 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals which are its members.The reservation percentage has been gradually reduced by the government after reviewing the pandemic situation. With the Covid-19 infection number reaching at its peak of over 8,000 in a day in November, 2020 in Delhi, the numbers are now declining and 161 fresh cases were recorded on January 18, 2021.Advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, representing the petitioner, informed the court that the government has issued an order on January 15 reducing the reservation to 25 percent in hospitals which have over 100 beds.He said he requires some time to get instructions from the member hospitals on this.As per the government’s order, a review meeting was held by the competent authority on January 15, in which the data with respect to pattern of Covid-19 beds and Covid-19 ICU beds occupancy on that date in 115 private hospitals providing coronavirus treatment was analysed.Keeping in view the low occupancy of Covid-19 beds/ ICU beds in the private hospitals, it was decided in the review meeting to further lower reservation of the total bed capacity from 30 per cent to 15 per cent, and of ICU beds from 40 per cent to 25 per cent of the total bed capacity in 45 hospitals having more than 100 beds and providing coronavirus related treatment, the government order said.It was also decided in the meeting that other 70 hospitals which have up to 100 beds shall have the option of reserving Covid-19 beds/ ICU beds there.Earlier, the Delhi government counsel had said not a single non-Covid-19 patient has come to the court that he was denied treatment in the hospital due to 80 per cent of ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients.He had stated that not even a single private hospital has approached the high court claiming that they suffered financial loss due to this reservation order.The petitioner organisation’s counsel had contended that ICU beds were kept vacant and even no payment was made by the government to the hospitals which were facing financial losses.He had further argued that there was no validity or permissibility to continue with the September 12, 2020 order.The Delhi government had told the high court that it has decided to de-escalate to 60 per cent the number of ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here as was recommended by a De-escalation Committee.The September 12, 2020 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22 last year. However, a division of the high court on November 12, 2020 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed.The petitioner association had told the high court that the 33 private hospitals are its members and the Delhi government’s order shall be quashed as it was passed in an irrational manner and is ex-facie perverse.The government, however, had contended that the situation of Covid-19 infection in Delhi has become critical recently and the Covid-19 cases are spiralling and it was critical that 80 per cent of ICU/ HDU beds be reserved for Covid-19 patients in the 33 private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-reduces-icu-beds-reservation-to-25-for-covid-29-patients-101611046190582.html

19-01-2021||Other||Instead of farmers, Modi govt should serve NIA notice to Arnab Goswami: Jakhar||Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday criticised the BJP-led central government for serving notices through the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to the protesting farmers while letting off Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami. “If anyone deserves to be investigated by the NIA right now, it is Goswami who not only breached the Official Secrets Act but also compromised national security by sharing classified details with others,” Jakhar said in a statement in Chandigarh. The purported WhatsApp conversation between Goswami and then Broadcast Audience Research Council chief executive Partho Dasgupta shows that the journalist was apparently privy to the Narendra Modi government’s plan to launch an air strike on Pakistan’s Balakot in retaliation against the Pulwama terror attack, three days before the Indian Air Force bombed the terrorist camp on February 26, 2019. Jakhar urged farmers to raise the matter during their meeting with the Union ministers on Wednesday as it is their children who work in the defence forces. Jakhar claimed that the Government of India has been targeting peaceful farmers in frustration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/instead-of-farmers-modi-govt-should-serve-nia-notice-to-arnab-goswami-jakhar-101611045630814.html

19-01-2021||Delhi||Rickshaw puller killed for ₹60 and his rickshaw; two arrested||A 55-year-old rickshaw puller was murdered allegedly by two men who then made off with ₹60 and his cycle rickshaw from east Delhi’s Vasundhara Enclave, the police said on Monday. Police said the two suspects have been arrested and the stolen rickshaw has been recovered, as well as the knife that they had allegedly used to slit the rickshaw puller’s throat on January 14.The rickshaw puller’s body, with the throat slit and head badly smashed with a stone, was found in the bushes of a vacant plot near a private school in Vasundhara Enclave on January 15, said deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav.The man’s body was shifted to a nearby government hospital mortuary and a murder case was registered at the New Ashok Nagar police station. Since the man’s identity was unknown, the investigating team showed his photographs to people in the areas near the spot from where the body was recovered. On January 16, the man’s identity was established as Jiban Mazumdar, a rickshaw puller, said DCP Yadav.“Further probe revealed that Mazumdar’s rickshaw and his wallet were missing. The CCTV cameras installed near the spot helped us locate Mazumdar’s rickshaw -- it was some distance away from the place where his body was found,” he said.Investigators said the footage from more cameras was examined and in one, two suspects were seen abandoning the rickshaw. Though local inquiry, one of them was identified as Chhotan Singh, a 24-year-old fish seller. Singh was taken into custody and during the interrogation, he admitted to killing the man. His revelations led to the arrest of his friend Dilip Haldar,20, the second suspect, said an investigator, requesting anonymity.“The duo revealed that on the night of January 14, they lured Mazumdar to the vacant plot on the pretext of having a party. The two overpowered him, slit his throat and crushed his head with a stone to hide his identity. They stole his wallet containing Rs.60 and the rickshaw, which was their prime motive for the murder,” Yadav said.Police said Haldar is a drug addict and has been previously involved in five theft cases, all registered at the New Ashok Nagar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rickshaw-puller-killed-for-60-and-his-rickshaw-two-arrested-101611012584282.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The living landmark returns||Here she is.“I came back one or one-and-a-half months ago.”For years, Ramrati’s morning routine stayed the same: reading aloud passages from the sacred Ramcharitmanas, her upper-half rocking back and forth with the rhythm and emotions of the epic’s Awadhi verses. On the side-lane that connects Barakhamba Road to Kasturba Gandhi Marg, in Delhi’s Connaught Place, she was a living landmark. Clothed in either a sari or a gown, she would be seen sitting cross-legged on the elevated footpath from 9 to 11am, with the hardbound on her lap or on a wooden book stand. Office-goers would walk past her. A few might glance at her, some slowing momentarily, moved by her sing-song recital. A very few might respectfully put a Rs.10 note in front of her, or present her with a glass of fresh fruit juice from a nearby stall (she would ask them to confirm that it wasn’t jootha). This elderly woman had the vibes of an archetypal neighbourhood dadi-maa who knits the socks, makes the mango pickles, keeps religious fasts and tells stories from the sacred epics. But she was without a house. She lived alone. This pavement was her home.And then coronavirus arrived. The consequent lockdowns shut down the city and all the street life.Ramrati too disappeared.“I was in Prayagraj,” says the woman, referring to the city in UP also known as Allahabad. Taking a break from her reading, her hands clasped beside the book, her arms under a blanket,Ramrati recalls the initial days of the lockdown, when there were no trains to be found. “I boarded a bus.” And there in the city where three holy rivers meet, Ramrati lived beside the Ganga, she says. “Every morning I was reading from (Ramcharit) manas.”Ramrati is from Rae Bareli, in UP, and some of her family still lives there. Why didn’t she stay on in Prayagraj, beside her “Ganga Mayya”, or go back to her native district for good? The lady looks puzzled. Shrugging her shoulder, she says, “But I live in Delhi.”On whether she feels scared of the pandemic, she says, “Bhagwan Ram looks after me.”Meanwhile, the lane is filling up with morning commuters. Almost all are masked. Ramrati’s mask is slung under chin. “I can’t read easily wearing it,” she says, before restarting her recital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-living-landmark-returns-101611012064875.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Minimum temperature may drop; better air in store: IMD||The minimum temperature over Delhi is likely to drop by between 1 and 2 degrees Celsius from Tuesday, as wind directions change again, this time from easterly to north-westerly, said the Met office, adding that mornings may see shallow to moderate fog.“With the change in wind direction, winds are likely to blow from the direction of western Himalayas, so they will be colder. The minimum temperature in Delhi may be around 8°C, while the maximum may be around 21°C. Winds are also likely to pick up, so air quality may improve,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Delhi’s minimum temperature rose to 9°C on Monday.The air quality index (AQI) in Delhi on Monday was 372, categorised as ‘very poor’, a minor increase from 347 the previous day. According to air quality early warning system under the Union ministry of earth sciences, there will be northwesterly winds of around 10 kmph blowing on Tuesday and of 15 to 20 kmph on Wednesday, which will help disperse pollutants and improve the city’s air.Currently, easterly winds are prevailing at lower levels over the northern plains. Wind direction is likely to change from easterly to westerly/northwesterly over northwest India from Monday night. Due to the change in wind direction, minimum temperatures are likely to fall by 2 to 4°C during the next three days, leading to ‘cold wave’ conditions in isolated pockets over eastern Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi during January 18 to 20 and over western Uttar Pradesh and northern Rajasthan during January 19 to 21, according to IMD’s Monday bulletin.Dense to very dense fog is likely over parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, Bihar and Odisha during next 24. ‘Cold day’ conditions are also likely isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during next 2 days.According to IMD, a cold day or a severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10°C and maximum temperature of 4.5°C or 6.4°C below normal, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/minimum-temperature-may-drop-better-air-in-store-imd-101611011130919.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Cook found semi-conscious on road dies, kin allege robbery bid||A 40-year-old man, who worked as a cook at a hotel in Vaishali near Ghaziabad, died in Safdarjung hospital on Sunday, nearly seven hours after he was found lying on the road in east Delhi’s Ghazipur in a semi-conscious state, seeking help from passersby, police said.His family members have alleged that he was assaulted during a robbery bid by three to four unidentified men near the Ghazipur underpass late Saturday when he was walking towards his home in Trilokpuri after work. They said Rs.4, 000 cash that he was bringing home from the hotel was missing, an allegation that the police have also confirmed. Lal’s ATM card and Aadhaar card were found in his pocket, the police said, while adding that they have not ruled out robbery.Since no visible injury marks were found on the body of the man, identified as Roshan Lal, the police are waiting for his autopsy report to ascertain the exact cause of death. The police suspect that Lal may have died because of an internal injury. To establish the exact sequence of events, the police are also scanning CCTV cameras on the route that he took to reach home from the hotel in Vaishali, said a police officer, who did not want to be named.On Sunday around 5.30am, the officer said a head constable of the Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) was passing by when he spotted Lal lying on the road and waving his hand for help. The policeman stopped to help and Lal told him that he was feeling sick after three-four men made him eat something. Lal gave the policeman his sister’s mobile number and requested him to call her.“The policeman left the spot after he informed the police about the matter and Lal spoke to his sister over the policeman’s phone. Lal was admitted to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital, from where he was referred to Safdarjung hospital where he died during treatment in the afternoon,” the officer said.Lal’s brother, Vijay (single name), said while speaking to their sister, Lal had told her that he was assaulted by three to four robbers when he resisted their robbery attempt. “My brother gave the same statement to the police at the LBS hospital in front of my sister and nephew,” said Vijay.Senior police officers said they are looking into Lal’s death from all possible angles. “The legal proceedings have been initiated in the matter. We are waiting for Lal’s autopsy report. Further action would be taken accordingly,” said deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cook-found-semi-conscious-on-road-dies-kin-allege-robbery-bid-101611010724005.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi Lieutenant-Governor chairs meet to oversee NDLS redevelopment||Delhi Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal on Monday chaired the second meeting of the apex committee to “oversee and facilitate” the redevelopment of New Delhi railway station and said the project will be developed in accordance with transit-oriented development (TOD) policy.According to officials, a transit-oriented development is a type of urban development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport.He also encouraged the use of recycled water for non-potable purposes and advised the formation of coordination committees for better implementation.The New Delhi railway station is the largest and second busiest station in the country and handles approximately 450,000 passengers daily or about 160 -170 million passengers annually. It is being redeveloped by Rail Land Development Authority(RLDA) which has invited bids from private players.According to officials privy to the development, the project will be carried out on public-private partnership (PPP) mode by RLDA in accordance with the TOD policy. Officials said under the plan, the railway station will get a makeover in a way that it would enhance the passenger experience and improve infrastructure and modern amenities.Under the plan, the railway station will get dome-shaped terminal buildings that will have two arrival and two departure areas at the concourse. The redevelopment plan also has provisions for two multimodal transport hubs (MMTH) on each side of the station along with a pedestrian boulevard with high street shopping, spaces for offices and other commercial activities.The project also aims to develop railway quarters as well as the necessary infrastructure for ancillary railway works.“The L-G also emphasised on considering the interconnectivity of the station with surrounding areas or influence area, apart from creating adequate parking for public and private transport. He also suggested that officials revisit the detailed walkability and cycling lane plan,” a government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lieutenant-governor-chairs-meet-to-oversee-ndls-redevelopment-101611010330600.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Enhanced share in central taxes on Delhi’s Budget wish list||Ahead of the Union budget, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday urged the Centre to treat Delhi on a par with the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir in the matter of its share from central taxes, the central assistance to UTs, and the disaster response fund.Sisodia, who is also hold finance portfolio, made these demands at a pre-budget meeting convened by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “Being the capital of the country, and one of the fastest growing metropolises, the Delhi government needs to maintain an infrastructure that meets world standards. The Delhi government needs funds to invest in crucial departments such as education, health, social, food securities, transports, roads and hospitals, among others,” Sisodia said.He appealed to the minister to increase the city-state’s allocation to at least Rs.8,150 crore in the revised estimate of 2020-21, and Rs.8,555 crore in the budget estimate for 2021-22.“Delhi has five urban local bodies, of which three are major municipal corporations with a population between 39 lakh to 62 lakh (3.9 million and 6.2 million). As the powers and functions of the municipalities in Delhi are the same as that of the local bodies in other states, omitting Delhi’s MCDs from receiving its basic performance grants on technical grounds does not help the constitutional mandate of strengthening the city’s local bodies,” he said.Sisodia said Delhi, with a population of nearly 20 million, should at least be provided Rs.1,150 crore, along with an appropriate annual enhancement grant for its local bodies.Considering the dire financial situation of the municipal bodies, Sisodia also requested a one-time grant of Rs.12,000 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/enhanced-share-in-central-taxes-on-delhi-s-budget-wish-list-101611007757034.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||‘Back at last’: After months online, cheer, relief in classroom reunion||In March last year, Class 10 student Bhawna, a resident of east Delhi’s Trilokpuri, was delighted to learn that schools in the national capital would remain closed for an indefinite period in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ten months later, on Monday, she was elated to return to school.“When the lockdown was announced in March, we were happy that schools would be closed for a long time. But eventually, we got bored and didn’t even feel like watching cartoons…now that schools have reopened after lockdown, I woke up excited this morning and came to school,” Bhawna wrote in her essay on lockdown experiences.The teenager, who studies at Janki Devi Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, in Mayur Vihar Phase 1, was asked to share her experiences as a part of the two-day “orientation and connectivity programme” at her school to ease students into the “new normal”.Adorned with welcome posters, balloons and flowers, schools wore a festive look as students trickled in to classrooms after a gap of 10 months. The day’s activities included practical classes, discussions and strategies on the upcoming board examination, as well as an orientation session to acquaint students with Covid appropriate behaviour.Class 12 student Rajendra, who studies at a government school in Shalimar Bagh, said, “During lunch break or physical education classes, we used to engage in physical activities or play with our classmates. It is sad that we won’t be able to do all that in the final year of our school life. But we are happy to be back. The classes will help us prepare for board examinations and reduce our stress.”While students were excited to return to school, despite having to wear masks and keep a distance from each other, the “no contact policy” left many dispirited. Riya Chauhan, a class 12 science student from Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said it was unsettling for her to encounter “emptier classrooms and corridors” as there were fewer students in school.“Coming back to school has been a different experience; earlier we could walk from one table to another in labs when we needed to discuss something, but that is no longer allowed. Since we were not allowed to gather in groups, I had the quietest lunch break in my entire life,” said the teenager, who resides in Azadpur.She said it was challenging to follow the lectures due to masks. “It was uncomfortable to wear a mask and communicate. We had to ask teachers to repeat what they were saying to be able to follow the lectures. We will adapt to the new normal in a few days though,” Chauhan said.While schools strictly enforced physical distancing norms, the scenes outside the premises were a cause for concern. Across the capital, students could be seen mingling freely with one another, either before reaching the school or after leaving it.Surya Kant Prasad, deputy director of education of Zone 2 (east), said he noted the same during his visit to several schools on Monday. “Most of our children are aware of the importance of maintaining social distancing and they are taking all precautions. For the rest, we will ask teachers to counsel students in the coming days so that they take needed steps for their own safety and the well-being of others,” he said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Chirag Enclave and Delhi Public School in Mathura Road to assess schools’ readiness. “Since CBSE has announced the dates for board exams, to be held in May, it would’ve been unfair to students to let them directly take the examinations, sans any counselling or pre-board classes,” he said.Principals across several Delhi government schools said teachers and staff were happy to see the children back and devised multiple protocols to facilitate their safety.Seema Singh Rathi, head of school at east Delhi’s Janki Devi SKV, said, “Our focus today was on discussing what students did at home during the lockdown so that we re-establish the student connect with teachers.”Sarita Batra, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Shalimar Bagh, said she visited each class to discuss the guidelines as a large gathering is not permitted. “We had conducted meetings with parents to assure them of the safety protocols. We started with lessons today as teachers need time to conduct practicals,” she said.Parents still concernedWhile most government schools in the capital reopened Monday, private schools will be reopening gradually. Parents have raised concerns citing lack of school buses, multiple entrance examinations in February, and the spread of Covid-19, even though a vaccine is at hand.Anita Madan, a resident of Janakpuri and parent of a class 12 student of St Thomas’ School in Dwarka, said, “My son, like other science students, has entrance exams in February. School has said that offline pre-boards will be held this month itself. What if our child gets infected and loses the opportunity to appear for the entrance exams?”Pankaj Gupta, parent of a class 10 student of Maharaja Agrasen School, said, “I won’t send my daughter to school because the Covid-19 threat still exists. Children have a tendency to mingle or not wear masks properly. Parents cannot be completely sure that schools will monitor such things the way we do. Reopening schools for students cannot be done on an experimental basis.”Requesting anonymity, a parent of a class 10 student of Amity International School in Pushp Vihar said, “The school has announced that students have to appear for offline pre-boards this week itself. This has caused immense stress to several children as they need time to adapt to going to school again.Reacting to these concerns, a school spokesperson told Hindustan Times on Monday, “Once children get back to school, only then can a call be taken on the pre-board examinations. Any call on offline examination will be taken after assessing the parents’ concern about sending their children to school.”Aprajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents’ Association, said, “As per our analysis, attendance at most schools on Monday was less than 50%. That shows that parents are still concerned about Covid. The non-availability of school buses has added to their woes. While private schools are still working on safety protocols, we feel that government schools need to do more in implementing these guidelines as children of these schools need more in-person assistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/back-at-last-after-months-online-cheer-relief-in-classroom-reunion-101611007030606.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||No plan to cancel nursery admissions so far, says Manish Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said that the government has, so far, no plans to cancel nursery admissions for the academic session 2021-22.Delhi government’s education department officials had last month told HT that they were considering skipping admissions to entry-level classes -- nursery, KG, and first -- in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“So far there is no plan to cancel admission this year... We are still discussing the timeline of the admission process. Everything has been delayed by two-three months this year due to the prevailing situation. The government does not want to rush the process of nursery admission. But there is no plan to cancel it,” Sisodia said.Every year, the process for admissions to entry-level classes begins between November and December, for over 2 lakh seats in around 1,700 private schools in Delhi. The government also carries out a separate admission process for students from economically disadvantaged families for the 25% reserved seats under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.Both principals of several private schools and parents said they were relieved after Sisodia’s statement. Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said, “We had expressed our concerns over it. A committee of principals and managements of several schools had met Mr Sisodia earlier this month to discuss the issue. We are really glad that the government has reconsidered its decision. It’s in the interest of students.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “The nursery admissions have already been delayed by more than a month. The government should immediately issue the admission notification so that schools can plan their academic session. We are receiving calls from parents every day.”Anubhuti, the mother of a four-year-old, said she has already enrolled her daughter in a school in neighbouring Noida. “We have been waiting for the government to release the notification so that we can withdraw her admission from there and enrol her in a Delhi school. I am glad that the government has said that it’s not planning to cancel the admission process,” she said.Delhi Parents Association also welcomed Sisodia’s statement. Aparjita Gautam, president of the association, said, “Parents have been waiting for the admission process to begin. There are many parents whose children could not get admission last year. The government should also issue a circular on the issue in order to bust the prevailing rumours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-plan-to-cancel-nursery-admissions-so-far-says-manish-sisodia-101611005614798.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi reports least cases since April 30, eight deaths on Monday||On the second day of the vaccination drive against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the city reported 161 new cases of the infection. This is the lowest number of cases reported in a single day in 263 days since April 30, when the city saw 76 cases, as per the data shared by the Delhi government.The cases came on the back of fewer tests on Sunday. Just over 50,500 samples were tested in Delhi – as reported a day later on Monday – compared to 68,673 tests that were conducted on average each day during the last seven days.Even then, Delhi’s positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – dropped to 0.32%, the lowest the city has seen so far. Positivity rate in Delhi has stayed lower than 1% for 22 days now, as per the government data.Experts say the spread of the infection is under control if a positivity of 5% or less can be sustained over two weeks.“A second wave of infection is unlikely to happen in India – or Delhi – because if you look at the graph there has been a fairly smooth curve in the number of cases going up March or April onwards. And, a smooth decline September onwards. The rise and fall has happened over ten months; the countries that saw a second wave this had happened over three months leaving many people still susceptible to the infection who fuelled the second wave,” said Dr T Jacob John, former professor of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.On Monday, the city also reported eight deaths due to the viral infection, taking the toll to 10,754 since March 13 when the city reported its first death due to the pandemic infection.Delhi’s case fatality rate (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – at 1.70%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reports-least-cases-since-april-30-eight-deaths-on-monday-101611005033288.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Co-WIN bugs impacting Covid-19 vaccination drive: Officials||The low turnout of the beneficiaries at Covid-19 vaccination centres is not only because of vaccine hesitancy but also due to the glitches in Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) app, which failed to send out text messages to a majority of selected health workers even on the second day of the drive, senior officials in the Delhi government said on Monday.Officials at a majority of Delhi’s 81 vaccination centres said a large number of health care workers did not receive texts informing them about their turn, due to which hospital staff had to call each one of them.“The Co-WIN app randomly selects 100 beneficiaries for each centre and the list is sent to the respective hospitals/session sites. The problem we are facing since day one is that the auto-generated SMS is not being sent to most of the selected beneficiaries. The second issue is that the list is sent out late. For example, we got the list of 100 beneficiaries for Monday only at 8pm,” said Dr Yogesh Kushwaha, nodal officer at Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital in the east district.He said as soon as they got the list, the hospital staff started calling up beneficiaries. “But, by that time it gets so late that many numbers are either unreachable or switched off. Then we follow-up in the morning,” he said.BL Sherwal, director of the Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, one of the vaccination sites, has asked his assistant to call beneficiaries. Similarly, hospitals such as Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB), Delhi State Cancer Institute and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (RGSS) have deployed their staff on full-time duty to track beneficiaries and contact them.Dr Sweta, the nodal officer at GTB hospital, said only 24 beneficiaries got the vaccine jab on the second day at their hospital. “The app did not send out the messages to the beneficiaries till Sunday evening. It’s not possible to call 100 people in a go. While many did not respond immediately, some were not reachable. We have conveyed this to the district administration,” she said.At RGSS hospital, just 20 frontline workers were vaccinated on the second day of the drive. Ajeet Jain, the nodal officer at the hospital, also confirmed that many beneficiaries did not receive the messages from the designated Co-Win app.Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer at Delhi State Cancer Institute, said, “None of the beneficiaries has received any message informing them about their appointment from the app designated for the purpose. Our staff had to call everyone in person”.Responding to complaints, a Union health ministry official said, “Nearly 90% of glitches have been addressed. Speed has increased... A lot of the glitches are also there because of varying degrees of the IT acumen of vaccinator officers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cowin-bugs-impacting-covid-19-vaccination-drive-officials-101611004555385.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||Vaccine turnout drops to 44% on Day 2, just 8 given shots at AIIMS||Only 3,598 health-care workers – about 44.2% of those selected to be inoculated on Monday-- turned up for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, registering a drop of nine percentage points from the Day One (Saturday) of the immunisation campaign in the city, while only eight people were administered the jabs at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences on the day.The data shared by the government showed that on the second day of the drive, conducted between 9am and 5pm Monday, a total 8,136 health-care workers were to be inoculated, but only 3,598 actually got the jabs. The remaining days for Covid-19 vaccination this week are Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were reported in 26 beneficiaries (0.72%). Two of them were categorised as “severe” with one beneficiary in east Delhi’s Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital requiring hospitalisation.On Saturday, the first day of the drive, a total of 4,319 (53.3%) of the 8,117 selected health-care workers received the Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi. There were 52 AEFI cases on Day One, with one hospitalisation at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).If looked at vaccine-wise, the AEFI cases on Monday were from Covishield doses, which are being used as the primary vaccine in Delhi and are being administered in 75 of 81 centres across the city. The turnout for the Covishield vaccine was 44.5% on Monday, whereas that for Covaxin was 40%, according to the data provided by the government.Apart from the general vaccine hesitancy, senior government officials attributed the low turnout to glitches in the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-Win) app, which they said failed to send out text messages (SMSes) to a majority of the beneficiaries selected at random by the app.A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the reasons for the low turnout on Day Two.Of 11 districts in Delhi, the highest turnout (55%) was in east Delhi, where 273 of 500 selected beneficiaries were vaccinated. This is quite lower than the highest turnout of 71.44% reported in the south district on Saturday.The second-highest turnout on Day Two (Monday) was in the south-east district where 420 (53%) of the 800 health-care workers were given the first dose. The Shahdara district vaccinated 163 (27%) of a total registered group of 600 persons -- the lowest among the 11 districts.Senior health officials said the low turnout was also because of glitches in the Co-Win app because of which at least two vaccination centres – Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College – were forced to allow beneficiaries on a “walk-in” basis.“There were login issues with the Co-Win app. Other than that, the app is still not sending SMSes to all beneficiaries it randomly selects each day for the vaccination. Hence, fewer health-care workers were turning up. After we communicated the problem to the district administration, they allowed us to accept health-care workers on a walk-in basis. As a result, the number of vaccinations improved at our hospital on Monday compared to Saturday,” said a senior official at Lady Hardinge Medical College. The number who got the jab increased from 26 on Saturday to 76 on Monday at the hospital.Similarly, RML vaccinated 69 health-care workers on Monday, compared to 31 on Day One.Dr Ravinder Pal Dhingra, the nodal officer of Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya in east Delhi said their staff are personally calling all selected beneficiaries to inform them about their turn.“The auto-generated text message system is still not in place properly. Our staff members have to divide the 100 numbers among themselves and call each one on each immunisation day,” he said.Dhingra said there is also a hesitancy among senior health -care workers to get the shot.“Those who are close to 50 years and have co-morbidities are showing reluctance to get the jabs. Some with co-morbidities have expressed fears that the vaccine could worsen their condition. So, we have now appointed a dedicated counsellor who is talking to such people and clearing their doubts and dispelling myths and rumours,” he said.Low turnout at AIIMSMeanwhile, an official at AIIMS said the low turnout at the central government-run hospital, could be related to multiple factors, including apprehensions of adverse events and late notifications through the Co-WIN app.A security guard of the hospital who received the shot on Saturday suffered anaphylaxis and was admitted to the facility. He was discharged on Sunday.“Also, those who had refused on Saturday were again included in the list and they did not turn up again on Monday. Around 20 people had turned up at AIIMS, of which some had fever while others had history of allergies, only eight beneficiaries received the shots,” the source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccine-turnout-drops-to-44-on-day-2-just-8-given-shots-at-aiims-101611004093608.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||At 2 centres, walk-in jabs lead to more vaccinations||On a day when glitches in the central government’s Co-WIN portal led to low turnouts at Covid-19 vaccination points in the national capital, centres that allowed walk-in shots to registered healthcare workers, circumventing the list drawn up by the portal, saw an uptake in the numbers.At the central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, 69 people were given the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine on Monday, a significant increase over the 31 immunised on Saturday, when the inoculation drive kicked off across the country.Hospital officials said this bump in turnout was primarily due to the facility allowing people whose names were not drawn by the Co-WIN app to get the jabs on Monday.“There was some issue with the Co-WIN portal, so we sought permission from the district officials to conduct the session offline. We allowed even those whose names were not drawn for today’s drive because almost 70 of the 100 people included in the list were those who had missed their shot on Saturday,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of RML hospital.To be sure, all the beneficiaries were already registered on the Co-WIN portal.Nearly 30 million health workers, and frontline workers are to be vaccinated in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccinations.Till Monday afternoon, the vaccination site at RML hospital saw only 11 of scheduled beneficiaries turn up for the shot.“I called at least 50 of the beneficiaries personally and most of them did not even respond. These are the same people who skipped getting vaccinated on Saturday. If they do not want to take the vaccine at all, why would they come?” said a hospital staffer on duty at the centre.Most who were vaccinated at RML on Monday were senior faculty members from the hospital itself, according to personnel at the hospital who asked not to be named.Two interns from the hospital said they were aware they could walk-in and get the shot on Monday, but expressed concerns over lack of long-term data on the vaccines.A security in-charge at the hospital, Pramod Kumar got the shot in the afternoon and said he felt fine after that.“I have 81 guards who work under me, and I got the shot to motivate them. I feel absolutely fine; after the 30-minute observation, I continued with my daily routine. There is a fear in the minds of people because the vaccine is new, and I want to set an example that it is safe,” he said.The turnout was also higher at the Lady Hardinge Medical College, where 76 people were immunised on Monday, as compared to just 26 people on Saturday.“Many people who were already in the hospital just walked into the centre to get the shot,” said one of the personnel on duty at the vaccination site in the new building at Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital.The 81 hospitals where the vaccination drive was rolled-out were due to start increasing the number of sites at their premises to finish administering the shots to their staff quickly. However, with low turnouts, the number of sites on Monday remained 81.Both the hospitals had a higher turnout than the city’s average of just over 44% of the beneficiaries selected for the vaccination drive turn up to the various centres in the national capital.Of the 8,136 beneficiaries targeted on Monday, 3,598 were vaccinated. Some of them had to be turned away due symptoms like fever and history of allergies.On Monday, only eight people were administered the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where walk-in shots were not permitted, against 95 who got the jab on Saturday.Similary at Lok Nayak hospital, where walk-ins were not allowed, only 12 people were immunised on Monday, down from 32 on Saturday.“The list for Saturday’s drive was prepared after asking people on WhatsApp groups. However, Monday’s list consisted mostly of people who were on Saturday’s list. Most of these people were on leave or under quarantine and couldn’t come. There were a few people who just showed up but we couldn’t allow that,” said a staffer from the vaccination centre at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-2-centres-walk-in-jabs-lead-to-more-vaccinations-101611003742801.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra gram panchayat polls: BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP claim victory||Amid claims of victory by all four key parties in Maharashtra, partners in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – won 58% of the 12,711 gram panchayats that went to polls on January 15. However, among all parties individually, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) won the highest number of gram panchayats, with the Sena a close second. Results of all gram panchayats were not announced till late on Monday and a clear picture is expected by Tuesday morning. Of the 27,782 gram panchayats (village councils) in the state, 14,432 were due for the elections last year. The elections were postposed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The BJP won a little more 2,600 gram panchayats, followed by the Sena, which won 2,570 panchayats of the 11,800 panchayats whose results were declared late on Monday evening. The NCP and Congress bagged 2,400 and 1,825 panchayats respectively, while local panels and independents won over 2,335 panchayats. A total of 214,880 candidates were in the fray for 125,709 seats, for which 3,56,221 nominations were filed. At least 26,718 members in 1,665 panchayats were elected unopposed. Another 162 panchayats in Gadchiroli will go to polls on January 20. Though the village panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, the parties claim the victory on the basis of the local panels formed by the candidates affiliated to them. Some of the panels at the local level claim their affiliations to more than one party. Three ruling parties, however, had announced to fight the elections separately. Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said, “The voters voted in favour of the MVA. Ruling parties fought in cooperation and it resulted in the combined victory. The Sena, NCP and Congress and their key leaders retained the village panchayats in their stronghold. We have been working on a Common Minimum Program under the leadership of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.” Environment minister and Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray said the voters of Maharashtra have reaffirmed their trust in the MVA government. “The MVA government has been unitedly working in the interest of the people under the leadership of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat. The government took cautious decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic and successfully handled it. The state has been marching ahead on many fronts including industrial, environment. The gram panchayat results are the reflection of our performance,” he said. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said: “The MVA has won more than 80% panchayats and it reaffirms the trust of the people on the ruling alliance. The voters have stood by us. The BJP’s claims are false as it did not enjoy the support from even the native villages of incumbent state unit chief Chandrakant Patil and former state unit chief and union minister Raosaheb Danve.” On the other hand, Chandrakant Patil said his party would win more than 6000 village panchayats. “We have won 1,907 of the 7,000 panchayats whose results were declared till 6pm. Our party had won 564 panchayats of 1,665 which were declared elected unopposed. Voters in the state have defeated the ruling parties as they were angry with the government over its failure on handling Covid-19, poor relief to the farmers in distress and at the same time, they had shown faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and development works,” he said. Patil said that the party won panchayats in the assembly constituencies represented or under influence of its key leaders like Narayan Rane, Raosaheb Danve, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Girish Mahajan, Sudhir Mungantiwar among others. Significantly, key leaders Chandrakant Patil, Danve, former state minister Ram Shinde, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil could not win the village panchayats in their native villages. In Patil’s native village Khanapur in Kolhapur district, the Shiv Sena won 6 of 9 panchayats, while Ram Shinde’s Chavandi panchayat was won by NCP under the leadership of party MLA and party chief Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar. BJP candidates faced defeat in Bhokardan, while Vikhe Patil’s Loni village panchayat went to an independent panel. Key leaders from the ruling alliance retained their citadel by winning most of the panchayats in their constituencies. Congress’s Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Thorat, NCP’s Dhananjay Munde, Anil Deshmukh, Shiv Sena Shambhuraj Desai, Gulabrao Patil won a majority of the village bodies. Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan’s constituency Karad recorded defeat of the Congress candidates. In Nagpur, the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) once again stamped its authority in Nagpur district, bagging 73 out of 129-gram panchayat seats. The elections to 12,711 gram panchayats in 34 districts of the state, including Nagpur were held on January 15. The BJP emerged a single largest party, while the Congress and NCP finished second and third, respectively. In Nagpur, the BJP got 73 seats out of 129, while the MVA candidates bagged 56 seats. However, in Katol assembly constituency, represented by home minister Anil Deshmukh, NCP won 19 out of 20 gram panchayats. The Congress grabbed 16 out of 17 seats in Patansaongi gram panchayat, the native village of Maharashtra dairy development minister Sunil Kedar. BJP claimed 12 seats while Congress 5 in Koradi gram panchayat, the home of state BJP general secretary and former Maharashtra minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. In Chandrapur, the former Maharashtra minister Sudhir Munganttiwar claimed that the BJP bagged over 55 per cent seats out of 629 gram panchayats in the district. On the other hand, guardian minister of the district Vijay Wadettiwar dismissed the BJP claims and asserted that the Congress obtained around 60% of seats while the BJP got 30% of seats in the elections. Hirave Bazar panchayat in Ahmednagar district is known for its water conservation efforts taken under its Sarpanch Popatrao Pawar. The village panchayat saw election for the first time in last 30 years. The panchayat was retained by Pawar’s panel. Patoda panchayat in Aurangabad was known for its all round development in 25 years under its sarpanch Bhaskar Pere Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gram-panchayat-polls-bjp-congress-shiv-sena-ncp-claim-victory-101611000862379.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 800 students with 80% and above secure FYJC seats after five admission rounds||More than 800 students who secured 80% and above in their SSC board (Class 10) exams in 2020 secured admissions to junior colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) under the ongoing first-come, first0served (FCFS) rounds. As per data shared by the education department, 50 students scoring 90% and above were admitted in the first phase that concluded last week, while over 900 students scoring 80% and above confirmed seats in the second phase of FCFS that concluded on Monday. Colleges said students who were earlier trying to get colleges of their choice might have waited until the end until seats open up in the round. “While most high scorers have already taken admission, some might have taken the risk of waiting until quota seats opened up after the regular rounds. Also, some students might have cancelled their earlier admissions and tried for another college or stream in this round,” said the principal of a suburban college. Under the FCFS round, students can claim seats against vacancies shown in the portal on the designated date and time. Once students claim a seat and proceed for admission, they can confirm their seat in the given college. After the first two phases of FCFS, over 1.22 lakh seats are still lying vacant in the MMR region. The education department will conduct a total of seven phases of the FCFS rounds for students who are still awaiting a seat. The last phase will end on January 31. Most colleges in the city have already started their online classes for FYJC students from the first week of January. The state education department is yet to make an announcement on the conduct of exams and other academic planning for the year as admissions were delayed by nearly four months due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the interim stay on Maratha quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-over-800-students-with-80-and-above-secure-fyjc-seats-after-five-admission-rounds-101611000562786.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt rejects General Motors’ plea to close Talegaon plant||Two days after the General Motors Employee Union moved the Bombay high court (HC) questioning the move of General Motors India Private Limited (GMIPL) to close down its plant at Talegaon in Pune district, Maharashtra industry minister Dilip Walse-Patil on Monday rejected the company’s closure application.The union had contended that the Talegaon plant was sold by the company to Great Wall Motors (GWM), a Chinese auto giant, but a closure application was filed with the state government to get rid of the employees working at the plant.In the petition filed through advocate Rahul Kamerkar, the union has said that in January 2020, reports started emerging that General Motors was being sold to the Chinese auto giant. Thereafter, the petition said the company put up a notice informing its employees that its “legal entity” was being sold to GWM, without clarifying as to what the term “legal entity” meant.It alleged that after January 2020, employees of the company were forced and coerced to accept a voluntary retirement scheme, which the union claimed was not fair and equitable. The company had also filed an application with the Maharashtra labour department, seeking permission to close the Talegaon plant.The petitioner union had opposed the November 20, 2020 closure application on several grounds, but sought a direction to the Maharashtra government to decide it before the expiry of the 60-day period, after which deemed permission for closure will be granted in favour of the company.It has contended that on the one hand, the company says that the GMIPL entity was sold to GWM. “If this is the case, then the application for closure is infructuous as the establishment sought to be closed has already been sold,” stated the petition.“On the other hand, the company says that only the Talegaon plant has been sold. If this is the case, then the application for closure is unjust and not in the public interest as it is being made only to throw the workers on the streets after first selling the establishment where they are working,” it added.The union has further contended that there were no such financial exigencies in the recent past as would justify a closure and alleged that the company wants to sell the land, plant and machinery to GWM for a hefty profit, and since GWM was not willing to take responsibility of the workers, they are now trying to get rid of the workers.Advocate Kamerkar said the industry minister rejected the application on Monday and refused GM permission to close the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-rejects-general-motors-plea-to-close-talegaon-plant-101611000322288.html
19-01-2021||Other||Not keen on fines for traffic violations: Maharashtra transport minister||State transport minister Anil Parab said his department is not keen on recovering fines to enforce traffic rules. He, however, said that strict action against offenders and awareness campaigns will ensure more road discipline. Parab’s statement came during the 32nd National Road Safety Week on Monday, which was inaugurated by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray at the Sahyadri guest house at Malabar Hill. Thackeray directed the authorities to identify black spots that lead to accidents and build trauma care centres to treat victims to save lives. “We must ensure that the accidents decline. We must first identify accident-prone spots and build trauma care centres at some locations to ensure how we can save lives,” the CM said. Thackeray said motorists should follow “niyam (rules)” and maintain “sanyam (restraint)” to keep “Yam (God of death)” away. Maharashtra is among the top three states in the country to have reported the highest number of fatalities (11,452) due to road accidents last year, said Parab. Mumbai, however, witnessed a decline in the number of total accidents and fatalities last year as compared to 2019. While the city reported 1,776 accidents and 299 fatalities in 2020, 2,872 road mishaps had occurred the year before that, killing 447 people. After Mumbai’s guardian minister from Congress, Aslam Shaikh, sought heavy fines on traffic offenders, Parab said, “We do feel that the traffic norms must be stricter but we are not very keen on recovering fines and penalising people [for traffic violations]. But if we don’t do it [recover fines], then motorists will also not follow the traffic rules only if we conduct awareness campaigns. The drink-and-drive cases reduced after stern actions were taken against the traffic violators. If there is proper awareness combined with strict action against violations, then we will get the expected results through road safety campaigns.” Shaikh said there is a need to increase traffic fines and action. “The traffic fines need to be increased. While the maximum traffic violations are of motorcycles, we impose a normal fine and allow them to go. If we seize their two-wheelers or file cases, then it will create a fear. The process for acquiring driving licences also needs to be made stricter,” he said. Parab also said the state transport department is making the licencing process better with less human interference. He said training institutions are soon coming up in the state where drivers will be tested at automated centres. “Fifty driving training institutions will start in the state soon. The tests will happen at the automatic centres, where there will be less human interference that will ensure quality training to drivers,” the minister said. Parab said the state is also planning to stop issuing new permits for autorickshaws and black-and-yellow taxis in the city as well as increase their minimum fares. However, a decision will be taken only after a thorough study on the two issues. “The decision regarding the fare hikes and permits will be taken after studying the situation of the rickshaws and taxis as well as the passengers. A complete study is being done on both the issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/not-keen-on-fines-for-traffic-violations-maharashtra-transport-minister-101611000084163.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-4 coaches: Bombardier lowest bidder, Chinese manufacturer ‘non-responsive’||Canadian company Bombardier has emerged as the lowest bidder for manufacturing 234 coaches for the Metro-4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarvadavli) and its extension line 4A (Kasarvadavli-Gaimukh). A Chinese firm had also shown interest in manufacturing the rakes in July 2020. However, according to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) officials, the Chinese firm – CRRC Corporation Ltd – did not qualify for the bids.In a text message, MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev confirmed that the Bombardier is L1 or the lowest bidder and that the bid process is still on for the tender worth ₹1,865 crore. The bid is likely to be awarded to the lowest bidder post the financial evaluation. He also said that CRRC’s bid was found to be ‘non-responsive’ or in other words not conforming to the bid’s requirements. A spokesperson for Bombardier said, “Metro cars will be produced at our Savli and Maneja sites near Vadodara.” The trains will also be designed at the engineering centre in Hyderabad.In June 2020, CRRC and another Chinese company – BYD Co Ltd – had shown interest in manufacturing 10 additional rakes for the Mumbai Monorail. However, MMRDA had terminated the bids, stating that it would look for Indian manufacturers following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” or self-reliant India.Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), which is manufacturing coaches for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar East-Andheri East), had also expressed interest in manufacturing rakes for Metro-4 and 4A.The 32.3-km corridor will connect the city to neighbouring Thane, and is being built for ₹14,549 crore. The extension to this corridor is a 2.7-km stretch till Gaimukh along Ghodbunder Road. In November 2020, a German funding agency, KfW, had approved a loan worth ₹4,000 crore for procuring rolling stock, implementing the integrated ticketing system and multimodal integration for the two lines. The line is expected to be operational by October 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-4-coaches-bombardier-lowest-bidder-chinese-manufacturer-nonresponsive-101611000082386.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Application seeking action for contempt against Kangana Ranaut filed in Bombay HC||An interim application has been filed in the Bombay high court (HC), seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against actor Kangana Ranaut for lowering the dignity of the court by tweeting and posting a video of her visit to Bandra police station on January 8. The petition, filed Bandra resident Munnawarali Sayyed, claims that the actor has violated the undertaking given by her on November 24, during the hearing of a petition filed by her seeking quashing of a first information report (FIR). The FIR was filed against Ranaut and her sister, Rangoli. The actor had assured the court that she would not use the social media platform to speak about the petition, and would attend the police station on January 8, 2021. However, on the said day, she not only tweeted about her visit to the police station but also maligned the authority of the court by saying that as a woman she was not being allowed to speak. Hence, the application seeks contempt proceedings against her. The petition, filed through Sayyed’s advocates Kamran Shaikh and Mohsin Shaikh, pointed to a tweet and video message posted by Ranaut on January 8. In the tweet, the actor alleged of being mentally, emotionally and physically tortured and sought the support of her Twitter followers. In the video message, she questioned the judiciary for asking her to keep quiet. In light of the above, the interim application has alleged, “Respondent in blatant disregard to the statement made before this honourable court, and without having any respect to the authority and majesty of law, committed a wilful breach of the order of this honourable court and interfered with the administration of justice and the judicial process by publishing a contemptuous tweet cum video on her Twitter account.” The actor had filed a petition seeking quashing of a sedition case filed against her and her sister by Bandra Police on an order by the magistrate. During the hearing of her petition on November 24, the actor had submitted to the court that she would attend the police station on January 8, 2021, and would not post any tweets about the case, pending the hearing. The interim application is expected to come up for hearing in due course along with the petition filed by Ranaut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/application-seeking-action-for-contempt-against-kangana-ranaut-filed-in-bombay-hc-101610999902114.html

What the state government has done is exercise the same power in less than six months for another temporary appointment, which is not needed,” said Anjali Helekar, advocate representing Sawant.“Appointment of a registrar has to be done as per law by the vice-chancellor, on the recommendation of a select committee constituted for the purpose. Even the temporary post has to be handed to someone appropriate for the post by the vice-chancellor only,” states the petition.Despite repeated attempts, Atram was unavailable for comment.On January 15, the university’s Fort campus witnessed high-power drama as Atram was not allowed to take his post by vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar who waited for clarity from the state government. The drama ended only at 5pm after the state government clarified and reaffirmed the appointment, following which Atram officially took over the post.The state government on January 8 had released a notification confirming Atram’s appointment as the registrar for the university. This post had been lying vacant since July 2020 after the death of former registrar Ajay Deshmukh. The state government notification states that Atram’s post as the registrar has been approved for only one year.Following this, Pednekar had on January 13 written to the state government to rethink their decision, stating that the current in-charge registrar Gaikwad “has been doing well at the post”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senate-member-files-petition-against-new-university-of-mumbai-registrar-101610999722409.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to restart vaccination drive from Tuesday||After a two-day halt following the launch on Saturday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will on Tuesday restart its Covid-19 vaccination drive for 130,000 healthcare workers, under the first part of the programme.A total of 1,926 healthcare workers were vaccinated across the city on Saturday. However, the drive was suspended owing to technical glitches in CoWIN, the mobile application used for registration of vaccine beneficiaries across the country. While the civic body claimed the application is now functional and they are undertaking tests by sending text messages to vaccine beneficiaries, it plans to conduct the vaccination drive only four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The drive will be gradually increased to five days a week, said civic officials.Dr Sheela Jagtap, immunisation officer of the BMC, said, “The aim is to vaccinate 4,000 health workers daily, and gradually increase the capacity. We conducted tests throughout Monday, by sending text messages to the vaccine beneficiaries. In case, the text messages do not get delivered, we will call them individually. For now, the vaccination will happen on four days a week —Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.”According to BMC officials, until Saturday, they were calling individuals and asking them to come to the respective centres for vaccination, but later they were asked to stop the process, and conduct it only via CoWIN application. However, now they have got the go-ahead to restart the process by calling beneficiaries, in case the application does not function.While the BMC has sent text messages to vaccine beneficiaries via the CoWIN app, in addition to this all the 24 Covid war rooms will be provided with the list of beneficiaries to inform them individually about the place and time of inoculation by calling them.A total of 1,926 health workers were vaccinated on Saturday, according to BMC, and 200 staffers, including 80 vaccinators, were involved in the process.Meanwhile, the BMC has maintained that no adverse effect or major side effect has been reported among healthcare workers who got vaccinated on Saturday. However, a few workers complained of fever, chills, body ache on Sunday — a day after getting the vaccine shot. By Monday, all these workers said they were feeling better.A senior doctor, who took the vaccine and did not wish to be named, said, “On Sunday, for the entire day, I felt a little weak with some body ache. Hence, I took a normal pain killer after which I felt better on Monday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-restart-vaccination-drive-from-tuesday-101610999661683.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||BMC demolishes chimneys of Kalbadevi gold processing units after complaints of pollution||Around 40 chimneys at gold processing units in Kalbadevi have been demolished by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the past month following complaints of pollution from residents in the area.The demolition drive is part of ongoing efforts to curb emissions from such chimneys, said BMC. Chakrapani Alley, assistant commissioner, C ward, of which Kalbadevi is a part, said, “We are in the practice of regularly demolishing these chimneys whenever they are brought to our notice. If there are complaints, we demolished the chimneys and recover the demolition cost from the gold processing units.”Kalbadevi is lined with gold processing units operating in small establishments. These establishments release acidic fumes in the air, alleged residents of the area, who have been complaining to the BMC for the past decade.Last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) acknowledged the pollution caused by gold processing units and made it mandatory for all BIS-certified assaying and hall-marking units to seek clearance under the Air and Water Pollution Act. CPCB said that gold processing units release lead oxides and nitrous fumes.“There are more than 2,500 units with chimneys. These units operate in small establishments that have been rented or sub-let, without any clearance. They process and clean gold with acids. This releases poisonous smoke and acidic fumes which are released in the air through chimneys made of PVC pipe,” said Harikishan Goradia, a Kalbadevi resident.He said BMC’s efforts to demolish the chimneys were too little, too late. “These chimneys return even after demolition. Unless the root cause is not addressed, which is the unit itself, there is no respite for us. We have been complaining about the fumes to various authorities, but there has been very little response. The emissions are visible to the naked eye and the pollution levels in the area are adversely affecting residents,” Goradia added.Alley, however, said that BMC would take action against those chimneys that reappear after demolition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-demolishes-chimneys-of-kalbadevi-gold-processing-units-after-complaints-of-pollution-101610999482191.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai EOW registers FIR against Telugu channel for causing loss to actor-producer||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police has registered a first information report (FIR) against a Telugu broadcaster following a complaint lodged by actor-producer Deepti Bhatnagar alleging violation of her copyrights by illegally broadcasting her show Yatra. The actor alleged that she faced losses of ₹1.5 crore due to violation of her copyrights.Bhatnagar’s Deepti Bhatnagar Production in Andheri (West), had produced the actor’s show, Yatra, which was telecasted on Star TV in Hindi in 2001.In March 2003 Star India Pvt Ltd released multiple rights of the show in the actor’ favour. It included video rights, terrestrial rights for India and Hindi language only, all dubbing rights in all languages (except Tamil), internet and publishing rights, worldwide.An EOW officer said that in 2014, the complainant got to know that the show was being telecasted on Bhakti channel in Telugu, which is owned by Rachana Television Pvt Ltd. After Star India Pvt Ltd accepted that it was an inadvertent error on their part, the matter was settled.Following this, Bhatnagar entered into a license agreement with Rachana TV in March 2015, permitting the channel dubbing rights to episodes 81 to 145 of the show for two years.“The license agreement expired in 2017 and was not extended. However, Rachana TV has been allegedly illegally retaining possession of the master copies of the licensed episodes, even after expiry of the license period,” said the EOW officer.The actor stated in her complaint that Rachana TV is not only illegally retaining possession of master copies but is also telecasting them on their television channels and online platforms without her permission and without paying any license fees, thus, infringing her copyright of the show.“I trusted them and handed over my work to them, and they took undue advantage of the trust bestowed upon them and duped me by continuing to telecast the show without informing me. Rachana TV dishonestly misappropriated the master copy/copies and used the same for their monetary benefit without there being any valid agreement for the same,” Bhatnagar stated in the FIR.“Rachana TV was supposed to protect me and my show’s interest all the time, in lieu of the earlier arrangement, but they had malafide intentions to earn monetary benefit out of the said acts,” she added.Despite the actor asking them to return the master copies of her show, Rachana TV has till date failed to return them and are enjoying monetary benefits by telecasting the show on their channels and online platforms, police said.The directors, promoters, representatives and employees of Rachana TV have allowed the over-the-top (OTT) content provider YuppTV to telecast the show on their platform without having any legal or contractual right, and handed over copies of the show without Bhatnagar’s consent and/or permission. “Rachana TV in connivance with others have caused wrongful loss to the tune of ₹1.5 crore to us and corresponding gain to themselves,” the actor has alleged.“We have carried out a preliminary inquiry in the matter for weeks and after cognisable material was found, an FIR has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Copyright Act,” said another EOW officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-eow-registers-fir-against-telugu-channel-for-causing-loss-to-actorproducer-101610999361500.html

Vaccination will be conducted on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday at 285 centres in Maharashtra,” the CM said.The state has set a target of inoculating around 28,500 health workers in a day (four days a week) at 258 centres across the state, officials said.“We have planned to inoculate 28,500 health workers daily at 285 centres. It is like a floating number provided by the Centre, for instance, if we completed an area then we will be shifting to another location to complete the drive.Going by plan of covering 100 beneficiaries in a day at one centre, it can also be achieved,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare and director, National Health Mission.State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday evening that the state government will “review the situation” before restarting the vaccination drive from Tuesday in view of several complaints of minor adverse reactions as well as glitches in using the Co-WIN application.“At several places where vaccination was held on January 16, we have received complaints from health workers. Though none of the complaints is of a serious nature, we have decided to review the situation first and then resume the vaccination (drive),” he told reporters.The Maharashtra government on Saturday evening announced suspension of the Covid-19 vaccination drive till Monday owing to problems in the software application.The Co-WIN platform assists programme managers in states to conducting vaccination sessions. Data of the beneficiaries is populated onto Co-WIN and the session allocation, details of vaccination to the beneficiary, information about the next dose will be captured and communicated digitally. It also sends messages to the beneficiaries to visit the designated centre.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-all-set-to-restart-covid-19-vaccination-drive-from-tuesday-101610999302148.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Two mild cases of AEFI reported in Mumbai after Covid-19 vaccination||Two mild adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) have been reported in Mumbai after taking Covishield vaccine on Saturday, first day of the nationwide mass inoculation programme. Both the healthcare workers have been kept under observation in hospitals. As per doctors, they are stable and will soon be discharged. On Sunday, a 42-year-old doctor from VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, was immediately admitted at the intensive care unit (ICU) after he experienced loose motions along with dizziness, weakness, dehydration and fever. However, he is stable and is scheduled to be discharged on Monday night. The doctor, requesting anonymity, said, “I am much better now and do not have any severe reaction. This is common for any type of immunisation programme. Public should not be scared of it and come forward for vaccination.” Another case was reported at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel. A female healthcare worker developed fever following the vaccination. She has been admitted in the general ward. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of the hospital, said she would be discharged by Tuesday morning. “Developing fever after a vaccination is a positive sign which means that the body’s mechanism is reacting to it... It has to react to the antigen to prepare the antibodies; so, everybody develops some kind of reactions. Some need admission while others do not. This depends on whether the beneficiary had lunch, their regular tables or any history of illness,” said Dr Deshmukh. On January 16, the first day of the vaccination, 1,926 beneficiaries were administered with Covishield vaccine in Mumbai at nine civic body-run centres. On the same day, 40 healthcare workers were inoculated with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at government-run Sir JJ Hospital. Hospital authorities said no one has reported any kind of adverse reaction to the indigenous vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-mild-cases-of-aefi-reported-in-mumbai-after-covid-19-vaccination-101610999123804.html

Two officials privy to the development said that the committee has held three meetings till date and Monday’s visit was the first site visit for the committee. “The members visited both the plots to understand the pros and cons. The committee will have another meeting in the coming days to take a final decision,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment, who is part of the committee, said, “We had a site visit today, and we will most likely submit the report within this month.” The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on January 6 formed a nine-member committee under state chief secretary Sanjay Kumar to look at alternate plots for building the car shed for Metro-3 and Metro-6. The committee has to specifically look at the plots in Aarey and Kanjurmarg and submit its report in a month. While the earlier committee, appointed under additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik in 2019, had also met citizens to consider their views, sources said that the current committee appointed under the chief secretary has not met with any citizen representatives yet. The two committees appointed earlier had studied nine plots before presenting their recommendations. In 2015, the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had appointed a committee under the then metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan that recommended building an integrated car shed for Metro-3 and 6 at Kanjurmarg. In 2019, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, after staying the works at Aarey, appointed a committee under Saunik. The committee, which submitted its report in January 2020, stated that Aarey would be the most viable option.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-appointed-panel-appointed-to-suggest-alternate-metro-car-shed-visits-aarey-and-kanjurmarg-101610999122680.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Oshiwara police arrests two rape accused||Oshiwara police on Sunday arrested two accused in two separate cases of rape which were registered in November and September last year. The two accused, who were absconding, were arrested from their respective villages in Haryana and Rajasthan.According to the police, in the first case registered in September 2020, a 12-year-old girl was raped by her brother’s 27-year-old friend. The accused, Akram Ali Khan, was absconding since then. He fled from Mumbai after the incident and switched off his mobile phone. In the second case registered in November last year, a 21-year-old woman was raped by a 20-year-old man after the accused promised to marry her. Sub-inspector Javed Karadkar of Oshiwara police station said they had been tracking both the rape accused since last year, but could not find them. On Friday, the police officers investigating the cases found that both the accused had switched on their phones briefly after which they were tracked down. “We traced their locations and tracked the accused by their mobile tower locations, Khan was traced in Haryana and Gulam was traced in his village in Rajasthan,” said Karadkar.On Sunday, two police teams left for Haryana and Rajasthan and arrested the two on charges of rape. “Both the accused are being brought to Mumbai and will be presented before the court,” added Karadkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaioshiwara-police-arrests-two-rape-accused-101610998883659.html

The idea was floated by Maharashtra minister for tourism Aaditya Thackeray, in a meeting and site visit on Monday with senior civic officials with jurisdiction over the area. Thackeray later took to social media and tweeted, “This morning I visited Mahim Retibunder to check on the progress of our beach restoration drive. I also discussed with DMC Ballamwar ji and AC @DighavkarKiran ji about our plan to have a cycle track from Mahim Fort to Bandra Fort. A watchtower for tourists is near complete.”Thackeray directed Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G-North ward, to check the feasibility of the project. “During the site visit, Aaditya Thackeray proposed the cycle track and has asked the civic administration to check the feasibility of this project. As discussed, it will run along the sea between Mahim fort and Bandra fort, along the existing road on the other side. Cyclists will be able to enjoy the view of the sea on one side,” said Dighavkar.“Only a small portion of this 5-km patch has a beach, at Mahim. In this portion, the track can run along the beach,” he added.Following up on its earlier plans to restore Mahim fort and Mahim beach, BMC began beach restoration at Mahim Retibunder before the Covid-19 lockdown. The plan includes restoration of the beach, construction of a promenade, a walkway, and a watchtower, and artwork to beautify the area, along with a seaside retaining wall. In October 2020, BMC transported sand to the Mahim Retibunder and began planting trees which are suitable to grow on the beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-plans-5-km-cycle-track-between-mahim-fort-and-bandra-fort-101610998882560.html

The long weekends around Republic Day, Good Friday, Holi, Janmashtami, Dussehra and Christmas are expected to see significant traveller interest.Travel portals said that over the years, multiple short breaks to relax, reconnect and rejuvenate have become the order of the day for leisure travellers. Vacationers look to pause and unwind at quaint, tranquil properties in the hills of Himachal or Uttarakhand, or at the beaches of Goa and Pondicherry – spending more time with their loved ones and make the most of the hotel and in room amenities.Vipul Prakash, chief operating officer (COO), MakeMyTrip, said, “Bookings on MakeMyTrip indicates that couples, small groups of friends and families with children have already started to plan and book staycations for long weekends for the year, starting with the Republic Day-long weekend. As travel sentiment revives, we hope to see more takers for the long weekend travel in the coming months.”Cleartrip said it saw a revival in the last quarter of 2020, catalysed by seasonal demand and ease in restrictions.“In 2021, we expect the large pent up demand to further convert into bookings. The vaccination plans will significantly aid the recovery in travel volumes, and as countries continue their vaccination drives, we may also see international travel restrictions easing. Travel will also be spurred by the number of long weekends this year, evenly spread out across all quarters,” said a spokesperson from Cleartrip.According to Yatra.com, the travel and hospitality industry is gearing up with customised services, among others, to attract more tourists, and quick getaways as a trend has increased exponentially in the past few years with a number of travellers across India packing their bags and setting out on journeys.Sabina Chopra, co-Founder and COO, corporate travel; and head, industry relations, Yatra.com, said, “ In 2021, we can expect this trend to grow further in demand, as tourists plan their travel before or after the weekends. The vaccine announcement is also expected to push this growth furthermore as we foresee people planning their trips judiciously while taking all precautionary measures in terms of health and safety.”“For January, at Yatra.com we have witnessed an increase in demand for two upcoming long weekends of Republic Day and Makar Sankranti where travellers enquired about holiday packages as well as alternate accommodation options largely in 4/5-star properties, homestays and villas among others, in offbeat locations, as people continue to set out for shorter escapes,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-mass-inoculation-on-travel-industry-hopes-for-better-year-101610998881530.html

At first, people mistook it to be a dog and tried to shoo it away only to realise later that it was a jackal. The jackal entered the shop around 11.30am was rescued around 2pm by animal lovers and forest department. Forest officials believe the jackal might have strayed from the mangroves as the area was near the creek. Forest officials sent the jackal for medical examination at the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). Rahul Pandey, the owner of the shop, said, “The jackal directly entered the shop and sat in a corner. We first thought it to be a stray and tried to scare him with a broom. But it snatched the broom and refused to move. When we realised it was a jackal, we closed the shop and informed forest officials.” Sanjay Pawar, range forest officer, Thane, confirmed that the jackal was rescued with the help of Wildlife Welfare Association members. “The jackal was found at 11.30am and was rescued after around two-and-a-half hours. We suspected the jackal came from the creek, which is merely 500 metres from the spot. A stray dog from the area had attacked him; hence he tried to hide in the shop. He had dog bites on his left leg. We rescued him by placing a nylon cage and have sent him for check up to medical officers at Borivli,” said Pawar. Dr Shailesh Pethe, senior veterinarian at SGNP, said, “The animal is around 2.5-years old and is a male golden Jackal. It has some minor wounds on his left hind leg. Necessary treatment has been provided and it looks healthy. We have kept it under observation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/golden-jackal-rescued-from-a-medical-store-in-thane-near-mumbai-101610998762214.html

Price of a litre of petrol was ₹91.56 and diesel was ₹81.87.The increase in fuel price was witnessed after it remained constant for two days. On January 15, a litre of petrol was available at ₹91.32 and diesel was priced at ₹81.60.Earlier, the highest price of petrol recorded in the city was in October 2018 when it reached ₹91.34. The highest price of diesel recorded in the city was last week on Thursday when one litre cost ₹81.60. Earlier, one litre of diesel crossed the ₹-80 mark in 2018.Fuel prices have also increased in other metro cities. The increase in fuel prices is due to an increase in the cost of crude oil throughout last week. Transporters have stated that the government is not serious about the rising fuel prices that could lead to unemployment in the country. “The situation is grave and will have a cascading effect. Fuel prices are at an all-time high which will impact small transport operators a lot and even force some to quit their jobs, leading to unemployment. As it is a complete chain of logistics in the supply of different products, the price of essential goods will also increase. We will soon be calling for an all-India transporters meeting, and strong action will be taken,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress.Citizens are also irked with the constant rise in fuel prices and have urged the government to reduce taxes on the fuel. “We are already suffering the financial impact of the coronavirus. Personal vehicles have become the only way for most people to commute in the city. The government should act quickly and reduce the value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel and immediately reduce the price,” said Dr Charu Jain, a Byculla resident.Meanwhile, the city’s Petrol Dealers’ Association has stated that they are helpless due to the constant increase in fuel prices. “We are helpless and have asked the government to intervene. The international crude oil prices have increased. We have also invested money and get rolling credit and do not earn directly.” said M Venkatrao, president, Petrol Dealers’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petrol-rises-to-91-56-l-diesel-to-81-87-as-fuel-prices-continue-to-soar-in-mumbai-101610998702008.html

An ANC officer claimed Shaikh has allegedly bought three to four houses in the city using the profits of illegal drug dealings. The official further said that Shaikh also had a rented house in Kurla from where the police seized 2,700 grams of charas on Sunday. She was paying ₹30,000 per month as rent for the house to hide the contraband, said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Datta Nalawade of ANC. Shaikh’s husband is currently in jail, facing charges of murder, added Nalawade. Following a tip-off, the Ghatkopar unit of ANC laid a trap near Patwardhan Garden on Linking Road in Bandra and nabbed Shaikh on Sunday. During search, MD worth ₹10 lakh and ₹20,000 in cash was recovered from her. She was then brought to the unit office where police conducted further inquiry and learnt about her rented house in Kurla. A team then searched the house and recovered 2 kg and 700 grams of charas and ₹9.45 lakh, said Nalawade. Shaikh was arrested under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and was produced before the court. The court has remanded her in police custody till Wednesday. Shaikh is an active drug supplier and is allegedly involved in smuggling and distributing drugs in the city from Worli to Andheri. She mostly travels in her own car at night and distributes contrabands to drug peddlers, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-anc-arrests-woman-seizes-md-charas-cash-worth-73-65-lakh-101610998641937.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Take vaccine on assigned date, or wait till end of drive: Mumbai civic body||Registered healthcare workers (HCWs) who do not show up on their first assigned date of vaccination will be given a second chance to be vaccinated, but they will have to wait till the end of the inoculation drive, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said on Monday. The civic body estimates it will take more than a month to complete the inoculation process for HCWs in the city. On January 16, which was the first day of the vaccination drive, BMC had set a target of immunising 4,000 HCWs, of which only 1,926 HCWs were vaccinated. Part of the reason for the shortfall was that the Covid vaccine intelligence network (CoWIN) app, which notified HCWs with details of where they can receive the shot, had malfunctioned. CoWIN has been developed by the Centre to monitor vaccine delivery. “The Central government is working to sort out the issue. Once we are able to send messages on time, the rate of turnout for HCWs will increase further,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. Civic officials said those who fail to show up on the designated date for vaccination would be given a second date since it may be impractical to expect 100% turnout on every day of the inoculation drive. “We cannot include the names of HCWs in the corresponding list of beneficiaries since it may lead to confusion. So they will again be given the next date of immunisation after the completion of the programme’s first phase. We therefore suggest that HCWs take the vaccine shot in the first round without missing the registered date,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. In Mumbai, 136,000 HCWs have registered on CoWIN for vaccination. BMC’s original plan entailed inoculating 12,000 HCWs daily, thereby completing the process in 15 days. However, following new directives from the Union health ministry, the civic body said it would need more than a month to immunise all HCWs.“We have to follow the Central government’s instruction to immunise 4,000 HCWs for four days a week. Additionally, there will be a backlog of defaulter HCWs who will be given other dates for vaccination. This has certainly extended the expected time period of the vaccination process,” said Kakani. At present, with the first batch of assigned vaccines from the Centre, BMC has set itself a target of vaccinating 50,000 to 65,000 beneficiaries. BMC received 139,500 units of Covishield in the second week of January, which can inoculate around 70,000 people. “We have to use both dosages from the same batch of vaccines. So we have to keep the remaining vaccines for the second dosage which will be given 28 days after the first dosage. At present, we have kept a target to vaccinate 50,000 HCWs,” said Dr Gomare. Kakani said the civic body would only be able to estimate how long it would take to vaccinate Mumbai’s population of approximately 20 million people after the inoculation process has been smoothened out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/take-vaccine-on-assigned-date-or-wait-till-end-of-drive-mumbai-civic-body-101610998161992.html

An overall air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator — of 156 was measured, which falls in the moderate category. This beats the lowest AQI recorded in the year before this at 162 on January 16. Air quality had remained in poor to very poor category since the beginning of January owing to low temperatures. On January 8, AQI was the worst at 317 (very poor). With the onset of westerly winds, the air had cleared up by the weekend, but became poor on Sunday with an AQI of 252.“Air mass has formed in the ocean and wind blowing from the sea is cleaner than the air from land mass. Winds blowing from the north and west have cleared the air of pollutants. The air quality is expected to remain in moderate to poor category,” said a spokesperson for System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). AQI was calculated by SAFAR as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. Of the 10 locations measured, only Navi Mumbai recorded very poor air with AQI at 351.SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Meanwhile, temperatures increased in the city. Santacruz weather station, representative of Mumbai and suburbs, recorded a minimum temperature of 20.2 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees above normal. Colaba observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded minimum temperature at 21.8 degrees Celsius, 3 degrees above normal. Santacruz reported a maximum temperature of 31.6 degrees Celsius, which was 1 degree above normal while it was 29.4 degrees Celsius in Colaba which is 1 degree below normal. “The sky was somewhat cloudy on Monday. Parts of Maharashtra can expect a winter spell towards the middle of the week,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, India Meteorological Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-breathes-its-cleanest-air-so-far-this-year-on-monday-101610997921953.html
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu deaths in Maharashtra soar to 6,816; state to upgrade its lab||The number of bird flu deaths in the state is rising continuously. The toll has reached 6,816 in the past 11 days. Of these, 829 birds were found dead across the state on Monday.In addition, more than 25,000 poultry birds were culled by the local administration in eight districts after bird flu cases were confirmed by the ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal — a nodal body for testing bird flu cases. Of these, over 10,000 birds were culled in the past three days at Parbhani, Latur, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Beed, Ahmednagar and Raigad districts while nearly 15,000 were culled in one village each in Parbhani and Latur to contain the spread last week.On Sunday, 836 bird deaths were reported whereas on Saturday around 1,200 birds were found dead across the state, officials from the state animal husbandry department said.Meanwhile, the state government has decided to upgrade the Western Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WRDDL) in Pune, to do away with its dependency on ICAR-NIHSAD, Anoop Kumar, principal secretary of state animal husbandry department confirmed on Monday.“We shall complete the BSL-3 (Biological Safety Level) laboratory at our own WRDDL. After this, there will be no dependence on NIHSAD laboratory. This will help in confirmation of bird flu strain in the state without any delay,” Kumar said.WRDDL will be turned into BSL-2 and BSL-3 laboratory based on turnkey basis with an expenditure of ₹70 crore. The administrative approval for the project given on Monday, the principal secretary added.CM Thackeray had last week directed the animal husbandry department to upgrade the state laboratory to get rid of its dependency on the central laboratory.The state government has to get confirmation of bird flu or avian influenza from ICAR-NIHSAD to start the culling process of poultry birds.Laboratory facilities that handle infectious agents are categorised by BSL which corresponds to the risk level of the pathogens being handled. BSL-3 laboratories are designated for indigenous or exotic agents that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation. BSL-3 laboratory is pervasive worldwide for applications ranging from microbiological research, scientific teaching, biomedical, diagnostic and clinical, bio-security, vaccine research, to various production facilities.The state government already empowered all district collectors for immediate implementation of a containment plan even if they suspect deaths due to bird flu. It, however, has not banned supply and sale of poultry birds in the state except in the one-km radius of the poultry farms where bird flu cases have been confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-deaths-in-maharashtra-soar-to-6-816-state-to-upgrade-its-lab-101610997801752.html
19-01-2021||Delhi||26 adverse events in Capital on Monday, two hospitalised: Govt||Two people, among over 3,500 people who received coronavirus vaccines on Monday, were reported to have suffered ‘severe’ adverse effects following immunisation (AEFI).One of them suffered a severe allergic reaction, while the other had an abnormal heart rhythm, as the vaccination programme entered its second day in the national capital. Both who suffered the adverse reactions were administered the Covishield vaccine, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.No adverse events were reported in those who were administered Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on Monday, according to data seen by HT.Other than the two severe adverse reactions, 24 minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection, and fever were reported in the city on Monday.On Saturday, a 22-year-old security guard from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, who had been given a Covaxin jab, had suffered anaphylaxis and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the hospital. He was discharged on Sunday.Adverse events are observed with most vaccines and can range from pain, mild swelling at injection site and body ache to breathlessness and hospitlisation. Experts said AEFIs needed to be evaluated in the context of risk-and-benefits associated with immunization.In the case of coronavirus vaccines, the government has said that there can be mild AEFIs, such as pain and swelling at the site of injection, mild fever, nausea, giddiness and mild rashes. Serious AEFIs can be a severe allergic reaction, such as an anaphylactic shock, which could potentially require hospitalisation.One of the severe adverse reactions was reported in a 27-year-old doctor from Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital whose heartbeat turned irregular after getting the shot.“Her heart was skipping a beat, according to the doctors at the hospital. She was immediately admitted to the hospital. She is stable,” said a senior official from east district, where the hospital is located.The second reaction was reported in a 45 year-old doctor at south-west Delhi’s Venkateshwar hospital who had anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction where the membranes of the throat start swelling up, preventing a person from breathing.After receiving the vaccine, the doctor reported a choking sensation and difficulty swallowing. “She was kept under observation for a few hours, after which she was discharged,” said a senior official from the district.Both who suffered the adverse events on Monday were women.Other than that, two serious adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) from Saturday’s drive were reported later on. One was in a security guard at Max hospital Patparganj, whose blood pressure plummeted after receiving the shot. The second was at Northern Railway hospital, according to details provided by the Union health ministry.“The acceptable level of AEFI would ideally be zero, but that is not the case. I think it is around 0.2% and yet we are focussing on that and not the 99.8% benefit,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/26-adverse-events-in-capital-on-monday-two-hospitalised-govt-101610996438570.html
19-01-2021||City||35% seats reserved for women in Ambala Sadar civic body||The state government has issued a list of 31 wards as per the reservation criteria for the upcoming Ambala Sadar (Cantonment) municipal council elections on Monday.The state government has issued a list of 31 wards as per the reservation criteria for the upcoming Ambala Sadar (Cantonment) municipal council elections on Monday.As per information, the wards were decided by “draw of lots” in Panchkula in the presence of a committee set-up for ward delimitation consisting of BJP’s Sadar Mandal chief Rajiv Dimple and others.In all, 11 seats (35%) have been reserved for women, including nine in general and two in SC category.Apurva Chaudhary, executive officer, Sadar MC, said, “Out of 31 wards, six (wards 3, 4, 21, 23, 26 and 28) have been reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Castes (SC) category, with wards 3 and 28 for women from the same category. Similarly, wards 18 and 20 are reserved for candidates from the backward classes (BC) and wards 1, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19 and 24 for women candidates from the general category. The decision to reserve the post of chairman will be taken by a state committee soon.”As per details, in the last tenure that ended in 2018, there were 20 wards under Ambala MC, out of which 11 were in the city area and nine in the Sadar Zone of the Cantonment. Out of these nine, six members were Congress-backed and three were from the BJP. Earlier, the MC elections had taken place in 2005 and 31 councillors worked till 2010. Later in 2010, the corporation was formed and the Sadar zone was also added, elections for which were held in 2013 for a total of 20 wards. But in 2019, the corporation was divided into Ambala MC and Ambala Sadar municipal council. This is for the first time the civic body will go to polls post-detachment.In the recently-concluded elections of the MC, Venod Sharma’s wife Shakti Rani Sharma of Haryana Janachetana Party (HJP) had claimed the mayor seat. BJP had managed to become the single largest party in the House with eight members followed by HJP with seven, Congress with three and Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) with two. Last week, Congress’ Rajesh Mehta had joined HJP taking the party’s number equal to that of the BJP. Haryana Congress general secretary (grievance cell) and former councillor Onkar Pruthi alleged that the whole process had happened secretly in Panchkula and not in Ambala, and the party will surely make a comeback. “Like in the city, here too the workers would like to contest on the party symbol. But the final decision will be taken by Kumari Selja,” he said.The ruling BJP in the state is confident of winning majorly on the face of local MLA and urban local bodies minister Anil Vij, said Rajiv Dimple. “Our leader Anil Vij’s popularity in the region will make us win. There is no factionalism and we are working as a family,” he said.Like in the city, the contest here is set to be four-cornered with the entry of HDF and HJP. HDF’s general secretary Chitra Sarwara said that the party had started selection of candidates. “But there are speculations that the election for the chairman might be indirect, which shows BJP’s anxiousness after losing at many places in the recent local bodies elections,” she added. HJP’s Venod Sharma has already announced that his party will contest with the same enthusiasm in all wards. He remained unavailable for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/35-seats-reserved-for-women-in-ambala-sadar-civic-body-101610995940545.html

The 61-year-old CPI(M) legislator from Konghad in Palakkad died at Thrissur medical college hospital. The hospital said he was admitted two weeks ago and later tested negative. But post-Covid complications triggered a stroke and he was put on life support for the last few days. Vijayadas was also a member of CPI(M) Palakkad district committee.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled the death of party lawmaker. Vijayadas was elected to assembly twice, 2011 and 2016.Meanwhile, four legislators have tested positive in Kerala during the ongoing budget session even as the state continues to report high incidences of Covid-19 in last two weeks. On Monday the test positivity rate (TPR) went up to 10.11 per cent as Kerala reported 3,346 new cases of the viral disease.The assembly session was originally scheduled till January 28 but it was cut short to January 22 due to the prevailing pandemic situation. Many legislators have approached Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan to reduce it further but he told them that he has to complete budget discussion and other formalities.Also read: 'Masterstroke' - Mamata Banerjee brings Nandigram back in focusOnce lauded for its Covid-19 control measures, Kerala witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases since last month. Kerala and Maharashtra now report one-third of active Covid-19 cases in the country, statistics show. Worried, two weeks back the Union Health Ministry rushed an expert team to the state.In view of the rising caseload, the state has sought more vials of vaccine. When the country’s TPR since January 1 is between 4 and 5 per cent, in Kerala, it ranges between 9 and 10 per cent. The state health department, however, put up a brave face saying the state managed to delay the peak and controlled death rate (0.4 against the national average of 1.40) considerably. Now, the state has 68,399 active cases and has reported 3,480 Covid-19 fatalities so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-mla-dies-of-covid-19-complications-4-state-legislators-test-positive-101610989269500.html
