07-01-2021||News||Devising a vaccine strategy for India||India has now approved the vaccines developed by Astra-Zeneca and Bharat Biotech. Several more will likely be available later in 2021. Deploying these vaccines effectively will be crucial. India and other developing countries have to keep their specific circumstances in mind while formulating vaccine strategies.India will not need to vaccinate 1.35 billion people, but just beyond the point where the reproductive rate is under control even without suppression. If India had, for example, 60% of people already infected and we knew who they were, we would have to vaccinate at most 40% or ~560 million persons. This requires approximately 1.1 billion doses, given that most vaccines need a booster dose. Actual targets will be higher if India cannot identify who already has natural immunity. The choice of vaccines will be constrained by cost, cold-chain availability and so on. There are five key issues that vaccine strategies must consider. The first is allocation. Most nations will vaccinate healthcare workers first. They treat those who are infected with Covid-19 and vaccinate the remaining population. After that, it seems logical to prioritise the elderly, who have a higher infection fatality rate. However, premature death costs a young person more years of life than an old person. The balancing of risk and harm may have convinced Indonesia to buck the global consensus and vaccinate working age persons first. It is worth considering in India. Even if the elderly are prioritised, that will not exhaust the vaccine supply: 80% of India’s population is below 50. Allocation among the working age population should consider two factors. First, the additional protective benefit from vaccination is much lower if one has immunity from a prior infection. Thus, areas with a large susceptible population and a higher reproductive rate obtain greater benefits from vaccination. Indeed, with severely limited doses of vaccine available, it may be prudent to screen people for Covid-19 antibodies and prioritise vaccination of those without antibodies. There may also be greater benefits to fully vaccinating one area fully than to giving a small number of doses to multiple areas. Adequate vaccination in an area will permit relaxation of suppression in that area; spreading vaccination across areas may not result in release of any of those areas. Areas that are closest to herd immunity even without suppression require the least number of doses to return to normal economic activity and have higher returns from vaccination. Areas that suffered the greatest economically will have the greatest benefit from relaxing suppression after vaccination. These twin considerations should guide prioritisation. The second issue is distribution. Moving vaccines from companies to warehouses will be relatively easy but moving it from warehouses to distributors to end-users will be tricky, given the difficulties with cold chains and storage facilities. Digitally monitoring storage and transportation facilities will be critical. Second, 600 million or so vaccine recipients need to be identified, and then re-identified three-four weeks later for a second dose. As Nandan Nilekani has suggested, we may need to build a bespoke, vaccine-agnostic digital platform to enable this. Third, administering 30-40 million immunisations a year is a different kettle of fish from vaccinating 600 million people in a year. Sourcing the trained human resources necessary to deliver intramuscular shots, without diverting from existing priorities, will not be easy. Perhaps medical students, phlebotomists, paramedics and pharmacists can be rapidly and reliably trained to administer vaccines. The third issue is financing. The choice here is whether to finance vaccinations publicly or privately. In the United States, United Kingdom and Europe, vaccines are likely to be entirely free and administered publicly. However, India will need a hybrid strategy, where the majority of the population is vaccinated for free publicly, while allowing private markets for approved vaccines. Cost alone will necessitate this. The cheapest vaccine India is considering — Covaxin — will cost over $1.1 billion at $1 per dose. Other vaccines will cost from three times as much (Astra) to 30 times as much (Moderna). Given the tight fiscal situation, the government will be well-advised to have as much private sector involvement as possible.The fourth issue is communication. It’s vitally important for the government to have a well thought out communications strategy to fortify public confidence and reduce vaccine reticence in the population. A good strategy will avoid mixed and contradictory messaging, be simple to comprehend, be science-led, involve regular communication, utilise respected community leaders to widen reach, and clamp down on the spread of misinformation. And the final issue is certification. Resumption of normalcy will require standardisation on certification of immunity, whether by vaccination or prior infection. Every country will need an internal set of protocols regarding proof of vaccination, but also standards that are interoperable with norms elsewhere. In other words, proof of vaccination in India or Tanzania must be acceptable to a Singapore Airlines or Qantas. This will also require multilateral bodies to play an active role in creating frameworks, around which digital platforms can be created. India is embarking on a monumental mission, not just in terms of vaccinating its own population, but also vaccinating a large part of the world thanks to its position as the world’s leading vaccine producer. Addressing these five issues will augment the effort to efficiently get vaccines to hundreds of millions in the shortest period of time.Reuben Abraham is CEO, IDFC Institute in Mumbai, and Dr Anup Malani is professor , University of Chicago Medical SchoolThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/devising-a-vaccine-strategy-for-india/story-u12s0fA8oFOmfMxXo3St1H.html
07-01-2021||News||January 6: A black day for US democracy||January 6 will be remembered as a black and bleak day in the annals of the history of the United States (US), when the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy allowed its legislative heart — the US Capitol — to be stormed by supporters of President Donald Trump. Encouraged by a sitting president who has lost the election for a second term, the protesters saw this as a last-ditch, desperate attempt to overturn the Joe Biden victory. This tragic turn of events in what should have been an orderly transfer of governance in a democracy has resulted in four deaths and, alas, the US stands diminished in its own esteem and that of its well-wishers.The fact that this mass protest was announced days in advance and that the much-touted security system of the US capital and the over-protected legislature allowed this violence to unspool (with possibly tacit support from within) points to many omissions of institutional ineptitude and worse, socio-political turpitude. Led by Trump and his extreme right, largely white support base, a section of US society was rejecting both the rule of law and the principles enshrined in the US constitution with impunity.The white supremacist disregard for the sanctity of law has been on the increase during the Trump presidency and the contrast with how Washington dealt with peaceful protests by African-Americans in recent months is illustrative of the deep racial fissures that still fester in US society. While the Wednesday storming of Capitol Hill was devoid of large-scale violence and had some comical visuals, a worst-case scenario would have been that of heavily-armed extremists taking control of the US Congress and the military having to step in. The fact that preliminary reports refer to vehicles with arms, ammunition, pipe-bombs and Molotov cocktails being found in the vicinity adds to the anxiety of what could have happened on Wednesday.However, to the credit of the US political ecosystem and its inherent resilience, the commitment to both constitutional principles and rule of law was reiterated by the US Congress within hours of the deplorable attack. Led by Vice-President Mike Pence in the Senate and Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives, the shaken and outraged legislators, in the main, condemned the violence and distanced themselves from a president who had brought disgrace to the high office he held. The Biden victory as declared by the electoral college was upheld and it is expected that the White House will have a new occupant on January 20 and that US democracy will be back on track.But this will be a wounded country whose democratic credentials and internal socio-political cohesion will be seen to be tainted and in need of urgent repair. Biden’s priority, hence, will be one of domestic healing and restoring US credibility in the international arena. The challenge to the rhythms of normative democracy symbolised by January 6 will also shrink Washington’s ability to provide substantive and persuasive leadership to the complex global challenges that the world was facing in 2020. These include the 3C spectrum – the climate crisis, China, and Covid-19.A nettlesome Trump legacy issue that will test the Biden team will be the China conundrum, which has a distinctive salience for many nations, including India. While there will be no dearth of critics using January 6 to take potshots at the US and its penchant to “export’” democracy and lead the democratic cluster against Beijing, the American ability to self-correct after a setback is commendable.Trump’s consistent attempts to reject and denigrate the outcome of the US electoral system has no precedent and his term in office will be analysed for years. But the interregnum till January 20 is fraught with some dangerous security-related exigencies. As per US law, the president is at the apex of the nuclear command authority and is “the finger on the button”. The codes are contained in a briefcase referred to as the “football” and this is carried by an aide who is always in close proximity to the president.In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol Hill attack, Trump was missing and close aides revealed that POTUS had “lost it” and appeared deranged. For the US, and the world at large, this is cause for deep concern and one can only hope that the professionals in the system will firewall any impending recklessness by Trump. This low probability exigency, which would have an apocalyptic consequence, is sharply attenuated in relation to Iran and merits mention.The US has no doubt dodged a bullet on January 6, but the complex pattern of events leading to it point to the inherent fragility of the democratic compulsion and the need to nurture it in a positive and normative manner.

07-01-2021||News||Ensure access to justice in a post-Covid world||The Covid-19 pandemic forced the Indian judiciary to adopt digital processes at an unprecedented speed and scale. With a lockdown being imposed on March 25 and the enforcement of physical distancing, courts across India started using video-conferencing to hear cases, accompanied by facilities for e-filing and e-payment, wherever possible. Although there has been media coverage of online hearings in the Supreme Court and a few high courts, the experiences of district court lawyers remain at the margins of public awareness. Given that the district courts are the first port of call for litigants, it is critical to understand the circumstances under which lawyers in these courts worked during this period.DAKSH undertook a rapid review of the experiences of 124 lawyers in nine districts across Delhi (Shahdara and Central Delhi), Madhya Pradesh (Bhopal, Barwani, Morena, and Sidhi) and Karnataka (Bengaluru Urban, Dakshina Kannada, and Kalaburagi) of accessing courts during the pandemic between July 1, 2020 and September 20, 2020. Since this is India’s first large-scale implementation of online hearings, e-filing and e-payment, the findings will help shape the way forward for virtual courts.Any move towards the online functioning of courts must account for the digital divide in India. While mobile phones are used widely, access to the internet and advanced digital equipment remains limited to some urban users. Lawyers in semi-urban and rural districts found online hearings challenging because of internet connectivity issues and unfamiliarity with this mode of working. In MP, a majority of the respondents opted to attend online hearings from designated booths on the court premises because of poor connectivity and the lack of smartphones and/or computers in their homes and offices. Although having booths within the court premises addressed the technological barrier, it raised a fresh set of challenges in the context of the pandemic because it became difficult for court staff to enforce physical distancing.Another drawback of implementing online hearings was that the public did not have access to these hearings in all nine districts. This is a significant departure from the open justice principle followed by Indian courts. In physical hearings, judicial proceedings are conducted and decisions pronounced in “open court”, the evidence is communicated publicly to those present in the court, and there are no impediments to fair and accurate reporting of judicial proceedings.Online hearings should try to replicate this openness as far as possible, by allowing for litigants and the general public to watch the hearings. Opacity reduces the confidence of citizens that even in an online hearing their case will be heard on merits, while giving a fair hearing to all parties, leading to enforceable remedies, utilising procedures that are conspicuously fair and perceived to be so.Across the three states, the production of undertrial prisoners remotely was not considered mandatory and seemed to depend on the judge hearing the case. The production of an accused person before a magistrate is an important fair-trial requirement because it allows the magistrate to enquire whether the accused has legal representation, to determine the age of the accused, enquire about their health, and make a reasoned decision on the need for further confinement. This should not be dispensed with for the sake of expediency.Along with connectivity, the choice of digital platforms also affected experiences of online hearings. None of the platforms used for webinars and meetings is customised for court hearings. So, hearings on these platforms take place in the same manner as a virtual meeting and do not emulate the experience of a physical court. To illustrate this point in the context of criminal trials, defendants may feel comfortable telling a judge before whom they are physically present about custodial violence, but cannot do so on video conference from prison because the prison staff are present in the same room. Therefore, the architecture of the platform must allow the defendant to speak to a judge without the prison staff being present. Additionally, there must be a provision for undertrial prisoners to confer in private with the lawyers virtually.The experience of several respondents with e-filing has not been agreeable and they have reverted to physical filing as soon as it was permitted. In several places, e-filing had to be followed by the physical filing of the same documents, making the process of e-filing redundant. Respondents also found e-filing inconvenient because of the restrictions on file sizes and formats, and technical issues with the websites. They stressed on the need for support in the form of training videos and helplines for lawyers to help them navigate online hearings.The shutdown of courts across India provided an opportunity to adapt to digital modes of working. The large strides made in this regard need to be evaluated and improved upon. It is important to not lose this momentum and institutionalise a hybrid model of working along with systems such as e-filing, e-payment while safeguarding due process and ensuring access to justice to people on both sides of the digital divide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/ensure-access-to-justice-in-a-post-covid-world/story-o4OLC4wEa40hSLCJFww0HJ.html
07-01-2021||News||To secure India’s energy future, create a sovereign wealth fund and invest||Indians pay among the highest prices for petrol globally, because of taxes, even as oil is close to multi-year lows. How can these two extremes be aligned? The ongoing turmoil in the oil markets due to the pandemic and under-utilised supply presents a long-term opportunity for India to secure its energy future. Simply, India can take small stakes in the listed oil and gas companies of democracies such as the United States (US), Canada and Australia, via a specially created sovereign wealth fund (SWF). India is currently the world’s third- largest consumer of oil with growing demand and limited domestic supplies. Import in 2019-20 was 1.6 billion barrels and will increase as its economy expands. Some analysts believe that the big thrust on electric vehicles (EVs) will spell the end of the oil age. But will it? Electric cars still account for less than 2% of all cars sold worldwide and there are no alternatives for heavy trucks — the biggest oil consumers in India. EVs depend on the reliability of supply chains for key minerals — rare earths, lithium and cobalt — the majority of which are from, or controlled by, China. For a range of reasons, the obituary for oil looks premature. India’s oil demand is set to rise in the foreseeable future.Luckily, the energy market is currently in India’s favour. This is due to increased oil production in the US and Canada over the past decade, which has brought down the price of oil. The US has added 8.5 million barrels/day to its oil production from 2008-18, accounting for over 70% of the increase in global oil production over this period. Canada added 2 million barrels/day to its oil production in the same period. This increased supply and the short-term demand disruption caused by Covid-19 means that oil prices will remain weak for some time.This also means that upstream oil and gas investments can be made on the cheap today. Such investments can protect India from future increases in oil prices as financial returns from them will increase in line with oil prices. This approach is in contrast with India’s traditional one, where India’s State-owned oil companies invested in oil and gas fields. Most investments were made in economies such as Russia, Mozambique and Venezuela — and many have run into political or economic instability.An investment in developed economies, especially the US or Canada, carries fewer risks. Historically, the cost of assets in stable western countries was a deterrent, but with the low oil prices of the past few years, especially in 2020, many of these investments now look attractive. To do so, India must set up a sovereign wealth fund to invest in listed oil and gas companies — in contrast with the country’s public sector acquiring assets, or companies. First, oil and money are both fungible. The higher dividend payout from energy investments will offset the impact of higher prices. Second, large-scale acquisitions by foreign State-owned companies are not favoured either in the US or Canada, more so in the current environment of predatory investments by Chinese companies. However, sovereign wealth fund’s from across the world routinely invest in western financial markets as they are seen purely as financial investors, not acquirers. Third, there is the risk of accidents and, therefore, unlimited exposure. For instance, BP discovered in 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico disaster that there is no upper limit to penalties for environmental damage. An Indian public sector company with an operational stake may be liable in case of an unfortunate event. A sovereign wealth fund with a minority stake will not be liable.Norway is an example of prudent management of the windfall from high oil prices of the past, with which it set up a rainy day fund — now one of the most powerful and successful in the world. India is witnessing a similar windfall, in reverse, due to low oil prices — and needs to plan for the time when prices will be higher. That time is now.Amit Bhandari is fellow for energy and environment studies programme, Gateway House The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/to-secure-india-s-energy-future-create-a-sovereign-wealth-fund-and-invest/story-yba92QduQ7G94T6Sje8pJM.html

07-01-2021||News||India’s retrospective taxation blunder is still extracting heavy costs||A retroactive law is truly a monstrosity. Law has to do with the governance of human conduct by rules. To speak of governing...today by rules that will be enacted tomorrow is to talk in blank prose”. This quote by Lon L Fuller, an American legal philosopher, aptly summarises India’s retroactive tax misadventure.In 2012, India amended the Income Tax Act retroactively to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision favouring Vodafone in a tax battle with the government. The 2012 amendment spooked foreign investors. It amended Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act, retroactively making it applicable to “indirect transfers”, ie. to the transfer by a non-resident of a share in a company incorporated abroad, if the share derived, directly or indirectly, its value substantially from assets located in India. One such “indirect transfer” was the 2006 internal corporate restructuring carried out by Cairn Energy. Armed with the 2012 amendment, the Indian government in 2015 imposed on Cairn a draft tax assessment of ₹10,247 crores for the corporate restructuring that took place in 2006.Consequently, Cairn sued India before an investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunal alleging that imposition of taxes retroactively violates the India-United Kingdom bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The ISDS tribunal, in late December, ruled in favour of Cairn, holding India guilty of violating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) obligation of the India-UK BIT. The tribunal dismissed India’s argument that the 2012 amendment clarified the intent of Parliament regarding “indirect transfers” and that it was not retroactive.The tribunal held that the 2012 amendment substantively changed the scope or operation of Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act. The tribunal also ruled that whether the 2012 amendment was constitutional or not has no bearing on India violating its treaty obligations because India’s liability has to be ascertained under international law. This is important because it ruptures the myth perpetuated by the defenders of the retroactive amendment that a law passed by Parliament that has not been declared unconstitutional does not violate India’s BIT obligations. The sovereign right to tax should be exercised in a manner consistent with international law.The tribunal reasoned that India’s decision to retroactively apply the law, without a specific justification, created a new tax burden on a transaction that was not taxable at the time it was carried out, ie. in 2006. India robbed Cairn of its ability to plan its activities keeping in mind the legal consequences of its conduct. It disproportionately undermined the principle of legal certainty, which is one of the core elements of the FET standard specifically and of the rule of law generally. Hence, the tribunal ordered India to return over $1.2 billion to Cairn Energy Plc. This is the second instance of an ISDS tribunal admonishing India’s 2012 retroactive amendment of the Income Tax Act. A few months ago, another ISDS tribunal in Vodafone International Holdings v India found India guilty of breaching the India-Netherlands BIT for imposing taxes on Vodafone retroactively.The 2012 amendment was a momentous error committed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, on assuming office in 2014, had a great opportunity to correct this blunder by amending the law and making it prospective in application. This was expected because the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto, cited by the Cairn tribunal, correctly criticised the UPA government for unleashing tax terrorism and uncertainty that deleteriously impacted the investment climate. However, the NDA government, instead of amending the law, relentlessly pursued the tax claims against Vodafone and Cairn Energy.India has already challenged the Vodafone award. Presumably, it will do the same with the Cairn Energy award. In endeavouring to extract revenue through retroactive taxation that damages investor sentiment in the long run, India is being penny-wise and pound-foolish. The government should remember that promoting rule of law and safeguarding legal certainty are important drivers of foreign investment inflows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-s-retrospective-taxation-blunder-is-still-extracting-heavy-costs/story-gg6EfPCj02UKZQdflcKhzK.html
