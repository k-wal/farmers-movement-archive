In 2020, around five million pilgrims from across India took the holy dip at the confluence of River Ganges and Bay of Bengal to celebrate Makar Sankranti, the first major Hindu festival in the Gregorian calendar.The Mamata Banerjee administration has made elaborate arrangements for the mela. For the first time, provisions have been kept so that pilgrims can also take the holy dip sitting in their home (e-snan) and watching the mela, live on the website. Pilgrims can book online a tirtha samagri pack comprising Ganga Jal in a container, prasad and the holy tika.“The court has directed the state government to freely distribute the e-snan kits to pilgrims who opt for it on the mela ground. People can also opt for the e-snan kit sitting in their homes. In that case people have to pay only the delivery charge,” said Chatterjee.Officials said that till Wednesday 100,560 e-snan kits have been delivered to devotees and only 3432 pilgrims are likely to take the holy dip. At least 35 counters have been set up at Sagar Island and Kolkata from where devotees can take the e-snan kit.Till Wednesday afternoon around 780,000 pilgrims had arrived at the mela ground. Last year around 1.5 million had reached by this time.“At least 5.3 lakh pilgrims have been medically screened at 13 entry points and around 23,000 Rapid Antigen Tests have been done. Announcements were being made in eight languages to make the people aware about the safety norms such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” said Arup Biswa, state minister, who along with a few other ministers and MLAs have reached the mela ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-nod-for-ganga-sagar-mela-asks-state-to-distribute-e-snan-kits-101610561718917.html

Work on the Green Ashiyana Resort is taking place on the Haldhibari animal corridor of KNPTR; the state forest department and the local administration are blaming each other for the flouting of the ban. This is the second instance of construction near KNPTR. In July last year, HT had reported about the construction of a building on the Kanchanjuri animal corridor of the park, a UNESCO world heritage site known as the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos. In April, 2019, acting on an application by animal activist Rohit Choudhury, the SC had “restrained” all mining along the southern boundary of KNPTR and in the entire catchment area of rivers/streams and rivulets originating in the Karbi Anglong hill ranges and flowing into the park. “No new construction shall be permitted on private lands which form part of the nine identified animal corridors,” the order said. Despite the SC order, construction is taking place on private land on the animal corridors in and around KNPTR.In September, the central empowered committee of the top court had written to the Assam chief secretary as well as chief wildlife warden, terming the violations a “serious issue” because they amounted to contempt of the court. On January 4, P Sivakumar, director of KNPTR, wrote to the Golaghat deputy commissioner mentioning the construction of the Green Ashiyana Resort on an animal corridor and urging the district administration to take action against it. “The resort has constructed a boundary wall over the stream in the southern side of the resort. During October, 2019, a wild elephant while coming back from the Karbi Anglong area to the park had got stuck up inside the boundary wall enclosures of the resort,” said the letter, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Despite instructions by the forest department to remove the boundary wall over the stream and allow smooth movement of wild animals, the resort authorities didn’t do anything. “The resort is carrying out new construction work on the eastern side. They are not allowing forest personnel to carry out road cum high land work and are trying to {wrest} control over the temple and fishery pond which they have constructed inside,” the letter added. Golaghat deputy commissioner Bibhash Chandra Modi said the administration came to know about the construction just two days ago from the forest department. He said action would be taken against the resort soon and the SC order complied with. “This is a mockery and contempt of the SC order and neither forest department nor civil administration are serious on implementing the order. While the blame game continues, it is the wildlife and the environment which is getting affected. The SC should take action against the KNPTR director as well as the Golaghat DC for clear violation of its order,” said wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury. Owner of the Green Ashiyana Resort, Kishore Hazarika, said he had been in occupation of the property since 2003 and till 2019 he was not informed by either forest officials or the district administration that the area falls in an animal corridor. “All this is part of a vindictive campaign against me. There is no notification yet mentioning that the area is in an animal corridor. And even if that is the case, there should be a comprehensive compensation package if action is taken against me or others who have been staying in the area,” said Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resort-construction-near-kaziranga-national-park-afoot-despite-sc-ban-101610561543266.html
13-01-2021||India||Asaduddin Owaisi helped BJP in Bihar, will do so in WB, UP polls: Sakshi Maharaj||Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj on Wednesday mocked All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi saying he had helped the BJP in the Bihar assembly elections and would also help in the polls in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.The assembly election in West Bengal is due in April-May this year while Uttar Pradesh will go to the polls in February-March next year.Sakshi Maharaj was meeting party workers in Saurikh on the Lucknow-Agra expressway. He was on his way to Delhi from Lucknow.“Many thanks to him. May God give him strength and help him. He supported us in Bihar, he will help us in UP and West Bengal elections," the MP told reporters when asked about Owaisi's entry in UP politics.The BJP MP is not the first political leader to claim that Owiasi’s presence in elections helps the saffron party but the AIMIM chief insists that he has no deal with India’s largest political party. Others have often derided him as the “BJP’s B-team”.On Tuesday, Owaisi on Tuesday visited Varanasi where he said that the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a coalition of small parties including the AIMIM and Omprakash Rajbhar’s SBSP, would contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls and put up a strong fight.On January 3, he also forayed into West Bengal in a significant first move to emerge as a threat to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the assembly polls due in West Bengal a few months, Asaduddin Owaisi.Owaisi met a popular young Muslim leader in Kolkata, who, in recent months, has emerged as the most vocal critic of the TMC.The AIMIM contested 24 seats in the Bihar assembly election and won five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asaduddin-owaisi-helped-bjp-in-bihar-will-do-so-in-wb-up-polls-sakshi-maharaj-101610560206893.html
13-01-2021||India||Pollution in Yamuna under Supreme Court scanner for a second time||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took a second shot at cleaning the polluted Yamuna River by taking suo moto cognizance of significantly high levels of ammonia in water discharged from neighbouring Haryana into the Capital.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) issued a notice to two Central Ministries - Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, governments of states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and National Capital Territory of Delhi to be represented on January 19, the next date of hearing.The Court noted that the Constitution and judicial decisions of the past have given the mandate of setting up Sewage Treatment Plants and stoppage of sewage effluents in surface water to the municipalities. However, as seen in the present petition, the Court said, “It is often found that either the sewage is not treated through a plant before being discharged or the treatment plants are not functional or incapacitated.”The Court directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to prepare a report identifying the municipalities along the stretch of the river which are yet to install sewage treatment plants (STP). “It (CPCB) shall also submit priority-wise list of Municipalities, river stretches adjacent to which have been found to be most polluted,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The central pollution body will also be at liberty to identify other gaps causing untreated sewerage to be discharged into the river.A similar exercise was undertaken by the Supreme Court in July 1994 by taking suo moto notice of a HT report “And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna”. After monitoring the case for 23 years and gaining little success, the apex court on April 24, 2017 transferred the suo moto petition to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).The bench seemed to be aware of this order as it recorded in its order, “It is clarified that the suo moto petition and directions issued herein, shall not in any way dilute any other directions issued by other Court or Tribunal.” The suo moto petition has been titled “Remediation of polluted rivers”What prompted the top court to examine the matter a second time over was a petition filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to stop Haryana government from discharging pollutants into the river. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora who appeared for DJB pointed out that level of ammonia in the river water flowing through Delhi had reached alarming proportions. On December 25 last year, ammonia concentration in water peaked to 13 ppm as against the permissible limit of 0.5 ppm.Arora said, “The water treatment plants of DJB are able to treat water with ammonia content up to 0.9 ppm. Due to this reason, our plants at Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla are forced to function at nearly 50 per cent capacity. The problem is with Haryana as their STPs do not work. They should not discharge untreated sewerage into the river. Ammonia mixed with chlorine can cause cancer. We cannot supply this water to residents.”DJB in its petition demanded an immediate order against Haryana to stop discharge of pollutants into the river. Haryana was even accused of not releasing the full 450 cusecs of water to Delhi at Wazirabad and demanded an order to that effect. The DJB had in the past written several letters to its Haryana counterpart but no concrete action has been forthcoming.Pointing to the “extremely dire and urgent situation” facing Delhi, DJB in its petition filed by advocate Shadan Farasat said, “The water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Okhla, Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi may not be able to process/pump any water at all due to the extremely high impurity levels. This would completely disrupt the supply of drinking water in the NCT of Delhi and can potentially plunge it into a humanitarian crisis where many of its residents are unable to access drinking water.”The bench said, “We find that in addition to the issue raised by present petition, it will be appropriate to take suo moto cognizance with regard to the issue of contamination of rivers by sewage effluents and ensure that the mandate is implemented by municipalities as far as discharge of sewage into rivers is concerned…We deem it appropriate at this stage to start with the issue of contamination of river Yamuna.”The Court appointed Arora as amicus curiae to assist them in the suo moto petition. The Court issued notice to Haryana government and CPCB on DJB’s petition and posted it along with the suo moto proceeding on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-in-yamuna-under-supreme-court-scanner-for-a-second-time-101610560472152.html
13-01-2021||India||Supreme Court stays FIRs against Bengal BJP leader Kabir Bose||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed proceedings in two criminal cases lodged against West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Kabir Shankar Bose after the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) told the top court in a sealed cover report that Bose, a CISF protectee, was not present at the incident spot on December 6 last year, where he had allegedly beaten and molested workers of the Trinamool Congress.The protection offered to Bose, comes almost a month after the top court had extended protective cover to senior BJP leaders Arjun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and two others by ordering no coercive action to be taken in any of the criminal cases lodged against them in the state of West Bengal.Appearing for Bose, senior advocateMahesh Jet hmalani had maintained that the criminal cases were based on false charges leveled against Bose at the behest of his father-in-law Kalyan Banerjee, a senior leader and Member of Parliament belonging to the Trinamool Congress. It was at Jethmalani’s insistence that the court had sought the Special Incident Report prepared by CISF’s Special Security Group that protects his client.On Wednesday, the bench of Justices SK Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy went through the contents of the CISF report submitted in the sealed cover. The bench then issued a notice on Bose’s petition to the West Bengal government and state police. In the meantime, it added, “Proceedings in pursuance to FIR bearing Nos. 400 of 2020 under Sections 341/323/325/326/307/354/504/506/34 IPC and 401 of 2020 under Sections 341/325/354A/34 IPC both dated December 7, 2020 registered with Serampore police station shall remain stayed.”In his petition, Bose stated that TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee was seeking his arrest after he filed for annulment of marriage with Banerjee’s daughter in 2015 and joined BJP. On December 6, Bose’s car was attacked and he was unlawfully restrained from moving out of his house. The FIRs alleged that Bose had caused injuries to the Trinamool workers and allegedly molested a woman. Bose claimed that he was not present in the area where the incident was said to have occurred. The Court was convinced on this count after it saw the “movement register” produced by CISF which maintains log of all protectees.On December 18 last year, the bench issued a notice on Bose’s petition and directed the CISF’s Special Security Group to submit the Special Incident Report in a sealed cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-firs-against-bengal-bjp-leader-kabir-bose-101610559835374.html

Through the meeting, states were advised to efficiently manage the spread of Avian Influenza in their respective states in accordance with the Action Plan 2021," the release further said.To deal with the situation the states were asked to coordinate with the department of health and forest and sensitize them about the issue, the ministry said.States were also asked to maintain a sufficient supply of protective equipment and maintain biosecurity measures in poultry farms. The ministry said States were also directed to identify BSL-II labs at the state level for speeding up the identification of infection in the state and timely introduction of control mechanism.The states were also asked to ensure that the infection does not spread among poultry, as it would have a high economic cost for the poultry farmers."It was found that many states are banning the supply of poultry and poultry products from other states. As this would add to the negative impact on the poultry industry, the states were requested to reconsider such a decision. Awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements, seminar etc are being conducted by several states," the release said.The states were encouraged to continue such awareness generation activities with support from their state Directorate of Information and Public Relations and were assured about the availability of funds for such activities.The release said that states should issue advisories on Dos and Don'ts regarding consumption of poultry and eggs, so as to avoid spreading of rumours/ misinformation thereby leading to economic loss for the poultry farmers.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said poultry farms, zoos, water bodies will have to be constantly monitored to contain the disease. He had also asked all states to remain on alert to control the spread of the disease."Bird flu has been confirmed in Kerala, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, UP, MP, Delhi and Maharashtra. Poultry farms, zoos, water bodies have to be constantly monitored to control the spread of bird flu," said PM Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-centre-asks-states-not-to-ban-supply-of-poultry-from-other-states-101610558746006.html

Assembly elections in the state are due in April – May 2021.“The ECI has directed all districts to strictly maintain law and order to ensure free and fair elections. The poll panel has made it clear that strict action would be taken against anyone in case of negligence in duty,” said a senior police officer present at the meeting.The opposition has been frequently raising allegations of deterioration of law and order in the state citing multiple incidents of political violence. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress had, however, refuted such allegations.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar too had in the past voiced his concern over the alleged law and order deterioration in the state in several tweets and during his interaction with the media.“The two main issues which were discussed in Wednesday’s meetings were law and order and summary revision of electoral rolls,” said a senior state government official.The Bharatiya Janata Party has already urged the Commission to enforce the Model Code of Conduct at the earliest and deploy central forces well in advance to avert any violence during the campaign period and ensure free and fair elections.“The ECI is aware of the state’s scenario. We have also raised some issues before the ECI. The poll panel will now have to look into them. We have requested that the Model Code of Conduct be enforced at the earliest and that central forces should be deployed so that opposition parties can campaign freely and without any fear,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of BJP’s Bengal unit.The TMC, however, hit back saying that MCC and central forces can come in only after elections are declared.“It seems that Dilip Ghosh doesn’t know anything about the Constitution. The MCC cannot be enforced before the polls are announced. Law-and-order is a state matter. Unless the state wants or elections are announced, central forces can’t be deployed,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.This is Jain's second visit to the state. Earlier he had come to the state in December to take stock of the poll preparedness and even had a meeting with the state's top health officials as polls would be held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Jain is likely to hold a meeting with some of the state's top bureaucrats on Thursday too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eci-warns-bengal-govt-staff-of-action-for-negligence-of-duty-ahead-of-polls-101610558108380.html
13-01-2021||India||India wants Pfizer to do local study before approval: Official||Any vaccine maker, including Pfizer Inc that has sought emergency-use authorisation for its Covid-19 shot in India, must conduct an additional local study to be considered for the country's immunisation programme, a senior government official told Reuters.Serum Institute of India, the local manufacturer of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, did a months long local study on more than 1,500 people before seeking and receiving emergency approval on Jan. 3.India, which has reached 10.5 million coronavirus infections - the second highest in the world after the United States - has also approved a homegrown vaccine made by Bharat Biotech ahead of its inoculation campaign which starts on Saturday.Local media have reported that Pfizer had sought to import and distribute its vaccine in India without doing local trials. In early December, it was the first company to seek emergency-use approval in the world's second-most populous country but has not attended subsequent meetings called by Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, according to minutes https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/Committees/SEC of the deliberations released on the drugs regulator's website."As of now, the pre-condition for any vaccine to be implemented is that you have to do a bridging trial," Vinod K. Paul, who heads a government panel on vaccine strategy, said in an interview in his office near the parliament building.The government has already distributed 16.5 million doses of the two approved vaccines to states, with a plan to deliver 600 million jabs to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months. Serum Institute has stockpiled 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and says it will raise its monthly output to much more than that now the approval has come.Health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens whose genetic makeup can be different from people in western nations. There are, however, provisions under New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, to waive such trials in certain conditions.A Pfizer spokeswomen had no immediate comment.The Pfizer vaccine, developed in partnership with Germany's BioNTech SE, is already being administered to people in countries such as the United States and Britain. It was not immediately clear if any other countries had asked for similar smaller local trials before approving vaccines developed and tested abroad.Paul said officials have had discussions with Pfizer and Moderna Inc - both U.S. companies have reported more than 90% efficacy for their vaccines - to make the shots in India given its large pharmaceutical capacity. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker.Paul, a paediatrician who had taught at the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences, also said Russia's Sputnik V, which is now undergoing last-stage trials after completing a Phase 2 study there, will soon apply for emergency-use approval in the country.No vaccine maker will be given indemnity by the government should something go wrong, Paul said. Serum Institute had written to the government seeking indemnity. AstraZeneca has said it has received such indemnity in many other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-pfizer-to-do-local-study-before-approval-official-101610556790549.html

Seventeen others who had fallen ill after drinking the illicit alcohol at a party Monday night are still in hospitals in Morena and Gwalior.The high death toll led to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announcing on Wednesday the transfers of collector Anurag Verma and superintendent of police (SP) Anurag Sujania from the district and suspension of a deputy superintendent of police Sujeet Singh Bhadoria. He also ordered constitution of a high-level three-member probe team headed by additional chief secretary (Home) Rajesh Rajora, according to an official statement.Two members of the probe team - additional director general of police (CID) A Sai Manohar and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police (training) Mithilesh Shukla - will visit the district.Earlier on Tuesday, a police station in charge and the district excise officer were suspended shortly after the tragedy began to unfold.The victims of the hooch tragedy are from five villages- Chhaira-Manpura, Pahawali, Bilaiyapura, Chheechhawali and Meerpur, all villages in the vicinity of small town Chhaira in the district.Police have booked seven men but no one has been arrested yet.“An FIR against seven accused has been lodged for sale of spurious liquor. Two of them are among those hospitalised. They will be arrested as soon as they are discharged from the hospital. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the others, inspector general (IG) of police, Morena zone, Manoj Sharma said,Morena’s chief medical and health officer, Dr RC Bandil said, "Initial autopsy reports suggest the deaths caused by excessive consumption of liquor that caused damage to vital body parts of the victims like liver etc. The FSL report may reveal if there was some poison in the liquor.”A police officer who did not wish to be named, said the preliminary investigation found that the accused used chemicals to make spurious liquor and sell it to people in villages at low price. Police seized a large number of liquor bottles from an agriculture farm where the accused used to make the hooch.Villagers of Chhaira-Manpur and some other villages staged a blockade at Morena by placing bodies of three of the victims on the road while accusing the local police of patronising liquor and gambling gangs in the region. The agitation was withdrawn on assurances by authorities that all the culprits responsible for the tragedy will be brought to book.Satyendra whose brother Jitendra, 32, lost his life in the tragedy said, “The police’s inefficiency claimed my brother’s life. He is survived by four children including three daughters. Who will take care of them?”Ex-sarpanch of Chhaira-Manpura village Rajesh Yadav said, “Police are hand in glove with illicit liquor racket and gambling gangs in the area. We complained several times against these gangs' activities on even the CM helpline but nothing happened.”Earlier in the morning, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “A campaign will be launched across the state against illicit liquor and stringent action will be taken against government officials and employees responsible for such incidents, to check recurrence of such incidents.”The Opposition Congress continued to attack the BJP government in general and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in particular for the hooch tragedy.Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The BJP government and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan have miserably failed in maintaining law and order situation in the state. The home minister Narottam Mishra is busy in BJP affairs in West Bengal. That spurious liquor claimed more than 20 lives in Morena within just 3 months of Ujjain hooch tragedy which had claimed more than 14 lives over there speaks volumes for the functioning of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-toll-in-morena-hooch-tragedy-rises-to-21-dc-sp-shunted-out-101610557620125.html

Fire department officials could not confirm the cause of the fire but suspected that it could have been after laptop was left for charging overnight.The incident happened at Leela Homes high rise apartments in the house of paediatrician Dr. Puneet Kalra who said he had gone to sleep at around 4.30am and left the laptop to charge.“Around 7.30 am, my wife woke me up saying that there was a fire in our flat. We tried to go to the drawing room but there was fire and thick smoke. Unable to move out, we took our seven-year-old daughter to the balcony from where we started shouting for help,” said Dr Kalra. “Then we heard a blast, which could have been the air conditioner.”“Our neighbours in the opposite flat came to our aid,” he said. “They got a ladder and put it across our balconies. Our daughter, then my wife and finally I crawled over.”The fire department officials said that they got a call around 7am and deployed three fire tenders and about a dozen firemen from nearby Vaishali fire station. By the time they reached there though, the family had been rescued.“One of our teams went up the stairs to reach the flat with water pipes. Another team tried to douse the flame from outside,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. “It is likely that the fire started as the laptop was left on charging mode on a sofa and the heat or a spark caused the fire.”A few residents caught the blaze on their phone cameras that later made it to social media.“We estimate that we lost goods worth ₹3-4 lakh” said Dr Kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laptop-on-charging-mode-sparks-fire-at-6th-floor-flat-3-family-members-rescued-101610553013781.html

13-01-2021||India||Vaccine drive accelerates, doses reach far corners of India||India’s drive against Covid-19 gathered momentum on Wednesday with planes carrying vaccines flying into airports across the country from where the precious cargo was dispatched to small cities and towns in readiness for the inoculation exercise beginning January 16.From Assam to Goa and from Jammu and Kashmir to Kerala, the vaccines were carefully and swiftly transported to far corners of the country, a day after the first consignment of the Covishield vaccine from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable rolled out of the Serum Institute of India manufacturing facility in Pune.According to sources, 95 per cent of the 1.1 crore doses of Covishield vaccine purchased by the government have been delivered and shipped to nearly 60 consignee points across India in two days.Of the 55 lakh doses of indigenously developed Covaxin of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech ordered by the Centre, the first tranche of 2.4 lakh doses have been dispatched to 12 states.Covaxin has been sent to 12 sites, one each in Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai, Lucknow and Hyderabad, according to official sources.The vaccines have been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database, the Health Ministry said.The Mumbai airport authorities said it has facilitated the delivery of about 2,72,400 doses of the Covishield vaccine to 22 domestic destinations on Wednesday, starting with low-cost carrier GoAir's first flight to Goa with 23,500 doses of Covishield vaccine.These shipments were carried out by SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir and Vistara to Bagdogra, Rajkot, Ranchi, Imphal, Agartala, Cochin, Bhopal, Kanpur, Jammu, Srinagar, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Raipur, Dehradun, Varanasi, Indore, Trivandrum and Jabalpur, it said.On Tuesday, consignments were sent from Pune to 13 cities including Delhi.As the vials began reaching their destinations, in readiness for the pan-India vaccination drive that will be launched on Saturday, states firmed up their plans and fine-tuned logistical details.In Delhi, where the drive will begin in 89 centres, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said his AAP government will provide the vaccine free if the Centre fails to do so.He said he has already appealed to the Centre as there are many people in the country who can’t afford the life-saving jab.In accordance with the national priority list, the vaccine will be first given to healthcare and frontline workersWhile Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand and Union territories of Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir were among those to receive the first consignment of the vaccines on Wednesday, others like Maharashtra and West Bengal started their transportation to various districts.A special vehicle carrying Covid-19 vaccines was held up and had to take a five-kilometer detour in West Bengal's Purba Bardhaman district after the national highway was blocked by protesters led by state minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury who were agitating against the new farm laws, sources said.The van, piloted by the West Bengal Police, was on its way to Bankura and Purulia to deliver the vaccines when it was stranded despite a 'green corridor' being arranged for its swift movement, they said.Chowdhury, who is the state library services minister, said he was not aware of the movement of the vaccine van and cleared the road once it was brought to his notice, but by that time the vehicle had been already diverted.The first consignment of about 94,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine reached the Madhya Pradesh capital on a scheduled flight from Mumbai, a state government official said.From the airport, insulated vans of the health department transported the boxes -- that signal India entering a decisive phase in its fight against the pandemic -- to the State Vaccine Centre where Medical Education Minister Visvas Sarang inspected the arrangements. The doses will be dispatched to eight districts from Bhopal.Kerala, too, received its first Covishield vaccine consignment on Wednesday morning on a Go Air flight that landed at Kochi. Another flight was expected to land in Thiruvananthapuram later in the day.Sources in the National Health Mission sources said of the 4.33 lakh doses of the vaccine, 1,100 will be sent to Mahe, an enclave of Puducherry.The vaccine will be stored in the regional vaccine centres at Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode from where it will be distributed to 133 centres.So far, 3,62,870 people have registered themselves for a shot.Giving details of the vaccination plans for Maharashtra, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the state had already received 9.83 lakh doses of the total requirement of 17.5 lakh for the first phase.Of these, 9.63 vials were from SII and 20,000 from Bharat Biotech, the state minister told reporters."We have to give the doses twice to a person in a gap of four weeks, hence 55 percent of the around eight lakh registered health workers will undergo vaccination as of now," he said.The Centre, he said, has asked the state to reduce the number of inoculation centres from 511 to 350, saying the government should focus on other emergencies as well.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries per day and the Union Health ministry said it has advised the states not to organise "unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day"."States have been advised to organise vaccination sessions taking into account 10 percent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session each day."Therefore, any undue haste on the part of states to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised," the Union Ministry said.It also said that states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward.The country's financial capital, Mumbai, which will have 72 centres, received over 1.39 lakh Covishield vaccine doses, said civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.Health department staffers of the BMC brought the vaccines from neighbouring Pune under police security, it said. The civic body has created a centralised cold storage facility for vaccines in Kanjurmarg.The towns of Aurangabad and Thane in the state got their share of the first doses too.Goa Health Services Director Jose D'Sa told PTI that two boxes comprising 23,500 doses of the Covishield vaccine were received in the morning.Around 18,000 health workers in the coastal state will be covered during the initial phase, another health official said.The northeast state of Assam received its second consignment of Covid-19 vaccines when a cargo flight of a private airline carried 12,000 doses of Covaxin weighing around 78.5 kg, from Hyderabad to Guwahati."The consignment was shipped by Bharat Biotech and handed over to state government officials within six minutes of its arrival," said an Airports Authority of India spokesperson.The first batch of 2.40 lakh vials of Covid-19 vaccine for Assam and Meghalaya had landed on Tuesday.Guwahati’s LGBI Airport has been marked as the nodal point of distribution of vaccines for the northeast.Assam and Tripura welcomed their first lot of Covishield doses."The vaccine containers were transported to a National Health Mission (NHM) storage facility at Gorkhabasti area," State Immunization Officer Kallol Roy told reporters in Agartala.SpiceJet said it had transported 3.5 tonnes of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad to 11 cities.GoAir said it was airlifting a total of 69,600 vials of the vaccine.The Mumbai airport said that the standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented by it in anticipation of the vaccine distribution saw the terminal register a cargo processing time of just seven minutes, right from goods acceptance to dispatch at the ramp, it added.Besides, the airport has deployed a dedicated Covid-19 task force to reduce dwell time and facilitate advanced planning and collaboration between the airport and all stakeholders in this process, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-accelerates-doses-reach-far-corners-of-india-101610554448440.html

13-01-2021||India||Odisha BJP MP's free food scheme for needy in Bhubaneswar irks civic body||Ahead of the upcoming civic polls in Odisha, the fight between BJP and BJD seems to have intensified with BJP's Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi getting into a conflict with the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation over its diktat that no one would be allowed to give food and clothes free of cost to the poor and homeless people in the state capital.Sarangi, a former IAS officer of Odisha cadre who won from the prestigious Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha constituency had started an organisation called Annapurna Trust for feeding poor people in the city free-of-cost. The project was started a month ago on a trial run basis in Bhubaneswar for providing cooked meals to 200 poor and hungry people, but an announcement was made to scale up.“Annapurna will provide hot meals everyday to needy people residing in Bhubaneswar during lunchtime. Five organisations have joined hands for this initiative. Every day, volunteers on two vehicles will distribute food to 750 people listed in the 1st phase,” said Sarangi who is the chief advisor of the Trust.Clearly aimed at slum dwellers, who form the bulk of Bhubaneswar's electorate, Sarangi's lunch on wheels for the poor has not pleased officials in the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.“Poor people living on the roadside in the city hesitate to shift to the shelter homes being managed by the BMC due to free distribution of food and clothes by some organisations. It leads to failure in making the state capital a beggar-free city. Individuals and organisations may distribute free food and clothes to destitute people at shelter homes managed by the BMC after taking permission from it. In violation of the order, legal action will be taken against the individuals/organisations,” said BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury.After the BMC’s objection to giving free food, the MP said the order does not affect her plans as the trust would charge Re 1 for each meal. “Annapurna is not free. We are charging one rupee. It does not come under the BMC order purview,” said Sarangi.Political analysts said Sarangi may have taken a leaf out of BJD's book on wooing the slum dwellers. “In April 2015, BJD had started the Aahar meal scheme in which 5 lakh people were getting lunch at ₹5 everyday at 110 centres. It helped the BJD in 2019 polls. So it's quite natural for Sarangi to adopt the same populist technique as no political party in Odisha can survive without such measures. But I hope as Bhubaneswar MP she brings structural changes to the lives of slum dwellers,” said Gyana Ranjan Swain, professor of political science in Ravenshaw University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-mp-s-free-food-scheme-for-needy-in-bhubaneswar-irks-civic-body-101610553741390.html

A dense fog blanketed some parts of the city, lowering visibility to 50 metres and affecting traffic movement.The IMD said the lowest minimum temperature of 0.2 degrees Celsius was reported at Ganganagar (West Rajasthan) over the plains of the country.Due to the prevalence of dry north/northwesterly winds, minimum temperatures are very likely to remain below normal over most parts of Northwest India during next 3-4 days, the IMD said"Hence, Cold Day/Severe Cold Day conditions very likely to continue in many pockets over Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during next 3 days," it said.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are also likely in many pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and Uttar Pradesh; in some pockets East Rajasthan and in isolated pockets over West Rajasthan during next 3-4 days, the IMD said.Meanwhile, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall and moderate thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over south Tamil Nadu, south Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next 24 hours, the IMD said in its 8 pm bulletin.It said extremely heavy rainfall was observed at isolated places over Tamil Nadu on Wednesday."Today, cold day conditions at a few places with Severe Cold Day conditions at isolated places (were) observed over Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and East Uttar Pradesh; Cold Day to Severe Cold Day conditions at isolated places over West Uttar Pradesh and Cold Day conditions in isolated places over Punjab," the IMD said.Himachal Pradesh's Keylong and Kalpa shivered at subzero temperatures, while state capital Shimla registered a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius, the meteorological department said.Lahaul and Spiti's administrative centre Keylong continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 11.4 degrees Celsius, Shimla MeT centre director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius, he added.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places as Churk recorded the lowest temperature of 3.2 degrees Celsius.Dense to very dense fog occurred at isolated places over the state.Intense cold conditions prevailed in parts of Rajasthan too, where Ganganagar was recorded as the coldest place at 0.2 degree Celsius.The Kashmir Valley reeled under severe cold too, with Srinagar city -- the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir -- recording its lowest minimum temperature in eight years, the Meteorological Department said here on Wednesday.Srinagar recorded a low of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius, which was the lowest temperature recorded in the city in eight years, an official of the MET department said.He said the exact same minimum temperature was recorded in the city in 2012 on January 14.The rest of the Valley was also reeling under intense cold.Biting cold conditions prevailed in most parts of Punjab and Haryana also with Narnaul being the coldest place in both the states at 1.4 degrees Celsius.Narnaul in Haryana recorded a low of three notches below the normal. Hisar was the another place where the mercury settled below the 2 degrees Celsius-mark. It registered a minimum temperature of 1.7 degrees Celsius, five notches below the normal.Among other places in the state, Ambala, Karnal and Rohtak experienced cold conditions at 7.8, 6.5 and 5 degrees Celsius, respectively, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said here.Bhiwani and Sirsa reeled under cold conditions at 2.8 and 3.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.Chandigarh, the joint capital of both states, recorded a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-shivers-as-srinagar-records-lowest-temp-in-8-years-no-relief-soon-101610553758113.html
13-01-2021||India||Publication of notice for interfaith marriage optional, rules Allahabad HC||In an order likely to bring relief to interfaith couples, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has ruled that the publication of a notice of intended marriage under the Special Marriage Act and inviting objections is not mandatory.Justice Vivek Chaudhary passed the judgment on Tuesday 2 on a habeas corpus petition filed by an interfaith couple intending to marry.The order was uploaded on the high court’s website on Wednesday.“This court mandates that while giving notice under Section 5 of the (Special Marriage) Act of 1954 it shall be optional for the parties to the intended marriage to make a request in writing to the marriage officer to publish or not to publish a notice under Section 6 and follow the procedure of objections as prescribed under the Act of 1954,” the court observed.“In case they do not make such a request for publication of notice in writing, while giving notice under Section 5 of the Act, the marriage officer shall not publish any such notice or entertain objections to the intended marriage and proceed with the solemnization of the marriage,” the court added.“It goes without saying that it shall be open for the marriage officer, while solemnizing any marriage under the Act of 1954, to verify the identification, age and valid consent of the parties or otherwise their competence to marry under the said Act. In case he has any doubt, it shall be open for him to ask for appropriate details/proof as per the facts of the case,” the court ruled.“Since the matter relates to protection of fundamental rights of large number of persons, the Senior Registrar of this court shall ensure that a copy of this order is communicated to the Chief Secretary of the State of Uttar Pradesh who shall forthwith communicate the same to all the marriage officers of the state and other authorities concerned as expeditiously as possible,” ordered the court.The court also observed that the matter could have come to an end at this stage, but for the views expressed by the young couple while interacting with the court on their personal appearance.“The young couple expressed that they could have solemnized their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 but the said Act requires a 30-day notice to be published and objections to be invited from the public at large,” the court said.“They expressed that any such notice would be an invasion in their privacy and would have definitely caused unnecessary social pressure/interference in their free choice with regard to their marriage,” the court added.“They further stated that such a challenge was being faced by a large number of similarly situated persons who desire to build a life with a partner of their own choice,” the court said.It may be mentioned that after the Adityanath government promulgated the ordinance enforcing the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, the marriage officer is bound to publish the notice for a period of 30 days and invite objections. Any person can object to the marriage.Since the ordinance was passed, several Muslim men have been arrested under controversial circumstances and accused if trying to forcibly convert Hindu women for marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/publication-of-notice-for-interfaith-marriage-optional-rules-allahabad-hc-101610551094375.html
13-01-2021||India||Talks must continue: MoS Rupala on Jan 15 scheduled meeting with farmer groups||The government is in favour of continuing talks with protesting farmer groups as it believes a solution can be found only through dialogue, Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala said on Wednesday.While eight rounds of negotiations so far between the government and a representative-group of thousands of farmers protesting against three farm laws have failed to resolve the crisis, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three Acts till further orders and set up a four-member committee to end the impasse.However, the protesting farmer unions have said they will not appear before the committee as they consider it to be "pro-government". They have, however, shown willingness to attend the scheduled ninth round of talks on January 15 with the government, though they have asserted they would not settle for anything less than a complete repeal of the laws."Talks must continue. It is only through dialogue, a way forward can be found," Rupala told PTI.He was responding to a query whether the government talks with protesting farmers' leaders on January 15 will be held as scheduled in the wake of the Supreme Court setting up of a committee to resolve the crisis.On Tuesday, Kailash Choudhary, who is also Minister of State for Agriculture, had said the government was willing to go ahead with the meeting and it was for the farmer groups to decide what they want.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at several border points of Delhi since November 26 last year, demanding a repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) procurement system for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-must-continue-mos-rupala-on-jan-15-scheduled-meeting-with-farmer-groups-101610553147765.html

13-01-2021||India||For TMC and BJP, swing in Left, Congress votes can be crucial in Bengal polls||For the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal contenders in the upcoming West Bengal assembly election, change in vote share of the Left and Congress may play a crucial role although the latter has weakened significantly in the districts since the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.The Congress and the Left Front partners, headed by the CPI (M), contested as allies in the 2016 assembly polls but could not stop the TMC from retaining power with 211 out of the state’s 294 seats. Since the Congress benefited more from the alliance and wrested 44 seats against the Left’s 32, the tie-up did not last.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left contested as opponents but it was the BJP that turned heads by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats, thanks to a huge swing in Left votes towards the saffron camp.This time around, the bigger stakeholders in Bengal politics feel that the smaller parties, especially the CPI(M), cannot be taken lightly because assembly polls are fought on local issues and Muslim voters and farmers will play a decisive role.In some of her recent rallies, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee took a seemingly softer stance towards the CPI (M) while her follower-turned electoral foe Suvendu Adhikari has openly appealed to Left and Congress workers to help the BJP oust the ruling party. “I appeal to our friends in Left Front and Congress to attend rallies of their parties but vote for us in the interest of Bengal,” Adhikari said at a rally in West Burdwan district on Tuesday.Analysis of the 2019 poll results showed that the biggest contributor to the BJP’s stunning performance were voters who were d loyal to the CPI(M) and its partners for more than three decades. Out of 40 Left candidates in the race, 39 lost their election deposit as they failed to secure one sixth of the votes cast in their respective seats.The phenomenon was seen even in East Midnapore district, Suvendu Adhikari’s home turf, where the TMC won. His father, two-time TMC MP Sisir Adhikari, got 50% votes in the Kanthi seat but the BJP secured 42% while CPI(M) ended third with 5.3 %. In 2014 and 2009, Adhikari won the seat but the CPI (M) came second with 34.72 % and 42.5 % respectively. It was apparent that the bulk of the votes for the CPI (M) in the past went to BJP’s kitty last year.In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when the TMC was not in power in Bengal, the Left Front secured 43.3% votes but won only 15 seats. In comparison, 19 seats went to the TMC although Mamata Banerjee had a lower vote share of 31.18%. In that election, the BJP got only 6.14% votes and one seat in Bengal.The BJP has dramatically improved its position since then, winning two Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and 18 seats in 2019. Seen in terms of assembly segments, the BJP is already ahead of the others in 122 assembly seats in 2021 while the TMC is ahead in 163.In terms of vote share in the 2019 polls, the TMC got 43.69 % in 2019 against 40.64 % secured by the BJP. The CPI (M)’s vote share came down to 6.34 % while the Congress got only 5.67%.“Neither the Left nor the Congress ever supported the BJP. These parties should either secure their own votes or support us,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy.“TMC and BJP leaders are daydreaming. The Left-Congress alternative is the answer to the TMC’s misrule in Bengal and the BJP’s policies at the Centre. People will give these parties a befitting reply,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI (M) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the assembly.According to the 2011 census, Bengal’s population stood at 91.3 million. It is projected to reach 101.9 million in 2021 and around 30 % comprise Muslims. The census showed that around 68.13% of the population lives in villages of rural areas where the literacy rate was 72.13% in 2011.Veteran political commentator and columnist Suvashis Maitra said if the CPI (M) regains even one vote then it will be at the cost of the BJP.“The TMC cannot possibly lose more than what it has already lost. Rather, it may win some additional Muslim votes. If the CPI (M) makes some gains then it will be because of the extensive relief work it carried out after cyclone Amphan and the community kitchens has been running across Bengal since the pandemic began. A section of Left voters who shifted allegiance to the BJP in 2019 may vote for the Marxists again,” said Maitra.“Election is a game of possibilities and our party is ready to take on the challenge. But one must bear in mind that the CPI (M) has nothing to offer to its supporters because it simply cannot come to power,” a BJP vice-president said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-tmc-and-bjp-swing-in-left-congress-votes-can-be-crucial-in-bengal-polls-101610546644561.html
13-01-2021||India||Shouldn’t be iota of apprehension about Covaxin's safety: ICMR scientist||As critics continue to raise doubts about the reliability of an indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine which is still in the third phase of trial, a top Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist on Wednesday said that Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech) is safe and there should not be an iota of apprehension about its safety. He called for people to dispel the myths and misconceptions around Covid-19 vaccines.“The vaccine that India has developed (Covaxin) presents to the immune system a wide array of antigens, so the immunity which will be produced after vaccination is expected to address the mutants as well,” Dr Samiran Panda, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Speaking about the speed at which the vaccines have been developed, Dr Panda said, “In older days, it would take 20-30 years to get a vaccine or medicine out in the market. Given the knowledge about the whole genome of the virus, the vaccine (Coviaxin) has come out within 10-12 months, which underlines the superiority, ability and commitment of Indian scientists."His remarks come in the backdrop of the health ministry saying the recipients will not get to choose which vaccine they want to be administered to them. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said that there will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and its effectiveness can be seen only after 14 days.Earlier in the day, Congress MP Manish Tewari said that the government should not roll out Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based pharma firm Bharat Biotech, till its efficacy and reliability is completely established and phase 3 trials are over.The ICMR scientist told ANI that the Indian program has taken a smart vaccination approach, rather than mass vaccination approach. “Herd immunity produced by vaccination is a good idea but when the virus mutates, immunity might not be working against it even if it is a drift,” he said.India’s vaccination drive is set to begin on January 16, for which a total of 11 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine produced at Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, have been delivered across the country, according to Serum officials. Bharat Biotech has also shipped its vaccine Covaxin to several cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shouldnt-be-iota-of-apprehension-about-covaxin-s-safety-icmr-scientist-101610544740365.html

The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost ₹971 crore.The new building will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of ₹83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.According to the plan, provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-work-of-new-parliament-building-to-start-on-jan-15-say-sources-101610545157252.html

The government should understand the sentiments of the farmer, they added.Farmers in Sitarganj took out a tractor rally and burnt the copies of the farm laws. Several farmers said that they will continue the agitation from Sitarganj to Delhi till the Modi government gives up.Virk said Lohri is a festival of fun and frolic but this year farmers are disappointed due to the new farm laws.

LCA-Tejas incorporates a large number of new technologies many of which were never attempted in India. The indigenous content of LCA-Tejas is 50% in Mk1A variant which will be enhanced to 60%,” Singh said in a statement posted on his Twitter timeline.Last March, the defence ministry gave a green light to the purchase of 83 advanced Tejas jets from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

A forensic team also collected evidence from the scene of the crime as well as the SUV in which Singh was shot.Police said the killers seemed to be professional hit men.The police have so far not been able to ascertain the identity of the killers or who hired them.A senior police official said that the reasons behind the killing are still not clear but it could involve airport related tenders and personal dispute. A police team has been sent to Singh's Jalalpur residence in Chhapra district, about 100 km north of Patna, as part of the probe.Another police team collected details, information about Singh and recorded the statements of his colleagues and other employees at the Patna airport. Police suspect that someone hired an assassin to eliminate Singh.Police have scanned nearby CCTV footage from cameras on apartments, shops and examined the victim’s call data records.The incident triggered panic among citizens and over 2,000 policemen were deployed to maintain law and order in the area. The spot where the murders took place is located near a high-security zone that includes chief minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence, the Bihar police headquarters and state secretariat.Singh was gunned down in front of his apartment on Shankar Path at Punaichak area at around 7.15 pm on Tuesday. Singh had returned from duty on his new SUV and was waiting for the guard to open the main gate when two motorcycle borne assailants pumped several bullets into his body and sped away.Police suspect the killers tailed Singh from the airport. The victim who was shot in the neck and chest died on the spot. Five CCTV cameras of the apartment were non-functional. A nearby CCTV captured a grainy image of the motorcyclist.Police found six empty cartridges from the spot and a mobile phone from Singh’s car.Another police official said they have received some clues about the criminals but are yet to identify the culprits.Villagers of Jalalpur had threatened to block the national highway and hold protests if the police failed to arrest the accused within seven days. Singh’s father retired from Kolkata police while his elder brother runs a skill development centre in Jalalpur.Villagers said that Singh had political ambitions and wanted to fight the assembly election from the Marhaura seat on a BJP ticket. He was reportedly close to many BJP leaders including Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sushil Modi.“We are in utter shock after the incident. Police should arrest the criminals immediately and ensure that such incidents do not happen in future,” said agriculture minister, Amrendra Pratap Singh.Vivek Thakur, Rajya Sabha member, also expressed concern over the incident. “Police should intensify night patrolling in the city to avoid such incidents,” he added.Attacking the NDA government over the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar, Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav said, "The incident took place in the VIP area, which is considered the safest zone in Patna. Even with the CM's house nearby and all roads equipped with CCTV, such incidents are happening. The crime graph is soaring in the state since this government came to power.""The area where the chief minister lives is considered a VVIP zone and even when the CM reviews law and order five times within 45 days, criminals have the courage to shoot the IndiGo manager," said CPI leader and Paliganj MLA Sandeep Sourabh."This says it all about the current law and order situation in the state. People of the state are living in fear and criminals are having a free run," said Congress MLC Premchand Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-set-up-sit-to-nab-killers-of-indigo-s-patna-station-manager-101610538100927.html
13-01-2021||India||Delhi HC seeks timeline from Centre for finalising Draft Health Policy 2020||The Delhi high court has asked the Centre to give a timeline for finalising the Draft Health Policy 2020, which includes the guidelines for treatment of rare diseases. The court said that “Right to Health is a fundamental right and no child in our country should be deprived of treatment because of the drug being expensive”.Justice Pratibha M Singh noted that the Centre had not finalised the health policy on rare diseases despite the lapse of one and half years since an earlier direction of the court. She said that the Draft Health Policy 2020 has also “yet not seen light of the day” while the earlier one is kept in “abeyance”.Hearing two pleas seeking treatment of children suffering from rare genetic disease known as Duchene Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) which was beyond the capacity of the parents because of the high cost of drugs and cure, the single judge bench remarked that “such a policy cannot be left indefinitely when young human lives are on stake” .DMD is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys where muscle starts weakening at a young age. During the hearing, the Central government standing counsel, appearing for the ministry of health, told the court that they would not be able to bear the entire cost of the treatment but it would be made possible through donations by private parties and others. The Centre had told the court in an affidavit that the Draft policy has been released and it is still in consultation.The matter would be now heard on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-timeline-from-centre-for-finalising-draft-health-policy-2020-101610538502844.html
13-01-2021||India||Information under RTI, if sought for vested interests, cannot be provided: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that whenever information is sought under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, especially by disgruntled persons in the garb of transparency, the authorities have to see whether the details asked are for some personal or vested interest.Justice Pratibha M Singh made the observation while dismissing a plea by a man who had sought details of the persons who had been appointed at the President’s secretariat as multi-tasking staff.The judge said that the petitioner had “cleverly” concealed the information from the court that he had filed the plea because his daughter had been unsuccessful in this selection process.Also Read: Delhi govt allows schools to reopen for classes 10, 12 from January 18The court also imposed a cost of Rs25,000 on the petitioner for hiding the facts, while also noting that providing him with details of the persons who have been appointed will be a complete evasion of their privacy.Advocate Anurag Alhuwalia, the Central government’s standing counsel, told the court that while five of the six details sought were provided to the man, the last one, with respect to the phone numbers, name and address of the residence of the successful candidates was not given, because that would infringe upon their privacy.During the hearing, the court repeatedly sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel as to what was the motive for seeking such information. The court was finally informed that the petitioner’s daughter had also appeared for the recruitment process and was unsuccessful in her attempt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/information-under-rti-if-sought-for-vested-interests-cannot-be-provided-delhi-hc-101610538082885.html

It didn’t give further details.Doval, who is on a two-day visit, also met President Ashraf Ghani at the presidential palace in Kabul and “discussed cooperation in countering terrorism and strengthening a regional consensus on the Afghan peace process”, Afghan chargé d’affaires Tahir Qadiry said on Twitter.The visit comes at a time when the troubled Afghan peace process between the government and the Taliban is very delicately poised, especially in the wake of a sharp surge in violent attacks blamed on the militant group.A growing number of civilians in influential positions and human rights activists have been assassinated across Afghanistan in recent weeks, and Kabul and other major cities have been witnessing almost daily bomb attacks. Countries in the region are closely watching the situation to see if the incoming Biden administration in the US makes any major changes in the approach to Afghanistan.There was no official word from the Indian side on Doval’s visit.India has consistently backed an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process and said that the gains made in the war-torn country in the past two decades must be preserved. New Delhi has also said any solution in Kabul must ensure that Afghan territory isn’t used for terrorism directed against India.The Afghan NSA met US chargé d’affaires Ross Wilson on Tuesday and discussed the ongoing peace efforts, reforms in the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and joint efforts related to the security situation.Mohib has also been travelling to countries in the region to shore up support for Afghanistan in the peace process. Last month, he travelled to Azerbaijan and Iran for talks on the regional security situation.While in Tehran, Mohib met his Iranian counterpart Ali Shamkhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif and held wide-ranging discussions about enhancing bilateral relations on security, trade, economic and transit issues. Mohib also told his Iranian interlocutors of the need to boost neighbourly relations and “combat common threats based on mutual confidence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-visits-afghanistan-for-talks-on-strategic-issues-101610537602831.html

13-01-2021||India||Heavy snowfall in Kashmir offers opportunities to revive trekking||Heavy snowfall may have disrupted normal life in Kashmir over the last few weeks, but it has offered opportunities for more advantageous trekking in the snow-clad Himalayas to many young women and men, who have over the last few years formed clubs to revive adventure sports in the Valley.Jalal Jeelani, a filmmaker, said they try to go trekking every season though it is most adventurous and challenging in the winter when they only go for day trips. “Snow trekking needs proper clothing and gear... every new trek comes with new challenges which give us new experiences,” said Jeelani.He said their group of doctors, engineers, and businessmen have trekked to several snowy high-altitude places. “Last month, we went to Bangus [Valley in Kupwara district located at an altitude of 10,000 feet]. It was first ever snow trekking by civilians to Bangus with over six feet of the snow.”Also read | Jammu & Kashmir bans poultry import amid bird flu outbreakTariq Mughloo, who is a part of the Varmul Trekking Club, said they have organised three trekking trips this winter. “Our club is four-year-old and we used to go trekking only in summer or autumn. This time, we also started winter trekking. It has a different experience, especially when you walk on the snow.”Mughloo said trekking in winter cannot be done with proper gear and that they want younger people to trek and enjoy nature.Mohammad Aslam, a tourist guide in the resort town of Gulmarg, said the mercury may have plunged to minus 10 degrees Celsius but that has not deterred younger people from going trekking.Tanvir Khan, the president of Pathfinders Hiking and Trekking club, said before trekking they do their research about the places or mountains they have to trek to and whether there is any danger of avalanches or any other difficulty. “Once we are satisfied, then we begin our journey and always take help from the local guides because all tracks are under snow. There is low visibility at some places--not more than 10 metres,” said Khan, who began snow trekking four years back.He said there are around 10 to 11 members in their group including one woman. “After our journey, we upload short videos on our Facebook page... to create awareness about these places, especially among our young generation, who spend most of their leisure time sitting at home watching television or mobiles.” He said their videos and pictures have inspired many to join them for trekking.Kashmir has received six spells of snow since November. Last week, it experienced the season’s heaviest--up to five feet--snow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-snowfall-in-kashmir-offers-opportunities-to-revive-trekking-101610534723211.html

Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to follow the Standards laid down in Indian Pharmacopoeia," the tribunal was informed.The tribunal said that in view of the revision of the Pharmacopeia, the adverse health effect of plastic packaging has been regulated to an extent."The matter being required to be primarily dealt with by the concerned Executive authorities, we do not consider it necessary to pass any further order in exercise of jurisdiction under Sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010," the bench said.However, it is necessary to ensure that compliance of the norms is duly monitored at appropriate level of the Health Ministry to safeguard the health of the citizens, the tribunal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-directs-fssai-to-finalise-draft-packaging-regulations-within-3-months-101610533968261.html

13-01-2021||India||Mumbai second most congested city in the world after Moscow||Mumbai was the second most congested city in the world after Moscow in 2020 in terms of traffic, according to the latest report released by TomTom Traffic index which conducted a study in 416 cities across 57 countries.Two other Indian - Bengaluru and New Delhi - rank sixth and eighth respectively in the list of most congested cities.Mumbai’s position worsened from the fourth spot in 2019 and 2018. Bengaluru improved its position from fifth to sixth with 51 per cent of congestion compared to 71 per cent in 2019.According to TomTom data , drivers in Mumbai spend an average of 53 per cent extra travel time because of the traffic congestion. Other global cities that feature among the top 10 include Manila from The Philippines, Bogota from Colombia, Moscow and Novosibirsk from Russia, Kyiv in Ukraine, Lima from Peru, Istanbul from Turkey and Jakarta from Indonesia.The report, which analysed traffic data in 400 cities in 57countries around the world, said that although Mumbai’s ranking has worsened, the congestion decreased by 12 per cent. Parag Bedarkar, manager enterprise sales, TomTom said that the reason for decrease in congestion across the world and Mumbai could be due to the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 lockdown. Bedarkar said that analyzing Mumbai proved that congestion levels were down by 18 per cent in the morning peak hour and 17 per cent during the evening rush hour."Solutions offered by companies like work from home have helped in reduction of congestion even after the lockdown," added Bedarkar.Apart from helping commuters plan their travel TomTom provides real time traffic management data along with historical traffic congestion data which could help governments plan their infrastructure projects and initiate more public transport like increasing bus frequency, etc.Werner van Huyssteen, General Manager, India, TomTom, said: “Last year, we announced that both global and India congestion levels in 2019 had increased for the ninth consecutive Traffic Index.

He said reports of samples were coming every 48 hours.Earlier on Sunday, the government issued a circular declaring UP as a ‘controlled area’ in view of the outbreak of bird flu in states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It also put a complete ban on import of live birds to UP till January 24. “We will review the situation in the meantime and take an appropriate decision accordingly,” Kumar said.He also made it clear that there was no ban at all on sale and consumption of eggs and meat in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-scare-uttar-pradesh-bans-import-of-birds-poultry-till-january-24-101610531663123.html
13-01-2021||India||Secret tunnel on India-Pak border reveals PM Imran Khan’s real plans||Indian security forces on Wednesday discovered another tunnel built by Pakistani security officials to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, people familiar with the matter said. This is the second tunnel found by Indian security forces since November last.ALSO WATCH | ‘Must be no ifs and buts, no double standards in fight against terrorism: EAMThe Border Security Force has told the national security establishment that the underground tunnel, like the last one found in November, was a professionally-engineered effort to infiltrate terrorists trained in terror camps commissioned by the Pakistan army.The entry to the tunnel was spotted about 300 feet from the zero line; about 65 feet from the fence on the Indian side, a senior Border Security Force officer said. The 3-feet wide tunnel appears to have been constructed at a depth of 25 to 30 feet.But this time, the BSF did not stumble upon the tunnel. “Given the sophistication of the last tunnel that had been found, we had figured that the Pakistan army had started building cross-border terrorists to create a new infiltration route and had constituted special teams to look for them,” the BSF officer said.Counter-terror officials in New Delhi said the tunnel also explained instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistani Rangers in this region.It has been an old tactic of Pakistani security forces to open fire at border guards on the Indian side to distract them. Usually, it was to help terrorists infiltrate into India. “Now, it is also being used to draw the attention of security forces from spots where they are building tunnels,” a counter-terror official said.And there has been a sharp increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces all along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in 2020.According to statistics compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir police, there were 930 instances of ceasefire violations in 2020, a 54% increase over the 605 instances the previous year. There was also a 22% increase in recruitment of terrorists by Pakistan’s deep state.“But the security forces were on their toes,” a top Jammu and Kashmir police officer said. Only 52 of the 174 terrorists recruited in 2020 are still active. “Nearly 50 of them were arrested or surrendered. Another 76 were killed in security operations,” the officer said.A national security planner in Delhi said the Pakistan army’s approach to infiltrate terrorists via tunnels reflected how desperately they wanted to keep Kashmir on the boil. “The general understanding earlier was that the Pakistani side would largely pause infiltration attempts during the winter. The tunnels indicate that General (Qamar Ahmad) Bajwa does not want the terror tap to be turned off…. That he does not want a dip in terrorist attacks in Kashmir,” he said.But the desperation to keep the Kashmir Valley in the news, he said, could also be linked to Imran Khan’s troubles from the opposition that has united to target the PM Khan and even the army. This would explain why PM Khan and Gen Bajwa have been trying to focus on Kashmir back home.The Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance of opposition parties formed in September to mobilise nationwide protests against Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government is already gaining public support.“If the economic situation is not properly controlled, Pakistan will face political instability with growing risks of government collapse,” an internal assessment by the United Nations’ department of safety and security said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/secret-tunnel-on-india-pak-border-reveals-pm-imran-khan-s-real-plans-101610531648760.html

Meanwhile, another rebel BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal alleged that Yediyurappa was being blackmailed by at least three of those being sworn-in into giving them ministerial berths. Yatnal also claimed that the chief minister was distributing money to “lingayat mutts” so that they rebel against the Centre in case he is asked to step down.Refusing to step down, Karanataka’s excise minister H Nagesh said his community will revolt if he is dropped from the cabinet. In December last year, after the minister was accused of seeking a bribe of ₹one crore for a transfer, he had alleged that he was being targeted for being a Dalit.From nearly 24 aspirants, Umesh Katti, Arvind Limbavalli, Murugesh Nirani, C P Yogeshwar, S Angara, MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar are being accommodated in the cabinet.Political analyst Aravind had earlier said that irrespective of who gets the nod, the exercise was likely to kickstart another round of dissidence. "There are simply too many claimants for too few posts. It will definitely create heartburn amongst those who have been denied a berth. Remains to be seen how he will handle the aftermath of the cabinet expansion exercise," he said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yediyurappa-being-blackmailed-claims-rebel-mla-ahead-of-karnataka-cabinet-expansion-101610531560791.html

The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of these laws, but the farmers have hardened their stance reiterating that they want the laws to be scrapped.The top court has formed a committee to resolve the impasse over the three laws, but the protesters have said that they won't listen to it as all the four members of the panel are pro-government.Apart from the three laws, which were passed in September last year, Chautala also held discussions on textile hubs, airports, east-west corridors and railway routes, news agency ANI reported.The meeting with PM Modi comes a day after Chautala met home minister Amit Shah with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.After the meeting on Tuesday, Khattar had said that the political situation in the state was alright and dismissed the claims that his government is weak. “The speculations by the Opposition and media are baseless. Our government is going on strong and will complete its tenure,” he had said."I think the government (in state) is going strong.

Hopefully, the Supreme Court will resolve it," Chautala had said after the meeting.Chautala is the leader of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) which is an alliance partner in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Haryana.

Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” the company said in a statement.Even though it said that 1.65 million vaccine doses were donated to government of India for free, it did not disclose how many doses were shipped in the first batch out of 5.5 million doses that the government had purchased. The remaining doses will be sold at a price of ₹295 plus government taxes.Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).This indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) biocontainment facility in Hyderabad. The vaccine received restricted emergency use approval under clinical trial mode by the national drugs controller early this month.“The evaluation of COVAXIN™ has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants,” the company statement further read.“This vaccine has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data…,” it added.Covaxin is presented in multi-dose vials, and can be stored at 2-8ºC.The product development and clinical trial data thus far has generated 5 publications, which have been submitted to international peer reviewed journals, 4 of which have been accepted and will be published soon. The publication of phase II trial data is undergoing the peer review process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-shipped-to-11-cities-across-country-bharat-biotech-101610529622411.html

Now the government is saying that the recipient won't be able to pick and choose the vaccine which he's administered to. When phase 3 trials of Covaxin are not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari told news agency ANI.He said that the government should not roll out Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based pharma firm Bharat Biotech, till its efficacy and reliability is completely established and phase 3 trials are over. “It (the government) should act in a manner whereby there's complete confidence in people. You can't use rollout as phase 3 trial, Indians are not guinea pigs,” the Congress MP was quoted as saying by ANI.His remarks come as the health ministry on Tuesday hinted that for now, the Covid vaccine recipients will not have the option to choose from the two vaccines recently approved for restricted emergency use in India. "At many places in the world, more than one vaccine is being administered, but presently, in no country, vaccine recipients have the option of choosing the shots," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had told reporters.Tewari had earlier too questioned the reliability of the vaccine and accused the government of misusing the situation. “The BJP government has politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety. The controversy over the vaccine is its latest manifestation. Who is going to get himself vaccinated with a vaccine that has question marks on its reliability,” he had said without naming Covaxin.Two vaccines - Oxford University's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin - have been approved for the viral disease for restricted emergency use. The shipment of both the vaccines, which will be first given to nearly 30 million health and frontline workers, has begun across cities as the nation gets in motion to kickstart the vaccination drive on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-are-not-guinea-pigs-manish-tewari-targets-govt-over-covid-19-vaccine-101610528959240.html

13-01-2021||India||Explained: How much will one dose of Covishield and Covaxin cost?||The first phase of vaccination in India in which healthcare workers will be inoculated first is all set to begin from January 16. The Centre has procured both the vaccines that have got restricted emergency use approval from the Drug Controller General of India. The procurement has been done by the Centre requiring no fund from the state government. The inoculation of frontline workers will be free of cost. But as it is not clear what will happen at the later stage when it comes to the vaccination of common people, the cost factor will come into play.Covishield vs CovaxinIndia is procuring 110 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine at the cost of ₹200 per dose. Taxes are extra. However, this is a special discount price for the Indian government. For other countries and private buyers, the price will go up beyond ₹400 per dose.Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was always said to be cheaper than Oxford vaccine, which is known as Covishield in India. But for Centre, there has not been much price difference. The Centre is procuring 38.5 lakh doses of Covaxin at a rate of ₹295 per dose. But as Bharat Biotech is also providing 16.5 lakh doses to the Centre free of cost, the cost per dose comes at ₹206.Bharat Biotech authorities earlier said that their price will be the same for everyone. Hence, it can be expected that one dose of Covaxin will cost something around ₹295.At present, states can't choose which vaccine they get, the ministry has clarified.Price of all vaccines which have been approved across the world (per dose)Pfizer-BioNTecg: ₹1,431Moderna: ₹2,348- ₹2,715Sinopharm: More than ₹5,650Sinovac Biotech: ₹1,027Novavax: ₹1,114Sputnik V: Over ₹734Johnson & Johnson: ₹734Several states including Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala have promised free vaccine to all residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-is-the-cost-of-covishield-and-covaxin-101610526317829.html

The schools have been asked only to call students with the consent of the parents and follow all the Covid-19 precautions. All schools in the national Capital have been physically shut since March last year in order to avoid the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. This will be the first time after 10 months that students will return to their campuses.Also Read: Delhi govt to set up panels to examine fee hike proposals by pvt schoolsIn a circular issued on Wednesday, the Directorate of Education (DoE) said, “In order to conduct the activities pertaining to pre-board preparations and practical work, the head of government, aided and unaided recognised schools may call the students of classes 10 and 12 only to school with effect from January 18, 2021. However, the child should be called to school only with the consent of parents, following the enclosed standard operating procedure. Further, while the records of children coming to school be maintained, the same should not be used for attendance purposes as sending the child to school is completely optional for parents.”According to the circular, only schools outside containment zones will be allowed to reopen and students, teachers, and staff living in these zones will not be allowed to attend. The schools have been asked not to hold any assembly and physical outdoor activities . The principals have been asked to guide children not to share books, copies and stationary items.While the pre-board exams of Class 12 will be conducted between March 3 and April 15, for Class 10 they will be held between April 1 and April 15, the circular started.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has already announced the timeline of practical and written examinations. While practical exams will begin from March 1, written exams will be conducted between May 3 and June 10.The DoE has asked schools to provide emotional and trauma support to students and teachers upon their return to the campus. The schools have to maintain social distance of six feet, have staggered timings and maintain hygiene, among other Covid-19-appropriate guidelines already issued by the government. While a majority of the schools has welcomed the decision, several parents said they are still apprehensive about the safety of their children. Jyoti Arora, the principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “It was much needed to prepare students for hands-on practice for the forthcoming CBSE practical exams. There are also students in a class who need extra help from teachers, so it’s going to be very helpful for them. Students will be able to get detailed guidelines and supervision from teachers for projects and practical files.”Sumit Vohra, the father of a Class 10 student at DPS Vasant Kunj, said, “Whose responsibility would it be if my child is infected with the virus while attending school? I will not send my child to the school till the situation becomes totally normal. It’s good that the government has given an option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-allows-schools-to-reopen-for-classes-10-12-from-january-18-101610528122427.html

13-01-2021||India||Government plans to boost robotics, manufacturing, export of drones||The Union electronics and information technology ministry plans to boost robotics and manufacturing and export of drones under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, officials aware of the matter said.The ministry introduced the scheme last year to provide incentives of four to six percent to electronics firms for manufacturing mobile phones and other electronic equipment to boost exports.“The mobile phones PLI approximately aims to create [production worth] $8 billion... per players with overall $150 million incentives...Similarly, for drones and robotics, [it]...will be at least [production worth] $2 billion...per player,” said an official, who did not want to be named. There is an emerging market for drones and robotics and the scheme will help India capture a space in it on the global scale, the official added.Also read | India leases hi-tech US naval drones to boost surveillance, intelA second official familiar with the matter said there will be greater demand for robotics and drones with companies such as Amazon investing heavily in the latter. “All delivery services will have to reorient themselves to accommodate the new technology.”The drones are expected to be increasingly used for aerial surveys, fighting large scale insect attacks such as those by locusts last year apart from military purposes. Robotics has a huge potential in boosting healthcare services. Umakanth Soni of Robotics Technologies Park said India’s output is pretty low in the robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector. “It is great that...[the ministry] is looking at doing this [boosting robotics and manufacturing and export of drones],” Soni said.Soni said the technology park seeks to set up an ecosystem for AI and robotics in India. “Our problem primarily lies with the inability to scale these solutions [up] and manufacture them. That is a sector where we need massive support.” He said India has eight percent of the global talent in the AI sector.Soni said India needs a cluster approach that countries such as China and Israel have adopted. “AI is going to create $15.7 trillion of new economic value by 2035, according to PWC research. The AI revolution has the potential to create 133 million jobs, with a net gain of 58 million jobs.”Chirag Sharma of HubbleFly, a drone manufacturer, said there is great scope for domestic production. “...incentives would be needed. That way at least we can start research and development,” Sharma said. Experts pointed out that India’s regulatory drone policy is still in the draft stage and it will need to finalised to boost production and export of drones. The civil aviation ministry is working on the policy that will decide who can fly a drone, to where, and with what kind of payload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-plans-to-boost-robotics-manufacturing-export-of-drones-101610526381634.html

Owners of the diesel autos have been asked to install compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion kits or replace their vehicles with electric operated vans within the revised deadline.The state cabinet on Tuesday at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar gave its nod for the transport department’s proposal to extend the deadline for ban on plying of diesel autos under Patna municipal corporation, Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwari Sharif city council limits.As per the earlier cabinet decision, diesel autos were to be banned in Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwari Sharif areas with effect from March 31, 2021. An officer of the transport department said that the deadline for plying of diesel autos was extended in keeping with the public interest, as the local transport sector was hit hard due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the state elections.This was among the 16 policy matters that the cabinet approved after discussions with the ministers and officials concerned. The unions of diesel auto drivers had also threatened to observe the government ban in breach if the deadline was not extended and appropriate facility was not developed for conversion of their autos for retrofitting with CNG kits.The cabinet also decided to hand the management and maintenance of newly created or developed public water bodies under Jal-Jivan-Haryali mission to the self-help groups of Bihar State Rural Livelihoods Mission (Jiveeka). Jiveeka volunteers have also been authorised to run community kitchens for indoor patients at all district and sub-divisional hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-to-ban-diesel-autos-in-patna-townships-extended-to-september-30-101610525714516.html

13-01-2021||India||Resort comes up in animal corridor near Assam’s Kaziranga in violation of SC order||A resort is being constructed near Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) in Assam in violation of a Supreme Court order banning construction in animal corridors. Despite the ban, work in Green Ashiyana Resort is taking place in the Haldhibari animal corridor of KNPTR amid a blame game between the state forest department and local administration. This is the second instance of construction activity near KNPTR. In July last year, HT had reported about the construction of a building in Kanchanjuri animal corridor of the park, a UNESCO world heritage site known for being the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos. Also Read: In April, 2019, acting on an application by animal activist Rohit Choudhury, the Supreme Court had “restrained” all mining activities along the southern boundary of KNPTR and in the entire catchment area of rivers/streams and rivulets originating in Karbi Anglong hill ranges and flowing into the park. “No new construction shall be permitted on private lands which form part of the nine identified animal corridors,” the order stated. But despite the Supreme Court order, constructions on private land on the animal corridors in and around KNPTR are taking place. In September last year, the centrally empowered committee of Supreme Court had written to Assam chief secretary as well as chief wildlife warden terming the violations as a “serious issue” as they amounted to contempt of the apex court. On January 4 this year, P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR, wrote to Golaghat deputy commissioner mentioning the construction of Green Ashiyana Resort in the animal corridor and urging the district administration to take action. “A boundary wall over the stream in the southern side of the resort has been constructed. During October, 2019, a wild elephant, while returning from the Karbi Anglong area to the park had got stuck inside the boundary wall enclosures of the resort,” the letter said. Despite instructions by the forest department to remove the boundary wall over the stream and allow smooth movement of wild animals, the resort authorities didn’t do anything. “There is new construction work on the eastern side. They are not allowing forest personnel to carry out road/highland work and are trying to control the temple and fishery pond which they have constructed inside,” the letter added. Golaghat deputy commissioner Bibhash Chandra Modi stated that they came to know about the construction just two days ago from the forest department. He assured that action would be taken against the resort soon.“This is a mockery and contempt of the Supreme Court order and neither forest department nor civil administration are serious in implementing the order. While the blame game continues, it is the wildlife and the environment which is getting affected. The Supreme Court should take action against the KNPTR director as well as the Golaghat DC for clear violation of its order,” said wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury. Owner of Green Ashiyana Resort, Kishore Hazarika, mentioned that he has been in occupation of the property since 2003 and till 2019 he was not informed by either forest officials or the district administration that the area is part of an animal corridor. “All this is part of a vindictive campaign against me. There is no notification yet mentioning that the area is in an animal corridor. And even if that is the case, there should be a comprehensive compensation package if action is taken against me or others who have been staying in the area,” said Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resort-comes-up-in-animal-corridor-near-assam-s-kaziranga-n-violation-of-sc-order-101610525662391.html

13-01-2021||India||NGT raps govt over delay in report on import of hazardous waste||The NGT has rapped the Environment Ministry over delay in a report by the committee which was set up to review imports of hazardous waste including tyres, lead and PCBs.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said mere constituting a committee does not serve any purpose unless the matter is taken to a logical end.The National Green Tribunal said that even though a committee is said to have been constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) more than a year ago, no reason is given why no report has been submitted.The MoEF had constituted a committee on November 29, 2019, to review import and export policy of hazardous and other waste such as tyre, textile, lead, oil, paper, glass and printed circuit board and given recommendations to the ministry.The Committee is yet to submit its report on import of paper waste, the tribunal noted."Thus, the MoEF needs to follow up so as to ensure that the requisite report becomes available at the earliest and as far as possible by April 30, 2021, so that based on such report and other material, the MoEF may take a further policy decision in the matter in the interest of the environment and public health," the bench said.The NGT had earlier directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to ensure that no plastic bag less than 50 microns of thickness be manufactured, stocked, sold and used in the country.The green panel also asked the CPCB to ensure that no unregistered plastic manufacturing and recycling unit is in operation and no unit is running in non-conforming or residential areas.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Amit Jain, who alleged that cheap waste paper and road sweep waste is imported from the US, Europe, and other places for burning in brick kilns, causing land and air pollution.“Large plastic waste yards can be seen near recycled paper mills. Import of cheap waste paper is hazardous and is affecting the environment. The import is to the extent of 9,00,000 tons of waste which generates hazardous plastic,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-raps-govt-over-delay-in-report-on-import-of-hazardous-waste-101610522968756.html

The vaccines are being stored appropriately by the authorities, and would be distributed to all centres 24 hours prior to vaccination day,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted. The vaccines were shipped in from Pune via Mumbai.“The first lot of Covid-19 vaccine for Goa has reached today early morning at 0622 hrs. The two boxes received were expeditiously cleared by TEAM GOA and handed over to Health Service officials,” the Airports Authority of India Goa Airport, said in a tweet. The Goa government has said it is all set to vaccinate around 19,000 health workers initially with those among them who are above 50 years of age being given first priority. “There will be eight locations where vaccination will be done -- five government establishments and three private. Around 19,000 health workers from the government and the private sector have been identified to be vaccinated in the first phase, but on the first day, around 100 vaccines will be given from each centre so around 800 persons will be vaccinated,” Sawant had said.“Health workers are first in line followed by other frontline workers, the vaccines will be voluntary and those above 50 will be given first preference. The others will receive in subsequent phases depending on the availability of the vaccine,” Sawant said.“Our health systems are geared up and ready to issue the doses. We have had two trial runs and no substantial issues were noticed,” he added.The Goa government has identified five government health facilities, including the apex Goa Medical College, two district hospitals and two others besides three private hospitals -- Manipal Hospital, Victor Apollo hospital and the Healthway Hospital -- for the first phase of the vaccination drive.The state has conducted two trial runs for the vaccine roll-out on January 2 and January 8 to help identify issues that could crop up during the actual vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23500-doses-of-covishield-vaccine-arrive-in-goa-101610523862233.html
13-01-2021||India||Centre seeks Supreme Court nod to make adultery punishable for armed forces||The Supreme Court on Wednesday admitted a plea by the Centre seeking clarification to prosecute armed forces personnel for adulterous acts. The Supreme Court had, in September 2018, declared the offence of adultery under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) unconstitutional. An application filed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) seeking clarification to this effect was taken up by a three-judge bench headed by Justice RF Nariman on Wednesday.Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for MoD, told the court that the September 27, 2018 judgment of the court in the Joseph Shine v Union of India case, striking down adultery as an offence could come in the way of armed forces personnel being convicted for adulterous acts under the Army Act, Navy Act and Air Force Act.Also Watch: ‘Farmers won’t participate’: Protestors reject SC order for talks with panelVenugopal said, “The Army, Navy and Air Force have provisions under which those caught in adulterous acts are liable to be punished for unbecoming conduct by which they can be court-martialed.”The application by Centre said, “The aforesaid judgment passed by this court may cause instability within the applicants services, as defence personnel are expected to function in peculiar conditions, during the course of which many a time they have to stay separated from their families for long durations, when they are posted on borders or other far-flung areas or in areas with inhospitable weather and terrain.”The plea also stated, “In view of the aforesaid judgment, there will always be a concern in the minds of the army personnel who are operating far away from their families under challenging conditions about the family indulging in untoward activity.”The bench issued notice on the application and said, “This stands on a different footing as it amounts to unbecoming conduct.”AG Venugopal said that the same needs to be clarified as in view of the Supreme Court judgment, an argument may be raised that what could not be done directly in view of aforesaid judgment is being done indirectly.The bench, also comprising justices Navin Sinha and KM Joseph, said, ‘We cannot clarify since it’s a decision by Constitution Bench.” The court issued notice and sent the matter to Chief Justice of India for constituting a five-judge bench to consider the Centre’s application.The application stated that unlike IPC Section 497, the Armed Forces do not differentiate between a man and a woman, who is subject to the Army Act, if they are guilty of an offence. In other words, the Army would equally proceed against a woman as per the Act, if she enters into an adulterous/illicit relationship. Also, Constitution’s Article 33 specifically allows Parliament to restrict or modify operation of fundamental rights with regard to armed forces. The 2018 judgment had been passed on the premise that it discriminated against women as it considered them as chattel or property of a man and only the husband of a married woman could bring a complaint against the third person involved in adulterous act. The law did not likewise punish women involved in similar relationships. However, Supreme Court held that though adultery may not be an offence, it will continue to be a ground for seeking divorce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-supreme-court-nod-to-make-adultery-punishable-for-armed-forces-101610523441889.html

Neither is KD Singh with the TMC anymore nor he is a MP now."The ED probe against Singh and a firm linked to him (Ms Alchemist Infra Realty Limited) dates back to September, 2016 when it filed a criminal case under the PMLA taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed against the company, its directors and others by market regulator SEBI.“Investigation revealed that the proceeds of crime generated by Alchemist Infra Realty Ltd were laundered through the web of companies. Investigations also revealed that the funds mobilised by the firm from various investors were never utilised for the purpose for which they were collected and the same were transferred to bank accounts of other group companies which were mainly paper companies from where they were systematically siphoned off by the accused and used to purchase properties at various locations in the country. All such assets in Punjab, Haryana , Shimla and bank accounts in HDFC Bank worth ₹239.39 crore identified during the course of investigations have been provisionally attached,” the ED said in a statement in January 2019.It has been alleged by the probe agencies that the company launched an illegal collective investment scheme, also called a ponzi or chit fund scheme, and mobilised funds of about ₹1,916 crore from the public in the years preceding 2015.The firm allegedly launched the scheme “without the approval” of the SEBI and led to cheating of gullible investors.In 2015, the firm had informed the SEBI that it had refunded ₹1,077 crore after the market regulators investigation and had sought more time to restore the rest of the amount, which was turned down by the SEBI. Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed by the SEBI in March, 2016.Singh was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Narada sting probe as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-mp-kd-singh-arrested-by-ed-in-connection-with-money-laundering-case-101610523120877.html

On Monday, the number was 96.Flights from the UK have resumed from January 8. To contain the spread of the virus, the Delhi government has imposed additional restrictions on people coming from the UK to Delhi. Every passenger — irrespective of their test result — will have to undergo a seven-day institutional quarantine in Delhi. No other city has imposed such restrictions so far.People who are testing positive of the new virus, known to be a far more contagious strain, viare kept in single-room isolation at designated healthcare facilities by the respective state governments, the department said earlier.Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine and a comprehensive contact-tracing exercise has been initiated for the co-travellers, family members and others, the ministry said, adding that the genome sequencing of other specimens is going on.The situation is being monitored and regular advice is being given to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG laboratories.The presence of the new UK variant of the coronavirus has been reported by several countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/102-cases-of-uk-mutant-strain-in-india-so-far-confirms-health-minister-101610521717398.html

In this regard, this is to inform that due to unforeseen activities, it is decided to postpone the scheduled polio NID round from January 17 2021 till further notice,” read the letter issued on January 9, which was addressed to principal secretaries of health and welfare department of all states.The health ministry officials, however, clarified that the drive was only deferred for the time being.“It is just a temporary measure, and the vaccination will be held soon after the Covid-19 vaccination is taken care of,” an official said on condition of anonymity.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a media briefing on Tuesday, had also said that certain non-Covid related government programmes were being rescheduled due to Covid-related interventions.“When the Covid-19 outbreak started, non-Covid health care services were hugely affected.

13-01-2021||India||Bird flu impacts 3 migratory water birds, apart from poultry and crows: Centre||Bird flu has impacted the bar-headed geese, black and brown headed gulls and the Eurasian teal among migratory birds, and crows and poultry among domestic birds till now, according to the Union environment ministry.The ministry had constituted a committee comprising the inspector general, deputy inspector general of forests and wildlife and a project scientist to monitor the handling of the avian flu situation by states. The committee held a meeting with all state chief wildlife wardens on Tuesday to take stock of the situation and ensure that Centre’s advisory is being followed.“Increasing surveillance and monitoring of wild birds, particularly waterfowls, including ducks, geese, and waders in natural habitats, are therefore essential to check disease transmission. Coordination between the forest department, wetlands authority and the animal husbandry and veterinary departments at the state level is critical to ensure that transmission from wild to domestic birds and vice versa is curbed.The wildlife division of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change has also been sending advisories to the states, which need to be followed in letter and spirit. NGOs with a vast network of bird watchers and ornithologists could also be approached for their expertise and resources to monitor vulnerable areas in states, which could then be shared with the government agencies for further action,” said Dipankar Ghose, director, wildlife and habitats programme, WWF India.Also Read: Bird flu spreads to forests, triggers concerns about safety of endangered species“The wildlife wardens have been asked to coordinate with state governments and the ministry of animal husbandry and fisheries everyday. They have also been asked to ensure states are complying with the advisory issued to them and that any bird deaths or suspicious cases have to be reported to us,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife).“We are keeping a watch on any new species contracting the virus. As of now cases have been reported from protected and forest areas of Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat.According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), bar-headed geese are in abundance hence they are of “least concern” but their numbers are declining. They breed in Afghanistan,Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation (Central Asian Russia) and Tajikistan, and have a very large range.“Most migratory waterfowl species are known to be carriers of the H5N1 virus. After the infection surfaced in Himachal Pradesh, it has been reported in six to seven states. Most recently reports of red junglefowls have come in. They are a relatively rugged species so its very surprising that they contracted the virus. The avian influenza virus normally doesn’t jump over to humans but can be easily transmitted from migratory species to domestic birds and has great potential to completely damage our poultry—birds and even pigs,” said Bivash Pandav, director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), who has specialised in research of water birds.He cautioned that the possibility of endangered bird species contracting the virus cannot be ruled out. “We have to be extremely watchful and monitor wetlands and other wintering grounds. You cannot catch migratory birds and vaccinate them. All you can do is protect other species like vultures etc. A lot of precaution must be exercised in zoos. This epidemic cannot be taken lightly as the virus mutates and evolves very quickly,” he added. Birders and nature lovers can help in reporting cases of dead or sick birds, but Pandav cautioned that they avoid going close to the birds.According to an advisory by the environment ministry, affected birds display symptoms such as tremors, diarrhoea, head tilt and paralysis. The disease spreads quickly, causing paralysis and staggering. The advisory to state chief wildlife wardens says an action plan should be prepared for monitoring the migratory birds and dealing with any emergency. Dead birds should be handled with utmost caution and scientific supervision and surveillance should not be restricted to the protected areas alone, but to all such wetlands and habitats that provide grounds to the migrating birds and to areas where there is a possibility of interaction of migratory birds and poultry such as backyard poultry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-impacts-3-migratory-water-birds-apart-from-poultry-and-crows-centre-101610518281890.html

13-01-2021||India||Bolster India’s rise to counter China challenge: Secret US strategy for Indo-Pacific||A secret US strategy for the Indo-Pacific framed in 2018 envisaged bolstering India’s capacities so that it could work with other like-minded countries to act as “a counterbalance to China” and maintain the capacity to counter challenges from Beijing such as “border provocations” and access to cross-border rivers. The strategy, framed more than two years before the India-China military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), makes more than 20 mentions of India and sees the country as “preeminent in South Asia” and taking on “the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security” while increasing engagement with Southeast Asia and expanding economic and defence cooperation with other US allies and partners. Also Read: Will stand ground at LAC, says army chiefOn the other hand, the document, classified “secret” and “not for foreign nationals”, sees China as a strategic competitor to the US intent on dissolving American alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and circumventing “international rules and norms to gain an advantage”. It also states China will use its dominance in cutting edge technologies to “pose profound challenges to free societies”. Under the US system, such documents usually remain secret for up to three decades but the Trump administration’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien declassified the 10-page strategy with slight redactions on January 5. Experts believe this was done to signal continuity of the US’s Indo-Pacific strategy to key partners such as India, Australia and Japan amid the change in administration in Washington. The strategy is based on the assumption that a “strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China”, and that New Delhi’s “preferred partner on security issues” is Washington. Among the “desired end states” or goals of the strategy is India-US cooperation to “preserve maritime security and counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia and other regions of mutual concern”, and India maintaining “the capacity to counter border provocations by China”. The strategy also sets the goal of ensuring that India remains “preeminent in South Asia and takes the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security, increases engagement with Southeast Asia, and expands its economic, defense, and diplomatic cooperation with other US allies and partners in the region”. The strategy states that the US will take action on several fronts, including diplomatic, military and intelligence, to “accelerate India’s rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security and Major Defense Partner” and to address challenges emanating from China, including the border dispute. Among the actions the US will take in this regard is offering “support to India – through diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels – to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China and access to water, including the Brahmaputra and other rivers facing diversion by China”. The US will also “solidify an enduring strategic partnership with India underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the United States and our partners in the region to address shared interests”. According to the document, the US will build a “stronger foundation for defense cooperation and interoperability; expand our defense trade and ability to transfer defense technology to enhance India’s status as a Major Defense Partner; increase our cooperation on shared regional security concerns and encourage India’s engagement beyond the Indian Ocean Region”. The US will also support India’s bid for membership of the Nuclear Supplier’s Group, and work “with India toward domestic economic reform and an increased leadership role in the East Asia Summit (EAS) and ADMM+ (Asean Defence Ministers Meeting” Over the past three years, the US has signed three key defence agreements, one at each of the 2+2 ministerial meetings, to facilitate the real-time sharing of sensitive military information and transfer of sophisticated technology. These agreements are the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), the Industrial Security Annex to the General Security of Military Information Agreement, and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). In a recent farewell address, outgoing US ambassador Kenneth Juster had specifically referred to these agreements and said concluding them had elevated the bilateral defence partnership. During the same event, Juster had said the US was “very supportive” amid the India-China border standoff but declined to go into details. “We both share a vision of the Indo-Pacific region...and that is an inclusive vision that provides opportunities for all countries to grow and prosper but also wants to avoid incursions of any type, intimidations and predatory financing, and when there’s a situation that is along those lines, we cooperate to try to resist it,” he had said. The four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – elevated the body to the ministerial level in 2019 and the second ministerial meeting was held in Tokyo last year. Ahead of that meeting, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had spoken about plans to formalise the Quad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bolster-india-s-rise-to-counter-china-challenge-secret-us-strategy-for-indopacific-101610512761615.html

A division bench of Chief Justice TB Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee directed the state’s chief secretary on Friday to file an affidavit on Tuesday on the measures for the dip in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This [affidavit] will enable the Court to assess the situation and decide whether or not the Ganga Sagar Mela should be permitted to be held this year keeping in mind the pandemic situation and the paramount interest of public health at large,” the bench said.The Mela is held on the Sagar Island in West Bengal in mid-January every year. It is the second-largest congregation of pilgrims in India after the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. Around five million pilgrims from across India took the holy dip to celebrate Makar Sankranti, the first major Hindu festival in the Gregorian calendar, last year.The state government has for the first time made provisions for pilgrims to watch the Mela live on the internet. Pilgrims can book an online pilgrimage package comprising Ganga Jal in a container, prasad, and the holy tika for e-snan (e-holy dip).The court earlier directed the state government to inform the pilgrims about the risks of taking the holy dip during the pandemic. Sabysachi Chatterjee, the lawyer who filed a petition over the Mela, said the court was primarily satisfied with the state government’s arrangements but said it was susceptible about how the effectuation of the measures could be achieved.In October, the court banned the entry of visitors into Durga Puja pandals amid muted celebrations because of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-to-decide-today-whether-ganga-sagar-mela-can-be-held-101610511741857.html

13-01-2021||India||Take precautions even after Covid vaccine: Bihar govt tells health workers||The Bihar government has cautioned healthcare workers to continue taking precautions against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) even after taking vaccine shots, as it braced up to inoculate over 467,000 healthcare workers in the state during the first phase of vaccination from January 16. Precautions are necessary as it takes 14 days after the second shot of the vaccine to develop protective antibody, said top health officials. The gap between the two shots of vaccine is 28 days. “One has to maintain social distancing, use hand sanitiser and mask even after taking Covid-19 vaccine. It takes at least 14 days after the second shot of vaccine to develop antibody against coronavirus,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH). “The first shot is a priming dose, then the booster dose is given after 28 days that completes the vaccination process. It will take 14 days from the second shot to develop protective antibody level in an individual. So, those taking the vaccine should not immediately become complacent after taking the first or the second shot,” he added. In order to dispel any myth surrounding around the vaccine, Singh has decided to take the first shot of the vaccine at the NMCH, which is one of the 16 session sites or vaccination centres in Patna and among 300 in Bihar selected for vaccination on the inaugural day of vaccination on January 16. The first batch of 54,900 vials of Covishield vaccine that will suffice for 549,000 doses, reached Patna by air from Pune on Tuesday. The second consignment of vaccines is expected to arrive either later this month or early next month, said a senior state health officer.Some Opposition leaders have raised doubts about the efficacy of the indigenous vaccines after the drug controller general of India, earlier this month, gave its nod for restricted emergency use of two vaccines — Covaxin of the Bharat Biotech and Covishield of Serum Institute of India. The ministry of health and family welfare also emphasises on social distancing, use of hand sanitiser and mask and regular hand-washing in its frequently asked questions section on vaccination. Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit, also dwelt on this fact while making a presentation on state’s vaccination preparedness to the chief secretary Deepak Kumar. The video conference on Monday was attended by district magistrates (DMs) and civil surgeons of all 38 districts as well as principals and superintendents of nine government and five private medical colleges in the state. The health department, in keeping with the Centre’s guidelines, has asked DMs, civil surgeons, principals and superintendents of government and private medical colleges to make arrangements for video-webcasting at session sites for monitoring and surveillance purpose. It has also asked the officials to arrange for Anaphylaxis kit (to treat an acute and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction after vaccination) and adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI) kit at all session sites. It also asked them to ensure training of vaccinators and medical officers in each vaccination team on use of these kits. AEFI committees, comprising doctors from different disciplines, have also been notified in medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-precautions-even-after-covid-vaccine-bihar-govt-tells-health-workers-101610511321578.html

He added the launch of the vaccination drive did not mean the end of the pandemic. Prasad warned the people against lowering their guard and asked them to follow Covid protocol strictly.“In the last 24 hours, 511 cases have been reported from across Uttar Pradesh...vaccination of all will take time. Till the vaccination, people should remain alert and cover their faces with masks, wash hands regularly, and maintain social distancing.

We do not want that to be repeated. There maybe a short delay of certain services where we might have to reschedule certain programmes but no service will be shut in future when Covid-19 vaccination drive is on. And since governments are guided by scientific norms and standard operating procedures, and therefore, transparent, we would expect that everyone would scrupulously follow these SOPs while the vaccination rolls out in the country. Also, the entire process is technology driven,” he said.Also read | ‘When every moment counted’, tweets minister Hardeep Puri on vaccine driveBhushan also reiterated that there will be a sequential roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine, depending on the availability of the vaccine.The roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine will provide priority to the healthcare workers and the frontline workers who are estimated to be around 30 million, followed by those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million. The vaccination drive will begin with 10 million healthcare workers from across the country on January 16. Three phases of dry runs have already been conducted across the country, with the third dry run having been conducted on Friday across 615 districts covering 4,895 session sites in 33 States/UTs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-could-take-a-year-or-more-health-ministry-101610508380626.html

13-01-2021||India||NW India records very poor AQI; dense fog also likely: IMD||Many towns and cities in northwest India recorded very poor quality air on Wednesday morning. This includes Delhi with an air quality index (AQI) of 341, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Noida, Rohtak etc.This in spite of strong winds of 15 to 25 kmph blowing during the day. Higher air pollution levels are likely to be due to reduced wind speed in the morning and moisture in the air which tends to make pollution particles heavy and cling together. Dense fog is also likely in many parts of NW India on Wednesday morning.Many stations recorded cold day/severe cold day and cold wave on Tuesday. “There is uplifted fog and cloud cover in many parts of NW India because of which the day temperatures are falling, nights are also very cold. This is because an intense Western Disturbance has passed on January 8 and northwesterly winds are blowing from the direction of the snow-clad Himalayas. The feels-like temperature in many parts of northwest India is at least 2 degrees lower because of chilly winds and cold days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting Centre.The feels-like temperature takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body actually perceives the temperature. In winter, a strong wind can make a day feel much colder than what the measured temperature would indicate.Shrivastava added, “The minimum and maximum temperatures may fall by 1 or 2 degrees in the next three days and both a cold day and cold wave may be recorded over many places including Delhi.”There is no likelihood of a Western Disturbance affecting the Western Himalayan region for four to five days during which period, the temperatures are likely to be lower than normal and winds are likely to be northwesterly. Some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Rajasthan recorded cold wave and severe cold wave conditions on Monday and Tuesday according to the Regional Meteorological Centre.IMD has warned of minimum and maximum temperatures falling further in the coming days. Amid the prevalence of north/northwesterly winds, minimum temperatures are likely to be below normal over most parts of northwest India during Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Dense or very dense fog is expected to envelop parts of the regionCold Wave/ Severe Cold Wave conditions are also likely over some parts over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and in isolated parts over Uttar Pradesh, north Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan during the next three days. Ground frost is likely in isolated pockets over south Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and north Rajasthan during the next two days. Dense to very dense fog conditions are likely in some places.Cold day conditions intensified on Tuesday with Delhi’s Palam recording 14.8 degrees C, 5.7 degrees C below normal; Chandigarh 11.1 degrees C, 9.6 degrees C below normal; Ambala 12.6 degrees C, 6.7 degrees C below normal; Gorakhpur 15.2 degrees C, 7.3 degrees C below normal; and Rohtak 14.9 degrees C, 5.7 degrees C below normal.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degrees C or 6.4 degrees C below normal, respectively.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees C in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nwindia-records-very-poor-aqi-dense-fog-also-likelyimd-101610507061057.html

First we need to listen to farmers, if they have any misconception about Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), we will clear it, they need to be assured that whatever is happening is in their interest," Ghanwat told news agency ANI.Also Read: Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws, forms 4-member committeeSC on Tuesday, after putting a stay on the farm laws' implementation, formed a four-member panel to listen to grievances of the protesting farmers and the point of view of the government on the issue. The committee is to submit its report to the court on the same within two months."Several farmer leaders and unions want freedom from the monopoly of APMC, this need to be stopped and farmers should be given the freedom to sell their crop. This has been a demand for the last 40 years. Farmers who want MSP should get it and those who want freedom from it should also have an option," Ghanwat further said.Also Read: Farmers say copies of new laws will be burnt on LohriMeanwhile, farmers' leaders rejected the committee formed by the SC on the grounds that all its members were 'pro-farm laws'. According to the farmers' leaders, the committee has been formed by the government through SC and all its members have supported the new legislation at one point or another.However, according to Ghanwat, farmers' fears are not justified. "It is a total misconception. Ashok Gulati is not a political leader or even part of any group, he is an agricultural economist. I have been neutral on this, I have never worked for any political party but only in favour of farmers, and whatever happens in the coming days, we will try our best to get the issue resolved in favour of all farmers of the nation, not just for farmers of Maharashtra or Punjab," he said.The other three members of the committee appointed by the top court are Bhupinder Singh Mann, President of Bharatiya Kisan Union's Mann faction, Pramod Kumar Joshi Director of International Food Policy Research Institute and agricultural economist Ashok Gulati.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-get-justice-says-anil-ghanwat-member-of-sc-panel-on-farm-laws-101610501185536.html
13-01-2021||India||Opposition welcomes top court order, urges Centre to repeal laws||The opposition parties on Tuesday welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the implementation of the three farm laws with the Congress flagging concerns over the composition of the four-member panel formed to end the impasse between farm unions and the central government.Calling the formation of the committee “well-intentioned”, senior Congress leader P Chidambram tweeted: “The decision to form a committee to help find a solution is well-intentioned. However, the composition of the four-member committee is puzzling and sends contradictory signals.”The committee comprises Bhupinder Singh Mann, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union; Anil Ghanwat, president of the Shetkari Sangathana; Pramod Kumar Joshi, former director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; and economist Ashok Gulati.Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the members of the committee have expressed support for the new laws. “So, the question arises in our minds that how justice will be done to farmers by them. How can anyone trust a committee whose members have already spoken so loudly in favour of Modi government’s draconian farm laws,” he said.Thousands of farmers have massed Delhi’s borders in protest against the new laws that they say will leave them vulnerable to the big agribusinesses. The government has maintained that the laws will open up agricultural markets and help in increasing farm incomes.Welcoming the Supreme Court stay on the laws, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar tweeted, “It is a big relief for farmers and I hope that a concrete dialogue between the Central government and farmers will be initiated now, keeping the farmers interests and well-being in mind.”Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin said, “I once again urge the Union government to commit to repealing the farm laws in the next Parliament session.” Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “It is clear that these farm laws are not for the welfare of our farmers but for the corporate only.”Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, however, were cautious in their response to the apex court’s order.“There are some people who feel there was no or not good enough grounds for staying the laws, but now that the honourable court has made a decision, it now rests on the farmers to come to the discussion table,” said a senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli attacked the Congress for its criticism of the court-appointed committee. The Congress’s stand is a “classic testimony towards its duplicity and opportunistic politics practised since 2005”, he was quoted as saying by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-welcomes-top-court-order-urges-centre-to-repeal-laws-101610498487989.html
13-01-2021||India||Khalistanis have infiltrated farmers’ protest: Govt in SC||The central government on Tuesday said in the Supreme Court that “Khalistani” secessionists had infiltrated the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders and were trying to influence participants.Attorney general KK Venugopal made this claim before a bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde that enquired about statements in this regard made by some other lawyers during the hearing on the farm laws. Senior advocates Harish Salve and PS Narasimha, appearing for different parties in the matter, had raised the issue of those with “vested interests” taking advantage of the protests to further their “oblique motives”.Salve contended that there were banners of the Canada-based banned outfit Sikhs for Justice that had come up at the protest sites. “This is a banned outfit which is advertising to pay ₹25,000 to anyone who joins these protests. They are furthering their oblique motive under the garb of the farmers’ protest,” he said.Narasimha supported Salve in his submission. He said there was a formal application in this regard, with pictures of such banners and Facebook messages about money for joining the protest. “These kinds of protests can be dangerous,” he said. At this, the bench asked the AG if the assertion made before it was true and the law officer replied in the affirmative. “We have been informed there is Khalistani infiltration in the protests,” said Venugopal, adding that he would file an affidavit along with necessary inputs from the Intelligence Bureau.The bench asked Venugopal to file the affidavit by Wednesday. Later, when the bench released its order of the day, it recorded these apprehensions: “Laudably, the farmers have so far carried on the agitation peacefully and without any untoward incident. But it was pointed out in the course of hearing that a few persons who are not farmers have also joined, with a view to show solidarity with the farmers.”“A specific averment is made in an intervention application filed by one Indian Kisan Union, in... that an organisation by name ‘Sikhs for Justice’, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. This averment is supported by the learned Attorney General also,” the order added.The court will take up this plea on January 18 along with Delhi Police’s request to stop the farmers from taking out a tractor rally or procession in any other form on or around Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalistanis-have-infiltrated-farmers-protest-govt-in-sc-101610498277866.html

The vaccines will dispatched on Wednesday to 10 regional vaccine stores in districts such as East Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.Punjab received its first consignment of 20,004 vials of the Covishield vaccine, which would be distributed to district headquarters in special vans, said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajeev Bhaskar. Chandigarh received 1,200 vials.Odisha kept its first consignment in a cold room at the airport before the vials were sent to state vaccine centres. Insulated vaccine vans from every district will be stationed at the centre to carry the vials to district vaccine stores, said Bijay Panigrahi, state nodal officer for the Covid-19 vaccination drive.Assam and Meghalaya were the first states in the northeast to receive the Covid-19 vaccineAfter receiving its first batch of the Serum Institute vaccine, Tamil Nadu is expecting a second batch, from Bharat Biotech, on Wednesday, said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. He said the vaccines were dispatched from Chennai to 10 regional centres including Coimbatore, Trichy and Madurai. “The vaccination is entirely voluntary,” Radhakrishnan told reporters, adding that 2,000 vaccination centres had been readied in the state.As the vaccine arrived, Tamil Nadu and the Union territory of Puducherry announced that immunisation would be free fore everyone.The Bihar government has already made a similar announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-mega-inoculation-drive-vaccines-reach-14-cities-101610495773505.html
13-01-2021||India||House panel may summon FB on WhatsApp privacy policy||The Parliamentary Panel on Information Technology is likely to summon Facebook officials in the wake of privacy concerns about WhatsApp, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.“The issue was discussed, but not as a matter of formalised discussion,” a person aware of the proceedings of the meeting held on Tuesday said. “You can expect the panel to take up the matter.”The new privacy policy, which was rolled out by WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, last week, includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists.The move has faced massive backlash globally, with users en masse defecting to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.The panel, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, may also plan to summon Twitter. “The companies will have to come in and clarify whether they are intermediaries or publishers,” said a second person familiar with the matter. “The issue of taking down of people’s accounts arbitrarily may also be raised. The exact date of the meeting has not yet been set, but it will happen in the coming weeks.”A third person familiar with the matter said that issue of Twitter’s “arbitrary” ban of US President Donal Trump, in the aftermath of an armed insurrection by his supporters on the Capitol building in Washington, was raised by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey and Congress MP Karti Chidambaram. “If they are intermediaries, how can they ban someone. Today, its Donald Trump, tomorrow it will be someone else,” said the third person.The issue of data privacy was raised by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, and supported by other MPs, the third person mentioned above said. “If WhatsApp says its data is end-to-end encrypted, how can it be shared with someone else? This raises serious concerns about data privacy. Moreover, in this case, why can’t they share the data with the government of India,” the third person added.The panel met on Tuesday to hear from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal agency for Aadhaar. The second person quoted above said UIDAI told the panel that it had managed to completely universalise the Aadhaar services, except in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Facebook’s handling of data has already been an issue, which has been raised by a joint parliamentary committee and the IT panel in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-may-summon-fb-on-whatsapp-privacy-policy-101610487234421.html
13-01-2021||India||Will stand ground at LAC, says army chief||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China to reduce tensions in the sensitive sector are “prolonged,” even as he described a joint threat from China and Pakistan as “very potent”.He said India should not read too much into the recent withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no reduction of troops by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector, where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.Hindustan Times reported on Monday that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but the PLA’s frontline deployments remain unchanged.Gen Naravane told reporters at his customary annual press conference ahead of Army Day on January 15 that he was hopeful the ongoing dialogue with China would yield an “amicable solution,” but stressed that the operational preparedness of the army was of high order and the force was ready to deal with any eventuality. The two armies are due to hold the ninth round of talks between their senior commanders to resolve the lingering border dispute that has brought chill to ties.“Eight rounds of talks have taken place between military commanders and each of these rounds has either been preceded or followed by diplomatic level engagement. We will ensure that through the medium of these talks we reach a solution which is acceptable and not detrimental to our interests. And if the talks get prolonged, so be it. We are prepared to hold our ground for as long as it takes to achieve our national goals and interests,” the army chief said.His remarks convey two important things, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “First, it is a declaration of resolve and intent to continue with a strong posture along the LAC till the time the matter is resolved to India’s satisfaction and that time is not of paramount importance. Secondly, it also shows that an early resolution appears unlikely, most probably due to the positions of both sides being quite different on the terms of disengagement and de-escalation,” Hooda said.Naravane said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.“On the situation at the northern borders, we are carrying out certain studies.We carry out a periodic review of our operational plans and our strategies to deal with various threats — both external (one front or two fronts) and internal. And based on these reviews, a certain amount of rebalancing does happen...,” the army chief said. He said the army was focused not only on eastern Ladakh but along the border with China — stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand to Arunachal Pradesh.“There is no eyeball-to-eyeball deployment in the central and eastern sectors but friction points are there. In these areas, China has built a lot of infrastructure on its side, including roads and barracks. We monitor all these developments and factor them in when we devise a new strategy,” he said.He said various Chinese army units and formations come to the Tibetan plateau for their summer training and go back when the winter sets in.“We should not read too much into their presence or absence in these training areas.These areas are well in depth and are as much as 500 km to 1,500 km away from the border. All the same, we keep an eye on their deployments on the Tibetan plateau because these are the forces that could be mobilised and sent to the borders in 24 to 48 hours…However, what is more important is that in the border areas where there is eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation,there has been no reduction of troops.That is where we have to be more concerned and careful,” Gen Naravane said.On the origin of the border row with China, Naravane said the army had full details of where the PLA was training in the Ladakh theatre last summer but the latter had the “first-mover advantage” that can never be predicted.He said the Indian Army exploited the same advantage last August when it moved swiftly and occupied strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.“They (PLA) come for training every year and we had full details of the areas they were present in. We were regularly monitoring the situation. But suddenly they had the first-mover advantage. This first-mover advantage will always remain, like we had in the month of August. Even though we were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact,China had no clue that we would surprise them,” he said.The Indian Army swiftly occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The army chief said that there was no doubt that India faced a collusive threat from China and Pakistan.“This is not just something that was part of some strategic paper or loud thought process.It is very much manifesting itself on the ground. There is indeed increased cooperation between China and Pakistan in both military and non-military fields. And a two-front threat is something that we have to be prepared for. And in dealing with such a threat, we have to see which threat is more serious, prioritise it and deal with it first,” he said.The two countries together pose a very potent threat that cannot be wished away and the army keeps that element in mind during its strategic planning, he said.The army chief said that the force was reducing its footprint in the North-east with the security situation there improving manifold in recent years. He said one brigade had been relieved of counter-insurgency duties and two more would follow suit. “We are drawing down in the North-east.It will help us focus more on our primary task, which is dealing with external threats,” he said.On a recent controversial one-man study — published by a think tank — that said half of the army was under stress, Naravane said it was based on a highly inadequate sample size of just 400 people. “For 99% accuracy, the sample size should have been 19,000.”On a lighter note, he said maybe there is stress in the army and “I am also stressed”.Stress is not always bad as it can also get work done, he said, adding that measures were in place to deal with the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-stand-ground-at-lac-says-army-chief-101610484171684.html
13-01-2021||India||SC stays farm laws, sets up committee to hear all sides||The Supreme Court on Tuesday took the unprecedented step of staying the three contentious farm laws that have brought tens of thousands of protesting farmers to Delhi’s doorstep, and formed a four-member committee to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court, though the move left protesting farm unions unimpressed.The unions insisted that the protest would continue, and pointed out that all members of the court-appointed committee, Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agriculture economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana), have previously indicated their support for the laws.The court’s decision, which buys the government time — the committee is to hold its first sitting within 10 days, and the court will next hear the case after eight weeks — comes after eight rounds of talks with farmers failed to resolve the deadlock. The court also agreed to hear the government’s application seeking an injunction against a proposed tractor march that could disrupt celebrations of the Republic Day on January 26. The Centre, in an application filed through Delhi Police, said any such march would cause “embarrassment to the nation”. The unions said they would go ahead with the next round of talks with the government on January 15.While putting the laws on hold amid massive protests at Delhi’s borders, the court held that suspension of the legislation “may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith”.The court also directed that the minimum support price (MSP) system, in existence before the enactment of the new laws, shall be maintained until further orders. “In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws,” ordered the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.At the same time, the court also urged the farmers to consider calling off their protests in view of the “extraordinary order” issued to suspend the laws.T he bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, expressed hope that the stay order will be perceived by the farmers as an “achievement” and will prompt them “to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others”.It observed that all those interested in solving the problem should go to the four-member panel that will look into problem areas and report within two months. While the farm unions have said they will continue to push for a complete repeal of the laws, several opposition politicians saw the court’s order as a victory for them, though some others pointed out that the farmers are unlikely to get justice from the committee.“I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court to stay the #FarmLaws in the cases filed by various parties including DMK. This is a victory for farmers protesting across India. I once again urge the Union Govt to commit to repealing the farm laws in the next Parliament Session,” Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin said on Twitter.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “All four members (of the panel) are known to have taken a public stand in favour of the laws.They have said that the farmers are being misled. How can such a committee do justice to the farmers?”The court order added that representatives of all the farmers’ bodies “shall participate in the deliberations of the committee”. In the 11-page order, it said the panel was constituted to listen to the grievances of farmers and the views of the government and to make recommendations to be considered by the bench.During Tuesday’s hearing, the court took note that senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who appeared on behalf of the farmers’ unions a day ago and had sought time to convey the willingness of the union leaders to join the deliberations before the committee, was absent. The CJI, however, remarked that his absence should not deter the bench from passing an order to constitute a committee, which, he said, was only for the purposes of assisting the court and would be a part of the judicial proceedings.“We want to solve this problem.That is why we want to form this committee. Members of the bar must show some loyalty to the judicial process.This is not politics. There is a difference between politics and a judicial process. You cannot come here and tell us all negative things. Members of the bar must cooperate,” said the bench as advocates ML Sharma and AP Singh contended that farmers did not want to go before any committee.It added: “No power can stop us from setting up a committee to evaluate the pros and cons of the farm laws and it will be part of the judicial process.”Attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the government, supported the court’s view to have a committee for resolution of disputes.On his part, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for a Delhi resident, told the bench that the order should be worded in a manner that it should not sound like a victory to any one side.“It will be a victory of fair play. But we are also making it clear that suspension of the laws will not be indefinitely and it will not be an empty formality. There cannot be empty suspension of the legislations without any purpose. Everyone interested in solving the problem should go to the committee. The committee will not punish you but will only listen to you and will give us a report. Everyone will have to cooperate,” emphasised the CJI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-farm-laws-sets-up-committee-to-hear-all-sides-101610483262758.html
13-01-2021||India||People won’t be given vaccine choice: Govt||Vaccine recipients will not get to choose which shot they take, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc., or Bharat Biotech International’s Covaxin, which it has developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), for protection against Covid-19.Both vaccine candidates have won approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) although Covaxin is still in Phase 3 trials.“Several countries in the world are using more than one Covid-19 vaccine to inoculate their citizens. In none of these countries are beneficiaries being offered an option of choosing which vaccine to take,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday.Recipients will get two doses of a vaccine four weeks apart.“The current recommendations are very clear that it will be given at day zero and at day 28, four weeks apart, and as has been pointed out, the effect will come after two weeks. At the moment we are just considering 0 to 28 days, and we would like to focus on that,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR.“There is some literature in the world which is showing that you can give up to six weeks {apart}, and some countries are also discussing whether it can be given at a bigger gap but at the moment we would like to stick to four weeks, and would like our first phase {of vaccination} to be at four weeks till more knowledge is attained,” he added.The government is looking at staggering the procurement of vaccine doses rather than placing a bulk order even as both the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech have stockpiled enough vials to meet initial demand in the country, which will immunise 30 million health-care and front-line workers at the vanguard of the fight against Covid-19 before turning its attention to 270 million people aged above 50 and those with comorbidities.“We would be staggering our supply orders. We are aware of this, and people who are manufacturing and supplying the vaccine are also aware of it,” said Bhushan.The Indian government has procured 11 million doses of Covishield from Serum Institute at a cost of ₹200 per dose, exclusive of taxes. Of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, the number is 5.5 million doses, of which 1.65 million doses are being procured free of cost, and the remaining 3.85 million doses are being purchased at a cost of ₹295 per dose, exclusive of taxes, making the net cost of a Covaxin dose ₹206 per dose.“We wanted to share the prices so that the less than adequately informed discussions on the topic should end,” said Bhushan.Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the launch of the vaccination drive across the country on January 16. Close to 30 virtual meetings have been held between the Centre and states to review preparations.“The Centre is very closely collaborating with the states and Union territories for rolling out the vaccination on January 16, 2021. Since different individuals will be discharging different duties they need to be trained as per the best of their ability,” said Bhushan.The government has trained 2,360 master trainers, who in turn have trained 61,000 programme managers, 200,000 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members so far.“Each vaccination team will have five members, of which there will be one vaccinator. The four other team members also need to be adequately trained which is why so many people had to be trained for the launch… this exercise will last may be for beyond one year..,” Bhushan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-won-t-be-given-vaccine-choice-govt-101610481689050.html
13-01-2021||India||Vaccine vials land in city, Serum moves 6.4m doses||Marking a milestone about 10 months after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) gripped the country, India on Tuesday dispatched about 6.44 million doses of the Covishield vaccine to 14 cities from its manufacturer’s Pune headquarters, setting in motion a massive inoculation drive that will begin this weekend.At 4:53am, three temperature-controlled trucks escorted by police vehicles left the Serum Institute of India (SII)’s building on the outskirts of Pune for the airport, carrying vials of the vaccine that, along with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, has been okayed by the drug controller for restricted emergency use.Pune deputy commissioner of police Namrata Patil, accompanied by SII staff, cracked open a coconut — believed to be auspicious — to flag off the vehicles that left the premises.“Our trucks left the SII facility early morning and now the vaccine is being distributed in the entire country. This is a proud and historic moment as scientists, experts and all other stakeholders took great efforts while making this vaccine in less than a year,” said SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla, whose organisation is conducting clinical trials and manufacturing the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine.The first consignment of 264,000 doses of Covishield reached Delhi’s central storage facility at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital (RGSSH) in the afternoon around high security, according to officials aware of the developments.Twenty-two boxes containing 1,200 vials each of the vaccine was brought to the hospital’s utility block that has been retrofitted with 90 deep freezers, which can store 4.1 million doses of the vaccine.“Each of the vials (5 millilitres) contains 10 doses (0.5ml each) of the vaccine. So far, Delhi has received 264,000 vaccine doses that will be almost enough for the health care workers in the city,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.At the start of the vaccination drive beginning this Saturday, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 million health care and frontline workers (employees across government departments, the police and civic bodies). Next on the priority list are an estimated 270 million people (those above 50 years of age, and people with serious comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension). This exercise, according to some estimates, could take at least seven months.A SpiceJet flight carrying the vials landed at the Delhi airport around 10am. The Delhi Police formed a “green corridor” to safely transport the vaccines to the hospital, which received the consignment around 3pm.“There are three levels of security that will be in place (in the hospital).There are CCTV cameras installed within and outside the building. There are hospital guards stationed at the vaccine store round the clock, and police personnel deployed outside the store,” said Dr Chhavi Gupta, a spokesperson for RGSSH.In the national capital, the vaccination drive will be launched at 89 centres (49 private and 40 public health care facilities) that are part of the 5,000 sites approved by the Centre across the country. Delhi has pegged the number of health care workers at 300,000, of which around 225,000 have already been registered with the government.“Delhi is fully prepared and all preparations are in place,” health minister Satyendar Jain said.Apart from Delhi, vials of the vaccine were flown to Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Chandigarh. On Tuesday, four airlines (Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir) operated nine flights to transport 5.47 million doses of the vaccine to these cities across the country.Separately, Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope said his state, too, received the first consignment of 963,000 doses by road and that the vaccine will be distributed among 511 camps covering all districts. “We have also developed 3,135 cold chains to be used for storing the vaccines,” he said in Mumbai.The Indian government has procured 11 million doses of Covishield from SII — the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume — at a cost of ₹200 per dose, exclusive of taxes.For Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin (it is still in Phase 3 trials), the number is 5.5 million doses, of which 1.65 million doses are being procured free of cost, and the remaining 3.85 million doses are being purchased at a cost of ₹295 per dose, exclusive of taxes, making the net cost of a Covaxin dose ₹206.In case of both vaccines, recipients will get two doses four weeks apart and the effects will start showing 14 days after the second dose.“The Centre is very closely collaborating with the states and Union Territories for rolling out the vaccination on January 16, 2021. Since different individuals will be discharging different duties they need to be trained as per the best of their ability,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a briefing.The government has trained 2,360 master trainers, who in turn have trained 61,000 programme managers, 200,000 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members so far.Health authorities in states have said they would make use of experience gained from running regular child immunisation programmes for polio to ensure full coverage in what they called the world’s biggest vaccination drive. “The vaccine is here even then that doesn’t take away the fact that people will still have to observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour such wearing a mask, maintaining hand hygiene and ensuring physical distancing,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of premier scientific body Indian Council of Medical Research.As of Tuesday, India has reported 10,495,813 cases of the viral infection while 1,51,581 people have died in the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-vials-land-in-city-serum-moves-6-4m-doses-101610480872820.html
13-01-2021||India||Panellists have been in favour of new laws||A committee of four formed by the Supreme Court to examine three contentious agricultural laws has people who mostly believe in freer markets and economic reforms, analyses of their publicly held positions on agricultural issues show.All four members proposed for the committee — economists Ashok Gulati and PK Joshi as well as farm activists Anil Ghanwat and Bhupinder Singh Mann — have either publicly endorsed the laws or want them amended.That is a gripe among farm unions protesting the laws they say will hurt their livelihoods.The protesting farmers on Tuesday said they didn’t want to be part of the committee because its views in favour of the laws were well-documented. The farmers, in any case, have held that their opposition was not to the validity of the laws but to how they were “anti-farmer”, and therefore they needed to be repealed, not amended.A key figure in the committee, economist Ashok Gulati, has been arguing for decades for a market-led, enterprise-driven agricultural economy, which supports half of all Indians but is largely an antiquated sector.Gulati is an agricultural economist who knows policymaking firsthand, has held public positions and headed non-profits in the farm-rural-food sectors, apart from writing copious amounts of original economic research in prestigious journals.He is currently the Infosys chair professor of agriculture at the New Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (Icrier). He has served the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and led the International Food Research Institute in South Asia (IFPRI).Gulati had a direct role in policymaking during the previous Congress-led regime when he headed the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices, the federal body that recommends minimum support prices or MSP for farm produce.Gulati has praised the pro-reform laws currently being opposed by tens of thousands of farmers as a “1991 moment”, a reference to India’s first major economic reforms that saw the opening of markets, privatisation and currency devaluations but which left agriculture untouched.He has also been a harsh critic of many policies of the Narendra Modi government, his main argument being that the shackles around agriculture and statist policies can’t lift farm incomes. He had dismissed the possibility, for example, of farmers’ incomes being doubled in six years as the Modi government has promised to do by 2022.But the recent laws came in for abject praise from Gulati. “The Narendra Modi government deserves compliments for finally introducing reforms in the country’s agri-marketing system,” he wrote on May 10 in a column he writes in The Indian Express.Gulati has consistently opposed the government’s obsession with keeping domestic food prices low by frequently imposing food-export bans, which he argues keeps Indian farmers poor. “That’s an implicit tax on farmers,” he had told HT a year ago.“I don’t think any economist will lose sight of rationality but yes, he has been an advocate of agri reforms. That doesn’t suit the farmers’ positions,” a former colleague of Gulati said, not wanting to be named.Economist PK Joshi is a former chief of IFRI in South Asia and a food policy specialist who, too, advocates reforms of his own. His research has contended, much like Gulati’s, that the MSP system of fixing floor rates that is effective only for wheat and rice has devastated the environment by incentivising over-extraction of water.He has often argued that MSP reaches a small percentage of farmers, distorts market prices and does little to help a majority of farmers who don’t have marketable surpluses, meaning small farmers who can’t grow enough to sell.“There is an ongoing debate on whether minimum support prices for various agricultural commodities can be replaced by a system of price deficiency payments to farmers,” Joshi wrote in the journal EPW in May 2018. In it, he argued that price deficiency payment — a model where farmers are paid the difference between open-market prices and MSP — is a more efficient way of supporting farmers.Anil Ghanwat, the third member named for the committee, belongs to Shetkari Sangathana, one of India’s main pro-technology and pro-reforms farmer organisations founded by the late Sharad Joshi, a well-known farm organiser.In an earlier comment to HT, he had said: “The government should consult farmers to examine the laws taking our suggestions, but the laws must not be repealed.”Bhupinder Singh Mann is a former Rajya Sabha member and a farm leader who currently chairs the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, a platform of farmers that is not part of the protests and whose members recently met agriculture minister Narendra Tomar recently, urging him not to repeal the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panellists-have-been-in-favour-of-new-laws-101610475858380.html
13-01-2021||India||If protected, Aravallis can support rich biodiversity: Study||New Delhi: A new study has found that the Aravalli hills in Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi can support rich biodiversity and wildlife if protected from further habitat fragmentation. The study found a total of 1,327 signs of 13 mammal species during two seasons—winter and summer -- of the survey conducted in 2019.Two species of large carnivores-- leopard and striped hyena -- as well as four species of herbivores, two primate species and seven species of meso-carnivores (eg fox, civets, mongoose etc) -- were found by the survey in the habitat.Sunil Harsana, a resident of Mangar village in Faridabad who has informally surveyed the Aravalli stretches in the region for years, and has recently taken up formal research to document biodiversity in the region, conducted the study under the Worldwide Fund for Nature’s small grants programme. The study was supported by the non-profit Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR).The findings of the study, a summary of which HT has seen, are significant because the region is threatened by massive infrastructure-led land use change and real estate projects. Haryana, where Gurugram and Faridabad are located, is among states with the lowest forest cover (3.62%) and yet rich wildlife areas in the region do not have legal protection.“Part of the Aravallis on the Haryana side are notified under section 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, and treated as legal forest as per Supreme Court orders ... The remaining portion, which includes the Mangar Bani sacred grove, are awaiting formal recognition as forest as per the dictionary meaning,” said Chetan Agarwal, an environment analyst and senior fellow at CEDAR. “Haryana needs a protected area under the Wild Life (Protection) Act adjacent to the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary so that the entire contiguous stretch can be protected.”This study is significant because it proves there is a critical wildlife area in the middle of a deeply urbanised region, said Ghazala Shahabuddin, senior fellow at CEDAR. We have had camera-trapped images of leopards from 2017, of striped hyenas and mongoose more recently all in the Gurugram Aravallis,” Shahabuddin added.Surprisingly, the Aravallis in both Faridabad and Gurugram were found to harbour a larger variety of mammals compared to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary on the Delhi-Haryana border, which is classified as a protected area and enjoys legal protection under the Wild Life (Protection) Act.The largest number of species was recorded in the Faridabad Aravallis (14), followed by the Gurugram Aravallis (11), Mangar Bani (10) and least in Asola Bhatti (9). Mangar Bani and the Gurugram Aravallis threw up a 30% higher encounter rates with animal signs per kilometre in comparison to Asola Bhatti and the Faridabad Aravallis.Two species---the leopard and the honey badger-- are classified as endangered under Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act while three of the meso-carnivore species found in the region are thought to be declining in the northern Aravallis, and in other parts of India. These are the golden jackal, jungle cat and ruddy mongoose, according to the study.The Aravaljis in Gurugram and Faridabad, along with the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in southeastern Delhi, form a contiguous block of forest habitat. A survey by the Wildlife Institute of India in the Haryana Aravalis, in 2017 had also shown significant presence of wildlife, including leopards, in the region.The findings of the present study covering over 200 sq.km of Aravallis underlines that this is the largest contiguous remnant of native dry deciduous forest and thorn scrub in the Delhi-Haryana National Capital Region.Harsana carried out the survey of mammals along 19 line transects, adding up to a total length of 81 km across the region. In addition, a single transect of 9.8 km was also surveyed separately in order to assess the potential impact of a proposed tarred road from the Bandhwari waste management plant to the Damdama lake via Mangar Bani. The road project was later abandoned.He documented both indirect signs (scat, dung, pugmarks, scratch marks and tracks) as well as direct sightings of all mammal species along the transects. Camera traps were also placed in a few locations where possible.“Among direct sightings there were lots of nilgai, jackals, mongoose, blue-naped hare and northern plains grey langur. I saw a lot of leopard signs including pugmarks and scat,” said Harsana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-protected-aravallis-can-support-rich-biodiversity-study-101610475857842.html
13-01-2021||India||Experts surprised by stay before validity test||Former Supreme Court (SC) judges and legal scholars have expressed surprise at the apex court’s order staying the implementation of the three farm laws and pointed to the absence of judicial precedents where a law was stayed without the legislation, prima facie, declared as having flouted constitutional norm or violated fundamental rights. This, they also warned, can become a precedent for other courts.On Tuesday, a three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, had said: “We are of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) KG Balakrishnan said, “Courts do not stay any legislation before deciding upon its constitutionality. Here, instead of first going into the constitutionality of the laws in question, the Court has stayed the three laws and delegated a committee with the task of making recommendations on it after hearing farmers. To my memory, this has never happened.”The former CJI recalled instances where consequences of a law are stayed, which is distinct from staying the law itself. “In the past, the Court has stayed the consequences of a legislation where it if of the view that allowing the same will lead to irreparable damage. But to stay a law, its constitutionality has to be tested, arguments heard and then declared to be null or void. Here the Court is yet to examine the constitutionality of the laws under challenge.”Former Supreme Court judge Justice Deepak Gupta agreed, and said, “The Court is right in saying that it is not powerless. It has power to stay a law upfront where it finds that a particular law could not be passed by a state or Centre on grounds of legislative competence. Also, a law can be ex-facie legal or unconstitutional. But in these circumstances, the Court has to give reasons for granting stay on a law. I did not find any reasons after reading the order passed by Court on Tuesday.”The only reason cited by the three-judge bench for staying the laws was to encourage farmers to come to the talking table. Asked about whether this was a suitable ground to stay a law, Justice Gupta said, “I do not think this can be the basis for staying a law. We do not make policies. Court is entrusted to decide the validity of a law based on Constitution and judicial precedents. Courts should not become a platform for political warfare. There are instances when Courts have stepped into legislative turf in public interest as in the Vishaka case. This is because we have powers to do complete justice under Article 142. This order does not make any reference to Article 142 nor does it state that the same should not be treated as precedent in future cases.”Legal scholar and advocate Gautam Bhatia said the task of the Supreme Court is to resolve legal disputes before it. “It is not to act as a super-mediator or a family elder. In particular, the SC — going by its own precedent — is only supposed to ‘stay’ a law if it finds that prima facie that law is unconstitutional. In the past, the SC has refused to stay laws where not only serious challenges were mounted to their constitutionality, but also where allowing status quo to continue directly benefited the government, which was able to change facts on the ground. Examples include Aadhaar, J&K Reorganisation, and electoral bonds, the latter two of which still remain in cold storage.” Bhatia added that while comparing the Court’s behaviour in those cases with its behaviour now, the “inconsistency is glaring”. “It leaves the Court open to credible accusations that it is acting more like a participant in political conflict rather than an adjudicator.”Alok Prasanna Kumar, senior resident fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy said, “The Court has not applied any reason to stay the laws and the reason cited has no bearing with any established legal principles. In the process, what it has created is more confusion and chaos. With today’s order, the legal effect of the three laws has been thrown into doubt since the laws haven’t been rubbed off. In such a situation, what happens to transactions which took place under the new laws and the decisions taken by state governments pursuant to adopting them? The order is silent on these aspects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-surprised-by-stay-before-validity-test-101610475257794.html
13-01-2021||India||Farm leaders refuse to appear before panel, stick to hard line||Farm unions protesting a set of agricultural laws on Tuesday spurned the Supreme Court’s proposed committee of four to scrutinise the three contentious legislation, saying they would not participate in its consultations because farmers wanted the laws repealed, not changed.The farm unions, who have been rigid about their stand despite several amendments proposed by the government to address some of their objections to the new legislation, said they unanimously decided to stay off the proposed panel on Monday as a “precautionary step” when the Supreme Court first proposed it.The top court named members to panel, all of who were “pro-reforms” and “pro-government”, all the more reason not to take part in its consultations, leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform for the protesting farm unions, told reporters.The Supreme Court on Tuesday put the implementation of the three farm laws approved by Parliament in September on hold, and set up a committee of experts to examine the laws “threadbare”.“During the course of the agitation, it became clear that the court wanted a committee. Our lawyers told the court that they would get back after taking instructions from us,” farm leader Darshan Pal told HT.“We wanted to steer clear of the panel because that is a way of diverting the main issue, which is a repeal of the laws. That’s why our lawyers were not present today in court,” he added.The decision of protesting farm unions not to cooperate with the SC-proposed panel only deepens the stalemate.Balbir Singh Rajewal, another farm leader, said the unions would go ahead with their planned tractor parade on Republic Day inside the national capital in a “peaceful way”.“A lot of lies are being spread that we will lay siege to Parliament or take over the Red Fort on Republic Day. Our programme will be peaceful. We will announce the complete modalities after January 15,” Rajewal said.The leaders said their Republic Day parade would commence after the official celebrations at the Capital Rajpath vista conclude.The farmers’ leaders, however, said they would participate in the next round of talks with the government slated for January 15.The court on Tuesday issued a notice to the farm leaders after a Delhi Police petition asked that they be restrained from marching into Delhi on January 26.Tens of thousands of farmers are camping on Delhi’s borders, protesting a set of laws to ease restrictions on farm trade, which they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Eight rounds of negotiations between the farmers and the Union government have failed to break the impasse.Rajewal said the four-members named for the committee were “pro-reforms and pro-government”.Jagmohan Singh, another farm leader, said: “The government is trying to end our movement. We want to tell the government that this is an indefinite movement and we will not go anywhere till the three new farm laws are repealed.”The Supreme Court could help farmers by taking suo moto cognisance and repealing the laws, said another farmer leader Raminder Singh Patiala.The farm leaders said they favoured direct negotiations with the government and not with an “external committee”.The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered its 48th day on Tuesday.“The Supreme Court’s formation of a committee and farmers’ refusal to take part in it not only exposes the trust deficit between the government and farmers but also the limitation of the judiciary’s role in arbitrating an essentially political and economic issue,” said Sudhir Panwar, a farm economist and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leaders-refuse-to-appear-before-panel-stick-to-hard-line-101610475197828.html
13-01-2021||India||Serum will provide 50-60 million vials to India by February: Poonawalla||Serum Institute of India (SII) chief executive Adar Poonawalla on Tuesday said that even as his firm is providing 11 million doses of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca produced Covishield vaccine in India in the first phase, there are plans to provide 50-60 million vials either by January or February.Early Tuesday, the first consignment of the vaccines in three trucks rolled out of the SII facility at Hadapsar in eastern part of city for transportation to various locations across the country. The doses were taken to 12 cities through flights in the day and later to Mumbai via road.“Currently, 11 million doses of the vaccine are being rolled out across the country and there are plans to provide 50 to 60 more doses by January-February. We have given priority to India. We will provide as many doses as the nation demands. Rest of the vaccines, we will export. We are getting request from Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Africa, and there are COVAX partners also,” said Poonawalla, a 39-year-old businessman who joined the world’s largest vaccine manufacturing firm that his father founded in 2001.As per the purchase order released by the government of India, another 45 million doses are scheduled to be bought by the government by April this year.Poonawalla while interacting with reporters at his facility said that the real challenge lies in taking the vaccine to the “common man, to the vulnerable groups of people and to healthcare workers”.“Our trucks left the SII facility early morning and now the vaccine is being distributed in the entire country. This is a proud and historic moment as scientists, experts and all other stakeholders took great efforts while making this vaccine in less than a year,” he said.Poonawalla said that the SII has offered the vaccine to the Centre at a special price of ₹200. “This is one of the most affordable vaccines in the world and we are offering it to the government at a special price just to support the Prime Minister’s vision and to support the aam aadami (common man) of our country,” he added.He also said that once SII gets the requisite permission, the vaccine will be made available in the private market at the cost ₹1,000. Poonawalla further said that SII is not only providing the vaccine in India, “but it is also committed to providing it to other countries who are looking at India at this point”.Covishield is developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and manufactured by the SII.A puja was performed before the three temperature controlled trucks rolled out of the Serum Institute gates shortly before 5am and moved towards the Pune airport, about 15 km away, from where the vaccines were flown across India.Poonawalla further said, “The government of India will buy the vaccine at the rate of ₹200 per dose for 10 crore doses, and thereafter, the cost of the vaccine will go up. The vaccine we are offering to the government will be given to the common man, the poor, vulnerable groups and healthcare workers free of cost.”He also added that the SII’s production capacity is bigger than the world and that is why the company is under the maximum pressure (to manufacture) it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/serum-will-provide-50-60-million-vials-to-india-by-february-poonawalla-101610468056812.html
13-01-2021||India||Young blood needed to uproot dynasty politics, says PM Modi||Calling dynasty politics the “new tyranny” in democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked young Indians to join politics in large numbers to uproot this “tyranny” and “help reshape the country’s destiny”.Modi’s comments, renewing his attack on political dynasties, also come months before assembly elections in four states in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is pitted against the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) . All three parties, particularly the Congress, have been accused of harbouring family interests in their politics by the BJP.Addressing the National Youth Parliament 2021 here on Tuesday, the prime minister said, “There are some changes still pending. Political dynasty is the biggest enemy of democracy. It’s a challenge that needs to be uprooted. The days of people winning elections on the basis of their surnames are over.”Also Read: National Youth Day 2021: History and significance of the dayTo be sure, this is not the first time the prime minister or his party has spoken against dynasty politics. It’s been a key plank to confront the Gandhi family’s leadership in the Congress and accuse another key rival, Trinamool Congress, of favouritism over the role of Abhishek Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew.“This political dynasty is a new tyranny that increases the burden of incompetence on the country. It also promotes family and self interests instead of nation first. Dynasty politics is also a major reason behind political and social corruptions. They think if their ancestors are not caught, they too can breathe easily. They see such examples in their own houses. So, these people have no respect or fear of law,” the prime minister said as he virtually addressed participants, mostly students, at the youth parliament.This is the first time the event was organised in the iconic Central Hall of the Parliament.Modi called upon young Indians to become agents of change. “The responsibility to change this situation is of the youth.Join politics in large numbers with the idea to work for India.” He also said that as long as common people don’t join politics, the culture of dynastic politics will continue.The prime minister maintained that people of this country have now started supporting those who are honest and performing—seen by many as an oblique reference to his own government. “Performance and honesty have become necessary conditions for Indian politics. Those with a legacy of corruption now bear the burden of corruption. They are unable to come out of it. The country supports honest people. Now, lawmakers also understand that their CVs need to be strong and balance sheets of work should be foolproof.”He said in earlier days, family members looked down upon someone if he or she wanted to join politics but things have changed now. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, the prime minister said, “Your next 25-26 years are also important for India. Young people should come forward and become India’s destiny-makers. Politics needs young people. New ideas, new energy, new enthusiasm, new ambition is needed.”Modi also said he will tweet some of the speeches made during the youth parliament from his own Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-asks-young-indians-to-join-politics-to-uproot-dynasty-politics-101610447747286.html
13-01-2021||India||Mumbai: Sena youth wing stage protests against BJP MLA for ‘shielding’ those who attacked policeman||Shiv Sena youth wing, Yuva Sena, staged an agitation outside Sena Bhavan on Tuesday against BJP legislator Ram Kadam for allegedly shielding party workers who assaulted a police constable. Three BJP workers were travelling on one bike on Monday when they collided with other vehicle at Powai. When constable Nitin Khairmode tried to take them to the police station, they allegedly assaulted him. Of the trio, two managed to escape while one has been arrested and booked for assaulting a public servant.Later, Kadam reportedly intervened and through a phone call, told the police that the accused were young and police action might ruin their future. An audio clip of the purported conversation has gone viral on social media.According to Yuva Sena core committee member Samadhan Sarvankar, their agitation is to express support to the police fraternity. “We want to send a message that such attacks will not be tolerated. The state government needs to take action against Ram Kadam as he is demanding their release. He is sending a message that you can bash up policemen and he will secure your release,” said Sarvankar.However, Kadam has condemned the incident. “I have no connection with the attack...I was not even in Mumbai during the incident and the Yuva Sena is politicising the matter by dragging my name into it. In fact, I would have slapped the attackers myself,” he said, while talking to media.The Congress has called the legislator a habitual offender. “He has attacked policemen twice... This reflects the BJP culture,” said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Kadam is a spokesperson of the BJP and has been critical of the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Kadam started his political career in Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) as a legislator in 2009 and joined BJP in 2014. He has been elected twice on BJP ticket from Ghatkopar (West) constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-sena-youth-wing-to-stage-protests-against-bjp-mla-for-shielding-those-who-attacked-policeman-101610432925661.html
