Let the farmers give a deep thought to where the agitation is headed,’’ Khattar said referring to the “sad events” at the Red Fort.The CM said the Council of Ministers, in a specially convened meeting, has appealed to all farmers, particularly those from Haryana, to return to their homes. He said that unsavoury events on Tuesday deserved to be condemned in the strongest words. “Democracy offers space for dissent and differences. But no Indian, whatever the difference of opinion or difference of approach, can ever justify the action of hosting a flag other than the National Flag on the ramparts of the Red Fort. Our martyrs gave their life and blood to preserve and protect the nation for all of us, not to make a spectacle of it,’’ the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-organisations-not-in-control-of-agitation-now-haryana-cm-101611684962579.html

26-01-2021||India||Nagaland Governor puts NSCN in line of fire in Republic Day speech||Nagaland Governor RN Ravi on Tuesday put the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) in his line of fire saying the Centre’s initiative to resolve the Naga political issue was yet to bear fruit due to “unrealistic intransigence of some people” who are unwilling to forsake the politics by gun.In his Republic Day address at the Civil Secretariat Plaza in Kohima, Ravi who is also the central government’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks said people of the state have been unable to reap optimum benefit because some extra constitutional entities in the guise of espousing the Naga national cause have queered the pitch for the people and the government, keeping peace and progress at bay.Without naming the NSCN-IM, Ravi said, “The latest initiative since the last 24 years could not fructify as yet due to unrealistic intransigence of some people who are unwilling to forsake the politics by gun.”The governor’s remark comes against the backdrop of an impasse in the negotiations on the Naga political issue between the Centre and the NSCN-IM over the latter’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution. The NSCN-IM has been holding peace talks with the government of India since 1997.The politics by gun has fragmented the Naga society, pitting neighbours against each other and tribes against tribes, it did not even spare the Church for their honest initiatives to usher peace in this land, Ravi said.“The unrealistic, self-destructive and divisive politics has exhausted the people of Nagaland. The primary stakeholders have made their positions abundantly clear that the era of gun must end without further delay and enduring peace must be restored. They have made it clear that unresolved issues, if any, be pursued through dialogue post-settlement,” he asserted.Towards this, he appreciated the initiative of the state government in holding a comprehensive meeting with broad spectrum tribal and civil society on October 15, 2020 that reiterated the popular sentiment that the armed groups must come together to facilitate “One-Solution” for the sake of the people.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi loves the Naga people and holds them in high esteem. He is committed to restoring an enduring peace in the region with utmost regard to the wishes of the people. He is anxious to ensure that while India is taking giant leaps to the Moon and Mars, our people of Nagaland are not left behind,” the governor said.He went on to say that there must be no doubt in any quarter that Nagaland is and shall remain an integral part of India“On this auspicious occasion, I earnestly urge those friends who are still standing between the people and the peace to see the writings on the wall. The people of Nagaland and peace can no longer be kept a hostage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-governor-puts-nscn-in-line-of-fire-in-republic-day-speech-101611680938160.html
26-01-2021||India||BJP leaders meet to discuss violence in Delhi, farmers' agitation||Senior leaders of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) went into a huddle on Tuesday to discuss the implications of the violence that broke out in the national capital. Farmers protesting against the farm laws broke police barricades to reach Red Fort where they hoisted a flag sacred to the Sikhs. The party also underlined that there are similarities in how the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the farm laws have unfolded.Party chief JP Nadda, general secretary BL Santhosh and few other senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP and party general secretary Arun Singh, were present for the meeting at the BJP headquarters, said a person aware of the developments.The RSS also condemned the violence. In a statement, RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said, “The violence and disturbances unleashed in Delhi today on the sacred Republic Day is extremely painful and deplorable. Especially the unfortunate act at the historic Red Fort, it is an insult to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for freedom and national integrity. The RSS appeals to all countrymen to rise above political and ideological differences and strive for peace as a priority.”Also read: Explained - As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers wantNo details were shared about the meeting, although a functionary aware of the details said the party leaders see similarities in Tuesday’s protests that broke out within hours of the Republic Day parade, with the protests that engulfed the city at the same time last year when protestors gathered to demand the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act.Last year, when then US president Donald Trump was in India, protests broke out between pro and anti-CAA groups in the national capital leading to over dozen of deaths and heavy casualties.A senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the protests have “corroborated” what the party has been alleging— that the protests have been infiltrated by “anti-national elements”.The functionary quoted above said there is a sense in the party that the protests are being fuelled by those with “vested interests” and the government’s outreach efforts are being “stonewalled”.“The timing of the protests, the way the so-called farmers have reacted to the government’s outreach is indicative of it being the handiwork of those with vested interests. Why do they refuse to interact with the committee appointed by the Supreme Court?” said the functionary.While the opposition parties, including the Congress, have alleged that the farm laws were passed without adequate discussion in Parliament and the government did not heed the demand to send the bills to a select committee, the BJP claims that the opposition is creating deliberate misinformation about the laws just as it did with the CAA, which only seeks to fast-track citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbourhood.“When the CAA was passed we asked the protestors to show even one person whose citizenship rights had been taken away. Similarly, now we are ready to argue on the merits of the farm laws to prove it does not take away anyone’s land. But a concerted misinformation campaign has been started about the farm laws just as it was about the CAA,” said BJP’s national spokesperson RP Singh.He said the blame for prolonging the farmer’s protest and the violence that erupted on Tuesday rests with the “lumpen left and the ultra-left intellectuals”.The protests come at a time when the party has begun preparations for electoral battles in four states—Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala- and the Union territory of Pudducherry. The BJP has been facing flak for the farm laws that the protesting farmers have dubbed as pro-corporate and for being unable to break the logjam. It was also accused of dubbing the protesting farmers as secessionists.BJP leaders condemned the violence that broke out. Former national general secretary P Murlidhar Rao said the violence is “shameful and not acceptable”.“In Indian democracy u can have a mobilisation challenging govt on policies..sometimes it may appear as humiliating for d leaders who’re at helms but u can't have a situation where its challenging d sovereignty of country n questioning d spirit of Indian Republic,” he tweeted.Ram Madhav, also a former national general secretary, attacked the Congress for fostering the protests. “After peddling all sorts of falsehoods about farm law reforms n provoking farmers into aggressive action, the Indian versions of Trump like Rahul n ilk are now demonstrating pseudo-indignation at violence. They r equally responsible for whatever happened in Delhi today,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-meet-to-discuss-violence-in-delhi-farmers-agitation-101611680457433.html

Police personnel tried to control the mob by baton-charging them and lobbing tear gas shells.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/200-artists-including-kids-rescued-after-being-stranded-near-red-fort-for-two-hours-101611678927985.html

The message is clear that the country's people are anguished with the government. In such a situation, the Modi government will also have to shun arrogance and head the pleas of farmers," the AICC general secretary said in a statement."Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to shed his arrogance and tread the path of 'Rajdharma'. This is the true message of the 72nd Republic Day. Without any further delay, all three anti-farming black laws will have to be withdrawn. This is also the call of 62 crore 'annadatas' of the country," he said.The Congress leader also hailed the farm unions for dissociating from the day's violent incidents and hoped that they would follow the path of peace and non-violence to achieve their goal."Today, the Congress party and the entire country is pained by the violence and unruly incidents in Delhi. There is no place for such incidents in a democracy," he added."The agitators must keep their goal in mind. Non-violence and peace have remained the biggest strength of this farmer agitation. We sincerely hope that this farmer-labourer alliance will pledge to remain committed to a peaceful and non-violent struggle for the repeal of the three three anti-agriculture black laws," Surjewala said.He also criticised the government for holding 10 rounds of talks and yet not resolving the deadlock."Is it right for the prime minister to not give a healing touch despite the death of 175 farmers? Is the Modi government's policy of tiring out the farmers good for the country," Surjewala asked.A tractor parade by the farmer unions meant to highlight their demands dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital during the day as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult -- hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's tricolour.Tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in multiple places, leading to chaos in well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters. One person was killed and several were injured in the clashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-place-for-such-incidents-in-democracy-cong-on-violence-during-tractor-rally-101611677629246.html

26-01-2021||India||Violence by certain elements in Delhi unacceptable, says Captain Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that the violence perpetrated by certain elements during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital was unacceptable and urged all genuine farmers to immediately vacate Delhi and return to the city’s borders where they had been protesting peacefully for the past two months.The chief minister also ordered a high alert in Punjab amid the tension and violence in Delhi and directed Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta to ensure that law and order in the state is not disturbed at any cost.Expressing grave concern over the situation, Capt. Amarinder said the violence was apparently triggered by some people who violated the rules laid down for the tractor rally through mutual agreement between the Delhi Police and the Kisan Unions. It was unfortunate that these elements disturbed the peaceful agitation of the farmers, he said.He also condemned the incidents that took place at the historic Red Fort and some other key points of the national capital.Pointing out that the major farmer leaders had already and categorically dissociated themselves from the violence, Captain Amarinder said the agitating farmers should immediately vacate the national capital and get back to their camps at the borders, and continue to engage with the Centre to resolve the crisis over the farm laws.“Shocking scenes in Delhi. The violence by some elements is unacceptable. It'll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. Kisan leaders have disassociated themselves & suspended #TractorRally. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi & return to borders,” he tweeted.The chief minister called upon the farmers to continue to exercise the remarkable restraint with which they had conducted their peaceful protests for the past two months at Delhi’s borders, and in Punjab prior to that. Pointing out that peace had been the hallmark of their agitation, and the reason for the support they had received from across India and the world, he stressed the need for law and order to be maintained at all costs during the democratic protests by the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-by-certain-elements-in-delhi-unacceptable-says-captain-amarinder-101611673821763.html

I cannot say at the moment who did it and who did not, but prima facie it looks like it has been done by the people that we kept out of the farmers’ protest," Yadav told a TV channel."I appealed continuously that we stick to whatever route was decided and not deviate. Only if the movement goes peacefully, we will be able to win," said Yadav, who has been supporting the farmers' agitation against the new agriculture laws.Tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in multiple places, leading to chaos in well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters.Farmer leaders, who have been spearheading the protest at the national capital’s border points to demand a repeal of the farm laws, distanced themselves from the protests that had taken such an unseemly turn and threatened to shift public sympathy from their movement.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, alleged that some "antisocial elements" infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feel-ashamed-and-take-responsibility-yogendra-yadav-on-protest-violence-101611671662220.html

The violence started after the farmer organisations deviated from the path decided by the authorities for tractor rally. They pushed towards central Delhi, breaking barricades and facing water cannons.Some groups of farmers also stormed the Red Fort and hoisted their own flag. In the clashes at the 17th century monument, the policemen were attacked with sticks, leaving some of them injured. By evening, however, these protesters had started returning to their sit-in sites at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders.At least 19 people were taken to two Delhi hospitals following violence during the tractor rally. Most of them suffered minor injuries and were in need of first aid, according to doctors from the two hospitals.The Delhi Police registered four FIRs on Tuesday in connection with the violence. "Three FIRs were registered in east district and one in Shahdara district," news agency PTI quoted a police official as saying.According to Delhi Police, 86 of its personnel were injured in the violence, news agency PTI reported. Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Police, said legal action will be taken against those who assaulted the police personnel."The protesters violated conditions fixed for the rally. The farmers began tractor rally before the scheduled time, they also resorted to violence and vandalism," Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal said.The SKM had earlier condemned and regretted the violence that took place in the national capital. It claimed that some "anti-social" elements infiltrated their "peaceful" protest on Republic Day."Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength and that any violation would hurt the movement," the SKM had said in a statement, adding that it dissociates itself from those who have resorted to violence.The farmers, who have been protesting against three farm laws of the Centre, held the tractor rally to demand the repeal of new acts. Instead of following the marked route, they forcibly entered central Delhi by removing police barricades.The three laws against which these farmers have been protesting since November 26 are: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-body-samyukt-kisan-morcha-calls-off-tractor-rally-with-immediate-effect-101611671213478.html

The land was allotted to UPSCWB in compliance with the Supreme Court directives in the Ayodhya title dispute case in which the apex court, on November 9, 2019, paved the way for construction of Ram temple at the disputed site.“I believe there is no better way than to start the project by planting saplings on the five-acre land. The plantation was carried out in the area of the project meant to be developed as a green area. The area will have plants and trees from all different geographical regions of India and from different parts of the world in order to create awareness about the imminent threat of climate change,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which has been set up by UPSCWB to look after the construction of the Dhannipur project.Senior members of the board along with the members of the IICF hoisted the flag at 8.30 am on the 5 acre land in Dhannipuur village. The flag hoisting was followed by plantation drive where members and trustees of IICF planted saplings.On December 19, the trust had released the blueprint of the mosque and other structures designed by Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow-based architect and town planner, whom the trust has hired to design the mosque that would come up in Dhannipur in place of the Babri Masjid that was demolished in 1992.Akhtar is the founder dean of the Faculty of Architecture at Jamia Milia University, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhyas-dhannipur-mosque-project-launched-with-unfurling-of-tricolour-on-rday-101611667926019.html
26-01-2021||India||Explained: As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers want||The farmers protesting against the three laws passed by Parliament unleashed a fury on Delhi's roads on Tuesday.Also Read: Amit Shah reviews situation in DelhiThe farmers have been protesting at various border points near Delhi for more than two months. The anger finally spilled on the streets, as the police tried to stop their march towards central Delhi.So what exactly do these farmers want?As far as negotiations with the government are concerned, the agenda of the farmers is to focus the discussions only on ways in which the new laws can be scrapped. The government has, however, refused to roll back the pro-reform laws farmers say will hurt their livelihoods.ALSO WATCH | How farmers stormed Red Fort on tractors, hoisted flag from its ramparts﻿It has instead offered to hold the implementation of the three contentious laws for 18 months. The government has asked the farmers to reconsider the offer which Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said is the "best offer".The Supreme Court had on January 12 ordered to keep the three laws in abeyance and ordered the formation of a committee, but its intervention backfired as farmer unions alleged that the panel is “pro-government”.Out of the three central laws, the primary area of concern for farmers is the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, or FPTC Act in short. The law allows buying and selling of farm produce outside the APMC mandis without any tax. These regulated market places are being used by the farmers for years to sell their produce. But if the system is scrapped, they will find it difficult to negotiate with large buyers - hence putting them at the mercy of large corporate houses.The government, on its part, says that this act will give more freedom to farmers to choose who to sell their produce to. It has termed the three laws historic saying they will change the way agriculture trade is done.Also Read: At least 19 in hospital after violence at tractor rally in DelhiA related issue is that of the Minimum Support Price or MSP - the price at which the government purchases farm produce directly from the farmers. The farmers say that once they stop selling in APMCs, the big corporate houses may not honour the MSP. So, they want the government to make MSP a legal right.A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India (UPIASI) said that farmers in fully regulated agriculture markets in Punjab got 30 per cent more price for their produce in 2018-19 than those in totally unregulated markets in Bihar and partially regulated ones in Odisha, terming MSP as only risk-management instrument available for farmers. (Click here to read the full study)However, there is a need to consider the economic aspect before taking a decision on the MSP. The government sets MSPs for 23 crops, but effectively, it is applicable only in cases of wheat and rice as these are bought in sufficiently large quantities. MSPs are an assurance that the government will intervene if market rates fall below that threshold. And it was a good step in cases where India faced acute food shortages. But the laws to will have to be different while dealing with surpluses.Moreover, higher MSPs could upend the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation targets, hurting economic growth. Mandatory MSPs will also render India’s agri-exports non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices.The government, meanwhile, says that it is not right to include in the agenda the demand related to MSP as it is out of the purview of the new farm laws. It highlighted the plight of the small and marginal farmers and said they will benefit from the new reforms in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-as-tractor-rally-turns-violent-in-delhi-what-farmers-want-101611667569088.html
26-01-2021||India||105-year-old organic farmer from Coimbatore is celebrating her Padma Shri award||Eleven people from various fields in Tamil Nadu have been conferred the Padma awards. Among them and possibly the oldest living recipients from the list is 105-year-old Papammal from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu who has been awarded the prestigious Padma Shri.Papammal runs her own organic farm spread across 2.5 acres of land where she has been cultivating a variety of millets, pulses, vegetables and corn for over nine decades. “I’m very happy,” Papammal said over the phone as she was commuting to the Coimbatore airport to meet DMK leader MK Stalin. She joined the party several years ago.From an early age, Papammal alias Rangammal was interested in agricultural practices. She was born in 1914, lost her parents at an early age and was brought up by her paternal grandmother in Thekkampatti where she continues to live. She would not have studied beyond class 2, say her family members.Papammal lost her husband a decade ago and has three daughters, three grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and lives with five members of her family.“Paati is a boon for us,” said her grandson R Balasubramanian who is also a farmer. “Of course, I learnt everything from her. I’ve seen her work on the farm since I was a child and from class 10 until now I’m farming,” said Balasubramanian, 50.Also read: Amit Shah orders deployment of additional paramilitary forces in DelhiPapaammal saved money by selling snacks and beverages from a provisional shop she inherited from her grandmother. With the money, she bought 10 acres of land to cultivate pulses and corn. “There has never been a day when she hasn’t worked,” says her second niece R Kamalam who was accompanying her to the airport.With age, she sold a major portion of her land and retained 2.5 acres. The centenarian’s day starts at 5.30 in the morning and by 6 am she is on the field working until the afternoon. She had been associated with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in its education and other activities. She also had a stint as a councillor of the Thekkampatti panchayat in 1959. She also attends several village functions where they seek her blessings.The past year, however, slowed her down a bit as she developed wheezing and has remained indoors due to the Covid-19 pandemic while her family members help with her farm.According to her family, Papaammal’s active lifestyle and food habits keep her healthy. “Her favourite is mutton biryani and she takes her food with lots of greens and vegetables. She eats all her meals hot on a leaf and doesn’t use plates,” says Balasubramanian. “She sticks to hot water and avoids tea and coffee.”Though she received the information from Delhi on Monday afternoon, it was formally announced at night. Their home witnessed a beeline of visitors, including the media and politicians, since the announcement. “Her celebration is being with so many people,” says Kamalam.The family is planning a date to organise a formal celebration for her. Balasubramanian says that he brings up his two children with her as the role model to be active and work hard. “Our inspiration is at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/105yearold-organic-farmer-from-coimbatore-is-celebrating-her-padma-shri-award-101611667462021.html

He also said that the government of India did not take the protesting farmers seriously. Pawar’s remarks came after a group of farmers deviated from the proposed route of tractor rally and marched towards central Delhi, resulting in clashes with the police in many areas.“Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh held protest in a disciplined manner but govt didn't take them seriously. As restraint ended, the tractor march was taken out. Centre's responsibility was to keep law & order in control but they failed,” news agency ANI quoted Pawar as saying.The NCP chief also said that the protesting farmers had grown angry as the Centre did not fulfill their responsibility. “Nobody will support whatever happened today but the reason behind it cannot be ignored either. Those sitting calmly grew angry, the Centre didn't fulfill its responsibility. Govt should act maturely & take the right decision,” he added.Also read: At least 19 in hospital after violence at tractor rally in DelhiAppealing to the protesting farmers to return peacefully, Pawar assured that the opposition supports the cause of the farmers. "The way the agitation handled today is regrettable. We all sitting in Opposition support the farmers' cause and I appeal -- now you (farmers) should go back to your respective villages peacefully and should not give any opportunity to the govt to blame you," he said. Pawar, a former Union agriculture minister, addressed a protest in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan on Monday where he slammed the central government and the governor of Maharashtra for their behaviour towards the farmers. “The BJP-led NDA passed the laws without any discussion in parliament and in just one day on the basis of the majority. The Modi government has attempted to uproot the farmers through these laws, but the farmers have the power to uproot political leaders who have been acting arrogantly,” he said.Several other political leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, condemned the violence and urged the central government to repeal the farm laws and restore law and order in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-responsibility-to-maintain-law-and-order-it-failed-sharad-pawar-101611666116948.html

They said that the projects of the board were not “unanimously” passed and that the minutes have not reflected the objections they had raised. In a letter addressed to the Central Empowered Committee which is currently examining a petition against the clearances granted to the projects, the members who include Rajendra Kerkar, Arnold Noronha, Parag Ragnekar, Amrut Singh among others, wrote, “We were not given any opportunity to contribute to the decision making in a reasoned way and most of the concerns raised by us about the projects during the meeting were also ignored. In fact, few of us had written to the Member Secretary of the Board requesting him to record our objections in the minutes of the Board’s meeting held on 2nd December 2019. However no such inclusions corrections were made by him while escalating the minutes of the Board along with the wildlife clearance recommendation before the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SC-NBWL). Ultimately even the SC-NBWL recommended all three projects on 4th April 2020.”Also Read: Goa nearing complete normalcy after Covid-19 outbreak: Governor KoshyariDuring that meeting the Board granted approval to the three projects viz. the doubling of railway track in Castle Rock- Kulem-Kalay-Margao section of South Western Railway involving diversion of 120.875ha, four laning of existing NH-4A in Goa involving diversion of 31.015ha (Wildlife Sanctuary 6.75ha & National Park 24.265ha) and laying of LILO Narendra 400KV transmission line involving 11.546ha within the protected areas of Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park. The cumulative forest land that is to be diverted for the three projects inside the protected area is 163.43ha while the cumulative forest land required for such projects outside the protected area is believed to be another 200ha of forest land. The members also claimed that the agenda of the meeting was only handed over at the beginning of the meeting, thus giving them no time or opportunity to either understand the veracity of projects on wildlife or to form any reasoned opinion on their merits/demerits.“During the meeting there was no scope for meaningful debate or discussion, inadequate deliberation on the mitigation measures, no opportunity provided to each member to be heard and the haste adopted to simply get over the Agenda items and put rubber stamp recommendation on the wildlife clearance proposals concerning the three linear infrastructure projects. Even our signature on the attendance sheet of the meeting were considered and portrayed as deemed approval for the projects,” the members stated. “The Member Secretary who is also the Chief Wildlife of the State of Goa was overly enthusiastic about getting the projects approved as the Central government has already approved them. Surprisingly, he took it upon himself to present the project proposals to the members instead of the project proponents,” the letter stated. The exhaustive letter has also questioned the Board’s refusal to examine the projects comprehensively and cumulatively. “The three proposed linear projects will further fragment the already fragmented area, most of which is pristine and virgin in nature, However. Wildlife clearance was sought for every individual project to dilute the figurative requirement of diversion forest within the same protected area network. Thus, the impact of these projects, especially the cumulative impact on biodiversity, does not find mention,” the members said, adding that the State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire state. “There lacks a strategy with regard to these projects as random mono-culture afforestation will not be able to compensate the loss of forestry species of the Western Ghats,” the members said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-infra-projects-members-of-wildlife-board-allege-incorrect-minutes-101611661463866.html

Among other feats, he was conferred honorary doctorate by UK-based World Record University for depicting the Ramayana on handloom woven saree and entered the Guinness Book for weaving the longest saree.“At present I am working with around 5,000 artisans, out of which around 2,000 are women. They have found a way to earn their living and have become self-reliant. The actual recipients of this award are these artisans and I would thank them too,” he said.“Ours is a weaver family for the last 89 years. Now that I have received the award I would like to work more and engage more artisans and make them self-reliant,” he added.His family was forced to migrate to India from Tangail in Bangladesh in the late 1960s.

Farmers' leaders described it as a successful agitation and said they were able to send a message that state farmers are united against the farm laws.“The Mumbai agitation sent a message to the agitating farmers at Delhi borders that we are firmly behind them and will not relent till these regressive farm laws are withdrawn,” said Ajit Navale, convenor, Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) which organised this protest. “We will soon announce the next phase of agitation which will continue till these laws are not withdrawn,” he added.He said farmers were disappointed that Maharashtra Governor Bhagat SinghKoshyari did not meet them and their march was stopped midway to Raj Bhavan, the residence of the Governor. “We tore our memorandum signalling our protest,” said Navale.NCP chief and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat addressed the meeting on Monday condemning the central government for introducing the farm laws which they accused only enslaved the farmers.Prashant Sonavane, 56, who travelled for 12 hours from Buldhana, owns a 2 acre land in which he cultivates cotton crop. “Our agitation was successful as farmers across the state came together against these laws which will only snatch away our land and offer them to multinational companies on a platter,” said Sonavane.Similarly Yeshwant Malke, 50, regretted that Koshyari did not meet them. “It seems that the Governor was not ready to help us in this genuine demand. However our agitation in Mumbai helped to spread awareness about our struggle and we are going back satisfied,” said Malke.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since late November last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-speaker-present-as-protesting-farmers-hoist-tricolour-in-mumbai-101611658651901.html

She has now been conferred with Padma Shri, the country’s fourth-highest award, in recognition of her work.“Congratulations to all for it would not have been possible for me alone to save and rescue 125 people mostly women from getting killed on charges of witchcraft and partially rehabilitate them to live normal lives. I never even dreamt of getting such an honour in my life as only celebrities and film stars used to get such an award. I thank Narendra Modi for finding people like me from the remotest corners of the country for such national honour,” said Mahato.Also read | Assam banker known for empowering women gets Padma ShriShe added the award has strengthened her resolve to fight against the practice. “...17 women and men came to me after escaping murderous assaults on January 1 from Odisha on charges of practicing witchcraft. The police station in-charge there pleaded his inability to act in such socially volatile matter...” she said.Mahato was married off at 13 in 1978 when she was in Class 3. Her life changed completely in March 1995 when some of her neighbours attempted to rape her accusing her of practising black magic after a girl fell sick in their neighbourhood. “Panchayat fined me ₹500. Six months later, the villagers beat me and tried to kill me. I fled,” she said. Mahato rushed to the local lawmaker’s house for help and shelter but in vain. She then approached the police, who demanded ₹10, 000 for lodging a case.Bureaucrat Nidhi Khare helped her by sending her to an NGO working to root out witch-hunting practice in Jharkhand. “The then West Singhbhum deputy commissioner Amir Khare helped me set up anti-witch-hunting consultation centre, which has so far saved 125 so-called witches,” said Mahato.A documentary was made on her struggles in 1996 and how she was fighting the menace and helping others. Bollywood film Kala Sach – The Dark Truth was made on her life in 2014.According to National Crime Records Bureau data, 575 women have been lynched after branding them witches in Jharkhand between 2001 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-woman-gets-padma-shri-for-saving-women-branded-as-witches-101611658823088.html

26-01-2021||India||Assam banker known for empowering women gets Padma Shri||Lakhimi Baruah’s mother passed away during her birth and her father died when she was in her early teens. Her relatives raised her despite hardships and made her realise the importance of financial security, especially for women. The difficult circumstances made Baruah stronger and on Monday, she was named as one of the recipients of this year’s Padma Shri awards in recognition of her efforts to financially empower the Assamese women. Baruah is the founder of Konoklata Mahila Urban Cooperative Bank that has provided credit to thousands of women and made a positive change to their lives in Jorhat, Sivasagar. and Golaghat districts.Also read | Tamil Nadu’s Padma awardees include Balasubrahmanyam“I am very encouraged and inspired by the honour. It is a recognition of the difficult and arduous task that we have taken up and been pursuing for years. I want to express my gratitude to all who have been part of this journey and hope we reach more women.”Baruah understood first-hand how women from very poor backgrounds faced problems because of lack of money or a place to safely keep their earnings during her involvement with various women groups and her work in a cooperative bank.“Most women were unaware of how banks functioned. My work in a cooperative bank made me realise that these women needed a bank that they could access easily, save their earnings and take easy loans when in need. That is how the idea to set up the bank came.”Despite no specialised knowledge of banking, Baruah applied to the Reserve Bank of India in 1990 to set up a cooperative bank for women. The approval came in 1998 and the bank was set up two years later in Jorhat with an initial investment of ₹8.45 lakh and 1,500 women members. The bank employs only women and now has four branches, 21 regular employees, and 45,000 account holders, mostly women.“Women can open accounts with us with zero balance or as low as ₹20. Till now, we have given loans to over 8,000 women and around 1,200 women self-help-groups. Our turnover for the last year was nearly ₹16 crore and a profit of ₹30 lakh,” said Baruah. “We operate with the deposits of very poor women. We hope after this recognition, the government schemes or works related to MP or MLA local area development funds are also done through our bank so that we are able to expand and help more women.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-banker-known-for-empowering-women-gets-padma-shri-101611658223113.html

Some vested interests have been trying to whip up passions by instigating and resorting to unsavory incidents, which are crude, meaningless and are laced with ulterior motives,” he regretted.He said desecration, vandalism, arson and all such acts of insanity have no place in our society and those responsible for the aberrations will be dealt with firmly by all means to restore peace and harmony in the state.“We have to respect all faiths and that is what our tradition has been. The government is very firm in safeguarding the social fabric, which is spun by the colorful yarn of various faiths that reflects unity in diversity,” he said.The Governor appreciated the efforts of the state government in handling the Covid-19 pandemic in the state which had passed through testing times in the last one year. With vaccination rolling out 10 days back, the run has been smooth and the government has put in place the necessary infrastructure, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-governor-s-balanced-development-pitch-points-to-3-capitals-plan-101611653777062.html

At the break of dawn, children gather around the modest home of the 102-year-old man to learn Odia alphabets and a bit of mathematics. Elders who could not attend school during their childhood come to his home at 6 pm to learn how to sign their names.As a young boy, being sent to his maternal uncle’s place in Jajpur district helped him to study till class 7. Soon after his uncle arranged a job for him at Cuttack. But his father was reluctant and made him stay with him to help him out in farming. India was still not a free country then.Prusty took it upon himself the job of spreading literacy. “I would find children loafing around. They were all illiterate. Since I did not have much work, I started teaching them under a tree. There was no school then. Initially, I had to run after them, but soon they started coming,” he said.What endeared him to others was his refusal to charge money from his students. Even more than 70 years after he started teaching, he does not take money. “I liked children and teaching. I wanted the kids to grow up and become good human beings. Money was never my concern" said Prusty, who claims to have taught at least three generations from the same family.Kantira now has schools and colleges nearby, but villagers still send their kids to Prusty for learning the alphabets and arithmetic. “I will continue teaching the children as long as my health permits,” said Prusty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teacher-for-7-decades-102-year-old-class-7-pass-out-is-padma-shri-winner-101611653287893.html

Working on tips from co-workers, acquaintances, and friends, agents have tracked down driver's license photos to match their faces with those captured on camera in the building.In some cases, authorities got records from Facebook or Twitter to connect their social media accounts to their email addresses or phone numbers. In others, agents used records from license plate readers to confirm their travels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-me-rioters-flaunt-involvement-in-capitol-siege-on-social-media-101611652105942.html

The state police had a different approach in different districts and varying degrees of what was allowed for the rally. While the rallies ended peacefully by afternoon in a few districts, there was a tussle between police and farmers in the delta districts. In Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts, there was heavy police deployment, and a scuffle broke out between the police and the farmers who started the rally with bullock carts, tractors, jeeps and two-wheelers. In Thanjavur, the farmers removed barricades and ropes to continue their rally and ended it by afternoon. Also Read: Tractor rally: Why protesting farmers digressed from the original routesHundreds of tractors participated in Nagapattinam district and were stopped. “A confrontation is still going on between police and farmers there,” said state coordinator of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee K Balakrishnan. Police are at the location with a riot control vehicle to stop the rally and have warned of arrests. Policemen and farmers were also seen pushing one another after the tractors were not allowed to proceed. Some farmers continued their rally on foot. In Karur district too, they were allowed to continue the rally on foot. In Cuddalore, no tractor was allowed to enter the city, while in Virudhunagar, one tractor was allowed and hundreds of farmers joined on their two-wheelers. Police said that the rallies went on peacefully in these two places. “Since we had warned them earlier, farmers took put a rally only on two-wheleers,” said a station officer from Cuddalore. The district police had issued a note warning against gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly since a new variant of the virus emerged earlier this month. “Those who organise protests and gather in large numbers will be severely punished as per law as it may cause a surge in cases,” the Cuddalore police’s statement read. “Tractors without permission used in this rally will be penalised according to Motors (Vehicles) Act (1988) under sections 177, 179 and 207 and the tractors will be seized.”The opposition DMK and its allies have protested and launched hunger strikes in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi in the recent months. However, the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government has been in favour of the three new farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-tractor-rally-largely-peaceful-farmers-cops-scuffle-in-delta-areas-101611652882519.html
26-01-2021||India||Assam’s Padma awardee worked to eradicate witch-hunting practice||Till a decade back, nearly 12-15 people would be branded as witches and murdered annually in Assam. The cases have come down drastically in recent years, thanks mainly to activist Birubala Rabha’s efforts. In recognition of her work against the practice in the face of personal problems and dangers, the 72-year-old was named as one of the recipients of this year’s Padma Shri awards.“I am very happy with the honour. I have faced many struggles and even threats to my life for the work I have been doing... The recognition is the blessing of those who have supported us,” said Rabha, who dropped out of school after Class 5 to be married off early. Rabha was called a witch and blamed by fellow villagers for deaths of neighbours.Also read | Telangana’s Padma Shri awardee can barely eke out a living as a cookHaving been a victim of the practice, Rabha took it upon herself to raise her voice against it and has since saved dozens of lives. She has spread awareness for ending witch-hunting. “My life and work are dedicated to others. The journey has been arduous, but I am not going to rest on my laurels and stop the mission which we have taken up,” said Rabha. Rabha’s work prompted the passage of the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act in 2015.Witch-hunting is a form of superstition wherein women usually are blamed for deaths, illnesses, financial troubles, or even crop damage and targeted by relatives, neighbours, or fellow villagers. Such women are often ex-communicated, forced to leave villages, tortured by kangaroo courts, and in many cases killed. The real motives of such killings are often property disputes and ego clashes.According to the Assam government figures, between 2011 and 2019, 107 people were killed across Assam in witch-hunting incidents. The latest such incident was reported in October when a 50-year-old widow and a 28-year-old man were killed in Karbi Anglong district.“Though Rabha had been working for years on this, our work took concrete shape in 2012 with the setting up of Birubala Mission. We now have around 600 members across Assam and have saved lives of at least 200...” said Natyabir Das, an associate of Rabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assams-padma-awardee-worked-to-eradicate-witch-hunting-practice-101611652822445.html

Raju, who works as a cook on daily wages at a tribal welfare hostel in Marlavai village, has been awarded the fourth-highest civilian award for saving the dying tribal Gussadi dance.“I do not know what this award is, but I am extremely happy that my name was considered in Delhi. But I will be happier if they can arrange me some shelter and food through the rest of my life,” said Raju, who belongs to the Gond tribal community. “I will be grateful if this award can help me lead a happy life.”Raju has won accolades for his efforts to popularise Gussadi, an ethnic dance form of Raj Gonds inhabiting areas along the Telangana-Maharashtra border.Also read | Writer, folklorist, former journalist Vinayak Khedekar wins Padma ShriThe dance is performed during the harvesting season when the Gonds wear Gussadi Topi, a large headgear made of around 1,500 peacock feathers locally known as Mal boora, and animal skin around their waists. Raju worked with Madari Tukaram, the first Gond Indian Administrative Service officer in the early 1980s to give a style and system to Gussadi dance. “Long ago, I performed in front of [late former Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi and presented her with the traditional headgear of Gussadi,” Raju said.Raju also took part in the Republic Day parade as part of the state tableau in 1981. He also performed in presence of APJ Abdul Kalam when he was the President.Jayadheer Tirumala Rao, a researcher on Telangana tribal art and dance forms, said when tribal dance forms were being corrupted with modern forms and cinema culture, Raju took it as a challenge and restored the traditional dance form of Gussadi by hundreds of performances across the state and the country. “...[he has] trained thousands of tribal youths in this dance form over the last four decades,” said Rao. “If any art form has to survive, the artiste has to survive first. It will happen only if more such artistes who are striving hard to sustain the dying art forms like Gussadi are honoured with such awards.”Raju was felicitated at the Republic Day celebrations at Asifabad with a shawl and bouquet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganas-padma-shri-awardee-can-barely-eke-out-a-living-as-a-cook-101611650182113.html

Dakotas were used for dropping paratroopers during the 1971 war. The Indian Navy’s tableau depicted the navy’s role in the 1971 war with Pakistan. Photos of Maha Vir Chakra awardees were displayed on the rear part of the trailer, while the sides showed murals depicting the surrender ceremony and Operation X undertaken by the navy in that war. The IAF tableau featured one of India’s first women fighter pilots. Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth was part of the tableau that showcased mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30. The IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, C-130J Super Hercules special operations plane, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission choppers also took part in the flypast. The parade was shorter and involved fewer participants because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, only a fourth of the usual number of spectators were allowed at Rajpath. The shortened route of the parade saw it end at National Stadium instead of Red Fort. Not more than 25,000 spectators were allowed, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 were also not permitted at the parade. There was no chief guest at the parade this year. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was to be the chief guest but he cancelled his visit due to the spread of a mutant strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 in the UK. This was the first time in at least five decades that the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in India’s diplomatic calendar, did not have a chief guest. The last time the parade did not have a chief guest was in 1966.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-india-showcases-military-prowess-amid-border-row-with-china-101611648321861.html

Many of the OPD (staff) was listed for vaccination, so I managed the OPD workload.”Asked if he could have gone after OPD, which closes at 2 pm, the doctor, who did not wish to be named, said, “I would get the shot whenever called next.”Anjani, the staff nurse at Lok Bandhu Hospital, said, “I have told my hospital director that my name be included in the list in the next round.”As for the confusing messages, a staffer at Civil Hospital, who was to be vaccinated on January 22, said, “I got the message for the vaccination a day before and, shortly after, a message came for cancellation of the vaccination. A third came confirming (the vaccination) again and it confused me.”Health officials said medical conditions such as allergy or fever could be ignored but the SMSes were very clear.“Medical conditions such as fever or allergy have to be considered before the vaccination,” said Dr MK Singh, the officer in charge of vaccination in Lucknow.“Three hospitals had to use Covaxin, but the message went for Covishield. Hence, the cancellation was sent and (there was) a third message confirming their vaccination. There was no confusion,” said Dr Singh.He said an analysis of the reasons was being done and the final picture would be clear in the next two days.As vaccination is voluntary, officials are now working on motivational methods. Those who have been vaccinated are being asked to motivate others and video messages of vaccination ambassadors are being circulated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-workers-blame-confusing-messages-on-missing-covid-vaccine-shot-in-up-101611642938780.html

Speaking to reporters in Karur district of Tamil Nadu on Monday, where he was on a three-day visit in the western region of the poll-bound state, Gandhi said, “We have a very good relationship with the DMK...We respect Karunanidhi, Stalin-ji and we have full faith in the alliance. The aim of the alliance is to stop the RSS ideology from coming into Tamil Nadu.” In Puducherry, local DMK leaders wanted to contest alone in the 30 assembly seats, projecting Tamil Nadu parliamentarian-businessman S Jagathrakshakan as the chief ministerial candidate even as party chief MK Stalin clarified that Jagathrakshakan was given the additional responsibilities to only strengthen the party. Also read | Rahul Gandhi wraps up Tamil Nadu campaign; attacks AIADMK, BJPOn its part, the Congress has claimed all is well within the alliance. “We don’t know why this issue was created when everything is smooth sailing,” said a senior Congress leader seeking anonymity. “Congress is strong in Puducherry and in Tamil Nadu, we have accepted DMK as the alliance leader and Stalin as the chief minister candidate.” The DMK too has ruled out that the recent developments may affect the long-standing partnership in Tamil Nadu. “Just like how the Congress is strengthening its party with their leader’s (Gandhi’s) campaign, we are trying to strengthen our party in Puducherry,” said a source in the DMK. In Puducherry, Congress is also facing problems internally. On Monday, party high command in Puducherry suspended public works minister A Namassivayam for anti-party activities after his announcement of quitting a day ago. Subsequently, he resigned from the Cabinet and MLA post along with Congress MLA and his supporter E Theepaindan. The move came amid speculation that Namassivayam and his supporters may join the BJP during party president’s J P Nadda’s visit to the Union Territory in January-end. “Those who join BJP in Puducherry or Tamil Nadu will lose,” said Puducherry chief minister N Narayanasamy in a press conference. “People of Puducherry will never accept the BJP.” He added that the people were aware that despite the interference of the Centre and Governor Kiran Bedi, the Congress government has been functioning for the welfare of people. Narayansamy and his Cabinet colleagues will meet President Ram Nath Kovind in February urging him to recall Bedi.With the resignation of the two MLAs, the strength of the Congress in Puducherry assembly has come down to 12 while DMK has three seats. The Opposition, All India NR Congress, a splinter group led by former chief minister N Rangasamy, has seven seats and AIADMK has four. Three members of the BJP were nominated as MLAs to the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rift-in-cong-dmk-ties-in-puducherry-all-eyes-now-on-alliance-in-poll-bound-tn-101611643280986.html

26-01-2021||India||Farmers breach police barricades at Singhu, Tikri protest sites||Police used tear gas on groups of protesters when they tried to break barricades and cemented barriers at Delhi’s Mukarba Chowk as tens of thousands of farmers began a tractor procession through New Delhi’s outskirts on Tuesday in protest against three agricultural laws passed in September. This came shortly after protesters breached police barricades at farmer protest sites of Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur on Tuesday to force their entry into New Delhi.The procession began ahead of the time granted for it with tractors festooned with Indian flags and farm unions from neighbouring states driving into the national capital for the procession coinciding with Republic Day celebrations.Men and women danced on beats of dhols as people lined roads and showered petals on the protesters. Police tried to convince farmers to stick to the decided plan of holding the tractor parade after the conclusion of the Republic Day parade.Also Read: Tractors fall short, protesters from Singhu border set on foot to Delhi: FarmersA large number of farmers also marched on foot holding flags of different farmer unions and raising slogans. Some of them were seen riding motorcycles and horses.Residents were seen distributing food and water bottles to the protesting farmers.News agency PTI quoted a police officer saying: “As per the agreement, they were supposed to start their parade at the time specified but they forcefully entered Delhi and are currently peacefully sitting at Mukarba Chowk. They are supposed to head towards Bawana side as per the route [plan], but they are adamant that they want to go towards Outer Ring Road.”He added the situation is peaceful and they were trying to convince them to go towards the designated route at the specified time.Reuters quoted a farmer saying their word should travel around the world and that they are fighting for their lives. Devinder Singh, the 36-year-old farmer from Punjab, added: “If we lose our farmland, how will we survive?”Hundreds of policemen, including some with assault rifles, tear gas, and a water cannon, stood guard along the procession route as trucks were used to barricade the main route to Singhu.Police on Sunday allowed farmers to rally along approved routes on the outskirts of Delhi.With their tractor procession, the protesters seek to rival the spectacle of the official Republic Day celebrations on the Rajpath boulevard in pomp and pageantry. The leaders of the agitation plan to follow up with a march on foot to Parliament on February 1, when the government presents the Union budget.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that while the Republic Day rally is planned as a one-day event, the scale of the protest could mean that the rally could spill over to the next day by the time they return to their starting spots located at three different rally routes in and around the capital. Police have said about 30,000 tractors are likely to participate in the rally. But farm leaders said the number of vehicles will be closer to 200,000 as the agitation will continue till the demand for repealing three contentious farm laws is met.Police have allowed Tuesday’s parade to cover a length of 194km on stretches crossing the three principal border points that have become protest sites over the last two months.Farmer leaders have appealed to tractor parade participants to carry enough ration for 24 hours and ensure that the rally remains peaceful.The farm unions have pressed on with a protest against the Centre, opposing the agricultural laws that ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales, and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.The government and farm unions have been unable to find a solution to the stand-off over 11 rounds of talks. The farmers last week rejected a proposal by the Centre to put the laws on hold for 18 months. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday reiterated that farmers should accept the government’s proposal to suspend the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-breach-police-barricades-at-singhu-tikri-protest-sites-101611641060920.html

She had said after her induction in the IAF, while recalling her first experience of the spin solo on fighter aircraft Kiran, that as she entered the aircraft into a spin and recovered it all by herself at 20,000 feet, doubt started creeping into her mind as to what if the aircraft didn’t recover.“I told myself that if I don’t do it now, I will always be afraid of it. I spun the aircraft and to my surprise, the spin was more vicious or so it seemed. But the fighter pilot in me took over and I told myself come what may I will recover. And the aircraft recovered from spin and so did my confidence,” she had said.The Air Force contingent, comprising 96 airmen and four officers, was led by flight lieutenant Tanik Sharma. It was followed by the Air Force Tableau titled Indian Air Force: Touch the Sky with Glory, which showcased scaled-down models of light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter, Su-30 MK-I aircraft and Rohini radar against a sky-blue background.

Here is what we know about the incident that has turned the spotlight on the eastern sector even as rival soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball in Ladakh: • The latest incident took place at Naku La area at a height of over 5,000 metres on January 20 when Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into the Indian territory but were pushed back. • The Army has clarified it was a minor face-off that was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols. • The Naku La area has traditionally not been prone to face-offs. • Experts pointed to attempts by Beijing to open a new front amid the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tensions first erupted in May 2020. The two sides are holding diplomatic and military dialogues to defuse tensions there. Also Read: Indian, Chinese troops clashed in north Sikkim last week: Officials• The Chinese side neither confirmed nor denied the incident. • Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said Chinese border troops are committed to upholding peace and tranquility along the border with India and urged the “Indian side to work in the same direction” and “refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border”. • The news of the Naku La clash came hours before a joint statement by the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which agreed to a push for “early disengagement” of their frontline troops during the ninth round of military talks on Sunday. The talks went on for 16 hours. • The ongoing border tensions escalated in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. It was the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the contested Line of Actual Control in 45 years and resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers. • The Naku La episode is the second such incident in the eastern sector in less than a year. Four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops suffered injuries during a May 9, 2020, confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers. • Rival soldiers have so far clashed at least five times since the India-China border row erupted last year in the Ladakh sector. The situation there remains tense and the ongoing military and diplomatic dialogues have yet to make any positive impact. • On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the military and diplomatic talks with China were prolonged. • While the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been at the centre of the current border tensions, Indian forces are in a heightened state of alert all along the border with China, stretching from Himachal Pradesh to Uttarakhand to Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-troops-clash-at-sikkim-s-naku-la-all-you-need-to-know-101611639860685.html

Today’s parade in Kolkata has been dedicated to Deshnayak Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,” the West Bengal chief minister tweeted on Tuesday on the 72nd Republic Day, the first of the new decade.‘Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity’We must forever strive to protect, preserve & follow all the ideals of the Constitution.Warm greetings to every Indian on Republic Day!Today’s parade in Kolkata has been dedicated to Deshnayak Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.In the run-up to the assembly polls in West Bengal, which are likely to take place in April-May, Bose, a freedom fighter and a prominent Bengali icon, has emerged as a major figure. The central government recently declared and celebrated January 23, Bose’s birth anniversary, as ‘Parakram Diwas.’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power at the Centre, and is the main opposition party in West Bengal, paid a visit to Kolkata on January 23 to commemorate Bose’s birth anniversary.At an event held at Victoria Memorial, Banerjee was “heckled” allegedly by BJP supporters who raised “Jai Shri Ram” slogans towards her. The chief minister, who was sharing the dais with the Prime Minister, refused to speak at the event, taking offense to religious slogans being raised at a government function. This led to a war of words between the BJP and the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC).Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been in power in West Bengal since 2011 and the leader is looking for a third straight term as the chief minister. The BJP, buoyed by its performance in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming at forming its maiden government in the eastern state. There have been a series of confrontations between workers of the two parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/72nd-r-day-mamata-dedicates-parade-in-kolkata-to-netaji-subhas-chandra-bose-101611636218251.html

26-01-2021||India||Budget session: Parliament canteen expands menu, hikes prices||A buffet lunch for ₹700 and an aloo bonda for ₹10—the Parliament canteen will dish out an elaborate menu this Budget session. The Parliament canteen, now run by ITDC, will offer as many as 58 food items—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—from January 27, an internal circular said. The price tags, however, don’t smell of subsidy. For many years, the Parliament canteen had tried to strike a balance between the quality of food and its price but for the first time, food will be served with a no-profit-no-loss approach. While vegetarian biryani is priced at ₹50, a plate of chicken biryani will cost ₹100. A vegetarian meal (thali) will now be available for ₹100, mutton biryani at ₹150 and for a plate of fish and chips, a customer will have to shell out ₹110. Also Read: Stage set for mega tractor rally; Parliament march on Feb 1The new price list indicates a new menu and a higher rate. While the chicken biryani will cost ₹30 more than the current rate and its mutton counterpart will be ₹50 costlier, the new items include fish and chips, medu vada, mutton cutlet, omelette, masala poori and uttapam. A small plate of green salad, earlier available for ₹10, will now cost ₹25. Last year, the contract with the Northern Railways, which has been running the canteen since 1968, was scrapped. Top officials indicated that cost control and a better, tastier menu were the prime reasons for such a move. “The Northern Railways’ people in the Parliament canteen were paid nearly ₹1 lakh each by the Parliament to run the canteen. We felt that the cost should be reduced,” said an official. During a normal session, an average 4,500 people eat at the Parliament every day. According to the data available with officials, during the 2019-20 fiscal, of the ₹17 crore annual subsidy, only ₹24 lakh was spent on account of MPs. The rest was accounted for by visitors, security personnel and officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-parliament-canteen-expands-menu-increases-prices-101611635360277.html

Like Republic Day Parade, farmers are also showcasing tractors with special tableaux.The tractor march has already been subject to several controversies as the Centre had moved the Supreme Court against the march saying that the march on Republic Day would hurt the pride of the nation. The Delhi Police too didn't initially allow the protesters to come into the Capital. But after several rounds of consultations, the union leaders convinced Delhi Police about their march. Hence, additional caution has been taken by the union to spread the dos and the don'ts. "We've to take care that this historical parade is not stained at any cost. Our victory lies in the parade being taken out in a very peaceful manner; without any unwanted events taking place. Remember, that our aim is not to conquer Delhi, but to win over the hearts of the people of this country," the union said in its directive.Instructions for farmer’s Republic Day ਕਿਸਾਨ ਗਣਤੰਤਰ ਦਿਵਸ ਪਰੇਡ ਲਈ ਨਿਰਦੇਸ਼. किसान गणतंत्र दिवस परेड के लिए निर्देश #farmersrepublicdayparade #BharatKaregaDelhiKooch pic.twitter.com/VfESHaRPrF5 Places for 5 Routes -Join Farmers Tractor Parade via these Places#DigitalKisan #DigitalKisanMorcha pic.twitter.com/u37c3bekveHere are the dos and the don'ts> No weapon to be carried, not even sticks.> No flag of any political party or any other political outfit.

At the same time, I knew there were so many things, so much diversity and such a wide canvas I could illustrate," he said."While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many elements of the subcontinent’s culture have been evolving for centuries.

26-01-2021||India||Much ado about Netaji portrait at Prez House||In the end, like many controversies on social media, it ended up being much ado about nothing. On Monday morning social media was abuzz with claims that the portrait of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, painted by Paresh Maity, and unveiled by President Ram Nath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhavan on January 23, the beginning of the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of the freedom fighter was that of a Bengali actor who played the role of the Bose in a 2019 biopic.The claim, that the portrait was based on Bengali actor Prosenjit Chatterjee, popularly known as Bumba, who played Bose in a 2019 movie, Gumnaami gathered momentum.Then, it emerged that the portrait was actually based on a photograph of the leader likely taken in the 1940s, and not on Chatterjee. Netaji’s grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose who, last year, put out that photograph on Twitter, did so again and said this was the original on which the portrait was based.The actor also corroborated this on Twitter, saying: “As an Actor,I’m elated that people thought,that the painting resembles my character in Gumnami,dir. by @srijitspeaketh and prosthetics by Somnath.”Even by the trigger-happy standards of Twitter, the controversy was a bit much.Moitra tweeted: “After donating ₹5 lakhs to the Ram temple the President honours Netaji by unveiling a portrait of Prasenjit, the actor who played him in biopic God Save India (because this government certainly can’t).” She later deleted the tweet.“Is the portrait unveiled by the President of India that of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose or of actor Prosenjit Chatterjee who played the role of Netaji on screen? This is why education matters,” said a tweet by the West Bengal Congress, which too was later deleted. “If the neo-Bengal experts are done making a fool of themselves, let me remind them that all their misplaced activism won’t be able to save Mamata Banerjee,” Amit Malviya, BJP IT cell head tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/much-ado-about-netaji-portrait-at-prez-house-101611622119895.html
26-01-2021||India||Troops come to blows in India-China face-off||Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a brawl in north Sikkim last week, with soldiers from both armies suffering injuries in a clash that has turned the spotlight on the eastern sector even as rival soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball in Ladakh, officials familiar with the development said on Monday.The latest incident took place at Naku La area, which is at a height of over 5,000 metres, on January 20, when Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into the Indian territory, the officials cited above said, requesting anonymity. They added that the soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were pushed back.“It is clarified that there was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on January 20 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,” the army said in a brief statement.The Naku La area has traditionally not been prone to face-offs, and the developments reflected China’s aggressive behaviour in the eastern sector, the officials said.Experts pointed to attempts by Beijing to open a new front amid the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tensions first erupted in May 2020. The two sides are holding diplomatic and military dialogues to defuse tensions there.“I thought the use of the word ‘minor’ was best avoided. A clash is a clash. Just as we were awaiting the outcome of the ninth round of talks between military com mmanders, reports of an intrusion into Naku La represents an attitude that is anything but minor,” former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said.The Chinese side neither confirmed nor denied the incident. “On the specific [incident] you mentioned, I don’t have any information to offer. I would like to stress though the Chinese border troops are committed to upholding peace and tranquility along the border with India,” Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told the press in Beijing at a regular briefing.He urged the “Indian side to work in the same direction” and “refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border”.The news of the Naku La clash came hours before a joint statement by the two nuclear-armed neighbours, who agreed to a push for “early disengagement” of their frontline troops during the ninth round of military talks on Sunday. The talks went on for 16 hours.“They [the two sides] also agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, maintain the good momentum of dialogue and negotiation, and hold the 10th round of the corps commander-level meeting at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation,” the joint statement said.The ongoing border tensions reached new heights in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 — the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 45 years. The clash resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.The Naku La episode is the second such incident in the eastern sector in less than a year. Four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops suffered injuries during a May 9, 2020, confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers.Rival soldiers have so far clashed at least five times since the India-China border row erupted last year in the Ladakh sector. The situation there remains tense and the ongoing military and diplomatic dialogues have yet to make any positive impact.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the military and diplomatic talks with China were prolonged.While the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been at the centre of the current border tensions, Indian forces are in a heightened state of alert all along the border with China, stretching from Himachal Pradesh to Uttarakhand to Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh.In his address to the nation on the eve of India’s 72nd Republic Day, President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday said while the country was committed to peace, its forces were “adequately mobilised” to thwart any attempt to undermine national security. “Our national interest will be protected at all costs,” he said.A senior journalist of the Chinese official media said there was no record of last week’s clash in the PLA’s patrol log, an unusual remark given the secrecy surrounding the Chinese army.“This is fake news. Based on what I learned, there is no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side. Small frictions often occur on China-India border area, but clash that caused multiple injuries will definitely be recorded and reported,” Hu Xijin, the high-profile editor of nationalistic Global Times tabloid, tweeted.But experts said the Naku La incident appears to be part of a larger effort to both test India’s defences and open a new front in the face of the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tens of thousands of troops have dug in for the harsh winter.“There is nothing the Chinese can now do in Ladakh which they can portray to their advantage,” Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said. “Unlike previous standoffs, where the Chinese stepped back after intruding, there has been a fundamental change in the attitude of the Chinese. They aren’t stepping back this time after they were repelled and faced resistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-come-to-blows-in-india-china-faceoff-101611618264075.html

Why should we transfer the case here? We would like the advantage of the decision by the high court,” observed the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, clearing the decks for the high court to proceed suitably when the matter next comes up for hearing before it on February 6.The state government, got adjournments from the high court in the last two hearings citing the pendency of the similar petitions before the Supreme Court.Senior advocate PS Narasimha, representing the UP government, had requested the bench to transfer the two petitions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conversion-ordinance-don-t-take-hc-lightly-top-court-tells-up-govt-101611617889197.html
26-01-2021||India||India to impose permanent ban on 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok: Report||India's ministry of electronics and information technology has issued fresh notices to make permanent a ban imposed on video app TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps in June, Indian media reported late on Monday.When it first imposed the ban, the Indian government gave the 59 apps a chance to explain their position on compliance with privacy and security requirements, the Times of India reported on Monday.The companies, which include ByteDance's popular video-sharing app TikTok, Tencent Holdings' WeChat and Alibaba's UC Browser, were also asked to respond to a list of questions, the newspaper said."The government is not satisfied with the response/explanation given by these companies. Hence, the ban for these 59 apps is permanent now," business newspaper Livemint quoted a source familiar with the notices as saying. It said the notices were issued last week.The ministry's June order stated that the apps were "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order".The order, which India referred to as a "digital strike", followed a skirmish with Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border site when 20 Indian soldiers were killed.In September, India banned another 118 mobile apps, including Tencent's popular videogame PUBG, as it stepped up the pressure on Chinese technology companies following the standoff at the border.A TikTok representative told the Economic Times newspaper that the company was evaluating the notice and will respond to it as appropriate.The ministry of electronics and information technology could not be reached for comment outside regular working hours. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-impose-permanent-ban-on-59-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-report-101611617067803.html

26-01-2021||India||SC rejects Andhra govt plea to defer local polls||The Supreme Court on Monday reproached the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh for its endeavour to have village panchayat elections postponed, and said that the court cannot allow “lawlessness” in a state because of an ego battle.Clearing the decks for the local body elections in February in accordance with the poll panel’s itinerary, the top court expressed its strong displeasure at the state government’s accusations against state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar, terming the whole episode a “sorry state of affairs.”“Sometimes, you come up with one excuse; sometimes, you challenge appointment of an officer (Kumar). It is a political process and you are not letting a political process be completed for the last six months on one pretext or another. It is not that in this country, no election has taken place during these times. It was conducted in Bihar,” a bench headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, told AP government’s lawyer Mukul Rohatgi.Even as Rohatgi said that the state government was acting in the interest of its employees and that the court could prescribe an election schedule, the bench, which also included justice Hrishikesh Roy, said that it could not ask the state election commissioner to stop functioning.“What is this happening in the state? Your chief secretary and principal secretary don’t go. Your DGP is absent. Your employees’ associations are issuing resolutions against the election commission. We cannot allow this lawlessness. We cannot let this lawlessness continue because of your ego battles and your fights. We are not going to be a party to your ego battles,” Justice Kaul told Rohatgi.During the hearing, senior advocates Parag Tripathi and BH Marlapally, appeared on behalf of the associations of state government officers and other employees. Senior lawyer Sajan Povayya too appeared for medical officers in the state.The bench proceeded to dismiss the appeal by Jagan government against the high court’s order of January 21 in favour of the state election commission.On January 8, Kumar released the schedule for elections to be held in four phases – on February 5, 9, 13 and 17. The notification was issued on January 23 and the nomination process for phase-1 was to commence on Monday. This could not take place, as the district collectors and district panchayat officers refused to start the process as there were no instructions from the Jagan government||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-andhra-govt-plea-to-defer-local-polls-101611610431663.html
26-01-2021||India||Stage set for mega tractor rally; Parliament march on Feb 1||Hundreds of thousands of protesters on Monday prepared to enter the national capital on Republic Day on tractors to take out a mega farmers’ parade — one, they contend, will rival the spectacle of the official celebrations on the Rajpath boulevard in pomp and pageantry — even as the leaders of the agitation said they will follow up with a march on foot to Parliament on February 1, when the government presents the Union budget.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that while the Republic Day rally is planned as a one-day event, the scale of the protest could mean that the rally could spill over to the next day by the time they return to their starting spots located at three different rally routes in and around the Capital.The police say about 30,000 tractors are likely to participate in the rally, but farm leaders said the number of vehicles will be closer to 200,000. The farm unions, however, have promised not to veer from the three routes — centered around the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders — agreed to with the Delhi Police.“We will march towards Parliament on foot from different locations on the Budget day on February 1. As far as tomorrow’s (Tuesday’s) tractor rally is concerned, it will give the government an idea of our strength and they will know the agitation is not just limited to Haryana or Punjab but it is an agitation of the whole country,” said Darshan Pal, a farm union leader.He said the agitation will continue till the demand of repealing three contentious farm laws is met. The government and farm unions have not been able to find a solution to the stand-off over 11 rounds of talks, and the farmers last week rejected a far-reaching proposal by the Centre to put the laws on hold for 18 months. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday reiterated that farmers should accept the government’s proposal to suspend the laws. “The government has given the best offer to farmers’ unions. I am hopeful that they will convey their decision to us after discussing it among themselves,” he told reporters.Delhi Police have allowed Tuesday’s parade to cover a length of 194km on stretches crossing the three principal border points that have become protest sites over the last two months. The “farmers’ Republic Day parade” is the outcome of a months-long protest by farm unions against the three farm laws pushed by the Centre, and farmers say their event will be unique.The police said thousands of security personnel have been deployed at several border points to maintain law and order during Tuesday’s parade. The Delhi Traffic Police asked commuters to avoid routes where protesting farmers will conduct the rally.The farmers will also hold tractor marches from four places on the Haryana-Rajasthan border but these won’t enter Delhi.At the Tikri and Singhu border camps, the two largest farmers’ congregation points, farmers were busy preparing for their own Republic Day cultural spectacle. In the coppery light of a fading wintry sun, wheat-grower Manjit Singh Brar flashed a ‘V’ sign as he mounted a flagstaff on his glimmering brass-and-chrome-lined tractor.Wearing a turban in the colours of the national flag, he then roared on a video call: “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” (hail soldiers, hail farmers), a popular slogan coined by the country’s second prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri.Yogendra Yadav, one of the organisers of the farmers’ protests, said: “We have always seen Jai Jawan (victory to soldiers) on Republic Day. This time we will see Jai Kisan (victory to farmers) too. This will be a historic occasion.” His comment referred to the official celebrations which ceremoniously figure in a two-hour parade that showcases the country’s military might and cultural diversity.Farmer leaders have appealed to those participating in the tractor parade to carry enough ration for 24 hours and ensure that the rally remains peaceful. “No one should carry any weapon or consume alcohol. Banners carrying provocative messages are not allowed,” a leader said.The farm unions have pressed on with a protest against the Centre, opposing the agricultural laws that ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales, and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. The farmers say the laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.At Singhu and Tikri, which have become virtual tent cities, resembling a fair, with all possible amenities, such as 24-hour tea stalls, music sessions, prayer halls, canteens, gyms, libraries and now tractor fitment-and-polishing centres, the farmers could be seen preparing for the rally.Gulab Singh, who has modified his tractor for ₹600,000, said: “Urban children who have never been to villages will see a glimpse of what farming is like and what rural life is all about.” The vehicle has been flamboyantly decorated and dazzles in chrome, has a 10-speaker stereo system, coordinated LED lights and GPS, which will guide him through his parade route.Each procession of tractors will be led by a car that will act as a pilot vehicle, seating leaders of the movement such as Darshan Pal, Balbir Singh Rajewal and Kavitha Kuruganti.In one trolley, a team of six contortionists will make an acrobatic presentation, each contortion representing a food-crop plant.Farmer-artistes from Bengal have set up a mobile installation to pay a poignant tribute to over 100 farmers who have died in the protests, including Sant Ram Singh, a Sikh cleric who fatally shot himself on December 16. “It will be a major attraction and will pay a tribute to all our farmer brothers who have lost their lives in this agitation,” said Bolin Bhattacharya, who refused to reveal details of the artwork, preferring to keep it a surprise.Tableaux of folk dances of Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan will be led by women, said Revati, a farmer who goes by one name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-mega-tractor-rally-parliament-march-on-feb-1-101611602868064.html
26-01-2021||India||India seventh most affected by climate change in 2019 globally: Report||India was the seventh most-affected by the devastating impact of climate change globally in 2019 according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 released on Monday.India was preceded by Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Bahamas, Japan, Malawi and Afghanistan in the list of countries most affected by the impacts of extreme weather events in 2019, the report by Germanwatch, a Bonn-based environmental organisation said.Between 2000 and 2019, over 475,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of more than 11,000 extreme weather events globally and losses amounted to around US $2.56 trillion (in purchasing power parities).The report was released just ahead of the Global Adaptation Summit hosted by Netherlands wherein UN secretary general Antonio Guterres is likely to call upon developed countries and donor agencies to increase funding to adaptation measures of developing countries.Also Read: Joe Biden talks transatlantic ties, Covid-19, climate change with Boris JohnsonIn 2019, monsoon continued for a month longer than normal in India. From June to the end of September 2019, 110% of the long-period average was recorded. Flooding caused by heavy rain was responsible for 1,800 deaths across 14 states and led to the displacement of 1.8 million people. Overall, 11.8 million people were affected by the intense monsoon with the economic damage estimated to be US $10 billion. There were eight tropical cyclones in India. Six of the eight cyclones intensified to become “very severe.” Extremely severe cyclone Fani affected 28 million people, killing nearly 90 people in India and Bangladesh, and causing economic losses of US $8.1 billion, the report said.The Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) analyses quantified impacts of extreme weather events both in terms of the fatalities and economic losses. It doesn’t however consider slow-onset events like rising sea levels, glacier melting or ocean warming and acidification. The index is based on data from the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE. The most recent data available for 2019 and from 2000 to 2019 was taken into account.Six of the 10 countries most affected from 2000 to 2019 belong to the low to lower-middle income category. Climate impacts affect people in developing countries disproportionately, threatening lives and livelihoods, the report highlighted, adding that international climate financing has remained inadequate. In 2018, a total of US $78.9 billion was provided and mobilised. But the goal to mobilise US $100 billion annually from 2020 onwards, which, in 2009, developed countries agreed to provide for developing countries to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts remains unfulfilled.“The global Covid-19 pandemic has reiterated the fact that vulnerable countries are exposed to various types of risk—climatic, geophysical, economic and health-related—and that vulnerability is systemic and interconnected,” said Laura Schaefer of Germanwatch. “It is therefore important to address these interconnections. Strengthening the climate resilience of countries is a crucial part of this challenge. The Climate Adaptation Summit offers the opportunity to take an important step in this direction,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seventh-most-affected-by-climate-change-in-2019-globally-report-101611552192319.html
