The incident took place at a village in Karnal, after the farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws broke chairs and tables, and damaged a helipad where Khattar's helipad was scheduled to land.WATCH | Farmer protest: Vandalism at Haryana CM's event venue, helipad demolished"It is not right to obstruct anyone who wants to speak. I don't think people will tolerate violation of provisions given by Dr BR Ambedkar. Congress had attempted to finish democracy in 1975. At that time people identified their disgusting work & threw them out of power," Khattar said at a press conference, targeting the Congress.“Our nation has a strong democracy where everyone has freedom of expression. We never stopped statements of these alleged farmers and leaders. Their agitation is going on. Despite Covid, we made arrangements for them,” he further said.Hinting at a political angle involved in the vandalisation incident, the Haryana chief minister reiterated that the agitating farmers were being influenced. “Today's incident gave a message to people, bigger than what I'd intended to give. These people have defamed the farmers because a farmer doesn't have such nature. A farmer can be less educated or simple but he's sensible,” Khattar said.Earlier in the day, a clash first broke out between the farmers marching towards the helipad and the police, which was trying to stop the protesters, according to eyewitnesses. However, the protesters outnumbered the cops and the pro-Kisan Panchayat organisers and ransacked the venue, sending cops scurrying for cover.The police used water cannons and tear gas in an attempt to contain the crowd. The protesting farmers assembled around the venue while police’s attempt to control the situation with the help of the locals failed.Following the chaos, Khattar’s mahapanchayat, which was aimed to drum up support for the three contentious agriculture laws enacted by the Centre in September last year, was called off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/todays-incident-gave-a-message-haryana-cm-after-meeting-venue-vandalised-101610289186284.html

He also saluted chief minister Nitish Kumar for "cooperating with the alliance partner"."If one has to learn about how to fulfill coalition dharma, Nitish Kumar can teach that. Despite internal problems with the alliance partner and conspiracies, Nitishji's cooperation makes him politically great.

Why are you being so impatient with the cabinet expansion? Eveything will happen at right time, you just focus on positive politics," Manjhi said in another tweet..@yadavtejashwi जी आप बिहार के भविष्य हैं आपको अनर्गल बयान से बचना चाहिए।जब आप अपने दल के राजनैतिक कार्यक्रम खरवास के बाद आरंभ कर रहें हैं तो मंत्रिपरिषद का विस्तार पर इतना क्यों उतावले हो रहें हैं?सही वक्त पर सबकुछ हो जाएगा बस आप पॉज़िटिव राजनिति किजिए।A proposed ministerial expansion in Bihar is expected to take place on January 14 and the Legislative Council polls for two seats scheduled on January 28, people aware of the developments said. The seats had fallen vacant after election of Sushil Kumar Modi to Rajya Sabha and election of MLC Binod Narayan Jha to legislative assembly.A 14-member council of ministers of chief minister Nitish Kumar was sworn in by Governor Phagu Chauhan in November last year. Kumar had kept home, general administration, vigilance and three more departments for himself.Manjhi had said on Wednesday that he would seek one Legislative Council seat and a ministerial berth for his party from Kumar when he expands his Cabinet.Nitish Kumar had made an indirect attack at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, saying that the seat distribution within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for last year's assembly elections should have been done five months before the polls and added that the Janata Dal (United) had to pay a price."The seat distribution within the NDA should have been done five months prior to the elections but that was not done and as a result, JDU had to pay a big price for it. I was not in favour of becoming the chief minister but because of the pressure of BJP and my party, I agreed to assume the post," Kumar said at the JD(U) state council meeting on Saturday.The Bihar chief minister further said that his party failed to anticipate as to who were their friends and who were not.The NDA won last year's Assembly elections in Bihar. The NDA, with JD(U) and Manjhi's HAM, emerged victorious by winning 125 seats; the RJD and Left parties, which are part of the grand alliance, were left short of 13 seats from simple majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-internal-problems-with-alliance-partner-manjhi-salutes-nitish-101610285480555.html

People of this country should not be made lab rats,” he was quoted as saying by ANI. However, the minister ruled out any political differences or political ambitions over the issue. “As far as public welfare an national welfare is concerned, we'll stand with the Centre as far as public welfare and national welfare are concerned,” he said.Gupta’s comments came a day after the central government announced that the Covid-19 vaccination drive in India will begin from January 16. The date for vaccination was decided at a meeting of a high-powered committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Several political leaders have expressed their concerns over the use of indigenously developed Covaxin — one of the two vaccines approved for emergency use — as its trial has not been completed yet. On Saturday, Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo said, “The third phase trial of Covaxin is under process. The vaccine has been approved for emergency use (by the Drug Controller General of India). Its use should be avoided until its complete results are out,” Deo told reporters.Meanwhile, the Centre on Sunday said it was proactively preparing for the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive and that the Co-WIN software forms the backbone of the last mile vaccine administration.The states have been told to ensure that the vaccination drive is citizen-centric and built on the approach that the vaccine shall be available anytime and anywhere, the health ministry said in a statement. They have also been advised to urge the beneficiaries to seed their current mobile number with Aadhar for registration and consequent communication through SMS as there cannot be any proxies for Aadhar authentication.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of all states on Monday. This will be the first interaction between PM Modi and the CMs after the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gave restricted, emergency-use approval to two vaccines — Oxford Astrazeneca's vaccine known as Covishield in India, locally manufactured by Pune's Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-shouldn-t-be-made-lab-rats-jharkhand-minister-on-covid-vaccination-drive-101610283183807.html

So, cardiology and urology departments will run it on Monday and Wednesday, gastroenterology will run only on Monday, while pulmonology and CTVS will operate or on Wednesday and Friday," Gupta said."The COVID situation has improved in Delhi, so after being made a partially coronavirus facility, we have decided to resume the OPD too. It will start functioning again from Monday," a senior official had earlier said.The move will come as a big relief for people, especially the residents of east Delhi where the hospital is located.Delhi recorded 399 fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday, the seventh time the daily incidences count stood below the 500-mark in January, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.51 per cent.The infection tally in the city stood at 6.3 lakh and the death toll mounted to 10,678 with 12 new fatalities, they said."The OPDs of medicine, surgery, paediatric and gynaecology have resumed to serve the general public at the LNJP Hospital.

Both vaccines, the statement from the Health Ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.After vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, together numbering around 27 crore, a government statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-shall-form-foundation-of-covid-19-inoculation-drive-centre-101610280600234.html

You go!!". Narayanasamy was himself seen carrying a placard that read 'Go Back Bedi'.Narayanasamy leads the Congress-led Secular Democratic Alliance (SDA) government in Puducherry. Apart from the chief minister, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president A V Subramanian, various ministers, Congress legislators and delegates of different wings of the CPI, CPI(M) and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) are participating in the four-day-long agitation. The protest began on Friday.Although the SDA had earlier decided to hold the agitation near Raj Nivas (office-cum-residence of the Lt Governor), the venue was shifted to Maraimalai Adigal Salai (more than a km away) as police did not give permission in view of an order in force restricting agitations within 500 metres of Raj Nivas and the Assembly.The Centre has deployed Central Armed Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force personnel at vantage points to maintain law and order.This is the second time that such an agitation against Bedi is being held in Puducherry with the chief minister and his ministerial colleagues and leaders of the alliance parties taking part.The earlier stir was held in February 2019 to push for the demands of reopening the closed industries and public sector undertakings and also for smooth operation of the free rice scheme.The current agiation is, however, limited to the demand that Bedi be recalled.Bedi, a former IPS officer, and Narayanasamy have been at loggerheads over various issues ever since she was appointed Lt Governor in May 2016, with the ruling Congress accusing her of going against decisions of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-back-bedi-puducherry-cm-s-agitation-against-lt-governor-enters-third-day-101610278327475.html

10-01-2021||India||A book for cancer patients telling them how to eat right||While eating certain kinds of food increases one’s chances of getting cancer, there are certain other kinds of food items that can actually help fight this deadly condition.Talk to cancer specialists, and you will find most complaining about the high drop-out rate among cancer patients on chemotherapy. The reason largely is the same: that their body cannot take the harmful drugs that are powerful enough for both killing the cancer cells as well as harming the healthy cells. Talk to cancer patients on chemotherapy, and most would want to know if there was a solution that could make the therapy somewhat bearable.Dr Shubham Pant, oncologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, is here to help.In his new book, Food Matters: The Role Your Diet Plays in the Fight Against Cancer, Dr Pant guides cancer patients through the gruelling therapies with healthy recipes that can provide maximum benefit during and after cancer therapy.The book, however, is not one of your plain recipe books. Instead, it explains in great detail how eating wrong things can wreak havoc on our health, especially talking of things that could lead to diseases like cancer. Dr Pant has also painstakingly explained why cancer therapies such as chemo affect a patient’s sense of smell and taste, and how the side-effects can be minimized.“Cancer is a truly life-changing diagnosis… we normally take the simple things in life, like the ability to relish and taste our food, for granted… until it gets taken away from us… taste buds go for a toss and things that were appetizing become repulsive overnight…,” is how Pant broaches the topic of loss of appetite during cancer therapy.The introduction in the book clearly lays out the intent of writing the book, which is defining the link between diet and cancer.“The link between diet and cancer is complicated and most of the research points to an association... certain dietary choices and patterns can help in decreasing the risk..,” he writes in the book.The book is broadly divided in three sections: section 1 deals with diet and cancer prevention, second section is about eating healthy during cancer therapy, and third section is about surviving cancer.The first section deals with things that are wrong with Indian eating, and how influx of western food habits mean that the risk of developing cancer has only increased. What are the leading causes of cancer, including use of tobacco, alcohol, high fat and low in fibre food, and how prevention is always better than cure.He provides dos and don’ts of eating, and among don’ts the suggestion is to not eat red meat and processed meats, and in dos one will have to increase intake of fruits and vegetables in their daily diet. To motivate people, Dr Pant has shared experiences of his patients in the form of case studies, and what did they do right to mitigate the effects of cancer therapy.Towards the end of section 1, there is a list of healthy recipes shared for the purpose of making life somewhat easier for cancer patients on therapy. The recipes are tasty and the ingredients are simple that are easily available such as pearl millet, Amaranth with green vegetables, barley, chicken stew, chana with lime and date, figs, idlis etc.The third section that deals with surviving cancer through diet, and has a list of healthy and interesting salad recipes such as fig, yoghurt salad, cucumber and peanut salad, cottage cheese and grape salad, masala boiled egg salad etc. This book is a refreshing read; and a treasure trove for people with cancer who have trouble eating meals during therapy, and are always on a lookout for some tip that could make their life a bit easy. “We wish you the best of luck in your nutrition and health journey for the next phase of your life…,” Dr Pant writes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-book-for-cancer-patients-telling-them-how-to-eat-right-101610277869420.html

Within a month, we are going to face two parliamentary and an assembly by-polls. We have to finalise the candidates. We will discuss all these issues with Amit Shah and other important leaders," he added.The BJP leader said while his appointment with the home minister is confirmed, he will also try to meet JP Nadda, the party's national president.Asked about the steps taken to check the spread of Covid-19 in the state, the chief minister said, "In Karnataka, the Covid-19 situation is under control. We are taking all precautions."Earlier before leaving the Bangalore Airport, he hinted that the cabinet expansion may also come up for discussion during his meeting with the party high command."I don't know. I will discuss all the issues," he told reporters at the airport when asked if a cabinet rejig is likely this week.The cabinet expansion in the state has been on the cards for over a year now, but it could not take place, giving some anxious moments to ministerial aspirants and also leading to dissatisfaction.Among those in the ministerial race are MLAs Umesh Katti, Munirathna, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, M P Renukacharya, Aravind Limbavali and S R Vishwanath. Three MLCs -- C P Yogeshwar, MTB Nagaraj and R Shankar -- are too aspiring for a ministerial berth.Another MLC, A H Vishwanath, too was in the race but his hopes dashed when the Karnataka High Court on November 30 barred him from becoming a minister until at least May this year.The state can have a total of 34 ministers and it has 27 now.By-polls are scheduled for Maski and Basavakalyan assembly segments, and Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency.While Maski fell vacant due to the resignation of sitting Congress MLA Pratap Gouda Patil in 2019, the by-polls to Basavakalyan and Belagavi seats have been necessitated by the deaths of their representatives B Narayan Rao and Suresh Angadi, respectively, due to coronavirus."I will discuss all other issues with the party high command and wish to return in the night," the chief minister said before he departed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-meets-home-minister-amit-shah-to-discuss-state-s-political-scenario-101610274854773.html

10-01-2021||India||Proactively prepping for nationwide roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine: Govt||The Centre has been proactively preparing for the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive that begins on January 16, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Sunday, following a virtual meeting with administrators from states and Union Territories on the Co-WIN software which forms the backbone of the last mile vaccine administration.Ram Sewak Sharma, who is the chairman of the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management to combat Covid-19 and member of the National Expert Group on vaccine administration of Covid-19, talked about the Co-WIN software and the principles that shall underpin the technology back-up for the vaccination exercise, the health ministry said in a statement.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“Robust, dependable and agile technology shall form both the foundation and the back-up for the country’s Covid-19 vaccination which shall be the world’s largest immunisation exercise,” Sharma said, adding that this was an unprecedented scale of immunisation.He told the participants of the meeting that the vaccination drive should be citizen-centric, and built on the approach that the vaccine shall be available anytime and anywhere. Sharma also stressed on the need to be flexible without compromising on quality. “The inclusivity, speed and scalability have been kept in mind while designing the unique digital platform with all components being portable, synchronous without excessive and unnecessary dependencies,” he reiterated.The Empowered Group chairperson emphasised on the critical importance of capturing the vaccination data in real time, stating that this was non-negotiable; while the posting of data on the portal may be online or offline in view of connectivity issues being highlighted by few states.He cautioned the members against proxies and asked them to ensure the beneficiaries were “uniquely and undeniably” identified.How to ensure ‘no proxies’?Sharma advised states to urge the beneficiaries to seed their current mobile number with Aadhar for registration and consequent communication through SMS as there cannot be any proxies for Aadhar authentication. He pointed out that it is extremely important to clearly identify the person who is getting vaccinated and keep a digital record on who gets vaccinated by whom, when and which vaccine. He also advised the states and UTs that the data collection should meet the purpose of facilitating work and that needs to be validated at the field levels.To ensure smooth flow if the vaccination drive, the group also discussed issues like session allocation/planning/time slotting, workflow allocation, vaccinator’s allocation, sending SMS to vaccinators and beneficiaries, and connectivity issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/proactively-prepping-for-nationwide-roll-out-of-covid-19-vaccine-govt-101610272605239.html

In a series of tweets, the platform also acknowledged the surge and posted a picture showing the app ranking at number one on iOSapp store.Earlier this week, WhatsApp had started rolling out in-app notifications to users about an update in its Terms of Service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant's products. WhastApp also stated that users will have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp's service which triggered a massive backlash by users globally.However, the company said that it does not retain messages after they are deleted from the servers.The surge in Signal downloads can also be attributed to the richest person on the planet and Tesla CEO, Elon Musk who also joined the conversation on Twitter and asked people to download the app. Since then the app gained overnight popularity.Signal was created by Signal Foundation which was set up by former WhatsApp co-founder Brien Acton who left the former in 2017.It is a free to use app and has similar features like WhatsApp. However, it does not allow to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud. It also does not allow people to automatically add others in groups unless individuals give their assent.Users can also turn on disappearing messages feature for each chat and set a time limit ranging from five seconds to one week. After the set period, the messages in that chat will automatically be deleted.Meanwhile, Telegram, another instant messaging platform also said that it is seeing a surge in downloads as its ranking Telegram’s download ranking on Google Play also rose over the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/signal-telegram-downloads-surge-as-people-look-for-whastapp-alternatives-amid-privacy-concerns-101610267756068.html

The last national vulture census was conducted in 2006,” said a top official of the state forest department.The population of vultures crashed across the country, particularly due to the use of painkiller, Diclofenac, in cattle. The population of most common vultures, including the Oriental white-backed, Long-billed and Slender-billed, declined by more than 96% between 1993 and 2003.At present three vulture species – White-backed, Himalayan Griffon and Slender-billed – are being conserved at the VCBC. For the first time in December 2019, two Himalayan griffons fitted with transmitters were released in the wild from VCBC.On Saturday, two captive-bred White backed vultures fitted with satellite transmitters and six Himalayan Griffons with wing tags were released in the wild. Scientists would be monitoring them to know more about these birds.“The conservation and breeding program at VCBC has been running successfully since 2006. At present, there are 140 vultures. In the last 14 years 76 birds were born in captivity. We are now going to conserve the Asian King Vulture too and increase the number of aviaries so that more vultures could be protected,” said another senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vulture-census-in-bengal-after-14-years-plans-to-conserve-asian-king-vulture-101610270334807.html

Farmers managed to reach the venue despite being stopped some 3km away by the police.ALSO WATCH | JP Nadda addresses farmers, defends farm laws during Bengal visitThe protestors, who easily outnumbered the police, vandalised the event venue which led to a major scuffle with the organisers of the Kisan Panchayat.According to eyewitnesses, a clash first broke out between the farmers marching towards the helipad and the police, which was trying to stop the protesters.When the protesters reached the venue of the Kisan Panchayat, the villagers in favour of the panchayat tried to stop the protesting farmers. However, the protesters outnumbered the cops and the pro-Kisan Panchayat organisers and ransacked the venue, sending cops scurrying for cover.The police used tear gas in an attempt to contain the crowd. The protesting farmers assembled around the venue while police’s attempt to control the situation with the help of the locals failed.The chief minister is yet to reach the venue. His mahapanchayat was aimed to drum up support for the three contentious agriculture laws that have triggered widespread protests in North India.All the roads leading to the village had been blocked by the police with the help of trucks laden with construction material, parked on the roads, to avoid the entry of farmers protesting against the laws. However, it didn’t work.Additional forces from the nearby districts had been called in and duty magistrates were appointed to monitor the law and order situation in Karnal.The farmer union leaders, protesting against the farm laws, first gathered at Karnal's Bastara toll plaza on national highway 44, better known as Delhi-Chandigarh highway.Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, a local leader of The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni, accused the chief minister and BJP leadership of attempting to divide farmers by holding such meetings."What is the logic of holding such meetings in the favour of agriculture laws when the farmers’ stir at Delhi borders (against the laws) has entered its 45th day,” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-ransack-khattar-s-kisan-panchayat-venue-clash-with-pro-farm-laws-group-101610268828536.html
10-01-2021||India||India to get UN tag of international disaster response force for NDRF||India could soon be a part of the United Nations (UN) mandated international disaster rescue operations as its the country's federal contingency force, NDRF, is expected to obtain a globally recognised standardisation later this year, a top ranking official has said.The authorisation will be done by the Switzerland-headquartered INSARAG (or the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group) which is a network of more than 90 countries and organisations under the UN umbrella to deal with urban search and rescue related issues."Just like we have the Bureau of Indian Standards in the country, the UN agency INSARAG standardises disaster response teams across the world. It is an international gold standard," NDRF director general S N Pradhan told PTI in an interview."We are very much in thick of it and hopefully we will get the standardisation in 2021."He further explained the purpose of this categorisation that is possessed by some of India's neighbours like China and Pakistan."If there is a call from the UN to respond to some disaster you will be called upon...you will be an international response force," Pradhan said."It is not that we have not been doing that (going for international rescue operations) but when NDRF went to Japan and Nepal in the past it was a bilateral decision between two countries but with this standardisation it will be a UN mandated task," he said.It will be a matter of great prestige for India that its force is known as an international response force, the DG said.He said an INSARAG committee, comprising Australian and Singaporean experts, has conducted preliminary review of NDRF teams in September, 2019, but the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic put the process on a back burner for a while."Hopefully, in 2021 you will see at least two heavy teams of the NDRF notified as INSARAG teams," he said.The National Disaster Response Force was raised in 2006 to undertake specific tasks of relief and rescue during natural and manmade disasters or life threatening situations. It has 12 operational battalions comprising more than 15,000 personnel based across the country at present while four more battalions are taking shape.Pradhan said this UN standardisation could "trigger a long-term process where more and more of its teams can be certified"."It (INSARAG standardisation) will be a good thing as NDRF is second to none. This could lead to a cascading effect where NDRF can become a national accreditation agency for state disaster response forces and that also could be UN supported.""In Chile and China, the UN has certified their provincial teams so that state teams can also travel across the world for disaster response operations," he said.These are "very exciting developments" and it can add to the profile of India being a great disaster response oriented country where the protocols and standard operating procedures are of world standard, he said.The DG also spoke about reviewing the technology and rescue gadgets used by the force."We are reviewing our technology and changing specifications. It is not bad but authorised items in quality and quantity are 10 years old so it calls for a review.""The review has already been completed and submitted to the government," he said.Pradhan said the force was undertaking "simple but effective" technology changes like using battery-operated saw cutters as compared to those which run on petrol at present."We are reviewing the national emergency communication plan. It is going into phase 2 now. We are going to upgrade, have more in quantity and better equipment which is true to form so that we are able to negate any impact of total collapse of communication in a disaster-hit area," he said.The DG said the force will be upgrading its capacity and equipment in the next two financial years, which will be followed by training.Taining will be made effective in such a way that while NDRF will be the federal force there will be collaboration with other central paramilitary forces like the CRPF, BSF and ITBP and others so that they have their disaster response units ready to "shore up" NDRF when required, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-get-un-tag-of-international-disaster-response-force-for-ndrf-101610268656768.html

However, his crimes go far beyond financing terrorism,” the US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs said on Twitter.“Pakistan should further hold him accountable for his involvement in terrorist attacks, including the Mumbai attacks,” it added.Lakhvi was arrested soon after the carnage in Mumbai in November 2008 on charges of planning, supporting and financing the attacks in India’s financial hub that killed 166 people, including six American nationals. There has been little progress in Pakistan’s efforts to prosecute Lakhvi and six other accused in the Mumbai attacks case despite evidence provided by dozens of witnesses.The LeT commander was freed on bail in the Mumbai attacks case in 2015 and reports had suggested that he had been playing an active role in guiding the UN-designated terror group’s operations even when he was in jail.The Pakistani anti-terrorism court found Lakhvi guilty under three sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act for running a dispensary to raise funds for terror financing. The judge gave Lakhvi separate five-year prison terms under each section, to be served concurrently.This was the first time that Lakhvi has been convicted of a terrorism-related offense. However, a spokesman for the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province told media he was arrested for terror financing and not for any “specific militant attack”.The external affairs ministry said after Lakhvi’s sentencing that Pakistan’s “farcical actions” appeared to be aimed at an upcoming review by the FATF of the country’s efforts to counter terror financing. It also called for “credible action” by Pakistan against all terror groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-lakhvi-s-conviction-tells-pakistan-to-prosecute-him-for-2611-101610267543306.html

In contrast, Ratan Tata goes to Pune and meets the family of one of his former ailing employees in their small house,” he added.Raut alleged that PM Modi’s actions had reduced the significance of the Parliament and concentrated power in his hands. “In the last few years, we have witnessed many constitutional amendments but the government is not ready to repeal the farm laws despite the protests since the last 45 days. They are not even ready to discuss the issue in parliament. This is akin to the emergency,” he added.He alleged that the ruling party’s preparations for the 2024 Parliamentary elections have already begun with finishing off political opponents using central agencies.Recently, Raut’s wife Varsha appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in an alleged money laundering case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-s-latest-attack-on-pm-narendra-modi-has-reference-to-ratan-tata-101610266757214.html

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and several other senior leaders will attend the rally.“Along with Nadda, national general secretary BL Santosh and national vice president and party in-charge for Assam, Baijayant Jay Panda, who is already in Assam, will also take part in the rally in Silchar,” said Ranjeet Kumar Dass.Incidentally, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also launched his Lok Sabha poll campaign from Assam in 2019, with a rally in Silchar. The Barak Valley, which comprises three districts, has been a traditional stronghold of the BJP for over three decades.In 2016 assembly polls, the BJP had won 8 of the 15 seats in Barak Valley while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had won 5 and Congress 2. BJP is hoping to better its tally this time. Last month, Lakhipur Congress MLA Rajdeep Goala resigned from the Assembly and joined the saffron party.“From Silchar, Nadda will visit Guwahati on Monday afternoon and take part in a meeting with party office bearers as well as hold a couple of other organizational meetings. He will spend the night in Guwahati and will leave for Delhi on Tuesday after visiting Kamakhya Temple in the morning,” Dass stated.The BJP president won’t be holding any official talks with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), the two regional parties with which it is expected to enter into a pre-poll alliance.AGP is already part of the BJP-led ruling coalition in Assam while the UPPL, which is heading the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) after last month’s polls, is expected to replace Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF) as BJP’s new partner.BJP performed well in the BTC polls winning nine of the total 40 seats. The party is part of the ruling coalition in Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), which covers four districts in lower Assam. The saffron party also won the Tiwa Autonomous Council (TAC) polls last month, winning 35 of the total 36 seats.“BL Santosh, who will arrive before Nadda, will hold meetings with election sub-committees of the party dealing with social media, manifesto preparation, poll campaign etc. on Monday,” said Dass.BJP, which has 60 seats in the 126-member assembly, is aiming to win over 100 seats this time, along with its pre-poll partners.Opposition Congress is also in poll-mode with party in-charge for Assam, Jitendra Singh, reaching Guwahati on January 8 as part of a five-day visit. Though the party had announced formation of a grand alliance with AIUDF, it hasn’t materialized till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naddas-assam-poll-campaign-to-begin-at-silchar-like-modi-s-2019-campaign-101610265281568.html

The list of private hospitals includes Max, Fortis, Apollo, BL Kapur, and Gangaram, etc. Vaccines to all the centres will be supplied by the Delhi government and will be free for the beneficiaries.The Centre on Saturday said that Covid-19 vaccination drive would begin in the country on January 16, when nearly 30 million healthcare and frontline workers will be inoculated. In the second phase, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, together numbering around 27 crores.As per the ministry, over 61,000 program managers, 200,00 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members have been trained so far as part of the training at the states, districts and block levels.India’s drugs controller on January 3 granted restricted emergency approval to two companies for their Covid-19 vaccines.The first vaccine to become available in Delhi will likely be the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, called Covishield in India, and manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India. The other vaccine that has been granted approval for “restricted use in emergency situations” is Bharat Biotech’s Cavoxin.As of Sunday morning, the country has a total of 10,450,284 confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to the numbers published on the Union health ministry's website. The number of recoveries reached 10,075,950 after more than 19,200 patients recovered from the viral disease in the span of 24 hours. More than 1.5 lakh people have died so far.The spread of the virus has been majorly contained in the country as the daily number of new cases has dropped to less than 20,000 from a peak of almost 98,000 in September last year.

The last round of talks was held on Friday, but it failed to make any headway. The next round of talks will be held on January 15.Meanwhile, Sharma also filed a memo on Saturday in the top court which sought to implead over 40 farmer unions including the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) which is spearheading the farmers' movement, as respondents in the matter.Some other farmers unions which are sought to be impleaded as respondents by the petitioner are – BKU-Sidhupur, BKU-Rajewal, BKU-Lakhowal, BKU-Dakaunda, BKU-Doaba, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha and Kul Hind Kisan Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-seeking-immediate-removal-of-farmers-from-delhi-borders-on-jan-11-101610259434110.html

The farmer leaders have distributed black flags to activists and they are likely to take out a protest march towards the Kaimla village, around 8km from the toll plaza.Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, a local leader of BKU (Charuni), accused the chief minister and BJP leadership of attempting to divide farmers by holding such meetings."What is the logic of holding such meetings in the favour of agriculture laws when the farmers’ stir at Delhi borders (against the laws) has entered its 45th day,” he questioned."Even, the residents of the Kaimla village are against this programme and we are making efforts to ensure that the rally doesn’t take place but the protests will remain peaceful,” he added.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav has said that the union leaders have been told that strict action will be taken against them if they tried to disturb the programme. However, they are allowed to hold their protest peacefully at the Bastara toll plaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khattars-kisan-panchayat-to-support-farm-laws-riles-up-protesting-farmers-101610258308756.html
10-01-2021||India||Labour ministry likely to give shape to National Employment Policy by December||The Ministry of Labour and Employment is likely to give a shape to the National Employment Policy (NEP) by December this year following the implementation of four labour codes and completion of four major surveys, including one one migrant workers.The NEP will draw a broad road map for improving job opportunities in the country, mainly by various initiatives like skill development, bringing investment in employment intensive segments and other policy interventions.Last year, Parliament passed three labour codes on Industrial Relations, Social Security and Occupational Health Safety & Working Conditions (OSH).The Code on Wages was approved by Parliament last year and its rules have been firmed up. But the implementation of the rules for Code on Wages was held back because the government wanted to implement all four labour codes in one go. These four codes are likely to be implemented from April 1 this year.The implementation of these four labour codes would provide a conducive legal framework for universalisation of social security and other safeguards for the entire workforce of over 50 crore in the country.But for job creation, a broad NEP would be required to exploit the potential of each segment of different sectors of the economy. This would require up-to-date data on employment across the sectors in the country. This gap would be bridged by the four employment surveys to be conducted by the Labour Bureau, a wing of the ministry.Talking to PTI, Director General, Labour Bureau, D S Negi told PTI that the bureau has begun spadework on the four surveys and field work would begin by March and the results would be out by October-end this year only.He said the NEP would take a shape based on the data inputs of these four surveys by December this year only.Thereafter, the NEP would be sent for the approval of the Union Cabinet.The document is expected to aid employment generation in the country to a great extent, especially when the government is grappling with the issue of job loss especially due to the pandemic.Earlier last month, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar had also said that the four all India surveys on migrant workers, domestic workers, employment generated by professionals and transport sector which will be launched by early March, 2020 and the results of these will be available by October 2021.The minister had opined that for any evidence-based policy making for these workers, 'authentic data' on employment in organised and unorganised sector enterprises is highly called for.The minister had also informed that the bureau will soon launch an 'All India Quarterly Survey' on Employment of Enterprises' that will provide comprehensive data on the employment numbers in both the organized and unorganized sectors to address these data needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/labour-ministry-likely-to-give-shape-to-national-employment-policy-by-december-101610257098223.html

Under what law & for what crime has he been arrested? This is brazen contempt of court. Request @manojsinha," tweeted Mehbooba Mufti.Officials in the know of the developments said that Parra was rearrested since a powerful group of officials and politicians are opposed to his release and believe he may be popular among the youth in Kashmir.When in jail, Waheed won the DDC elections from Pulwama by defeating a BJP candidate.The Jammu and Kashmir government had recently started gathering details about the properties owned by the PDP youth president in Srinagar on the instructions of the NIA.The office of deputy commissioner of Srinagar had issued a communication to officials seeking details about the properties owned by Parra in the district.Parra was arrested by the NIA for allegedly seeking the terrorist group, Hizbul Mujahideen’s support for Mehbooba during the Parliamentary elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-seeks-l-g-s-intervention-in-waheed-parra-re-arrest-case-101610256902456.html

Three rounds of the dry run have so far been conducted across the country and there is a week's time to improve on weak areas identified during these mock drills.What distinguishes India's vaccination drive from other countries that have already started are the number of people Indian aims to inoculate at free of cost on the first stage and the nature of the vaccines. After once crore health care workers and two crore front line workers, the Centre plans to vaccinate 27 crore people who are at a greater risk of contracting the disease.Also Watch | 'India ready to save humanity with 2 vaccines': PM Modi on Covid, self-relianceHere is all you need to know> Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reiterated that India has a global role in vaccination against Covid-19. "Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world's biggest vaccination programme," he said as he was speaking at Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on Saturday,> The date of January 16 has been chosen because of the festivals including Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu etc.> India has also come up with an application for vaccination registration Co-WIN. During the dry run, states were asked to use the pre-product link of the application, which is not yet launched for public use (https://preprod.co-vin.in/home). Vaccine officials registered the name of health care workers who will be vaccinated at the beginning. The application is not yet available for downloading as the frontline workers do not need to register themselves for getting Covid-19 vaccine. Self-registration is only for people who are at a higher risk of contracting the disease.> The health ministry has also made it clear that though Co-WIN is an Indian app, the government will proactively consider if any other country wants to use the app for their vaccination drive.> To track people above 50 years, the latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections will be used.> Beneficiaries will receive SMS informing them about the date and time of the vaccination. After one dose, they will be notified the date of the second dose. Only after both the doses, they will get their digital certificate.> Before the vaccination drive starts, PM will take stock of the Covid-19 situation of the states.> States have urging the Centre to make vaccine free for all people. The Centre has already said that vaccination of frontline workers will be free.> The PM-CARES ((Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations)Fund may be used for the purchase of the vaccines. The government had earlier allocated ₹100 crore from the fund for the development of vaccines.> In-depth training for vaccination has already been held in all states. Doctors, staff nurses, pharmacists who are legally authorised to give injections will vaccinate people.> There will be vaccine officers 1 who will check the registration status of the beneficiaries. Vaccine officers 2 will verify documents. Vaccine officers 3 and 4 will manage the crowd.> All vaccine booths will arrange for three large rooms: waiting room, vaccinating room, observation room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-cms-tomorrow-before-covid-19-vaccination-begins-from-january-16-what-to-expect-101610254914228.html

BJP MP Tejasvi Surya on Saturday condemned the action and said it is a wake-up call for those who don't yet understand the threat to democracies by unregulated big tech companies. He also urged the Centre to review guidelines for intermediaries. Intermediaries can't interfere into social media content, he said.Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also slammed Twitter for reaping benefits of Trump's "hate speeches" for long and then banning him when he is out of power.A Mumbai-based lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, had approached the Bombay High Court last year seeking blocking of Kangana Ranaut's Twitter account as he alleged the actor of hurting religious sentiments.

This law will help those who get cheated in such cases."Talking about atrocities against women, the actor said, "In countries like Saudi Arabia, those who commit crimes against women are hanged to death at intersections.

As of now I am not confident to tell people to accept this vaccine.”Covaxin is indigenous Covid-19 vaccine being manufactured by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).The vaccine received DCGI approval for phase I & II human clinical trials and the trials commenced across India from July, 2020.After successful completion of the interim analysis from the Phase 1 & 2 clinical trials, Bharat Biotech received DCGI approval for phase 3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India, according to the company website.He, however, said, there is an indication that Covishield vaccine will be made available to the state which would be used at a large scale.Chhattisgarh has completed the mock drill for the distribution and administration of the Covid-19 vaccine in all its 28 districts and has made elaborate arrangements for the vaccination drive, which is expected soon, a health official said.2.53 lakh healthcare personnel will be administered the vaccine in the first phase of the drive in the state, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-health-minister-opposes-use-of-covaxin-101610244259487.html

10-01-2021||India||India’s vaccine drive to kick off on Jan 16||India’s vaccination drive, the world’s largest immunisation exercise against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), will kick off on January 16 with priority to about 30 million health care and frontline workers, the government said on Saturday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it a “a landmark step” in the fight against the pandemic.The Prime Minister chaired a high-level meet to review the status of the infectious disease along with the preparedness of states for the vaccination drive. “The roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine will provide priority to the health care workers and the frontline workers who are estimated to be around 3 cr (30 million), followed by those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 27 cr (270 million),” a statement released by the Union health ministry said.India plans to inoculate 300 million of its 1.3 billion people free of charge in the first six to eight months of this year. The Drug Controller General of India has approved two coronavirus vaccines for emergency use – Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield, which is manufactured locally by the the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which has been cleared for restricted use in emergency situations in “clinical trial mode”, leading to experts questioning the decision because of the shorter duration of human trials and relatively lower data published for the candidate. Both vaccines, the statement from the health ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.On Saturday, Modi was briefed about the preparedness of the Centre in collaboration with states for the roll-out of the vaccine. “On 16th January, India takes a landmark step forward in fighting COVID-19. Starting that day, India’s nation-wide vaccination drive begins. Priority will be given to our brave doctors, healthcare workers, frontline workers including Safai Karamcharis,” he tweeted after the meeting.The PM is scheduled to interact with chief ministers of all states on Monday via video conferencing, where they will discuss the Covid-19 situation and the vaccination roll-out.Three phases of dry runs have been conducted across the country ahead of the vaccination drive. The third round was conducted on Friday across 615 districts in 33 states and Union territories. More than 61,000 programme managers, 200,000 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members have been trained so far at state, district and block levels, according to the health ministry.“After the detailed review, it was decided that in view of the forthcoming festivals including Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu etc., the Covid-19 vaccination will start from 16th January 2021,” the official statement said.“The vaccination exercise is underpinned by the principles of people’s participation (Jan Bhagidari); utilising experience of elections (booth strategy) and Universal Immunization Program (UIP); no compromise of existing healthcare services, especially national programs and primary health care; no compromise on scientific and regulatory norms, other SOPs; and an orderly and smooth implementation driven by technology,” it added.India is ready with two “Made in India” vaccines to protect humanity from Covid-19 even as the world is watching the roll-out of the world’s largest vaccination programme in the country, Modi said.Addressing the virtual inaugural session of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention, Modi said India continues to play its role as the “world’s pharmacy” by getting essential medicines to those most in need around the world. “Today, India is ready to protect humanity with not one but two ‘Made in India’ corona vaccines,” he said, speaking in Hindi. “Today, the world is not only waiting for India’s vaccine, but it is also eyeing how India runs the world’s largest vaccination programme.”The PM was also apprised about the Co-WIN vaccine delivery management system on Saturday. The digital platform will provide real-time information of vaccine stocks, their storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the government. The platform will assist programme managers across all levels through automated session allocation for pre-registered beneficiaries, their verification and for generating a digital certificate upon successful completion of the vaccine schedule. More than 7.9 million beneficiaries have been already registered on the platform, the health ministry said.“As the vaccinators and vaccine administrators comprise a crucial pillar of the vaccination exercise, their training process was detailed out. 2,360 participants were trained during national level Training of Trainers which comprised state immunization officers, cold chain officers, IEC officials, development partners, etc.,” it added.At least seven other vaccines are being developed in India, while some others can be imported from abroad, including the one developed by global pharma giant Pfizer, which has already applied for import and sale in India of its vaccine for emergency use authorisation.In December 2020, the UK became the first country to start vaccination, followed by several other nations, including the US, Belarus, Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Malta, Mexico, Oman, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccine-drive-to-kick-off-on-jan-16-101610224333258.html

Parra was arrested by the NIA for his alleged involvement with the Hizbul Mujahideen on November 25 last year, a few days after filing nomination papers as a People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) candidate. He won the district development council elections from south Kashmir’s Pulwama.The NIA has alleged that Parra had “closed links” with Irfan Shafi Mir, who was earlier arrested along with Naveed Babu and suspended deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh.The agency has claimed that Parra conspired with the other accused to support Hizbul Mujahideen, a charge denied by the PDP which had termed his arrest as “politically motivated”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/niacourt-grants-bail-to-pdp-leader-parra-in-terror-case-101610224083841.html

When asked whether there is patronage to the front by Raje, he said: “So far, there is no such thing but if something happens then we will discuss”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raje-supporters-form-new-front-101610222533073.html
10-01-2021||India||AIADMK council endorses Palaniswami as CM candidate for TN elections||The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) on Saturday endorsed incumbent state chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami as its candidate for the upcoming assembly elections in the state.The AIADMK general council, the party’s top decision-making body also authorised Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam to devise the party’s strategy for the polls and endorsed the appointment of a steering committee, which is likely to play a key role in important matters.The party also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for including Tamil Nadu among the six states under the central lighthouse project.The general council passed 16 resolutions, including urging the Centre to not allow dissolving the provincial councils in Sri Lanka that ensure devolution of powers to Lankan Tamils.“This general council authorises O Panneerselvam and Edapadi K Palaniswami to devise winning strategies to ensure a grand win in the 2021 polls, create an AIADMK-led victory alliance and decide seat-sharing with alliance parties,” the members resolved.The party has earned the public’s praise for “good governance,” it added.The AIADMK had earlier led the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), its constituents being the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), DMDK and PMK among others, in the state for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and its two top leaders have already confirmed the party’s alliance with the BJP.More than 4,500 members were invited to the party meeting today which was held in Chennai’s suburbs. Participants had to submit a Covid-19 negative certificate to enter the meeting.The members said they “unanimously accept the announcement and will work hard to ensure victory” and bring Palaniswami back to the post after the elections.Targeting Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president MK Stalin, the party alleged that he was unable to bear the growing public support for its government, as well as Palaniswami’s administrative acumen and was therefore indulging in “uncultured” criticism of the CM.It condemned Stalin and his DMK supporters for “personal attacks.” In an apparent reference to its arch rival, the party in another resolution said it would strive to “put an end to dynasty politics of one family”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-council-endorses-palaniswami-as-cm-candidate-for-tn-elections-101610222156723.html

Marawi died on December 21.“The volunteer, at the time of enrolment, had fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be accepted as a participant in the Phase III trial and was reported to be healthy in all the site follow-up calls post 7 days of his dosing and no adverse events were observed or reported. As per the post-mortem report issued by the Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal that the site received from the Bhopal Police, the probable cause of death was due to cardio respiratory failure as a result of suspected poisoning and the case is under police investigation,” read the Bharat Biotech statement.“We cannot confirm if the volunteer received the study vaccine or a placebo as the study is blinded,” the company said.To test the efficacy of a vaccine, half of the trial participants are given the actual dose while others are administered a placebo with no benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-of-vaccine-volunteer-not-related-to-dose-bharat-biotech-101610221817475.html
10-01-2021||India||PLA soldier strays across LAC, detained in Ladakh||The Indian Army apprehended a Chinese soldier near the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on Friday after he strayed across the Line of Actual Control (LAC), an official familiar with the developments said on Saturday.“The People’s Liberation Army (PLA soldier) had transgressed across the LAC and was taken into custody by Indian troops deployed in this area (south of Pangong Tso). Troops from either side are deployed along the LAC since friction erupted last year due to unprecedented mobilisation and forward concentration by Chinese troops,” the army said in a statement.This is the second time a Chinese soldier has been held by the Indian Army after straying into Indian territory amid the border standoff between the two sides since May last year.Heights on both banks of the Pangong Tso have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries.The PLA soldier is being dealt with according to procedures, and circumstances under which he crossed the LAC are being investigated, the statement added. The soldier is likely to be returned after completion of formalities, the official said.In October 2020, the Indian Army had apprehended a Chinese soldier in the Demchok sector after he strayed across the LAC. The army identified the soldier as Corporal Wang Ya Long. It then said it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.Corporal Wang was provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes. The soldier was returned to the Chinese side after the investigations and formalities were completed.While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers.The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, where soldiers from the two sides are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-soldier-strays-across-lac-detained-in-ladakh-101610218633345.html
10-01-2021||India||Monitoring real estate projects not our job: Apex court on plea under Article 32||Day-to-day monitoring of construction projects is not the job of the courts and homebuyers should seek remedy against unscrupulous builders from the consumer court, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority or under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the Supreme Court has said.The order passed on Thursday by the top court, which in previous orders had come to the rescue of homebuyers left in the lurch by major real estate firms, is set to deal a blow to several homebuyers contemplating to file a direct petition in the top court under Article 32 for completion of stalled projects or securing refunds.Article 32 guarantees citizens right to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights.The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna said, “Managing a construction project is not within the jurisdiction of the court... This will inevitably draw the court into the day-to-day supervision of the project, including financing, permissions and execution, something which lies beyond the ken of judicial review and the competence of the court.”Purchasers of a commercial real estate project in Noida Sector 62 had approached the court against builders Premia Structures Limited who promised to construct office spaces for petitioners and allegedly collected ₹49 crore for the purpose. The commercial spaces were booked in 2014 with the possession to be handed over by 2018-19, the petitioners said. “Neither the construction took place nor the developer returned the invested sums,” said advocate Shikhil Suri who represented the petitioners. A criminal case was lodged against the developers but the key director has remained absconding till date, the petition stated.Disposing their plea under Article 32, the bench allowed petitioners to avail their remedies under the Consumer Protection Act, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act or the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).“It’s a huge burden on the court. We are an adjudicating body. Should the Supreme Court begin monitoring, there will be hundreds of projects of this nature spread across the country. We will be bogged down by these cases. Let’s not get into policy matters and start running industries. Just because the real estate industry is not running, should Article 32 be the remedy?” observed the court during the hearing.This was in contrast to the top court entertaining writ petitions under Article 32 filed by aggrieved homebuyers led by Chitra Sharma against Jaypee group in August 2017 and another set of homebuyers led by Bikram Chatterji against the Amrapali group in September 2017. In case of Unitech, the Court took up the petitions which came in appeal from the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in October 2016.Incidentally, Justice Chandrachud is heading the bench which is monitoring the Unitech case where close to 25,000 homebuyers are awaiting the court’s nod on a resolution plan offered by Unitech’s reconstituted board to complete the pending housing projects within fixed timelines. Even the Jaypee projects involving nearly 18,000 homebuyers are stuck as no construction has begun on the pending residential projects. The Supreme Court last year reserved orders on a resolution plan submitted by National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) for beginning construction of these projects.The Amrapali projects, involving nearly 47,000 homebuyers, are being monitored by a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court which holds a special sitting every week to know the progress of construction and availability of funds. These projects too are being executed by NBCC after the Supreme Court cancelled the registration of Amrapali under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. This judgment came in July 2019 after a forensic audit ordered by the top court found siphoning of huge amounts of homebuyers’ funds by Amrapali directors.The court acknowledged the pain of the present petitioners but clarified that the Parliament has enacted a statutory regime to protect the rights of purchasers of real estate. These include the Consumer Protection Act 1986, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016 and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monitoring-real-estate-projects-not-our-job-apex-court-on-plea-under-article-32-101610218647467.html
10-01-2021||India||Madhavsinh Solanki: A seasoned politician who had an eye for art||Four-time Gujarat chief minister Madhavsinh Solanki, who died in his sleep at the age of 93 on Saturday, will be remembered as the architect of the KHAM theory that helped the Congress win 149 of 182 assembly seats in 1985, a record that even the subsequent ascendancy of the Hindutva movement failed to break.Much before the Mandal commission report on the status of socially and educationally other backward classes (OBCs), the Solanki government introduced 10% reservation in jobs and educational institutions for OBCs in 1981. Solanki is also remembered as the first CM to introduce a midday meal for schoolchildren.His KHAM (Kshatriya (OBC), Harijan, Adivasi, Muslim) theory of giving a larger share in power positions to members from these communities helped the Congress win elections and retain power in Gujarat for more than a decade and a half.Solanki was the CM of Gujarat four times between 1976 and 1990 and was the country’s external affairs minister under PM PV Narasimha Rao.Solanki’s move to introduce reservations for OBCs resulted in an anti-reservation agitation across the state which led to riots between Hindus and Muslims and between the upper castes and Dalits, resulting in deaths of over a hundred people. Solanki resigned in 1985 only to return to power by winning a record 149 seats.Solanki, after resigning as India’s external affairs minister, withdrew from all political activity and remained confined to his home, spending time on reading books, listening to music and watching movies. As a bibliophile, Solanki was the most widely read politician in Gujarat.As the chief minister, he took a special interest in promoting art, literature, theatre and cinema in Gujarat. It was during his tenure that three film studios came up in the state and the government exempted Gujarati movies from entertainment tax.His friends included eminent lawyers, artists, theatre and movie actors, directors and writers. Solanki was a connoisseur of art, literature and movies. He had a rich library of books and movies. A journalist before he joined politics, Solanki was a member of the legislative assembly of the Bombay state in 1957-60 and then of the Gujarat legislative assembly from 1960-68.Solanki’s cabinet was known to have many highly educated and multifaceted ministers who had done well in various fields – finance, engineering, social work, law and trade union movement. Outside of his cabinet too, Solanki picked up eminent personalities from varied fields to head various state boards and corporations.(The writer is a journalist based in Ahmedabad)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhavsinh-solanki-a-seasoned-politician-who-had-an-eye-for-art-101610218606213.html

This would reduce the cost of subsequent acquisition of the fighter jets.The French offer to make the Panther choppers in India also works well with the government which has been looking to buy medium helicopters for the Indian Navy. The Airbus’ AS565 MBe is an all-weather, multi-role medium helicopter designed for operation from ship decks, offshore locations and land-based sites.According to South Block sources, the India-France strategic dialogue this week has led to forward movement over 9,900 MW Jaitapur nuclear power plant over reactor pricing issues with state-run Electricite de France (EDF) and Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL). The strategic dialogue was headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne, Diplomatic Advisor to French President Emmanuel Macron.According to senior officials, India has decided to consider the French offer of six Airbus 330 multi-role transport tankers on lease while making it clear that French defence technologies shared with Indian military should not be given to its adversaries. To this, the French have informed India that their relationship particularly in the defence sector has reached a new low with Pakistan after Prime Minister Imran Khan attacked President Macron personally over a terrorist incident.It is understood that France will no longer either supply or upgrade French weapon platforms or ammunition with Pakistan. This includes repairs of Mirage III/V fighters as well as Augusta submarines. The same thumb rule will apply to Turkey too, whose authoritarian leader R Erdogan had gone out of his way to launch vitriolic attacks on President Macron.While India and France discussed China and its role in the Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean, Paris has invited Indian Navy to participate in European Maritime Awareness in the Straits of Hormuz (EMSOH) as well as use facilities at the French base in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa. On China, the two sides have decided to build maritime capabilities to ensure that international maritime law is followed in both Indo-Pacific and Indian Ocean through joint surveillance and sharing of intelligence. France’s Chief Military Advisor also accompanied envoy Bonne. France has also offered India to join in trilateral naval exercises with UAE, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia.Although Doval and Bonne had restricted conversation on India-France strategic issues, Paris has offered help in development of engine for twin engine LCA or AMCA with the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as well as making Rafale fighter engines (M-88) under the “Make in India” initiative.At a political level, the French envoy made it clear that it would support India in the UN Security Council and ensure that Beijing’s move to put India in a dock either on cooked up charges of terrorism or Kashmir are stymied. This assurance Bonne made before Prime Minister Narendra Modi as India joins the UNSC for two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-offers-to-shift-panther-chopper-assembly-line-to-india-rafale-too-101610181121676.html
