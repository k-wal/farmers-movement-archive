The Bangladeshi contingent has been invited to take part in the parade at a time the two countries are celebrating the golden jubilee of the birth of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi marching contingent will consist of 96 soldiers. They will be carrying their BD-08 rifles during the march past, a license-produced variant of the Chinese Type 817.62mm assault weapon, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The Bangladesh Ordnance Factories produce more than 10,000 such assault rifles every year.Foreign soldiers took part in the parade for the first time in 2016 when a French army contingent of 130 soldiers marched down Rajpath. Then French President Francois Hollande witnessed the parade as the chief guest that year. The parade this year will be shorter, involve fewer participants and only a fourth of the usual number of spectators will be allowed at Rajpath, with the ceremonial event being curtailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by Hindustan Times on December 30. The marching contingents will be seen in a rectangular formation this year instead of the traditional square formation because of fewer participants being allowed in the squads. These squads will only have 96 participants compared to 144 in the ordinary course. The shortened route of the parade will see it end at the National Stadium instead of Red Fort, the officials said Fewer people will be allowed to witness the parade, with the government following strict social distancing protocols. Not more than 25,000 spectators will be allowed at Rajpath this year, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 will not be permitted at the parade. Last year’s Independence Day celebrations were also muted as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and measures imposed to check the spread of the disease, with fewer VIPs attending the annual August 15 event at Delhi’s Red Fort while school children skipped it altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladeshi-soldiers-to-take-part-in-republic-day-parade/story-4VQZEJHmyIRjXOLSHOhyXL.html

We will fight for our rights that are being taken away by the Narendra Modi government which is doing nothing for the poor...We will contest the upcoming elections to local bodies with the AIMIM,” Vasava told reporters.Owaisi heads the Hyderabad-headquartered All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM).“Well begun is half done! Had a fruitful meeting with BTP chief Chotu bhai Vasava at his house in Bharuch. The long wait of the Gujarati people finally gets over as BTP and AIMIM come together to create new political power,” tweeted Jaleel, who heads Maharashtra unit of the AIMIM and represents Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat in the neighbouring state.He told reporters that both the parties shared the same “ideology” that the country should run according to Constitution.Jaleel said the alliance will emerge a strong challenger for the BJP and the Congress, and will make impact on the upcoming polls.“The alliance with the BTP is a matter of pride for the AIMIM. There is great enthusiasm among people over this tie-up. People in Gujarat will choose us as an alternative,” he said.The BTP has two MLAs in the Gujarat Assembly who had refrained from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections held in June last year.The tribal party had contested the 2017 Assembly elections in alliance with the Congress.But after the newly-elected members of Congress in Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district Panchayat voted for a BJP nominee for the president’s post, which queered the pitch for the BTP-backed candidate, Vasava announced severing of its alliance with the Congress in December.The BTP had allied with the Congress in Rajasthan and supported Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the revolt by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot earlier last year.Elections to six municipal corporations, including Ahmedabad, 55 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka pachayats were supposed to be held in November, 2019, a month before their five-year terms came to end, but were postponed by three months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-joins-hands-with-btp-to-contest-local-polls-in-gujarat/story-4oefjucTuPzmpIMMVdFVDK.html

A total of 286 session sites spread across 125 districts were conducted and more than 75 lakh beneficiaries have already been registered on Co-WIN software till date, the health ministry said. Around 1,14,100 vaccinators have been trained so far. The dry run helps states and local authorities identify areas where they need to develop — in training or in arranging for more spacious areas for vaccination — so that the actual vaccination process does not encounter any glitch.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said vaccine in the state will be available around January 14, during the Makar Sankranti festival. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja said the Centre will send vaccine stocks within two to three days. Meanwhile, the subject expert committee of Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation on Saturday made three crucial recommendations. It has granted Serum Institute of India the permission for restricted emergency use of the vaccine, subject to multiple regulatory conditionalities.Free Covid-19 vaccine for all frontline workers in 1st phase: Harsh VardhanBharat Biotech too got recommendation from the committee for restricted use of its vaccine in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode specially in the context of infection by mutant strains.Cadila Healthcare got the permission for the conduct of its third phase of clinical trial. Union health minister Harshh Vardhan, as he took stock of the dry run exercises, said vaccine to frontline workers will be administered free. He said the details of how 27 crore priority beneficiaries -- those above 50 years of age and those below it having comorbidities -- would be vaccinated until July were being finalised.Covid-19 vaccination dry run underway; health minister urges people not to pay heed to rumoursIn Delhi, the dry-run was being conducted in state capitals in at least three session sites.

We will not compromise on any protocol before approving a vaccine,” Vardhan said adding that vaccine hesitancy was an issue even when the country started polio immunisation drive.In West Bengal, the dry run was held at Urban Primary Health Centres in Duttabad and Madhyagram and Amdanga Rural Hospital in North 24 Parganas district. A senior official in Assam said the dry run will continue regularly in the state till actual vaccination takes place.Tamil Nadu Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said overall, the processes worked successfully. The dry run was held at three centres each in the districts of Chennai, Tiruvallur, Nilgiris and Tirunelveli, and five in Coimbatore. Representatives of the World Health Organization too were present.“An initial learning was that the room earmarked for vaccination should be more spacious,” the secretary said, as reported by PTI. An important focus of the dry run was on the management of any possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), and adherence and management of infection control practices at the session site to prevent disease transmission, the union health ministry had said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-1-of-nationwide-dry-run-concludes-as-two-covid-19-vaccines-await-final-nod/story-gA2yp3PR2JMoEtA9PxQJ8H.html

He said the Aam Aadmi Party demands Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, MP Gautam Gambhir and the three mayors of the municipal corporations come clean on this “massive scam”.Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it is sad that the Aam Aadmi Party has chosen to start the New Year with a “blatant lie” on Trommel machines used at landfill sites.“AAP spokesperson Durgesh Pathak has alleged that MCDs are indulging in a scam in Trommel machines by making a five-year hire contract which is a lie. Secondly, Pathak says Trommel machine costs around 17 lakhs which, too, is a lie. Trommel machine contracts are on an annual renewal basis with the EDMC & others. So there is no logic of calculating on a five-year basis as is done by Durgesh Pathak today,” he said.Trommel machine costs Rs 52 lakhs which can be verified by the market, and the MCDs have hired them at 6 lakhs per month inclusive of full usage & maintenance expenses, he said.Each machine runs 24-hour a day with a driver and an operator on each machine working in 3 shifts. This apart, it has oil expenses and high maintenance expenses which are borne by the supplier company, he said. The company has to provide operative Trommels 365 days a year. The operation expenses of each machine runs upto over 5 lakhs a month, he added.Kapoor has said it will be better if AAP leaders crosscheck facts before making “politically-biased” allegations against MCDs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-bjp-spar-over-cleaning-of-landfills/story-8SLuxsRNnEk35QYS7OiFzI.html

This was possible thanks to the effective cooperation among multiple agencies in three countries to deliver the relief material to Fiji in record time,” it added.The Ministry said that India has firmly stood by Fiji during times of crisis and devastation caused by natural disasters like Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016.“The relief material sent now in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Yasa highlights India’s commitment to providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) support to Friendly Foreign Countries as a first responder,” it added.Disaster Risk Reduction and Management is an important pillar of India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2019, the Ministry noted, adding that India remains committed to extend full support to Fiji’s efforts to restore livelihoods of the affected communities and to build resilient infrastructure.

02-01-2021||India||Scientists outline steps for safely receiving Covid-19 vaccine||Following accounts of potential allergies to the Covid-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, scientists have outlined steps on safely receiving the second dose of the therapeutic in individuals who develop a reaction to their first dose.The research, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, summarised what is currently known about allergic reactions to vaccines like those developed against Covid-19. In the study, a team of experts led by allergists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the US, proposed detailed advice so that individuals with different allergy histories can safely receive their Covid-19 vaccine. After closer review of the data related to allergic reactions, the US FDA recommended that the mRNA vaccines, based on the genetic material of the novel coronavirus, be withheld only from individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the Covid-19 vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advised that all patients be observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination by staff who can identify and manage such reactions. In the review research, Aleena Banerji, MD, clinical director of the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Unit at MGH and her colleagues outlined steps on safely receiving the second dose in individuals who develop a reaction to the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. “Our guidelines are built upon the recommendations of US regulatory agencies and provide clear steps to the medical community on how to safely administer both doses of the vaccine in individuals with allergic histories,” Banerji said. According to the experts, allergic reactions to vaccines are rare, with a rate of about 1.3 per 1 million people. They said the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will have a similarly low rate of occurrence of allergic reactions. The researchers recommend that individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to an injectable drug, or vaccines containing polyethylene glycol or polysorbate speak with their allergists before being vaccinated. Banerji and her co-authors also suggested that vaccine clinics monitor all patients for 15 to 30 minutes to manage any allergic reactions that occur. They said even patients with severe allergies to foods, oral drugs, latex, or venom can safely receive the Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-outline-steps-for-safely-receiving-covid-19-vaccine/story-ej9t4QG372pu0apwKPAYNK.html

The subject expert panel of India’s drug regulator on Saturday has recommended it for emergency use. While the final nod rests with the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Covaxin moving a step closer to getting approval carries major significance for India in the global scenario as 10 countries have already shown interest in India’s first home-grown vaccine. 10 million doses of the vaccine have already been produced for the Indian market.Here is all you need to know about this vaccine:Made-in-India vaccine: This is the first made-in-India vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology.Inactivated vaccineAn inactivated vaccine is one which is developed by inactivating (killing) the live microorganisims that cause the disease. This destroys the pathogen’s ability to replicate, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognise it and produce an immune response. There are many inactivated vaccines against Hepatitis A, Influenza, Polio, Rabies, which offer “excellent protection”, Bharat Biotech has said.Expert panel recommends Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency useCovaxin’s efficacy as proved in animal studiesBharat Biotech in its report published after animal studies said that its vaccine candidate showed protective efficacy. The vaccine candidate was administered in 20 rhesus macaques, divided in four groups. One group was administered with placebo, while three other groups were immunised with three different vaccine candidates. “To summarize, the vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” it said. Covaxin’s human clinical trial outcomesThe third phase of trial is still going on, while the company has already published the findings of the first two rounds. It followed a double-bind, randomised, multi-centre phase two clinical trial which included children as well. Efficacy to be determined only after two shotsAfter Haryana minister Anil Vij tested positive after receiving one dose of the vaccine during the trial, the company clarified that the efficacy is to be determined only after 14 days post the second dose. Also, as its trial was random in which some received the vaccine and some received placebo, there was no way to know whether the minister received a vaccine shot or a placebo shot. PriceUnion health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has on Saturday clarified that the first phase of vaccination which will include frontline workers will be free. There has been no talk on the price of Covaxin though Dr Krishna Ella, the MD of Bharat Biotech, earlier said that the vaccine will be cheap, cheaper than a water bottle, he had said in a conference, pointing to a water bottle. Since his comment, it has been estimated that it will come at a cost lower than Rs 100. InvestmentAccording to reports, Bharat Biotech’s total investment is about Rs 350-400 crore for the development of the vaccine, including new manufacturing facilities, investment for trials etc.Covaxin in other countriesBharat Biotech has already signed a letter of intent with US firm Ocugen to co-develop Covaxin for the US market. The company was also in talks with 10 countries in South America, Asia and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-vaccine-gets-primary-clearance-all-you-need-to-know-about-covaxin-s-efficacy-price/story-oMQlTg6bvaDoLyyRQou5cO.html
02-01-2021||India||CDS General Bipin Rawat visits air bases in eastern sector, meets frontline soldiers||In his first official engagement outside the Capital in the New Year, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Saturday visited India’s forward air bases in the eastern sector and interacted with frontline soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh amid a border row with China in eastern Ladakh, officials said. “Nothing can deter the Indian armed forces from remaining steadfast in their call of duty,” an official statement quoted Rawat as saying. While the current border row is confined to the Ladakh theatre, the Indian military is on high alert to deal with any misadventure by the Chinese forces all along the border --- stretching from Ladakh in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. Rawat completed one year as India’s first CDS on December 31. As CDS, Rawat is the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs, and is the single point military adviser to the defence minister. The CDS interacted with personnel from the army, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Special Frontier Force in Dibang Valley and Lohit Sector of Arunachal Pradesh, the statement said. Complimenting the soldiers for their operational readiness, Rawat said that only Indian soldiers could remain vigilant under the challenging conditions and they were willing to go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the country’s farthest frontiers. Rawat’s visit to the eastern sector comes at a time of deadlocked military and diplomatic talks between India and China to ease tensions in the Ladakh theatre. Earlier this week, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that talks with China on disengagement and de-escalation in the Ladakh sector --- where the two countries have been locked in a border row for eight months --- had not yielded any meaningful solution. Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are firm about holding forward positions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) through the harsh winter months. Both sides are expected to hold the ninth round of military talks to reduce border tension but there is no indication of when India and China will hold the dialogue. Both countries had agreed to hold the corps commander-level dialogue at an early date during diplomatic talks on the dispute on December 18. While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-general-bipin-rawat-visits-air-bases-in-eastern-sector-meets-frontline-soldiers/story-6NcDExYrZp6e18dcdRTNlI.html

02-01-2021||India||LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi arrested on charges of terror financing||Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, one of the alleged masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, was arrested by Pakistani authorities on Saturday on charges of involvement in terror financing, almost five years after he was freed on bail. Lakhvi’s whereabouts had not been known since he was released on bail from a jail in Rawalpindi in April 2015. However, it was widely believed that he had continued playing a key role in directing the activities of the LeT even while he was in prison after being arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage. A spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan’s Punjab province said in a statement that Lakhvi was arrested on charges of terrorism financing during an intelligence-based operation conducted by the department. “Today, on 2 January 2021, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was arrested in a case of terrorism financing registered by the CTD Punjab in Police Station CTD Lahore,” the spokesperson said. “He is accused of running a dispensary [and] using funds collected for terrorism financing. He [and] others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the spokesperson added. Lakhvi, who is also a UN-designated terrorist, will face trial in an anti-terrorism court in Lahore, the spokesperson said. There was no immediate reaction to the arrest from Indian officials. A person familiar with developments noted, however, that Lakhvi was arrested on terror financing charges and that there had been little progress in efforts to prosecute him for his suspected role in the Mumbai attacks. Lakhvi was one of seven men arrested in the wake of the Mumbai attacks for allegedly helping plan, support and finance the terrorist assault on India’s financial hub that killed 166 people. The arrest came weeks ahead of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) planned reassessment of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing. In October last year, the multilateral watchdog retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, and gave the country time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”. Last month, LeT founder Hafiz Saeed was convicted for the fifth time on terror financing charges and given a jail term of fifteen-and-half years. In November last year, Saeed was given two separate five-year prison terms under provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act for using and providing funds for acts of terrorism in two cases of terror financing. He was also given a six-month prison term for being a member of a banned group. Saeed was also given two sentences of five-and-a-half-years in February 2020. The sentences will run concurrently. While Lakhvi was in prison following his arrest in December 2008 for the Mumbai attacks, he spent his time at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail in “relative luxury”, according to a BBC report.

02-01-2021||India||Pups named after Ladakh fronts inducted into ITBP canine squad||Galwan, Shyok and Rezang along with 14 other Belgian Malinois puppies were on Wednesday inducted into the combat canine ranks of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force that guards the country’s LAC with China.A ‘namkaran parade’ or ceremonial naming event was held at the training centre of the force in Bhanu near Chandigarh where its veterinary cadre chief DIG Sudhakar Natarajan adorned each pup with a special collar bearing its name and touched them with a silver sword on the right shoulder as a sign of induction into the ranks.   The ITBP handlers who carried them subsequently presented a crisp salute with a promise to keep them healthy, safe and fit for fighting.The puppies have been named after the various strategic geographical locations of the Ladakh sector where the ITBP is deployed as part of its primary task to guard the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.  The paramilitary force along with the Army is engaged in an standoff with the Chinese military in this region at present.PTI had reported earlier this month about the naming of these puppies, at the forces’ National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) at Bhanu, as Ane-la, Galwan, Sasoma, Shyok, Chang-Chenmo, Chip-Chap, Daulat, Rezang, Rango, Charding, Imis, Yula, Srijap, Sultan-Chuksu, Mukhpri, Chung-Thung and Khardungi.They were born during September-October and their father Gala is deployed for counter-terrorist duties while mothers Olga and Olyshea who are sisters undertake anti-Maoist operations with the ITBP troops in Chhattisgarh. The pups will now be trained for infantry patrol and anti-terrorist roles at the Bhanu training academy over the next few months. DIG Natarajan said there are three fundamental reasons for naming these puppies after strategic locations.  “One is we are doing away with the practice of giving our canine buddies westernised names. Secondly, our troops deployed in bone numbing, blood freezing high altitude borders would feel a sense of pride when they call out the names enmeshed deeply into our force’s ethos and glory instead of calling out to an Elizabeth or a Julius Cesar or Hamlet,” he said.He stated the third reason to be that these names are “a crisp salute to all our troops deployed all along the excruciatingly tough borders, keeping the nation safe”. It has been decided, he said, that the next batch of canines will be named on the lines of regions and border posts present along the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh. The Belgian Malinois breed of dogs first shot to international fame after they assisted the US Navy SEALs in the 2011 operation that killed Osama bin Laden in his safe haven in Pakistan and were later famously called as the ‘Osama hunters’.A senior officer said the puppies were later treated to a ‘bara khana’ or grand feast in military style. The menu consisted delicious bone broth soup tempered with powdered dog kibbles and garnished with puppy milk formula powder.This dog breed, since it was introduced in India about a decade ago, is being extensively used by the central security forces and police units in anti-Naxal operations and for counter-terrorist tasks as they are considered ferocious and most suitable for such duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pups-named-after-ladakh-fronts-inducted-into-itbp-canine-squad/story-QIYd2kAKk0Ibj2DsoqXSzO.html
02-01-2021||India||Expert panel recommends Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use||Covaxin, the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology, became the second vaccine in India to inch one step closer to the final approval for emergency use. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Saturday recommended Covaxin for restricted emergency use. On Friday, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield was given the recommendation. Both will now have to wait for the final approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). Also Read: Govt’s expert panel approves AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for emergency useThe development comes on a day a nationwide dry run exercise of vaccination was conducted under the supervision of the Union health ministry. Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said India is perhaps the only country which has several vaccine candidates almost ready.Bharat Biotech had applied for emergency-use authorisation first on December 7. The expert panel at that time asked the firm to submit its safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial for further consideration. On Friday, as the expert panel looked into the details of both Covishield (Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech), it asked Bharat Biotech to expedite volunteer recruitment for the ongoing third phase trial. A day after came the recommendation.Also Read: SII’s Covishield approval: Efficacy, cost and all about AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccineBoth the vaccine candidates have been recommended for restricted emergency use which comes with a few riders. For Oxford vaccine, the panel has imposed certain regulatory provisions, including that the shot is indicated for active immunisation in individuals of 18 years or more to prevent the disease and that it should be administered intramuscularly in two doses at an interval of four to six weeks.Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate is an inactivated one which is developed by inactivating (killing) the live microorganisims that cause the disease. This destroys the pathogen’s ability to replicate, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognise it and produce an immune response. There are many inactivated vaccines against Hepatitis A, Influenza, Polio, Rabies, which offer “excellent protection”, Bharat Biotech has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-recommends-bharat-biotech-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/story-s6WDwjh8GdtFqByZHSHR5N.html
02-01-2021||India||In a first, India successfully isolates, cultures UK-variant of Sars-CoV-2: ICMR||In a first, India has successfully isolated and cultured the UK-variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in a tweet on Saturday. “UK-variant of the virus, with all signature changes, is now successfully isolated and cultured at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) from the clinical specimens collected from UK-returnees,” the country’s apex medical body wrote on Twitter. It said that Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, was being tracked through the countrywide network of ICMR-laboratories since early days of the epidemic in India. No country has yet reported successful isolation and culture of the UK variant, according to ICMR. Vero cell lines were used by the scientists of ICMR-NIV to culture the UK-variant of the virus, it added. India has reported 29 cases of the new coronavirus variant, that is spreading rapidly around Britain and other countries, within five days of tracing its first such infection. The new United Kingdom variant genome of Sars-CoV-2 – B.1.1.7, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last 38 days. India successfully cultures the new viral strain on the horizon (UK-variant of SARS-CoV-2). #ICMRFIGHTSCOVID19 #IndiaFightsCOVID19 #CoronaUpdatesInIndia #COVID19 #Unite2FightCorona @MoHFW_INDIA @PIB_India @DrHVoffice @drharshvardhan @AshwiniKChoubey @icmr_niv pic.twitter.com/vaCMQMSHOJFrom November 25 to December 23, 2020, midnight, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect Covid-19.Apart from India, the presence of the new strain of the mutant virus has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.As a precautionary measure, the aviation ministry has restricted the operations of flights between India and the UK. Flights from India to the UK can start on January 6, while operations from the UK to India will begin on January 8. The schedule is valid till January 23, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri clarified on Saturday.The ministry has also issued a set of guidelines for travelling between the two nations.

02-01-2021||India||Congress’ opposition to rename Aurangabad won’t affect alliance: Shiv Sena||Two days after Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said his party would strongly oppose any proposal that seeks to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said its resistance will not affect the three-party MVA government in the state.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved when all the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies- Sena, NCP and Congress- sit together and talk.On Thursday, Thorat had asserted that the Congress would oppose any proposal to rename Aurangabad, saying that changing the names of places was not part of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the three ruling parties.It was the Shiv Sena, which had first made the demand to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar over two decades ago.Also Read | Maharashtra: Shiv Sena, Congress fight over renaming Aurangabad; BJP mocks themA proposal to that effect had been passed in the general body meeting of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in June 1995, which was challenged by a Congress corporator in the high court and later in the Supreme Court.In its party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said, “The Congress has opposed the proposal of renaming Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar. It has made the BJP happy. But the Congress’s opposition to the proposal is not new and therefore, linking it to the MVA government is foolishness.” “Even if the name has not been changed in the government records, Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar when there was Congress’s chief minister in the state. The people had also accepted it,” it said.“But some people feel that the issue of renaming Aurangabad will create friction within the ruling alliance,” the Sena said in a veiled attack on the BJP.“Thorat announced that if any proposal for renaming Aurangabad comes up before the MVA government, his party would oppose it. It is his claim. After his statement, BJP leaders started demanding that the Sena should make its stand clear on the issue. But the Sena has not changed its stance on it.” “Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar 30 years ago, which was accepted by the people.And it will soon be changed officially as well,” it said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said BJP leader Chandrakant Patil asked that if Allahabad’s name can be changed to Prayagraj, Faizabad’s to Ayodhya, why cant Aurangabad’s name be changed to Sambhajinagar.“But we want to ask why the party did not do so when it was in power in Maharashtra,” the Sena added. “Any state requires a foundation of self-respect and even the Congress will agree that Aurangazeb was not a secular person. The Muslims in Maharashtra have stood behind the Shiv Sena. They want development and welfare,” it said.“It is an insult to the memory of Chhatrapati ShivajiMaharaj that a city in Maharashtra should bear Aurangazeb’s name, who brutally killed ChhatrapatiSambhaji Maharaj,” it said.“But what Thorat is saying is right. The Maharashtra government is duty-bound to implement the CMP of giving justice to the downtrodden and the farmers,” it added.Congress’s opposition to the renaming proposal will not affect the MVA alliance, it said.Meanwhile, Raut said, “Thirty years ago, Balasaheb Thackeray gave the name Sambhajinagar. Only paper work is left now. When all the MVA allies sit together and talk, the issue would get resolved.” The renaming of Aurangabad was not a political issue, he said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam said the MVA government has been formed to work and not change the names of cities.“The CMP doesn’t mention changing name of Aurangabad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-opposition-to-rename-aurangabad-won-t-affect-alliance-shiv-sena/story-KleAiI91L9p3IOSL18qAML.html
02-01-2021||India||Nothing can deter Indian Armed Forces from remaining steadfast in call for duty: CDS||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Saturday hailed India’s defence forces for remaining vigilant under any challenging circumstances. “Nothing can deter the Indian Armed Forces from remaining steadfast in their call for duty,” he was quoted as saying by new agency ANI. Rawat made the comment during his visit to the forward military bases along the China border in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam as he completed one year in office on Friday. After witnessing measures adopted by troops to maintain effective surveillance and enhanced operational readiness, General Rawat said,“Only Indian soldiers could remain vigilant under such challenging situations — ever-willing to go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the borders,” according to ANI. Rawat had taken charge as the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) on January 1 last year. “The CDS has a task cut out: To make all three services work in a cohesive manner. We will work as team,” he had said soon after assuming office. As part of his current role after serving as Army chief for three years, General Rawat is the principal military adviser to the defence minister on all matters related to the tri-services. “As team, we will work towards a goal where 1+1+1 is either five or seven, and not three. What I mean is, the synergised effort should not be the sum of the whole, it should be much more. And we have to achieve that through integration,” he said after taking charge. Meanwhile in Kashmir, the Army has set up a ‘feedback and grievances’ helpline as part of its efforts to strengthen the bond with the people. “As part of Indian Army’s efforts to further strengthen the bond of friendship between the Aawam and Jawan, a ‘feedback and grievances’ helpline has been established under the aegis of Chinar Corps,” a defence spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-can-deter-indian-armed-forces-from-remaining-steadfast-in-call-for-duty-cds/story-csidoi6fWbM1gba7JMQI0L.html

We want people of Goa to be safe. We want business activity to continue and sustain. They (tourists) have to ensure that they wear a mask and maintain social distancing. We will recommend strict action against hotels and clubs that do not maintain the SOPs,” Rane told a press conference on Saturday.Rane, at the last minute on the New Year’s eve, pitched for a night curfew in Goa, a move that could have potentially derailed the state’s New Year’s eve celebrations that were planned by various hotels and nightclubs. However, he was overruled by chief minister Pramod Sawant who said that there would be no night curfew in the state but that norms would have to be followed.Visuals emerging from across the state, however, revealed that revellers were seen thronging the popular hotspots, often gathering in groups, without masks.Also read: Free Covid-19 vaccine for all frontline workers in 1st phase - Harsh Vardhan“Tourists should realise they are coming here to enjoy. But they should have responsibility. 60 per cent of people wear masks only at the airports.

The government should increase the fine to Rs 500 on beaches. These people will not understand. We want Goa to be looked up as a topmost tourist destination. I am not saying do not go to the beach, go to the beach but maintain social distancing,” Rane said.“I am sorry there will be a spike and the spike will be uncontrollable. Reporting cases in time will help us keep the count down,” Rane also said.Goa is seeing around 100 fresh cases of Covid-19 each day which is lower than the 500-odd daily cases that were being recorded at the peak of the infection in September last year. However, the state has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths per million having registered more than 700 deaths till date and more than 50,000 registered cases cumulatively so far which is more than 3 per cent of the state’s population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-act-against-hotels-clubs-not-following-covid-19-norms-goa-health-minister/story-EY4ymR1cCAjJKJuzouQe8O.html

The United Kingdom has given the nod to Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccine.The United States has approved the emergency use of Pfizer. But India, as it already has three applications, is likely to get more than one vaccine for emergency use, the minister implied.At present, six Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials in India, including the frontrunners Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield is the Oxford vaccine developed by Astrazeneca and Pune’s Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenous one being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Apart from these two, there are ZyCOV-D being developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd in Ahmedabad in collaboration with the Centre’s Department of Biotechnology, and NVX-CoV2373, which is being developed by Serum Institute in collaboration with Novavax.

The terms were due to end on Sunday and Monday.State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar has said the elections to local bodies will be held in February. The government has opposed the move saying the entire official machinery will be busy with Covid-19 vaccination programme then.The high court last week ruled Kumar is the final authority to decide the schedule for the elections and directed the government to constitute a three-member committee to discuss the poll schedule.Kumar and the government have been at loggerheads since March last year over the conduct of local elections. The process for the elections was stalled due to Covid-19 pandemic.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has accused Kumar of stalling the election process in collision with opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He alleged Kumar sought to benefit the TDP because he belongs to the community of N Chandrababu Naidu, the head of the party.The government removed Kumar through an ordinance in April that sought to reduce the term of the state election commissioner from five to three years.Kumar moved the high court challenging the ordinance and got an order in his favour on May 29. The Supreme Court upheld the high court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-extends-term-of-special-officers-in-andhra-local-bodies/story-yYhWXVWbiuQk61wOPyPzeL.html

Speaking at a programme here, he said, “We initiated the campaign against Covid-19 in March 2020 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and at the beginning of this year we could say firmly that the dry run of the vaccine will be held on January 5 across the state and the vaccine will be available near around Makar Sankranti.” The chief minister added that a dry run of the vaccine is being held at some places in the state on Saturday. Adityanath was speaking while laying the foundation stone of Advocate’s Building at the collectorate campus here on Saturday. On Friday, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended granting permission for restricted emergency use of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, paving the way for the roll-out of the first Covid-19 shot in the country in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-available-in-up-near-makar-sankranti-yogi-adityanath/story-4adYklwlqIayVpYhDo6oBK.html
02-01-2021||India||‘How can I trust BJP’s Covid-19 vaccine’: Akhilesh Yadav won’t get vaccinated for now||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said he was not going to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for now as the “BJP government cannot be trusted”. “I am not going to get vaccinated for now. How can I trust BJP’s vaccine, when our government will be formed everyone will get free vaccine. We cannot take BJP’s vaccine,” the SP president said. Yadav also attacked the Yogi Adityanath led-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over its handling of the pandemic. “Why cold-chain and refrigerators for vaccine now? This government was warding off Covid by clanging plates, claps, and hovering helicopters over hospitals,” he said while addressing the media a press conference at the party office in Lucknow. Soon after the SP chief’s remarks, minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur told news agency ANI, “Akhilesh Yadav’s statement that he ‘won’t get vaccinated as it’s a BJP vaccine’ is very unfortunate...What can be more unfortunate than a young leader linking Covid-19 vaccine with a political party. It shows Akhilesh Yadav can’t think above politics.”Yadav was addressing the press conference on the sidelines of an event in which religious leaders from Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh communities from Ayodhya gathered to extend support to him and his party. Ahead of assembly elections in the state slated for 2022, the SP chief announced he would withdraw civic taxes (water, house, sewer) for people of Ayodhya. “It is the land of Maryada Purshottam Ram. It’s a religious place. If this government does not withdraw the civic taxes, our government will.” He added that he was a religious person and had a temple at home, outside, and had made one inside the chief minister’s residence when he was the chief minister.

02-01-2021||India||Police probe Srinagar jeweller’s murder as little-known group claims responsibility||Investigators are probing whether business rivalry could have been the motive behind a 70-year-old jeweller’s killing in Srinagar on Thursday even as a little-known group has claimed responsibility for murdering him for acquiring property in the city under the region’s new domicile rules. The rules were formulated in 2020, a year after the end of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status that, among other things, prevented people from outside the region from owning property and getting jobs in the Union Territory. Satpal Nischal, the jeweller, who ran a shop for over four decades on Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street, was from Punjab’s Gurdaspur Punjab. He had purchased a house and a shop after acquiring domicile status for him and his family as per the new rules. Police said they have obtained some leads from the murder scene and were looking at all angles, including The Resistance Front (TRF)’s claim that it murdered Nischal. “We are investigating the case and are even looking what TRF has said in a Facebook post,” said sub-divisional police officer Shahjahan Ahmad, who is involved in the investigation into the murder. In the Facebook post, the TRF claimed Nischal was part of what it described as a “settler-colonial project” in Kashmir. It added he was murdered in an “intelligence-based operation” while calling Nischal an agent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological fountainhead. The TRF claimed Nischal was “posing as a businessman” and added he “was an active participant” in the demographic change and settler project “run by Hindutva fascists to alter the demography of Kashmir”. The post said TRF has warned Indian nationals irrespective of faith, caste, or colour that they will be treated as RSS agents and not civilians if they come to Kashmir with the intention of settling here. “For a long time, we warned and now the time has come when we shall warn no more. We know your names, we know where you live and we know what you do and we are coming for you,” said the TRF post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-probe-srinagar-jeweller-s-murder-as-little-known-group-claims-responsibility/story-MPumjuc0LOsyduwzMNRriN.html

Our government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers is unparalleled,” Javadekar tweeted.On Friday, over 850 academicians from different parts of the country came out strongly in support of the agricultural reform laws brought by the government, saying these Acts seek to free farm trade from restrictions and enable farmers to sell their produce at competitive prices.In a statement, the academicians who also include a few Vice-Chancellors, said that union government has repeatedly assured the farmers that these three farm laws will not do away with Minimum Support Price (MSP) “but rather free the farm trade from all illicit market restrictions, open the market beyond ‘mandis’ and further assists the small and marginal farmers to sell their produce at market/competitive prices”.“The new laws also provide full autonomy for farmers to sell their produce. We strongly believe in the government’s assurance to the farmers to protect their livelihoods. The government is still firmly committed to delivering the principle of minimum government, maximum governance,” the statement said.“We stand in solidarity with both the government and the farmers and salute their intense efforts. We all will live, progress, and develop together and peacefully,” the academicians said.The statement comes amid continued protest by farmers on Delhi borders against the three laws - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The government and farmers have held six rounds of talks so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-s-commitment-to-welfare-of-farmers-unparalleled-prakash-javadekar/story-QCN3xyasAddIoXBhGSlIdO.html
02-01-2021||India||Airtel writes to DoT, says Jio’s charges against it baseless, outrageous||After Jio’s purported allegations that channel partners of rival telcos were inciting and provoking agitators involved in tower disruption, Airtel has shot-off a letter to the telecom department slamming the charges as baseless and outrageous.Airtel has told the Department of Telecom (DoT) that Jio’s allegations against it did not demonstrate any evidence that Bharti had any hand in the ongoing issues that the company is facing, and that the complaint should be dismissed “with the contempt that it deserves”.The letter by Airtel to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said the company is aware of a complaint made by Reliance Jio to the department dated December 28, in reference to the disruption of RJIL (Reliance Jio) services due to farmer’s protests in Punjab and Haryana.Airtel noted that a similar allegation had been levelled by Jio in a letter to the telecom regulator earlier in December to which the company had responded.“The baseless allegation made by Jio that Airtel is behind the farmer agitation to ‘sabotage’ their network and to force customers to switch to Airtel is therefore simply outrageous,” Bharti Airtel’s Chief Regulatory Officer Rahul Vatts said in the letter to the DoT dated December 28.Airtel added that Jio’s complaint does not bear any evidence that Airtel has any hand in the ongoing issues that Jio is facing.“In fact, we are amused as to how Jio can even believe that Airtel would be so omnipotent as to make customers forcibly port out of Jio. If we had this power, we would have exercised it over the last three years when Jio amassed a massive number of customers,” Airtel said.Jio’s letter to the DoT had claimed that “majority of the current sabotage and damage of RJIL network in Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country is as a result of the blatant efforts by some of the distributors, retailer and channel partners of Airtel and VIL in a malicious and inciteful campaign to capitalise on the ongoing farmers protest”.Jio had said the target of the campaign was to disrupt its services and leverage these disruptions to promote mobile number portability to other networks.Jio has said in its letter that “evidences clearly and unimpeachably demonstrate the direct involvement of channel partners of Airtel and VIL in these disruptions as well as Airtel and VIL’s (Vodafone Idea) ineffectiveness in controlling them”.A mail sent by PTI to Reliance Jio on the issue did not elicit a response.Meanwhile, rubbishing the charges levelled against it, Airtel said Jio’s complaint against the company was “in poor taste” and urged the telecom department to dismiss this complaint “with the contempt that it deserves”.“We have seen a history of Jio going to any length to make baseless allegations, adopt bullying tactics and use intimidatory behaviour to suit their purposes and meet their goals. This is another such instance,” Airtel said in its letter to the DoT.Airtel said that it has operated in the telecom industry for 25 years, during which it had competed hard in the market place to serve customers with excellence. The telecom firm asserted that it has always conducted business with character and transparency.“The irony of the situation is that while the operating teams were having several conversations over the last few days on how to provide support to the Jio teams based on their request, Jio was actually spending time drafting frivolous letters and making scurrilous allegations,” Airtel said.Airtel said it strongly condemns any person disrupting telecom networks or services to customers.“Telecom is an essential infrastructure and we believe it is against the law to indulge in such acts. As a matter of fact, we have always advocated firm Government action to ensure 100 per cent continuity of networks,” it added.It urged the DoT to bring forth a policy to mandate ICR (Intra circle roaming) in such situations of vandalism and network outages as a matter of course so that customers were never inconvenienced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airtel-writes-to-dot-says-jio-s-charges-against-it-baseless-outrageous/story-UISJ4l5rghWUgwqApe5TuI.html

Javadekar cited the findings of a data firm Morning Consult, which shows that in the approval ratings of world leaders, the net approval for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the highest at 55%, which puts him ahead of several world leaders. The survey shows that over 75% of the respondents approve of Modi while 20% disapprove of him, which puts his net approval rating at 55%. Leaders of Mexico and Australia are second and third in the list of popular leaders.As per the survey, the ranking is far better for PM Modi as compared to other global leaders, German chancellor Angela Merkel, for instance, has a rating of 24%, while it is in the negative for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The firm tracks the approval rating for leaders of 13 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. “There has been praise for the PM’s policies including from the World Health Organisation,” Javadekar said. He went on to add that the PM has won various international awards for his work and policies. “…Everything for the country and country is everything that is the way he has worked. He gave simple slogans during the corona crisis to drive home the need for maintaining physical distance and other Covid-19 protocols. Because of his initiatives such as made in India, made for the world, India’s heft has increased internationally,” he said. Even as the opposition has criticised the government’s response to the corona crisis, particularly the lockdowns, Javadekar said India was not caught napping when cases of infection began to be reported in January last year. The opposition parties such as the Congress had referred to the lockdowns as unplanned and said it forced thousands of migrant workers to walk their way home to their native states in the absence of proper planning.

02-01-2021||India||SC stays for 2 weeks demolition of BJP MLA’s illegal construction in Roorkee||The Supreme Court on Saturday stayed for two weeks the demolition of an alleged illegal construction done by the BJP legislator from Roorkee, Pradeep Batra. In a special sitting over the weekend, the SC bench, headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, asked the MLA to approach the high court with his request to carry out demolition of all identified unauthorised constructions by himself. The bench heard senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on behalf of Batra, as the lawyer submitted that the MLA will himself pull down all illegal constructions after an inspection and identification by the Roorkee- Haridwar municipal authorities. Rohatgi, assisted by advocate Gagan Gupta, also conceded that in case Batra fails to raze the unauthorised construction within a week of such identification by the municipal authorities, the officers would be free to forthwith demolish the same by taking help of local police force, if necessary. Taking on record these submissions, the bench, which also included Justice BR Gavai, agreed to give two weeks’ time to the MLA for approaching the Uttarakhand High Court with a formal application in this regard. The court ordered a status quo for two weeks but also clarified that it has not expressed any merit on Batra’s contentions. “It will be open to the High Court to accept the suggestion/proposal as made by the petitioners or to reject the same. We are not expressing any opinion either way on the merits of the said statement,” added the bench. On December 24, the high court had paved way for demolishing a large part of Batra’s property in Roorkee, rejecting his plea that a request for settling the dispute after paying for the illegal construction, identified by the municipal authorities, is pending since 2017. The high court noted that the authorities have on December 18 issued a demolition order and hence, there was no requirement to wait for disposal of Batra’s application to compound the irregularities. The order had come on a public interest litigation (PIL) by one Gaurav Pundir in 2017. Pundir alleged that the MLA and his family had illegally constructed a building on a ‘Nazul’ land (land in government’s control) in Roorkee. The PIL had also stated that various notices and orders on illegal constructions were issued to Batra by the municipal authorities since 2015 but the MLA went ahead with further constructions. Subsequently, the high court heard Batra’s contentions and also the municipal authorities before giving a go ahead for the demolition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-for-2-weeks-demolition-of-bjp-mla-s-illegal-construction-in-roorkee/story-sb2rZnT8N5bskN0oZ8cDvM.html

Calling it a ‘mammoth task’ would be an understatement. It is like conducting the general elections,” he said. He further stressed the importance of preparedness to get the vaccine to the people, deliver it to them, and monitor them afterwards for at least a short while to check for adverse reactions. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the objective of the dry run that took place today for Covid-19 vaccine introduction was to “assess operational feasibility in the use of Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application in a field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide the way forward prior to actual implementation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-people-should-not-hesitate-to-take-it-says-csir-dg/story-O9mN0nReVCPYLS4c7t0mgL.html

Yadav’s statement comes just a couple of days before the seventh round of discussion between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives to break the deadlock over the three farm laws.“It’s a plain lie that the government has accepted 50% of farmers’ demands. We’ve got nothing on paper yet,” Yadav was quoted as saying by PTI.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said earlier this week that after the round of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives on Wednesday, the two had reached a consensus on two out of four issues. The Swaraj India leader, however, rubbished these claims. “Our two main demands — three farm bills should be scrapped and legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) are still pending,” he said.Yadav said that if the farmers’ demands were not met after the meeting with the Centre on January 4, a march would be held on January 6. “The next round of talks with the government will be held on January 4 and if our demands are not accepted, we will hold a march at Kundli-Manesar-Palwal on January 6. We will announce a date about when and move forward from Shahjahanpur border,” he said.Farmers across the country, especially from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting around Delhi against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws that were passed in September. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The demonstrators have made it clear that they would not accept anything less than a complete rollback of the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-pending-yogendra-yadav-over-centre-s-claims-of-resolving-50-of-farmers-issues/story-oV49hndi1Qkco1xpPN6LkO.html

02-01-2021||India||Protesting farmers to hold tractor parade on Jan 26 in Delhi if demands not met||Tens of thousands of protesting farmers will enter the national capital on Jan 26, Republic Day, and carry out a tractor parade if their demands for a repeal of three farm laws and a law guaranteeing minimum prices for crops are not met by then, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, said on Saturday. Addressing a press conference in the capital, a seven-member team that is coordinating the over one month-long protests, spelt out a fresh agitation agenda spanning 15 days from Jan 6, which includes picketing Raj Bhavans, onward marches from six blockade sites on Delhi’s borders and a “rehearsal” for the Jan 26 tractor parade. The farm leaders said they would wait for the outcome of January 4 talks with the government and the Supreme Court’s hearing on January 5 on a clutch of petitions related to the three farm laws. “This is our ultimatum. If all issues are not resolved and our demands are not met by Republic Day, then we will start entering Delhi. The government is saying that 50% of the demands have been met. But the government has shown no signs of meeting our biggest demands,” said Yogendra Yadav, a leader of the platform leading the protests. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in recent years to demand that the Centre revokes the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September last year. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Also Read: Confident ongoing farm stir will end’: MoS Kailash Choudhary ahead of Jan 4 meetingTogether, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates. “Tractors from all neighbouring states will begin rolling into Delhi if matters are not resolved. Contingents from all current blockade sites will start moving. We will continue with our blockade of goods and services of Ambani (Reliance group) and Adani (group), including their products, malls and petrol pumps,” Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader said. The leaders were addressing their first press conference in the national capital since their agitation began. The leaders slammed what they called the government’s propaganda. “The government doesn’t want to withdraw the laws because it has become an ego issue for them. They have tried to tarnish our agitation in countless ways, sometimes calling us Maoists and Khalistani (a reference to Sikh separatists),” Balbir Singh Rajewal said. Asked what the farm unions would do if the Supreme Court were to uphold the validity of the laws, he said: “We are not a party to the case. But we will make a decision when the appropriate time comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-to-hold-tractor-parade-on-jan-26-in-delhi-if-demands-not-met/story-4YqXsNX59nEMmcWfTi6Q1K.html

The tractor parade with the national flag will be called ‘Kisaan Parade’,” Krantikari Kisan union president Darshan Pal said, according to news agency ANI.“We were peaceful, are peaceful and will be peaceful, but will stay at Delhi borders until new farm laws are repealed,” said one of the leaders of the protesting farmers’ unions, according to PTI.Farmer groups continued to block traffic from Ghaziabad and Noida to Delhi on Saturday. The Singhu and Tikri border crossing points from Delhi to Haryana have also remained completely blocked since last month when the farmer agitation against three laws enacted to liberalize the sector started. At the Ghazipur border, the service lane of National Highway-24 continued to remain closed for traffic.Meanwhile, Union minister of state (MoS) for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said a solution would come up during the talks to be held on January 4 with the farmers and that the ongoing deadlock would end. “I am confident that in the next round of talks with farmers, a solution will be reached and the ongoing protest will come to an end. The three farm bills are in favour of farmers. They used to demand to get rid of the middleman and sell their produce at a rate of their choice,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The first five rounds of talks between protesting farmers and the government failed to resolve the deadlock. On December 30, the farmers’ unions decided to meet the ministers for the sixth time. The government only agreed to address two of the four issues raised by farmers, which were sparing heavy fines for stubble burning and continuing the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use. The farmers have said they will intensify their stir if their demands are nor met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-tractor-parade-in-delhi-on-jan-26-say-protesting-farmers/story-MopzXZr3m9aRfCkVbKjiNL.html

Responding to Velumani’s challenge to prove the corruption charges levelled against him or quit politics, Stalin said, “I am ready to quit politics. Are you (Velumani) ready?” The DMK Chief was addressing a people’s gram sabha meeting at Devarayapuram in Thondamuthur constituency, represented by the minister. Referring to the memorandum submitted by the DMK to the Governor last month listing corruption charges against the CM and his colleagues, Velumani had said he would step down from his post if the charges were proved and sought to know whether Stalin was ready to quit politics if he failed to do so. “We will not only prove the charges against the minister, but also drag him to the court of law and get him punished for his corrupt deeds...” Stalin said. Stalin promised to order an inquiry into the ‘mysterious death’ of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, since the judicial commission constituted by the government has not submitted its report even after three years, immediately after assuming power. The DMK leader also mocked AIADMK for announcing K Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate, as its alliance partner BJP was yet to endorse it. Though the state government has banned gram sabha meetings, the party was holding people’s gram sabha meetings and lauded the participation in large numbers, as they had given a big mandate to DMK in the last Lok Sabha and local body elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-quit-politics-if-i-fail-to-prove-graft-charges-against-tn-min-says-stalin/story-0ADLjqkpfAqNxz2coyFWaI.html

In his virtual address, PM Modi also asked students to focus on ‘Brand India’ in addition to ensuring that their vision incorporates the less privileged sections of society.Here are the key highlights from PM Modi’s address:- Today, along with the foundation stone of an IIM campus, a new stone has been laid to strengthen the youth capacity of Odisha. This permanent campus of IIM will give Odisha a new identity in the management world with recognition of Odisha’s great culture and resources.- Today’s startups can become tomorrow’s multi-nationals. These start-ups are mostly starting in Tier-II and Tier-III cities in the country.- The youth of India needs to be prepared for the massive opportunities that lie ahead in India. In this new decade, we’re responsible to give a new image to brand India globally.- Management experts, who are coming out with new experiences in new areas of the country, will play a big role in taking India to new heights. This year India has given more unicorns than previous years despite the Covid-19 crisis.- To turn local into global, IIM students need to find new and innovative solutions. I’m certain that our IIMs can act as a bridge between local products and global collaborations.- The work pattern and demand for management skills are changing rapidly. Today, top-down and top-heavy management isn’t the need. It has changed to collaborative, innovative and transformative management.- During Covid, India found permanent solutions for PPE kits, masks and ventilators. India had perpetually adopted short-term measures for problem-solving. Today, India has changed its approach to long-term solutions.- Today, India’s gas coverage stands at over 98%, helped by our long-term solution approach. You know that turning coverage into 100% is the real challenge and we’re striving hard for it.- We’re trying to remove silos that existed in professional education. We want to include everyone in the mainstream for better development, a clear example of inclusive nature.- With the concept of work from anywhere, the whole world has changed from a global village to a global workplace.

Speaking to reporters at the Singhu border in Delhi, the leaders of the groups pointed out that only five per cent of the issues raised by them have discussed in meetings with the Union ministers. The farmers have also warned of a tractor rally on Wednesday if the reforms are not repealed. It has been over a month since farmers have been protesting against the farm reforms at several border points in the national capital. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told news agency PTI said that the Centre was hopeful of a positive outcome at the seventh round of talks with farmer groups adding that the previous meet held on December 30 happened in a cordial atmosphere and there was a possibility of positive results in the interest of farmers at the next meeting on Monday. Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police on Saturday informed that Tikri, Singhu, Jharoda and other borders remained closed for traffic movement and urged commuters to opt for alternative routes. A 57-year-old farmer, who was a Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) supporter from Baghpat, died at the UP Gate protest site on Friday due to harsh weather conditions.

02-01-2021||India||TMC suffers setback after more leaders switch sides||The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress celebrated its 23rd foundation day on Friday amid fresh setbacks in two of its prestigious citadels in poll-bound West Bengal. Soumendu Adhikari, former chairman of Kanthi municipality and brother of Suvendu Adhikari, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday. Suvendu, the party’s former MLA from Nandigram in East Midnapore, had defected to the BJP on December 20. Rabindranath Bhattacharya, TMC MLA from Singur, skipped the party’s foundation day celebration in his constituency. It was attended by an MLA from an adjacent constituency. Singur and Nandigram are prestigious constituencies for the party because mass movements against land acquisition in these two areas during 2006-08 paved the way for Mamata Banerjees’s political resurrection. “On #TMCFoundationDay, I extend my sincere gratitude to our Maa-Mati-Manush and all our workers who continue to fight with us in making Bengal better and stronger each day. The Trinamool family will carry on with this resolve for times to come! As Trinamool turns 23 today, I look back at the journey we began on January 1st, 1998. Our years have been of immense struggle, but throughout this time we have continued to achieve our objective of being committed to the cause of only the people,” Banerjee tweeted on Friday. Earlier this week, Suvendu Adhikari had hinted at a BJP rally that all his family members would be joining the saffron party soon. “Let me tell you that the lotus will bloom in my home. Wait for Ram Navami and Basanti Puja,” Adhikari said on December 29.Three days later, his brother Soumendu joined the BJP at a rally addressed by Suvendu at Kanthi in East Midnapore. Earlier, Soumendu was removed as the civic board chief by the TMC. He moved the high court against that decision.“Those who want to leave the party are free to go. Mamata Banerjee had successfully uprooted the 34-year-old Left Front regime. We are not concerned. We would win the polls again fighting under Mamata Banerjee,” said Sheikh Sufian, senior TMC leader and deputy chairman of the East Midnapore zilla parishad. Rabindranath Bhattacharya, a party old-timer and Singur MLA, had attacked party colleague Becharam Manna, the party MLA from Haripal in the same district. Though Bhattacharya could not be contacted after he skipped Friday’s function, Manna said: “Invitation had been sent to everyone for Friday’s foundation day program. He might have some other commitments. It won’t be right to see such things in bad light especially on the foundation day.” The TMC faced its first setback in Singur when the opposition BJP got a lead in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Buoyed by its impressive gains in those polls where the party won 18 of 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-member legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-suffers-setback-after-more-leaders-switch-sides/story-YtuGiECYYPwKS43DsWQXGN.html
02-01-2021||India||Govt committed to delivering on promise of housing for all: PM Modi||The Union government’s policies over the last six years have restored the faith of consumers that they can own homes of their own and rely on laws to support them if builders fail to deliver on time, Prime Minister Narenda Modi on Friday said while laying the foundation stone of the Light House Project under the Global Housing Technology Challenge-India scheme across six states. The project aims to construct of low-cost houses using alternative global technologies, materials and processes in six cities -- Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Rajkot (Gujarat), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Agartala (Tripura) and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh). About 1,000 houses at each location, along with allied infrastructure facilities, are meant to be constructed in a year’s time. Six chief ministers were present for the meeting, Shivraj Singh Chauhan from MP, Yogi Adityanath from UP, Biplab Deb from Tripura, E Palanisami from Tamil Nadu, Jagan Reddy from Andhra Pradesh and Hemant Soren from Jharkhand.Referring to the project, which he described as an incubation centre, the PM said the government was committed to delivering on its promise of “housing for all” by 2022, and was unwavering in its vows to provide affordable housing for the rural and urban poor, and affordable rented accommodation for migrant workers. The latest project, Modi said, will also strengthen cooperative federalism. “People were losing hope of owning a house even after putting in everything that they had saved. Houses remained on paper… People had also lost faith whether the law of the land will help them if they got into a dispute with the builder,” he said. To address these concerns, steps taken by the government over the past six years have made it easy for a hardworking, middle class family to own a house and restored their faith, Modi said. His reference was to RERA, or the Real Estate Regulation Act, introduced in 2016 to protect the interest of homebuyers from malpractices and builders defaulting on deliveries. “RERA has helped the people believe in reality projects again and that the projects will be completed. Today, 60,000 real-estate projects are registered under RERA. Thousands of cases have also been solved under the law,” Modi said. Even as the PM appreciated the efforts made by the states in providing housing for the poor; he criticised previous governments for not prioritising the sector. “Housing plans were not the priority of the central government in the past. They did not care about the details of quality of construction. There was a chalta hai, chalne do (let it be) approach… why shouldn’t the country get new technology, and the houses we build should be chust (swift) and durust (sturdy),” he said. The Prime Minister also announced the winners of the Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerators -- Uttar Pradesh topped the list followed by Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-delivering-on-promise-of-housing-for-all-pm-modi/story-whyuUFqEFDleEFcN0q6cbN.html
02-01-2021||India||For Mahatma Gandhi patriotism and Hinduism were not separate: Bhagwat||Patriotism and Hinduism were not separate from each other for the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said at a book launch on Friday. Speaking at Rajghat during the launch of Making of a Hindu Patriot: Background of Gandhiji’s Hind Swaraj, by JK Bajaj and MD Srinivas, Bhagwat said: “Gandhi ji has said my patriotism comes from my dharma. If you are a Hindu, then it is natural that you are a patriot.” In the book, the authors have quoted Gandhi having written to Leo Tolstoy, “…My patriotism is patent enough, my love for India is ever growing but it is derived from my religion and is therefore in no sense exclusive.” Bhagwat also stressed that Hinduism believes in the existence of unity. “Difference does not mean separatism,” he said, and quoted Gandhi as having said that his religion takes all other religions along. Referring to Gandhi’s emphasis on Swaraj, or self-rule, Bhagwat said that for Gandhi the struggle for Swaraj was not only about replacing the rulers but the reconstruction of society based on civilisational values. “A country is more than just land but when we say rashtra (nation) it means everything including the forest, the rivers and all living beings. You cannot understand what Swaraj is, till you understand swadharma,” he said. Bhagwat also refuted the charge levelled by critics that the Sangh was trying to appropriate Gandhi. He said such personalities cannot be appropriated by anyone. Even as the RSS has steadfastly distanced itself from Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse, those critical of the Sangh allege that Godse’s Hindu Mahasabha was inspired by the RSS. The Sangh was banned for the first time after the assassination, but the ban was revoked in July 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-mahatma-gandhi-patriotism-and-hinduism-were-not-separate-bhagwat/story-ERtkRDbvNykuzysQvGfAQM.html
02-01-2021||India||Paddy procurement at MSP up 23%: Govt data||The Union government bought a record 47.9 million tonne of kharif (monsoon crops) paddy in its ongoing procurement operations, 23% more than it did last year, according to data released by the government. Nearly 6 million farmers have been paid minimum support prices worth Rs 9000 crore for these purchases, the data show. The higher procurement comes at a time when farm unions protesting on Delhi’s borders have demanded making federally fixed assured prices or MSP a legal right. Paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of cultivators in states, such as Punjab. The food ministry’s official projections show the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%. Punjab’s share in total paddy procurement stands at 42%.  The food ministry has expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at assured prices, for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show. Farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana are protesting reforms that allow agribusiness to freely trade farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. A crucial change is that traders, agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market, rather than only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate. The government enacted three laws on Sept 24 to usher in these changes. The laws have angered farmers, particularly in Punjab, who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers growers an assured price, leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. Read more| The government and farmers’ dialogue is good newsTo placate farmers, the government’s food buying agencies have launched large buying operations in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety paddy at Rs 1,868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at Rs 1,888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country for the 2020-21 kharif season. In addition, the government has also accelerated purchase of other crops. “Up to 30.12.2020, the Government through its Nodal Agencies has procured 251633.79 MT of Moong, Urad, Groundnut Pods and Soyabean having MSP value of Rs.1346.76 Crores benefitting 1,35,813 farmers in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan,” a government note said. To be sure, production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-at-msp-up-23-govt-data/story-urb2hArzTjpuruIyVgAVFI.html

Governor Anandiben Patel will administer the oath of office and secrecy to the new ministers in the Raj Bhavan at 12.30 pm on Sunday, the official said.There are six berths vacant in the cabinet after three ministers losing the bypolls in November this year and two ministers - Tulsi Silavat and Govind Singh Rajput resigning from the cabinet in the run-up to the bypolls in October as they completed six months in their respective office without being members of the state assembly. One berth was already vacant.Sources said Chouhan is most likely to induct Silavat and Rajput into the cabinet. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Cabinet expansion is chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s prerogative. The party is not aware as to how many MLAs will be inducted in the cabinet as ministers.” This will be the first expansion of Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet after the assembly bypolls in November which saw Chouhan government gaining majority in the 230-member assembly with 126 members. Earlier, he had expanded his cabinet on July 2 with 28 new ministers including 20 cabinet ministers and 8 ministers of state. Twelve of the 28 ministers were ex-MLAs who later contested the bypolls. Earlier, there were just six ministers in the cabinet including CM Chouhan. While Chouhan was sworn in as the chief minister on March 23 he inducted five ministers in his cabinet on April 21. The cabinet can have a maximum of 35 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-to-expand-his-cabinet-on-sunday/story-MFVMLMDBkMFzpUSlbXRdRL.html
02-01-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s January 2, 2021, the vaccine is here, and it’s time for this column, which began on March 19, 2020, to end. The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has recommended that emergency use approval be granted to Covishield, the name given to the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine by the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making it in India, paving the way for its approval by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). This approval is a mere formality. India now has a vaccine, and it could start vaccinating the 300 million people in its primary priority groups as early as next week. It hopes to achieve that target by July. The Covid-19 pandemic started slow in India. The country didn’t register what everyone (including the managers of the HT dashboard) counts as its first case till early March (three returnees from Wuhan tested positive in late January, but there were no cases between then and early March). India went in for a hard lockdown from March 25, a day when it registered 90 new cases, taking its total to 657 cases, with 11 deaths. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe lockdown would go on for 68 days, although some restrictions were eased in phases in between, and the number of cases continued to rise through it. When it ended, on May 31, India’s dashboard showed a total of 190,533 cases and 5,328 deaths. The number of cases soared after that, reaching its peak on September 10, when, according to the HT dashboard, the country registered 99,181 new cases. I remember writing then that it was only a matter of time before India started seeing at least 100,000 new cases a day. I was wrong (thankfully)! The number of cases started falling. Around Diwali, it looked like India was nearing the end of its first wave; but soon after the festival, the number of cases started rising and I wrote about an imminent second wave. I was wrong (thankfully), again! My colleague, Kunal Pradhan, who has edited more of these columns than anybody else, has kept me informed about Indian cricketers who scored famous Test hundreds that matched the column number (he started doing this after I crossed 100 columns), and like anyone who has scored 238, I have played and missed a few times. For the benefit of those who want to know, he couldn’t recall anyone who scored 238, although Google informs me that this is the number of Test centuries scored at Lord’s. India’s approval of a vaccine comes even as the seven-day average of daily cases has fallen to 19,828, and the number of active cases in the country is 255,584, the lowest since July 5, according to the HT dashboard. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently attributing this to the wearing of masks, but as anyone who has travelled even briefly to rural India knows that most people there do not wear masks. I took the day off on December 31 and went on a dawn-to-dusk birding expedition in rural Haryana, and can vouch for this. It isn’t just Haryana; on a trip to Uttarakhand in late October that took me through Uttar Pradesh, I saw that very few people in small towns in India’s most populous state were sporting masks. Read more| Key expert panel meet today to review data on Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech Covid-19 vaccinesSo, why have India’s numbers fallen? In Dispatch 226, on December 16, I put forth some theories; the truth is simply that no one really knows – but we aren’t complaining. If India can get its vaccination drive going soon, and build some momentum into it – drives in many other countries have run into delays – and if the numbers continue to stay low (for whatever reason), the country will likely escape a second wave. HT will maintain a dashboard of the vaccination drive, and report on it from the ground, but I had always told myself that this column would end the day India approved a vaccine. The fortuitous timing of that approval, on the first day of a new year that we all hope will be better than the one gone by, means Dispatch 238, dated January 2, will be the last edition of this column. Goodbye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-gcLOUs3Hd603b240WeRj1O.html
02-01-2021||India||Farmers to intensify stir if Jan 4 talks not fruitful||Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the farmers’ collective protesting three recent agriculture laws, said on Friday that they would intensify their agitation if the government did not accede to their demands during the next round of talks.The leaders said they had prepared their agitation schedule, which would be activated depending on how the talks would go on January 4. Taking to reporters, the leaders said the two demands agreed to by the Centre were “minor”, while the major issues were yet to be resolved. “Abhi tak poonch nikli hai, haathi baki hai (Only a small part has been resolved. The big issues remain),” Yogendra Yadav, one of the leaders, said. “I don’t believe in this statement (by the government) that 50% of the issues have been resolved. The fact is the government hasn’t showed any willingness to repeal the laws and has also not agreed in principle for a law on minimum support prices,” Yadav said. “If the talks do not progress on January 4, then the farmers will start marching from their designated camps on January 6, including the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway,” he said.Read more| Farmers continue protests outside Delhi, say no question of withdrawing 2 demandsThe boycott of goods and services of certain industrial groups, including fuel stations and shopping malls run by them, would continue, said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the farmers’ agitation. Pal said all toll gates would be picketed on major highways to allow vehicles to pass freely as part of the protests. The farm leaders also said they would hold a tractor rally on January 6 if the laws are not repealed.“It seems the government is taking farmers lightly...If the government does not make a decision on January 4 then farmers will have to take a decision,” said Yudhvir Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a platform of protesting farmer unions, on Friday blamed Niti Aayog assessments of India being a food-surplus country and government economists who use this to argue against procurement of farm produce. “They (Niti Aayog) need to know that India has the maximum and rising number of hungry people,” said Avik Saha, secretary of the AIKSCC.India slipped on a global ranking of the prevailing hunger situation this year. While a Global Hunger Index score of below 34.9 indicates acute hunger crises, India’s score has fallen from 38.8 in 2000 to 27.2 in 2020. In 2019, the score was 30.3. “This is the result of complete government apathy and the recent decision of the Cabinet to divert foodgrains for alcohol production by companies is proof of this apathy towards the poor. This is despite claims of more than required production of food,” the AIKSCC said. Read more| Protesting farmers stay put in severe Delhi cold as talks with government remain deadlockedRepeating its demand to repeal the new laws, the AIKSCC said: “The Acts will erode food procurement and undermine the public distribution system, will replace basic food production by commercial crops profitable to the corporate and will give freedom to the corporate to purchase, hoard and blackmarket food.”The AIKSCC said the New Year was observed by millions of people by taking a pledge to struggle with the farmers and against rising hunger in the country. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-to-intensify-stir-if-jan-4-talks-not-fruitful/story-abIORGA8Cij1YeIjAdMpsN.html

One of the students revealed during interrogation that he committed the crime to deposit his school fee.” Kumar said, “The student revealed that his father works in a factory in Rudrapur. After his father’s salary was reduced by the management due to loss to the factory, he was not in a position to deposit the school fees so he got involved in crime.” The accused looted ₹ 5.35-lakh from Sachin Sharma, a resident of Balwant Enclave Colony and an employee of a cash management company at gunpoint, the officer said.

02-01-2021||India||Pvt firms, PSUs set to get access to crime database||In a controversial decision, the Centre has decided to give companies, including state-owned ones, access to the national database of crimes and criminals across the country for the purpose of background checks, people familiar with the development said. Currently, companies have to make such requests to the police. The idea, they added on condition of anonymity, is to monetise this data; companies will be charged for the background check. But internet activists say that the move could lead to misuse of data, and discrimination. Having access to this repository of data on arrests, convictions, ongoing investigations, court cases, and lists of proclaimed offenders, companies will be able to verify people’s criminal history on their own before hiring them. Right now, only the government and police have exclusive access to this crucial and sensitive data. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has already given its approval to monetise the CCTNS national data centre, also called CAS (Core Application Software) Centre, located at Shastri Park, New Delhi, for background checks, the people familiar with the development said. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been asked to develop a portal for this. As part of the project, companies will have access to database of National Data Centre (NDC), National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) and Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) for which they will have to pay a prescribed fee. The fee amount has not been decided yet, the people cited above said.

If a person’s name is found in the data, the user will be able to check the details, down to the level of the FIR, in the case of police cases. However, if the person’s name is not there in the database, it will show ‘no criminal record found’, ’’ said one of the people cited above. CCTNS (Crime & Criminals Tracking Network Systems) is a comprehensive and integrated system connecting all the police stations and investigation agencies across the country. It has a database that updates in real-time details of cases, criminals, courts, finger print bureaus, forensic labs etc. The database also has information on arrests, convictions, charge-sheets, lists of proclaimed and habitual offenders, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies (UIDB), registered vehicles. It even has photographs and, where applicable, screenshots. As of now, 97 % (15,620) out of 16,098 police stations across the country have already been connected to CCTNS.

This can help companies verify if their employee has any criminal record anywhere in the country and simultaneously generate some money for the government. Similarly, at a later stage, this data can be used for passport verification, verification of private security guards/agencies across the country.” On possible discrimination by companies against employees who have been acquitted or are yet to be held guilty. Ish Kumar added: “The government can only provide information. Whether the case (against the employee) amounts to disqualification depends on the policy of the company”. MHA officials declined to comment on the matter. Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now and board chairperson, Internet Freedom Foundation, said: “There is a pattern of government collecting data and making it available for the industry. Aarogya Setu app is one such example. CCTNS itself has lot of sensitive data which is problematic and there is no oversight. Giving a third-party access to it not only infringes the right to privacy but it can lead to misuse of data, especially when the data protection bill has not been passed by Parliament”. Amber Sinha, research director at Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), said, “Such sensitive data, which already suffers from social inequality and discrimination, coming into the hands of companies can lead to further discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-firms-psus-set-to-get-access-to-crime-database/story-4JqLbe8qgtOuVSujVl3n9O.html
02-01-2021||India||Despite vaccine, don’t lower guard: Experts||Experts welcomed Friday’s steps by a key government panel to approve a coronavirus vaccine but said the development must not be seen as a chance for people to begin letting their guard down in preventing Covid-19 infections soon. Their comments came after the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs and Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) cleared the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which will now need to be assessed for a formal approval by the Drugs Controller General of India.“It is fantastic news that we have a vaccine in such a short time, however it will be counter-productive if people believe that now is the time to throw the precautions out of the window. First, the vaccine will be given to a very small number of people at the moment. There aren’t enough doses to immunise everyone in the world right now. Second, even for those who do receive the vaccine, the two doses would be at least one month apart and it will take about two weeks after that for the immune response to kick in,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Some of the restrictions and the Covid appropriate behaviours will have to remain in place for at least six to eight months he said.Read more| Why India could catch up quickly on Covid vaccinationHe added, “Third, the vaccine is 80 to 90% effective, meaning there would still be 10 to 20% people susceptible among the group that receives the vaccine. So, to protect everyone from the disease people will still need to follow the social vaccines of wearing a mask, maintaining social distance, and washing hands frequently.” Maintaining the restrictions even when the vaccine become available is essential also because even those who do get the vaccine can still keep transmitting it to others who are susceptible. Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance said, “This is possibly the best news in a while. The good thing is that we are manufacturing it and we do not need to go begging for the doses. However, people will still have to take precautions because the vaccines have shown to protect from the disease and not infection. What this means is a vaccinated person can continue transmitting the infection to a susceptible population.” Along with the vaccine roll-out in India and other countries, Dr Jameel emphasised on the need for stepping up genomic surveillance to detect mutations that can escape the vaccine. When a large proportion of the population gets vaccinated, it results in the virus selectively mutating to evade the immune response generated by vaccines. This is just like over-use or incomplete use of antibiotics results in resistant strains of the bacteria. In vaccine, it usually happens in people who do not generate a robust immune response after immunisation, said Dr Jameel. “If a virus does mutate under pressure from a vaccine, two things can happen. One, it might mutate in such a way that it is unable to infect human cells as effectively making it weaker. Or, it can still infect people effectively and dodge the antibodies, but the T cell response will still work against it, meaning it will result in milder disease,” said Jameel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-vaccine-don-t-lower-guard-experts/story-U3wK3pkPqxUkxJv55uH6OM.html
02-01-2021||India||Why India could catch up quickly on Covid vaccination||India could have access to at least 40 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ready to ship from Serum Institute of India (SII) facilities in Pune, potentially helping the country catch up with other nations that have begun vaccinating their citizens. The vaccine, which was recommended for emergency use in India on Friday, is at present the only candidate that will be readily available in mass volumes for the country, but its stockpiles may be among the largest, SII executives have said in recent days. This, coupled with the vaccine’s compatibility with the Indian cold chain network are factors that could help a quick roll-out. With the manufacturing and stockpiling license, the Serum Institute of India has already been able to stockpile 75 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and by the first week of January, we will have 100 million doses. Nobody across the world has so much stock and we can start supplying as soon as we get the approval,” said Umesh Shaligram, director of Research and Development at SII, at a webinar on Thursday.Earlier in the week, SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told reporters that 50% of doses produced will be split between India and Covax Facility, a WHO-led pool to distribute vaccines to low and middle-income countries (LMIC). “...We have always said that we will keep giving 50% of everything we make to India and to Covax at the same time. So, if we are producing 60-70 million doses every month, there will be plenty of vaccines to go around both to India and to Covax countries, including some of our neighbours like Bangladesh etc. because everybody wants the vaccine, and we are trying to give as much as we can and equitably to nations including India,” he said.  Initially, the company may give most of its production to India because to export to these countries, it would need WHO’s pre-qualification, Poonawalla said on Monday.“… that may take another month or so after it is licensed in India. That way India will have priority, and because India is such a large country that we may end up giving a majority of those 50 million doses to India first. Every month we are churning out 40-50 million doses which will go up to about 100 million doses every month by March as by then we are going to commission a third facility that is getting ready. Eventually everyone is going to get it; of course some countries will have to wait a little longer,” he said. According to Our World in Data, close to 10 million vaccinations have already taken place across the world, with China, the US, the UK and Israel having administered the most doses. Among these, Israel has the highest proportion of its population that has received the vaccine at 11%.Read more| Dry run today to test systemsIn terms of volume, China has administered the highest numbers at 4.5 million, but none of its domestically made vaccines have yet been cleared following adequate safety and efficacy trials. Globally, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ticks two crucial boxes – it has received approvals after due scientific process and has secured the most deals for production as well as distribution. According to science analytics company Airfinity, 2.6 billion doses of the vaccine are expected to be produced in 2021. In terms of committed supplies, Oxford and AstraZeneca have been given orders for 3.7 billion doses. In terms of supply volumes, the next largest volumes have been projected for the candidate by Novavax, which too is being manufactured by SII. Novavax is making a vaccine using a tried-and-tested recombinant protein platform and has shown encouraging results, it is likely to take a few more months before late stage trials show efficacy results – the key marker for an inoculation to be assessed. Novavax’s deal with SII could assure India of more supply advantage later this year, since Poonawalla has previously indicated that 50% of all production by the company will be set aside for domestic supplies. India’s other large supplies could come from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which began its Phase 3 trials in mid-November, and is stated to have an annual production capacity of 300 million doses. A second India-made vaccine is by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila, which is yet to proceed to Phase 3 III trials. The third highest projected global production for 2021 is for Pfizer-BioNTech at 1.3 billion, according to Airfinity’s assessments, but the dose is considered unfeasible for poorer countries because of its high price and its ultra-cold storage requirements that will need special networks to be erected. The vaccine is expected to cost $20 a dose.This has made the Oxford-AstraZeneca – which will cost $3-4 per dose -- earn the “vaccine for the world” label by several experts. The companies committed to equitable distribution when in June it reached a $750m agreement with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, vaccine alliance to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses. Shortly after, it struck a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for low-and-middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020. The efficacy numbers reported from the Oxford-AstraZeneca trial fall below those reported for the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, but it is still well above the 50% threshold identified by regulators around the world as the bar for a vaccine to be considered effective. Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance said the SEC’s recommendations are “probably the best news in a while”. “The good thing is that we are manufacturing it and we do not need to go begging for the doses. However, people will still have to take precautions because the vaccines have shown to protect from the disease and not infection. What this means is a vaccinated person can continue transmitting the infection to a susceptible population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-could-catch-up-quickly-on-covid-vaccination/story-IPbo7pndG0zUgNUIsy2xHN.html
02-01-2021||India||Happy Vaccine Year||A committee of experts assessing coronavirus vaccines for approval by the drugs regulator recommended on Friday that the candidate developed by University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (and manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India) be cleared, paving the way for Indians to receive their first doses within days.The recommendations of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) are now being assessed by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), who is likely to heed to the advice of the expert committee and issue a formal approval. The DCGI heads CDSCO, the country’s drugs regulator.“The 10-member expert panel has recommended granting EUA (emergency use authorisation) to Serum Institute with certain riders that includes stricter monitoring of beneficiaries who will be given the vaccine shots. The DCGI is going through the report,” a person aware of the process said, asking not to be named. Once formalised, the vaccine – globally known as AZD1222 but to be marketed in India by SII as Covishield – will be the first coronavirus inoculation in the country. DCGI VG Somani had hinted on December 31 that the new year would bring a positive development on the vaccine front. Read more| SII’s Covishield approval: Efficacy, cost and all about AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccineThe SEC was also assessing applications by Pfizer-BioNTech, which was the first to be approved anywhere in the world last month, and by Bharat Biotech, an Indian developer that at present is the furthest along in the process. Pfizer sought more time to appear before the committee and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was not granted approval, with the SEC seeking more data from the Phase 3 trials that began in mid-November. The expert committee’s recommendations for Oxford-AstraZeneca include certain conditions for the approval, which will require SII to closely monitor post-vaccination side-effects after immunisations begin, and to submit a report to authorities every 15 days for the first two months. After this period, the company will need to create monthly reports of observed side-effects during the roll-out, a second person aware of the recommendations said, asking not to be named. “The company will also need to create a detailed fact sheet for patient information with possible AEFI (adverse effect following immunisation) and other detailed information that will be handed out to recipients,” this person added. The company will also need to keep submitting data from ongoing clinical trials in India as well as other locations outside of the country as soon as they are received, the official said. Details about what dosing regimen will be cleared in India will be confirmed after the formal approval by Somani, but India’s approach is likely to follow that of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, which became the first country to approve AZD1222 after a months-long rolling assessment. Read more| Centre releases Covid-19 vaccine rollout strategy; celebrities, RWA WhatsApp groups part of planIndia’s strategy of dosing recommendations will be closely watched since authorities in the UK indicated the vaccine may have a higher efficacy if the second dose is given later than the 28-day recommended by the manufacturer. The UK authorities said the vaccine can be 80% effective when there are three months between shots, an official involved in approving the vaccine said at a briefing on Wednesday, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found. Later in the same briefing, a British scientist involved in the approval of the vaccine said one dose of the vaccine is around 70% effective after 21 days and before the second dose is given. The vaccine is India’s strongest contender for early access to large volumes. An SII official said on Thursday at a webinar that the company had already stockpiled 75 million doses. SII’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday said the company will be supplying India and Covax in a 50-50 manner as and when it produces vials. It is also easier to store and transport than the other vaccines approved after due scientific process yet. AZD1222 can be kept at refrigerator temperatures (between 2-8°C) for up to six months, which makes it compatible with India’s existing cold chain network.Vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require freezing to -70°C and -20°C respectively, requiring specialised infrastructure that will be costly to deploy. Read more| Govt’s expert panel approves AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for emergency useApart from the UK, the vaccine has been approved by Argentina for urgent public use.In late stage trials, AZD1222 showed it had an efficacy of 62% when volunteers were given two full doses of the vaccine. A half dose followed by full dose regimen — which was initially given by accident during UK testing of the vaccine — was found to be 90% effective, but the method did not appear to stand up to the scrutiny of MHRA.The Union government has announced that India targets to vaccinate at least 300 million high-risk people against Covid-19 by July this year – a mammoth task in itself as it would involve administering the shot to 1.5 million people daily if immunisations were to begin in January. The approval now shifts the focus from the national Capital to Hadapsar in Pune, where SII has facilities. According to officials who gave details about the logistics, special cargo planes with cold boxes and refrigerated vans will start ferrying vials to various parts of the country as soon as requisite approvals and orders are in. State administrations will then distribute vials to district authorities for delivery to the hundreds of thousands of inoculation centres to be set up across India. The process will span over several weeks and drills have already been carried out in some regions, with more planned on January 2.Initial lots of the vaccine will be for the first two priority groups—health care and other frontline workers such as police personnel. After these, the government will begin vaccinating the high-risk general population – adults above 50 and those younger but with associated comorbidities. The government has targeted reaching these people by July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happy-vaccine-year/story-22tZX2Daa629SHT6Q0uQKO.html
02-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Dry run today to test systems||As India gears up to launch world’s largest immunisation drive, the government is conducting a dry run on Saturday to assess its ability and readiness to administer shots to hundreds of millions of people, including many in remote corners of the country. The government has already successfully conducted a two-day pilot Covid-19 vaccination drive in eight districts in four states on December 28-29, but Saturday’s dry run is more ambitious in scope, covering all state capitals, with some states also testing the process’ efficiency in districts located in difficult terrain or which are poorly connected. In the national Capital, the mock drives will be conducted at three locations – the Daryaganj primary health centre, the government-run Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, and the private Venkateshwara hospital. Twenty-five beneficiaries – all health care workers – will be present at each site and the vaccination team will demonstrate how they will be registered, how vaccines will be given, and how they will be monitored for adverse events, if any. Read more| UK reactivates emergency hospitals as coronavirus cases surgeAll the sites will have a three-room setup – one waiting room, one vaccination room, and an observation room. A team of four people – one person to check the documents, one to check the registration of the beneficiaries, one to monitor the person, and one to control the crowd — will be present. The teams will have a vaccine carrier (cold box) that will be used to transport vaccines at the temperature they are meant to be stored from the cold chain points to the vaccination sites. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan also conducted a review meeting on the dry run with the Delhi authorities. “The objective of this dry run is to prepare everyone for the huge immunisation drive. There should be good communication between the medical teams and the district administration for smoothly conducting vaccination. This will also let us know whether the registered beneficiaries are getting messages to reach the booth and whether they are getting an e-certificate afterwards. This will also clear up the divisions of lists of beneficieries and any doubts regarding the CoWIN platform,” he said. “Maharashtra and Kerala are likely to schedule the dry run in major cities other than their Capital. The objective of the dry run for Covid-19 vaccine introduction is to assess operational feasibility in the use of Co-WIN application in field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide way forward prior to actual implementation. This is also expected to give confidence to programme managers at various levels,” the Union health ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday.Read more| ‘2020 is gone, Covid-19 hasn’t’: A warning bell in Delhi CM’s New Year messageCo-WIN refers to the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network, which will help both health authorities as well as the public play their respective roles in the immunisation drive. Saturday’s dry run will involve 25 health workers eligible to receive the vaccine who will be the test beneficiaries. The states will prepare the vaccination sites, upload details of the beneficiaries on Co-WIN, and basically do everything they will do during the actual vaccination. As detailed in Thursday’s statement, the dry run will also give states an opportunity to check sites for space, electricity and connectivity, logistics etc. It will also help them figure out aspects of vaccine supply, storage and logistics including cold chain management. States have already been training vaccine administrators and preparing details of the beneficiaries. Around 150,000 vaccinators have been trained so far, covering over 700 districts. States are also augmenting the helpline 104 (which shall be used in addition to 1075) for any vaccine or software related query. The focus of the dry run will be on management of any possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). In addition, states will also emphasise adherence and management of infection control practices at the session site, to prevent disease transmission.The mock drill will also include concurrent monitoring and review at the block and district levels, and preparation of feedback. “A detailed plan with specific dos and don’ts has been shared with States. The dry run is to look at any gaps that may be seen on ground while executing the plan. It is meant to mobilize all aspects except for the vaccine,” said a senior health ministry official who asked not to be identified. The first round of the dry run was conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Punjab in two districts each. “No major issues were observed in the operational aspects during this dry run. All States expressed confidence in the operational guidelines and IT platform for large scale programme implementation,” the ministry’s statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dry-run-today-to-test-systems/story-6MftdbYWuplPt3ECbc36jK.html

A team of experts from IITs was working on it, he said.Rai also told journalists at the Vishwa Hindu Parishad office said that the temple construction would begin on January 14. He said the temple would be built using a special combination of stone and copper to keep it intact for a long time. With this method, the cost of construction would increase manifold. Therefore, a target had been set to collect funds by approaching 11 crore people. More than four lakh VHP workers would be engaged in the task of collecting money. He said that stones from Mirzapur were likely to be used in the temple foundation, as they were strong. Rai said on Thursday, Karsevakpuram was cleaned for storing the stones which would reach Ayodhya from Mirzapur soon. Coding on around 70 per cent stones, which had been shaped for temple construction in Ram Janmabhoomi Karyashala had already been done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-construction-to-start-on-jan-14-says-trust-official/story-2WtF1wVM76v4llRNi35lgK.html
02-01-2021||India||1 more Telangana Congress MLA to defect to BJP, party strength plunges to 5||In yet another jolt to the already beleaguered Congress in Telangana, party lawmaker from Nalgonda district Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy on Friday announced that he would quit the Congress and join the Bharatiya Janata Party soon. Rajagopal Reddy, who represents the Munugode assembly constituency, told reporters in Tirumala, after having a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara that the BJP was the only alternative to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, as the Congress party had failed to put up a strong fight. He said that he had predicted long ago about the growth of the BJP as a strong force in Telangana. “I stand by my statement and the recent results of the by-elections to the Dubbak assembly seat and the elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) proved it,” he said. Claiming that the BJP would get further strengthened in Telangana in the coming days, Rajagopal Reddy said he might join the BJP shortly keeping in mind the interest of the people of his constituency. If Rajagopal Reddy defects to the BJP sooner or later, the Congress will be left with just five MLAs in the 119-member state assembly. The party had won 19 seats in the assembly elections held in December 2018, but 12 of them defected to the TRS en masse. Of the remaining seven seats, the Congress lost one more in the by-elections to Huzurnagar assembly seat held in October 2019. The seat was vacated by PCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy on his election to Lok Sabha from Nalgonda parliamentary constituency in May 2019. With this, the party lost the Leader of Opposition status in the assembly. Interestingly, Rajagopal Reddy’s elder brother Komatireddy Venkat Reddy is also an MP from Bhongir parliamentary constituency and is a front-runner for the PCC chief post, following the resignation of Uttam Kumar Reddy. “My elder brother might remain in the Congress and become the PCC chief. But I am going to join the BJP,” Rajagopal Reddy said. In fact, soon after the last Lok Sabha elections, Rajagopal Reddy showered praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “People of India have given mandate in favour of Modi for the second time, showing their confidence in his decision-making. The BJP has the strength to take some revolutionary decisions, as they have strong leadership. I highly doubt how much Congress can fight against Modi,” he said then. The Telangana Congress party has strongly condemned Rajagopal Reddy’s statement that he would join the BJP shortly. “It is not correct on his part to desert the party when it is in crisis. As a responsible MLA of the party, it is his duty to stand by the party and strengthen it,” PCC vice-president Mallu Ravi said. Stating that the Congress was the only party that had been fighting on the issues concerning common people, Ravi said Rajagopal Reddy, who had won the assembly elections on Congress ticket, owned the moral responsibility to work for the defeat of the TRS and the BJP. He expressed confidence that the Congress would bounce back into power both at the Centre and the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-more-telangana-congress-mla-moves-to-bjp-party-strength-plunges-to-5/story-Q0TsPnmXaYsVeZGCIBUvVK.html

Referring to the violence witnessed during elections in the past, Dhankhar, while visiting Purulia district on Friday, said, “There is a general perception that elections in Bengal are marked by bloodshed. People are afraid that violence may mar the coming polls. I will do everything in my power to ensure that the elections are peaceful and fair. Democracy must be protected.” Dhankhar, against whom the TMC has moved President Ramnath Kovind, seeking his removal, visited the Sainik School in Purulia and also attended other programmes. “The governor feels compelled to make some comment every day. He needs sleeping pills. He forgets the fact that it is the election commission that conducts elections, not the governor. He speaks like a spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” said education minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee. On New Year eve, Dhankhar wished the people of Bengal. He made a similar remark in a statement issued by the Raj Bhawan. “Pray West Bengal exemplify its enormously rich culture, its essence and intrinsic spinal strength to secure 2021 elections shun of violence with “political neutral” stance of police and administration….,” the statement said. The TMC has demanded Dhankhar’s recall for “transgressing constitutional limits.” A team of TMC MPs wrote a letter to the President on Tuesday, listing “all such transgressions” by Dhankhar in recent times and urged him to take action as per Article 156, Clause 1 of the Constitution. “The governor holds office during the pleasure of the President as per Article 156, Clause 1. We have urged the President to withdraw the pleasure, which translates into removing this governor,” Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said in Kolkata. Dhankhar shot back, claiming free and fair elections are not held in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governor-needs-sleeping-pills-bengal-minister-retorts-after-former-talks-of-violent-polls/story-kDyomDH1k2d5jPiruqR6XL.html

02-01-2021||India||60,000 babies born in India on New Year’s Day this year, 7K less than previous year: Unicef||With the birth of nearly 60,000 babies, India will see the highest number of births on New Year’s Day 2021 across the globe. However, it is 7,390 less than the number of births on the first day of 2020. This will be followed by China with half as many births – 35,615 – on January 1 this year, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The Unicef estimates that 371,504 babies will be born across the world on this day. Of these, 52% of the births will take place in just 10 countries. This year, 140 million children are likely to be born across the globe with an average life expectancy of 84 years. Also Read: Pregnant women, infants more prone to severe risks of Sars-CoV-2-infection“The children born today enter a world far different than even a year ago, and a New Year brings a new opportunity to reimagine it. Today, as the world faces a global pandemic, economic slowdown, rising poverty and deepening inequality, the need for Unicef’s work is as great as ever,” said Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore. This year will mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation. Just as a comparison, the number of children estimated to be born this year is almost 78 times the number of people who have died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the globe so far. In India, the life expectancy of the babies born in 2021 will be 80.9 years, which is three years less than the global average. However, an additional 1,000 babies survive each day in India due to interventions by the government such as establishing Special Newborn Care Units (SNCU). A million newborns with special needs survive each year because of the 320 district level SNCUs set up by the government between 2014 and 2020. “Anticipating and addressing the potential impact of the pandemic is crucial if we are to prevent a rollback of gains made in saving the lives of children. As we do so, we must also think long-term, to build back a better world when the crisis finally recedes. The pandemic has shown us the need for systems and policies to be in place to protect people all the time, not just in the event of a crisis.
