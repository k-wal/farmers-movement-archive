Later, the authorities gathered about 150 more stray cows to shift the bovines in a shelter in Papora village on Friday night.“In the absence of any space for extra cows at the shelter, the officers of district administration broke the lock of the main gate of Government Primary School, Madanpur and shifted the cows in the school. We tried to stop them, but they didn't listen to us,” said Jitendra Lodhi, a villager of Madanpur village.More than 200 cows destroyed the kitchen garden and at least 100 plants of flowers, fruits and medicinal plants in the school premises, which won many awards for the infrastructure and beautification at district and state level said Asharam Kushwaha, a school teacher.“The school was in a very poor condition a few years ago. We have developed the school premises to attract the students and to enhance the knowledge of students about flowers and plants. Even in the lockdown, I used to take care of the garden but the cows destroyed everything,” said the school teacher.However, Tikamgarh district collector Subhash Dwivedi said, “The cows had been shifted to school premises for the safety of both bovine and people. It is true that cows destroyed the plants but now, we will do plantation of at least 100 plants with horticulture department officials in the school premises.”“We have also made an arrangement of six trucks to shift the cows at different shelters of the district,” he added.Madhya Pradesh’s cow cabinet and animal husbandry department minister Prem Singh Patel, said, “I have sought a report from the district.

24-01-2021||India||Nitish Kumar wishes speedy recovery to Lalu, but won't call. Here's why||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday wished a speedy recovery to his political rival and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was shifted to Delhi by air ambulance on Saturday from Ranchi where he is being treated for multiple ailments.Kumar, however, said he gets to know about Lalu's health from newspapers since he hasn't spoken to him on phone.When asked why there has been no telephonic conversation between the two leaders, the chief minister said, "I used to frequently call up his personal attendants and enquire about his well being when he had similarly fallen ill in 2018. So many things were said about me because of that."In 2017, Kumar had walked out of the coalition he had formed with the RJD and the Congress and formed a new government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Later, the phone calls Kumar made to Lalu during his illness in 2018, triggered speculations that he was feeling uneasy in the BJP-led coalition and seeking a rapprochement with the RJD chief.Lalu had undergone a fistula operation then. But his son and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had dismissed it as "last courtesy call". Kumar had then said the he called up Lalu keeping aside his political differences, but Tejashwi had said the door is closed for his (Nitish's) return.Nothing but a late courtesy call to enquire abt his health as he underwent fistula operation on Sunday.Surprisingly NitishJi got to knw abt his ill health after 4months of hospitalisation.I hope he realises he is last politician to enquire following BJP/NDA Ministers visiting him https://t.co/lw7cNmXhDLOn Sunday, Kumar said, "I want him (Lalu) to recover well soon. You know that when we were in different camps earlier then also I used to enquire about his health. In 2017-18, his family members had said that I do not enquire about his health but I want him to recover soon." He was speaking outside the Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) state headquarters in Patna, where he had gone to pay tributes to former chief minister and OBC stalwart Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary. Both Kumar and Lalu consider Thakur to be their political guru.Recently, the Kumar had admonished Yadav for impudence. Speaking in the state Assembly in November last year, the Bihar chief minister had underscored that he has been too charitable with the 31-year-old, who was also his former deputy, because he was "mere bhai samaan dost ka beta (the son of a friend, dear to me like a brother)".Yadav had made serious allegations against Kumar in connection with a murder case.In the Assembly election held last year, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) comprising Kumar's JD(U) and BJP defeated the RJD-led grand alliance. The NDA, riding on the back of BJP's best ever performance in Bihar, won the election after a close fight, scraping past the majority mark with 124 seats as grand alliance’s 111 seats. The majority mark in the 243-seat Assembly was 122.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-wishes-speedy-recovery-to-lalu-but-won-t-call-here-s-why-101611505414510.html

Arrested CAs are from Jaipur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Ludhiana. “They were operating multiple non-existent firms and fake entities to dupe the exchequer with fraudulent ITC utilisation in connivance with fraudsters and fly-by-night operators,” he said.Enforcement agencies have used data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to process data exchanged among GST authorities, customs department and income-tax offices and pin-pointedly identify unscrupulous elements, he said.“It is through such systemic changes, the department has now been able to take targeted actions against fraudsters and tax evaders. It is with these measures that the DGGI has not only been able to unearth the fake firms but also the final beneficiaries of ITC frauds,” he said.“Action has been initiated against big companies such as a popular online food ordering and delivery platform and a subsidiary of an e-commerce giant,” he said.The concerted nationwide drive against bogus GST invoice fraud has ensured better GST compliance to identify tax evaders and those availing input tax credits fraudulently, and thus, has resulted in record GST collection to the tune of more than ₹1.15 lakh crore for the month of December, 2020, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-cas-among-258-arrested-since-mid-november-in-gst-fraud-101611504836185.html
24-01-2021||India||Congress slams Center over petrol, diesel price hike||Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government over the rise of petrol and diesel price, the Congress party on Sunday alleged that excise duty on diesel has been hiked by 820 per cent and 258 per cent on petrol in the last six years.The party has demanded an explanation of how exactly has the government spent ₹20 lakh crore that it "collected by multiple hikes in excise duty on both petrol and diesel" in last six years.Excise duty is a form of tax imposed on goods for their production, licensing and sale.While addressing a press conference here, Congress General Secretary Ajay Maken said, "Today, in Delhi, the petrol prices have reached an all-time high of ₹85.70 a litre. Diesel has reached ₹75.88 litre and what is more shocking is the fact that during the Congress' regime, when UPA left power in May 2014, the international crude oil prices were 108 dollars per barrel. It has come down to all most half, which is 55.52 dollar per barrel and despite the crude oil prices have fallen to almost half, the petrol and diesel prices have surprisingly gone up.""The sole reason for an increase in petrol and diesel prices is that the central government has increased the excise duty on diesel by 8 times and on petrol by 2-1/2 times. The additional excise burden to the common man, to the consumer, is ₹23.78 per litre on petrol and ₹28.37 per litre on diesel, which is 820 per cent to be precise on diesel and 258 per cent to be precise on petrol. This is the increase in excise duty on diesel and petrol because of which the burden has fallen on the common consumer," he said.Maken alleged that the central government has earned more than ₹20 lakh crore from this "additional" excise tax and if the "Central government reduces the additional excise, withdraws the additional excise, which it has changed in the last six years, the petrol prices will fall down to ₹61.92 and diesel price will fall down to ₹47.51.""The Central Government has collected through petrol and diesel excise more than 20 lakh crore rupees in the last 6 years. So, where this huge amount has gone? Our Jawans, our government employees, their DA is being cut. Our small entrepreneurs, our MSMEs, they are continuously under pressure from the bank to repay the loans and they are continuously under the pressure of the taxation authorities. There is huge unemployment across the country. The farmers are committing suicide, so where has this amount of more than ₹20 lakh crore has gone?" he asked."First of all, it should reduce the increase in excise on petrol and diesel, secondly, the Congress Party wants to know where the ₹20 lakh crore, which the central government has collected from the excise duty hike of diesel and petrol, where that money has gone?" he asked.Commenting upon the price in LPG, he said, "As far as the LPG is concerned, I would like to remind you that during our time we used to give 12 cylinders as subsidized for LPG that almost stands withdrawn. At the moment, the LPG in the open market is around ₹700 per cylinder, whereas LPG in the open market without subsidy during our time again as I have said 12 cylinders per year, the subsidized rate were much lower, the subsidized LPG cylinder has gone up from ₹414 per cylinder to ₹700."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-center-over-petrol-diesel-price-hike-101611503856104.html

The northern plains will also experience 'cold to severe cold wave', IMD said, presenting the coming week's weather forecast.This fresh spell of chill has been caused by the movement of the western disturbance further northeastwards on Sunday from Jammu and Kashmir. As a result, dry northwesterly winds are likely to pick up from afternoon of January 25 and persist during the subsequent 3-4 days over plains of north and adjoining parts of central and western India.Regions in states of the northern belt like Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan will experience current spell of dense to very dense fog till January 26."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are very likely in isolated pockets over north Rajasthan and cold wave conditions in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh during January 25-27 and over west Uttar Pradesh and west Madhya Pradesh during January 26-27," the IMD said.Cold day to severe cold day conditions are also very likely in some pockets over Uttar Pradesh during the next three days (till January 26) and cold day conditions in isolated pockets over Punjab and Haryana and Chandigarh during the next 2 days.Officials have also confirmed reports of very light snowfall or rain at most places of the valley during the night in Kashmir Valley.The minimum temperature at most places in Kashmir decreased on Sunday after snowfall, but the clouds made way for the winter sun in the morning, officials said.The MeT office has said the weather would improve gradually on Sunday and would remain mainly dry till the end of the month.Kashmir is currently under the grip of 'Chillai-Kalan' -- the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-grip-of-chill-in-north-central-india-over-next-3-4-days-imd-101611501334040.html

Along with her two other sisters, one of whom is pursuing her B Tech, Behera has been hard at work making a road in her village."Though I completed my diploma in civil engineering from a private engineering college in Khurda district in 2019, I had pending dues of ₹44,000. My father could raise around ₹20,000 but I could not manage the rest. After sitting idle for over a year and a half, I decided to work as a NREGS labourer for at least 3 months so that I can earn something," said Behera.In Odisha, NREGS workers get ₹207 for a day's work. However, Behera said she and her sister have not been paid any wage since they started working.Behera refused to identify the private engineering college worried that it may hamper her chances of getting her certificate as well as college leaving certificate for further studies. Officials of the Directorate of Technical Education and Training said she could have met the officials of the State Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training for the certificate. "However, there may be some other pending dues which she has to clear before she gets her certificate," said an official.Behara said she wants to clear her dues first. "My father is a landless, poor farmer. The house tin which we are staying is on the land of another person. For me getting admission to a B Tech course is priority. I am willing to slog as a labourer for next few months to get my certificate," she said.The young girl said that after being turned away by the chairman of the private college, she did not meet any local officials for help.Delang block development officer Khirod Pradhan said he would enquire into the issue on Monday and would help her in whatever way possible.In October last year, a civil engineering graduate of Odisha who had lost his job in a road construction company in Chennai during lockdown had to work as a labourer in NREGS till the district collector intervened to save him. Anant Beria, who did his civil engineering Tech graduate of Bolangir district in Odisha had lost his ₹15,000 a month job in Chennai during lockdown. With his savings wiped out, Beria was forced to come back to his home in Jurlakani village in Deogaon block of Bolangir district and work in NREGS till Bolangir district collector Chanchal Rana saw him and gave him a job as data entry operator in NREGA cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-dalit-girl-works-as-labourer-to-clear-pending-dues-of-engineering-college-101611502772988.html

24-01-2021||India||Force Taliban to reduce violence and agree to truce, Afghanistan tells Pakistan||Afghanistan on Sunday called on Pakistan to compel the Taliban to fulfil their commitments to reduce violence and to agree to a ceasefire, a day after the US said it would review its agreement with the militant group in the wake of a spike in violence.The Afghan foreign ministry called on Pakistan and other international partners to press the Taliban to end violence in response to comments by Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi that the US should “not reverse things” in Afghanistan.“The Taliban have not only failed to live up to their commitments to reduce violence and move toward a comprehensive ceasefire, but have escalated the violence to an unprecedented level, carrying out targeted killings and creating new challenges to meaningful negotiations and lasting peace,” the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement.“We expect the government of Pakistan and all our international partners to compel the Taliban to fulfil their commitments to reduce violence, to secure a nationwide ceasefire and to sever ties with terrorist groups so that the way for meaningful peace talks and political agreement is paved,” it said.Most of the Taliban's top commanders and its leadership council and clerics are based in Pakistan, especially in Quetta and the country's northwest. During a recent visit to Pakistan, top Taliban negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said all decisions regarding the peace process are made after consulting the leadership based in Pakistan.Qureshi, in an interview with Al Jazeera last week, had called on new US President Joe Biden to follow up on the Afghan peace process and US troop withdrawal. “I think they should realise there is an opportunity in Afghanistan and they should persevere with what was initiated and not reverse things,” he said.He contended Pakistan had “done a lot” to create an environment to facilitate the peace process, and blamed “spoilers” – internal Afghan players and “elements from outside” – for the violence.The new US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, told his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib during a phone call on Saturday that the Biden administration intends to review the US-Taliban agreement that was finalised in February 2020. The aim of the review is to assess whether the Taliban is living up to its “commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders”.Over the past few weeks, Afghan government officials, civil society activists and journalists have been targeted in bombings and attacks in Kabul and other cities across Afghanistan. On January 14, India had called for an immediate stop to the targeted attacks and sought a comprehensive ceasefire to take forward efforts to usher in peace.Among the terror groups active in Afghanistan and having links with the Taliban are al-Qaeda and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). According to a UN report, there are some 6,500 Pakistani fighters active in Afghanistan.The Afghan foreign ministry said regional and international consensus is needed to achieve lasting peace in Afghanistan. “We appreciate the efforts of all parties who sincerely support the Afghan peace process. We expect the parties involved in the peace process to fulfil their commitments towards achieving peace,” it said.The Afghan government has taken the “most important steps” to build trust and pave the way for a comprehensive political agreement by releasing more than 6,000 Taliban prisoners, declaring its readiness for an immediate and nationwide ceasefire, and participating in peace talks, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/force-taliban-to-reduce-violence-and-agree-to-truce-afghanistan-tells-pakistan-101611500417250.html
24-01-2021||India||Two women die in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana days after taking Covid-19 vaccines||A woman in Andhra Pradesh and another in Telangana died on Sunday, days after both of them had taken the Covid-19 vaccination a few days ago, officials said.A 42-year-old woman, working as an accredited social health activist (Asha) worker in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district, died of brain stem stroke on Sunday four days after she received Covid-19 vaccination, officials said.Authorities at Guntur General Hospital (GGH) said Bokka Vijaya Lakshmi of Penumaka village, who was admitted to hospital with symptoms of severe headache, giddiness, seizures and vomiting on Friday evening, succumbed in the early hours of Sunday.According to Guntur district immunisation officer Dr Chukka Ratna Manmohan, Vijayalakshmi took the vaccine along with 10 others on January 20. “She was absolutely fine on the day of vaccination and even the next day. According to her family members, she developed mild symptoms on the midnight of January 21, when her condition turned serious the following day, she was brought to Guntur General Hospital,” he said.GGH Guntur Superintendent Dr G Prabhavati said the hospital authorities had carried out all radiographic and laboratory investigations immediately after she was brought to the hospital. “She suffered a brain stroke and was treated in the stroke unit of the neurology department," she said.Dr Manmohan said investigations revealed that Vijayalakshmi had developed a blood clot in the brain that led to the brain stem stroke. “We do not know exactly whether she already had the blood clot in her brain before vaccination or whether it was induced by vaccination. We are hoping to find some reason after conducting the autopsy,” he said.The immunisation officer, however, said Vijayalakshmi was absolutely healthy and had no history of any comorbidities at all. “She was one of the very active Asha workers in the district, having attended thousands of Covid-19 patients at Tadepalli primary health centre. We are surprised how she got the brain stroke,” he said.He said there was no way it could be established that it was vaccine-induced death. “First of all, Covid-19 itself is one-year old in the country. And the vaccination for Covid-19 is still in its nascent stage. We have not come across any such incidents of brain stroke due to vaccination in any part of the country so far. It is a rare case witnessed, maybe one in one lakh people who get vaccinated,” Dr Manmohan said.District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) Dr Jonnalagadda Yasmin, in a statement, said out of 11 people including a medical officer who got vaccinated at Tadepalli PHC on January 20, only Vijayalakshmi and another auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) Gottimukkala Lakshmi (38) showed symptoms of giddiness and seizures in the next two days.“They were shifted to GGH by the AEFI (After Effects Following Immunisation) committee. While Vijayalakshmi’s condition turned critical due to brain stroke, the other woman is stable and recovering,” she said.Vijayalakshmi’s husband Sambasiva Rao, a village revenue assistant (VRA) at Penumaka, told reporters that she had no other health complications and had fallen victim to the Coronavirus vaccine. “She developed symptoms only after receiving the vaccination,” he said.Rao, along with other family members, hundreds of activists of CPI (M), staged dharna at the Guntur Government Hospital, demanding that the government pay compensation of ₹50 lakh to the family of Vijayalakshmi, besides a government job to one of her two sons and a house site.Guntur district collector I Samuel Anand Kumar, who came to the hospital and consoled the family members of the victim. “He assured us to take up our issue with the government and ensure justice for the family,” Rao said.Also on Sunday, a 45-year-old Anganwadi worker in Telangana’s Warangal (urban) district, five days after she got the vaccination shot for Covid-19.The deceased was identified as Vanitha, a widow, who has been living along with her 13-year-old daughter in Shayampet town.State health director G Srinivasa Rao said the woman was vaccinated at about noon on January 19 at Urban primary health centre, New Shayampet and she expired in the early hours of Sunday.“The district AEFI committee is examining the matter and will submit its report to the state AEFI committee. The state AEFI committee will in turn furnish its report to the central AEFI committee for taking a view,” Rao said.According to Naveen, a local resident, quoting her relatives said she had no other health complications but had been complaining about burning sensation in the chest since the next day of taking the vaccine.“She brought it to the notice of the higher authorities about her problem, but they told her that it was quite common in the people who take vaccines. She suffered cardiac arrest this morning,” Naveen said, adding that her relatives alleged that she died of reaction due to vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-women-die-in-andhra-pradesh-telangana-days-after-taking-covid-19-vaccines-101611499294905.html

24-01-2021||India||Ahead of US, UK, here's what India's Covid-19 vaccination rate tells||India has covered more people in only a few days on its vaccination drive, which has surpassed the inoculation rate of the United States and the United Kingdom, the health ministry said on Sunday. While India took only six days to roll out one million vaccine doses, the United States took 10 days to reach the mark and the United Kingdom took 18 days to achieve the one million-mark, the ministry said. Both the countries began vaccination drives before India, but India managed to cover a huge number of population at a shorter span.The drive in India began on January 16 and till January 24, India inoculated 15,82,201 people. All of them are healthcare workers as in the first phase, the country is providing vaccines to only healthcare workers.Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishield after concerns over Chinese vaccineAmong the states, Karnataka has vaccinated the highest number of people. The number of beneficiaries in Karnataka stands at 1,88,971. Next is Odisha with 1,52,371 beneficiaries. State which have vaccinated over 1 lakh people are Andhra Pradesh (1,47,030), Telangana (1,10,031), Uttar Pradesh (1,23,761. Maharashtra has vaccinated 99,885 people so far.The vaccination process has been running smooth, health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said, though there were reports of minor glitches in the Co-WIN app delaying the process at the initial stage. New features have been added to the app so that if a beneficiary does not turn up for vaccination, the slot can be allocated to another one etc.A survey conducted in 28 countries by Edelman PR's Trust Barometer 2021 has revealed that India's are most willing to get vaccinated while both the UK and the US reported some kind of vaccine hesitancy. The survey said 80% Indians were willing to get vaccinated as against 66% in the UK and 59% in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-us-uk-here-s-what-india-s-covid-19-vaccination-rate-tells-101611497720866.html
24-01-2021||India||Kerala asks CBI to probe sexual harassment case in solar scam, Cong cries foul||The Marxist government in Kerala on Sunday decided to hand over a sexual harassment case in the solar scam which virtually led to the fall of Oommen Chandy regime five years ago, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), ahead of the assembly elections in the state and after Chandy was named chief of the Congress election management committee.The opposition Congress decried the move and said it was a politically-motivated decision eying the assembly elections. It and the party will deal with it legally and politically.“At least three senior police officers investigated the case and found there was no evidence to prove her claims. Almost five years the government sat over the case and explored many ways to make it alive. Neck-deep in corruption, gold smuggling and drug trafficking charges it dusted out an old case as a face-saver,” said senior Congress leader K C Joseph.The government claimed it was justified in handing over the case to the CBI.“It is a natural process. The government ordered the central agency probe after the woman in question approached it,” said state law minister A K Balan justifying the move.Nair had petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week complaining that she was yet to get justice in sexual assault cases she filed against many Congress leaders and she wanted a central agency probe. The government moved quickly apparently to checkmate the opposition that has been accusing it of collusion in the gold smuggling case.The solar scam involves Saritha Nair and her second husband Biju Radhakrishnan, who was later convicted in a murder case. In 2013, the couple floated a fictitious company called ‘Team Solar’ and cheated many people by promising them stakes in the firm and high returns after selling imported solar panels. They allegedly cultivated influential sources in corridors of power and flaunted them to attract gullible investors.The cheating case came to light in 2014 and 60 cases were registered against the two accused. Oomen Chandy who was then the chief minister, had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names allegedly cropped up in the case. Later the main accused Nair had raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders including Chandy, K C Venugopal, Adoor Prakash MP, A P Anil Kumar, Hibi Eden MP and others. The government had also constituted a judicial commission.Nair was sentenced in at last six cases and is currently out on bail. In the 2019 parliamentary election, she had filed her nomination against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad but her papers were rejected on grounds of her conviction. Last year the Supreme Court had dismissed her plea questioning Gandhi’s election and imposed a fine of ₹10,000 on her.The Marxist government had earlier sought legal opinion in the sexual harassment case and was reportedly advised that “her allegations were weak and would not stand legal scrutiny.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-asks-cbi-to-probe-sexual-harassment-case-in-solar-scam-cong-cries-foul-101611497296711.html

They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15000-tractors-170-km-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-farmers-tractor-rally-101611493581603.html

24-01-2021||India||308 Twitter handles from Pakistan creating confusion over tractor march: Police||The Delhi Police on Sunday said 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding a threat to create disturbance in the tractor rally. 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to create confusion," Dependra Pathak, Special CP, Intelligence, Delhi Police said.Giving details of these Twitter handles, the special commissioner said all these handles have been generated in Pakistan between January 13 and January 18.The proposed Republic Day tractor march which got formal permission on Sunday from Delhi Police has been the eye of controversy for the past few days as Centre had already reported 'Khalistani infiltration' in the protests and moved the Supreme Court, which in turn asked Delhi Police to take the final call on allowing the tractor march. Initially, the Delhi Police didn't allow farmers to enter the Capital. Instead, it offered an alternative route at the Kundli border. But after several rounds of discussions held between farmers' representatives and Delhi Police officials, it has now been agreed that farmers will be allowed to enter the Capital under certain terms and conditions.Formal permission received from police for Jan 26 tractor rally: Yogendra YadavNow it has been decided that the tractor rally will enter Delhi from Tiri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders. From Singhu, the march will pass through Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi border, KMP Expressway and then return to Singhu, police said.The protesting farmers have been planning this tractor march for a long time and several tractors from Punjab have joined the protest sites in the past few days for their Republic Day parade where they plan to showcase tractors from different states as it happens in Republic Day parade. Farmers' union leaders have promised that the march will be peaceful and the Delhi Police have also placed trust on them that the tractors will go back to the protest sites after their march, without proceeding further into the Capital.While several Union ministers in past claimed that farmers are being instigated from outside, early this month, the Centre told the Supreme Court that it was informed about Khalistani infiltration in the protests. It also mentioned the name of the banned organisation 'Sikhs for Justice' as being part of this ongoing protest.This is the first time, Delhi Police officially talked about outside links, specifically, Twitter handles having roots in Pakistan attempting to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/308-twitter-handles-from-pakistan-creating-confusion-over-tractor-march-police-101611492703767.html
24-01-2021||India||Hardeep Puri Interview: On Central Vista, Adani airports row, vaccine exports||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri is clearly a man of the moment: perhaps, among Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chosen few, given that he is handling crucial portfolios namely Urban Housing and Civil Aviation.As Housing Minister, he is in the eye of a storm thanks to the controversial Central Vista project; in Civil Aviation, he is firefighting because the sector is badly hit, thanks to the pandemic. Outspoken and forthright that he is, Puri makes it clear that doling out cash is not the Government’s model. As for the Central Vista, he defends it as vociferously as the critics decry it.In HT’s series The Interview, Puri talks at length on several issues: controversial and informative. If he defends industrialist Gautam Adani bagging the contract for six airports, he also talks about expanding the aviation sector, and the phased roll-out of transporting the vaccine.More importantly, he clears the misconception that the old Parliament building will be functional along with the new: “Only the usage will change and it will not be converted into a museum”, Puri asserts.For the uninitiated, the Central Vista project which includes a new Parliament complex there are misgivings about the iconic Parliament building being converted into a museum, once the new complex comes up.On taking safety precautions against the new Covid strain with the UK virus variant, Puri said that suspending flights between UK and India is not the answer: “However flights were reduced to fifty percent : from sixty plus, flights a week we were down to 30. But look at the other side: if we close flights from the UK are you suggesting that we close flights from everywhere else? Flights from Dubai are operational as are flights from European countries. The easiest thing to do is to listen to people who are saying you should not do this and clamp down. By doing that we would be causing more damage than the virus itself. So, I am clear that it was a sensible decision as was the decision by the Prime Minister to lock down in March and then opening up in a calibrated manner. Decisions relating to life and livelihood are equally important and if you don’t open up economic activity you would have inflicted a hard blow”.The hope, Puri said, is in the vaccine: “We should celebrate the fact that we have been able to manage the difficult part of the challenge and now we are looking towards recovery. With the kind of stocks of vaccine we have from the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, we would soon have more than we need. Today we are among the five countries in the world which is vaccinating people with indigenously produced vaccine. India under Prime Minister Modi is resonating with self-reliance”.On the road map for the aviation sector, Puri said: “We have already opened up 80 percent and most of the airlines are operating; we have rationalized air space. We are going to look at cargo in a big way. Two airports, Bengaluru and Chennai, have shown positive growth in air cargo. I am keen that Indian carriers regain the GDP when it comes to international aviation.“Going forward let me tell you that airlines expansion will take place; the number of aircrafts in the sky will further increase; Delhi Indira Gandhi International airport will get the fourth runway; with Jewar airport coming up in 2023, we will ensure that the traffic Delhi and Jewar airports will carry, will exceed the combined traffic of London, Heathrow, Gatwic and Stanstead. With Mumbai and Navi Mumbai airports coming up, we can look at an increase in traffic there too.“We are opening a hundred new airports in the coming years. That apart we will step on the gas on aircraft leasing; engine manufacturers are being brought here obviating the need to take aircrafts from here to Singapore and other places for servicing. With all this civil aviation will provide a big boost to the economy ”.Simply put, Puri said that the target is to reach pre-Covid levels before March end this year; take it to 40 percent beyond pre Covid levels by next year: “I predict that there will be robust growth by April 2022”, he claimed.On the much-awaited roll-out of the vaccination, Puri said: “Vaccine Maitri is for the foreign countries; the first phase of vaccination transportation was from January 12 when eleven million doses from Serum Institute and 2.40 lakh doses from Bharat Biotech were distributed to all states and Union Territories; Phase two was from January 19 which also is over. Now so far as the next phases are concerned, we will make an assessment in a day or so when to roll out. The first phase was tough but now the infrastructure is in place and people know how to go about it”. However, he said that the next roll out should be “within two days” adding that the states have a surplus.On a lighter note, one took Puri down memory lane: back to school in Germany when he was bullied because as a Sikh he kept long hair. Had it not been for his teacher, he probably would never have stood up to bullies: “Don’t get bullied; bully them instead” she had then told him.Politics was not Puri’s calling: it was the Foreign Service. He says as a diplomat “he lived dangerously” including flying in LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran from Jaffna: “When we were flying him from Jaffna to New Delhi, he was nervous and told me that someday his deeds will catch up with him”. Ominous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardeep-puri-interview-on-central-vista-adani-airports-row-vaccine-exports-101611492457928.html

But, till the BJP's Hanumans are there, we will move ahead with Ram's ideals," Sarma said.The Congress has formed the Grand Alliance with AIUDF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML) and the Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) to fight the upcoming assembly elections, likely to be held in March-April.A new regional political party, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), was formed jointly by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP).Jailed anti-CAA leader Akhil Gogoi's Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and 70 other groups have formed another party -- Raijor Dal.Training guns at the AIUDF chief, the Assam health and family welfare minister said, "Ajmal told Muslims won't be able to go to mosques if BJP wins. I want to ask today whether Hindus can visit temples if Congress and AIUDF form the government in the state."He asserted that till the "BJP is alive", Ajmal will not be able to enter within 100 km of Dispur, the locality of the Assam secretariat.Sarma also alleged that followers of Ajmal attacked 'Satras', the Vaishnavite places of worship, at Batadrava and other areas.Attacking the AASU, which has been protesting against the visit of the prime minister and home minister, Sarma said, "Today you are taking out a torchlight procession against Amit Shah.

24-01-2021||India||Congress and AIUDF will open doors for illegal immigrants in Assam: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday lashed out at the newly formed alliance of Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam saying it would aid the entry of illegal immigrants into the state.“Can Congress and AIUDF keep Assam free from illegal immigrants? They will open doors to infiltrators as it suits their vote bank politics. Can Assam be safe in their hands? For Assam to be secure, we need BJP governments in Centre and Assam” said Shah.The home minister accused Congress of using a policy of ‘divide and rule’ among various groups in Assam in the past decades which led to violence and killings in the state.The Congress, which has 20 seats in the 126-member state assembly, had recently sealed a pre-poll alliance with AIUDF, which has 14 seats. The newly formed Anchalik Gana Morch and three Left parties - CPI, CPI-M and CPI-ML-are also part of the alliance.In his speech, Shah also targeted the newly formed regional parties in the state (which were the outcome of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in December 2019) and accused them of indirectly aiding the Congress.“Congress was responsible for firing on the state’s youths (during the anti-foreigner agitation in 1979-85) and now those agitating forces have taken a different shape to help Congress by hoping to divide BJP’s votes,” Shah said.“People in Assam should know that these parties which have changed their clothes and are trying to aid Congress are not concerned about the state’s well-being. People of Assam want peace and development and only BJP can provide that,” he added.Shah appealed to the voters to help the BJP to retain power in the state so that Assam can be free of violence, agitations and there is control on the devastating floods that wreak havoc each year. He made no mention of the Citizenship Amendment Act which seeks to fast track Indian citizenship of non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and which has sparked another round of protests in Assam.Earlier in the day, Shah addressed a rally in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), to mark one year of signing of the third Bodo peace accord.“Peace has returned to Bodo areas due to the accord. There used to be killings and abductions here but I can assure that in a few years this region will become the most developed part of Assam,” he said.“Several steps have already been taken to implement clauses of the accord. I have come to reiterate the commitments made last year and assure that the Centre and state governments would fulfill all the promises made in the accord,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-and-aiudf-will-open-doors-for-illegal-immigrants-in-assam-amit-shah-101611490357959.html

Masks, corona tests and social distancing (Do Gaz ki Doori) have now become part of our everyday life. Despite this, there is no lack in your enthusiasm, your enthusiasm.""When you step on the Rajpath with zeal, every countryman is filled with enthusiasm. When you show a glimpse of the rich art, culture, tradition and heritage of India, the head of every countryperson rises with pride," PM Modi said in his conversation with the performers.The Republic Day parade, PM Modi said, pays tribute to India's great social, cultural heritage, as well as our strategic strength."This year our country is entering its 75th year of independence. This year is also the 400th Prakash Parv of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. In the same year we are also making 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose," PM Modi said.Urging people to make the nation stronger, PM Modi said, "We did not get an opportunity to sacrifice our everything for the independence of the country. But the country has definitely given us the opportunity to give our best.

We have got formal permission from police for the tractor rally. As I told earlier, 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' will be held on January 26 in a peaceful manner," sad Yogendra Yadav, whose Swaraj India has been supporting the farmers' agitation against the three central farm laws.Meanwhile, news agency ANI posted a order from the Delhi Police Commissioner to all Special Commissioners of Police and district units which said, "All officers and men, as well as CAPF and other force deployed for Republic Day Parade security, should remain in ready position to move at short notice for law and order arrangement in connection with Kisan tractor rally."Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan reported that three alternate routes have been decided upon by farmers and Delhi Police during a meeting.These short routes have been suggested keeping in mind the ongoing protest near three border points of Delhi - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur. Those at Singhu border have been asked to follow the Kanjhwala-Bawana route, while the protesters at Ghazipur border must take the Apsara border-Duhai route, according to Livehindustan. The protesters at Tikri have been asked to take the Nangaloi-Najafgarh-Badli route, it further reported.Christened 'Kisan Ganatantra Parade', the tractor rally will mark the two months of farmers' protest against the three central farm laws passed in September last year.The farmers have promised that their rally will remain peaceful. They plan to deploy 2,500 volunteers to facilitate the movement of the vehicles on that day.The farmers are protesting against three laws passed by Parliament in September last year - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protest has been going on since November 26; the farmers say these laws will benefit big corporate houses and put them at their mercy. The government has, however, rejected these allegations and have said that they are ready to discuss amendments to the laws and even said that they will be put on hold for 18 months.The protesters, however, are adamant that these laws should be repealed. At the 11th round of talks on Friday, the Centre has asked farmers to reconsider the 18-month option. The Supreme Court has already stayed the implementation of these laws and formed a committee to resolve the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-permission-received-from-police-for-jan-26-tractor-rally-yogendra-yadav-101611490665672.html

No demon can love Lord Ram. Mamata Banerjee is a dishonest and evil (shaitan) person. Her hatred for Lord Ram is natural," he told reporters.Singh added that the violence and murder unleashed allegedly by members of Banerjee's party TMC in West Bengal provide proof of their "evil" act.Banerjee had on Saturday declined to speak at an official programme at the lawn of Victoria Memorial Hall to celebrate Bose's birth anniversary after "Jai Shri Ram" slogans were raised by a section of the audience in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The party also attached an RTI document which proves that the Punjab CM was one of the 10 members of a high-powered committee of chief ministers for 'Transformation of Indian Agriculture'.The order for setting up of the committee, as seen in the RTI document, was passed in August 2019. Then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Kamal Nath, former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh were part of the committee, apart from agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand.Protesting farmers assure 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' will be peaceful"When you had the document in 2019, why didn't you tell the farmers that the Modi government was set to bring such anti-farmer laws," AAP leader Raghav Chadha said.RTI Exposes @capt_amarinder's lies.Punjab CM was a member of the committee that approved the 3 Anti-Farmer Farm bills.#DhokhebaazCaptain pic.twitter.com/Ne6r3U1P6bSince the beginning of farmers' 'Dilli Chalo' protest, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh locked horns over farmers' issues. The allegation that AAP has brought on Sunday is not new as Kejriwal has been accusing Amarinder Singh of drafting these laws. The RTI documents have now been added to AAP's attack.Singh had earlier answered to the accusation without denying that he was part of the committee but he had said that these farm laws were not discussed at any of the meetings of that committee.These farm laws were NOT discussed at any meeting & your repeated lies will not change that Mr @ArvindKejriwal.

There used to be killings and abductions here, but I can assure that in a few years, this region will become the most developed part of Assam,” he said, while addressing a rally in Kokrajhar, the BTR headquarters, to mark one year of the signing of the accord.“Several steps have already been taken to implement clauses of the accord. I have come to reiterate the commitments made last year and assure that the Centre and state governments would fulfil all the promises made in the accord,” he added.Shah mentioned how the Bodo accord was crucial in ensuring a peaceful election to the Bodo Territorial Council (BTC) held last month. He lambasted the opposition Congress for failing to fulfil promises and implement accords.The event was attended by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, BJP in-charge for Assam, Baijayant Jay Panda, and several other dignitaries.After the event in Kokrajhar, Shah will address an election rally in Nalbari before departing to New Delhi.The Bodo Accord, the third peace deal with Bodo rebel groups, was signed in New Delhi on January 27 last year by the Centre with all four factions of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), the All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) and United Bodo Peoples’ Organisation (UBPO).It was expected to end decades old violent demand for a separate Bodoland state and bring peace to areas dominated by Bodos, the largest tribe in Assam. Soon after signing of the accord, 1,615 cadres of NDFB laid down arms and in March, the outfit disbanded itself.The deal renamed Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD), which included four districts, as Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). Redrawing of BTR boundaries, grant of ₹5000 crore, rehabilitation of NDFB rebels and naming Bodo as associate official language of the state were also part of the deal.Also Read: Only Modi-led BJP can rid Assam of terrorism and intruders: Amit ShahSoon after signing of the accord, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a meeting in Kokrajhar in February last year and stated that the deal has put a full-stop to all Bodo demands and ushered lasting peace.In the past year, the BJP-led ruling coalition in Assam has set up a commission to redraw BTR boundaries as per the accord, named Bodo as associate official language and gave ₹4 lakh each to 1,279 surrendered cadres of NDFB.Last month, BJP emerged as the second largest party in the BTC polls and become a part of the executive council headed by United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL), its new partner in BTR, after parting ways with Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), which headed the council for 17 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodo-accord-has-brought-peace-to-btr-says-amit-shah-in-kokrajhar-assam-101611482460591.html

24-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi slams Centre for Tamil Nadu's 'economic downturn'||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi slammed the policies of the Central Government for Tamil Nadu's 'economic downturn' and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi cannot control and blackmail the people like it is doing with the State government.The former Congress President was addressing the people of the state during a roadshow organised in Perundurai of Tamil Nadu's Erode district, ahead of the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls.Alleging that PM Modi wants to control the people of Tamil Nadu, the Congress leader said, "Tamil Nadu used to be a manufacturing centre, an industrial centre, and that strength has been eliminated by the policies of Narendra Modi. He thinks that just as he can control and blackmail the state government, he can do the same to the people of this state. He did not realise that people cannot be controlled and they themselves decide for their future."I have not come here to tell you what to do or tell you my Mann ki Baat, I have come here to listen to you, to understand your problems and try to help resolve them", the Congress MP stated taking a dig at PM Modi's monthly radio programme.The Congress leader said that he has familial ties with the state and is indebted to the people of Tamil Nadu for having a loving relationship with his grandmother and father.The Congress leader also took a potshot at the BJP-led Central Government's economic policies and the state Government's Covid-19 management."People of Tamil Nadu are struggling because of the policies of Narendra Modi, the BJP, and the Government of Tamil Nadu. Demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax (GST), and the response to Coronavirus has severely damaged the people of this state", Gandhi added.The Congress leader is on a three-day visit to the western belt in Tamil Nadu and will have interactions with farmers, weavers, and the general public.Gandhi is in the state till January 25 and is also scheduled to visit Tiruppur, Karur, and Dindigul districts.Assembly elections are due in Tamil Nadu in April-May 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-slams-centre-for-tamil-nadu-s-economic-downturn-101611481287936.html
24-01-2021||India||Ageing dams in India, US, other nations pose growing threat: UN report||Over a thousand large dams in India will be roughly 50 years old in 2025 and such aging structures across the world pose a growing threat, according to a UN report which notes that by 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of dams built in the 20th century.The report, titled 'Ageing water infrastructure: An emerging global risk' and compiled by United Nations University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, says most of the 58,700 large dams worldwide were constructed between 1930 and 1970 with a design life of 50 to 100 years.It said at 50 years, a large concrete dam "would most probably begin to express signs of ageing."Ageing signs include increasing cases of dam failures, progressively increasing costs of dam repair and maintenance, increasing reservoir sedimentation, and loss of a dam's functionality and effectiveness, "strongly interconnected" manifestations, the report said."By 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of large dams built in the 20th century, many of them already operating at or beyond their design life," according to the UN University analysis.The analysis includes dam decommissioning or ageing case studies from the USA, France, Canada, India, Japan, and Zambia and Zimbabwe.According to the report, the world is unlikely to witness another large dam-building revolution as in the mid-20th century, but dams constructed then will inevitably be showing their age.The report said that 32,716 large dams (55% of the world's total) are found in just four Asian countries: China, India, Japan, and South Korea - a majority of which will reach the 50-year threshold relatively soon.The same is true of many large dams in Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe, it said.In India, there are over 1,115 large dams that will be roughly 50 years old in 2025, more than 4,250 large dams in the country will be over 50 years old in 2050 and 64 large dams will be more than 150 years old in 2050, it said.The report said that approximately 3.5 million people are at risk if India's Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, built over 100 years ago, "were to fail"."The dam, in a seismically active area, shows significant structural flaws and its management is a contentious issue between Kerala and Tamil Nadu States,” it said.The report added that dams that are well designed, constructed and maintained can "easily" reach 100 years of service but predicts an increase in "decommissioning" - a phenomenon gaining pace in the USA and Europe - as economic and practical limitations prevent ageing dams from being upgraded or if their original use is now obsolete.In the US, the average age of 90,580 dams is 56 years. More than 85% of US dams in 2020 were operating at or beyond their life expectancy and 75% of US dam failures occurred after 50 years of age. The estimated cost to refurbish US dams is about USD 64 billion. Nearly 1,275 dams were removed in 21 US states in the last 30 years; 80 removed in 2017 alone, it said.Worldwide, the huge volume of water stored behind large dams is estimated at 7,000 to 8,300 cubic kilometres - enough to cover about 80 per cent of Canada's landmass under a meter of water.The report’s co-author Vladimir Smakhtin, Director of UNU-INWEH, said the report aims to attract global attention to the creeping issue of ageing water storage infrastructure and stimulate international efforts to deal with this emerging, rising water risk."Underlined is the fact that the rising frequency and severity of flooding and other extreme environmental events can overwhelm a dam's design limits and accelerate a dam's ageing process. Decisions about decommissioning, therefore, need to be taken in the context of a changing climate," Smakhtin said.Lead author and UNU-INWEH Senior Researcher Duminda Perera said the problem of ageing large dams today confronts a relatively small number of countries - 93% of all the world's large dams are located in just 25 nations."Large dam construction surged in the mid-20th century and peaked in the 1960s - 70s especially in Asia, Europe and North America, while in Africa the peak occurred in the 1980s. The number of newly-constructed large dams after that continuously and progressively declined,” he siad.The pace of large dam construction has dropped dramatically in the last four decades and continues to decline in part because "the best locations for such dams globally have been progressively diminishing as nearly 50% of global river volume is already fragmented or regulated by dams," the report says.There are also strong concerns regarding the environmental and social impacts of dams, and large dams in particular, as well as emerging ideas and practices on the alternative types of water storage, nature-based solutions, and types of energy production beyond hydropower, it said.Public safety, escalating maintenance costs, reservoir sedimentation, and restoration of a natural river ecosystem are among the reasons driving dam decommissioning, the report said, adding that overall, dam decommissioning should be seen as equally important as dam building in the overall planning process on water storage infrastructure developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ageing-dams-in-india-us-other-nations-pose-growing-threat-un-report-101611480903512.html

With the help of the district administration, the factory has signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), paramilitary forces along with brands from Bangalore and Hyderabad.These organisations will place orders for tailoring services and also purchase readymade DANNEX products, officials said.“The project aims to make Dantewada a garment hub in the region. Initially, four new garment factories will be established which will provide employment opportunities to 1000 households. This will be done on a cluster approach. Clusters have been identified based on the availability of skilled and unskilled human resources in the district. The next step is the installation of machines—up to 100 per unit-- at the nearest available infrastructure. Nawa Dantewada Garment factory (NDGF) is the first such cluster established in the Geedam block,” said Dantewada collector Deepak Soni, while talking to HT.The tribal women working in the factory are happy with the earnings from the factory and hope that their brand becomes the cultural identity of the region.“The women are engaged in tailoring while some men are working in marketing of the products,” said Shushila Netam.Also Read: Chhattisgarh: BJP demands judicial probe into shelter home sexual abuse caseThe NDGF has not been officially inaugurated till now but the women and men from nearby gram panchayats have started working.

It will also help in poverty alleviation by ensuring employment opportunities to the local and in creating the district’s brand, showcasing the rich tribal heritage and culture of the region,” Soni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-tribals-start-garment-factory-in-maoist-hit-area-name-brand-dannex-101611475636357.html

The expenditure on the development of the entire 70 acre land there will exceed ₹1100 crore," said Swami Govind Dev Giri Maharaj, treasurer of Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Nyas.He said he arrived at these figures after consulting experts involved in the Ram temple construction project.The Nyas (trust) has not come out with an official statement so far on the expenditure involved in the project, he said while talking to ABP Majha Marathi TV channel."It was possible for us to raise funds (for the temple construction) from some corporate people. Some (corporate) families had approached us, requesting us to hand over the (temple) designs and assuring us they will complete the temple project, but I humbly declined that request," he said.To a query on criticism from some quarters that the Ram temple funds collection drive is a BJP campaign keeping in view the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, he said, "People see this depending on the colour of spectacles they wear.

24-01-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: BJP demands judicial probe into shelter home sexual abuse case||The BJP on Sunday demanded a judicial inquiry into allegations of physical and sexual abuse of women inmates of a shelter home in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district.The manager of the shelter home, run by an NGO and aided by government, was arrested on January 21 for allegedly raping an inmate, while three other staffers were held on Saturday on charges of physically assaulting women living at the facility."An impartial investigation into the allegations is possible only when a judicial panel will be set up to conduct a probe into it as the role of police is already in question in the case," Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Dharamlal Kaushik told PTI.Hitting out at the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh, the BJP leader said it is a "very shameful situation" that sexual and physical exploitation of women is taking place in a shelter home monitored by the state government."The inmates have made revelations before a magistrate that the women who were staying there were not only subjected to sexual harassment, but were also sent out for prostitution. They were also brutally thrashed and stripped and locked in a room there," Kaushik claimed.He demanded that the state government constitute a judicial commission for a probe into the case.Kaushik said the role of police in the case should also be investigated as the victims have alleged that when they went to a police station for registering complaint of sexual abuse, the police did not take cognisance of it.The case against Ujjawala Home, operated by NGO Shri Shivmangal Shikshan Samiti, came to light on January 17 when some of its staff members allegedly did not allow a 20-year- old woman to leave the facility when her husband came to take her back home.The man then forcibly took his wife and reached Sarkanda police station where they lodged a case of wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt and obscene acts against the shelter home staff.Two other women inmates also went the police station and alleged physical and mental abuse of women at the shelter. They were also made complainants in the case, a police official earlier said.On January 19, the women complainants approached the media, alleging that one of them was sexually assaulted by the shelter home's manager and other inmates were physically tortured by the staff.The complainants recorded their statement before a magistrate on January 21 following which the shelter home's manager was arrested, the police said.Later, another woman also alleged that she and other inmates were physically assaulted by the shelter home staff.The police subsequently apprehended three women staff members on Saturday, a police official said.A government official said the shelter home has been closed and seven of its inmates have been shifted to their homes and other government facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-bjp-demands-judicial-probe-into-shelter-home-sexual-abuse-case-101611472171445.html

24-01-2021||India||Tremendous growth of ‘GDP’: Rahul Gandhi jabs PM Modi over fuel price hike||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rising fuel prices in the country. “Modi ji has shown tremendous growth in 'GDP' i.e. gas-diesel-petrol prices! The public is plagued by inflation, Modi government is busy in tax collection,” he tweeted in Hindi.Though fuel prices remained unchanged on Sunday, they are at their all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week on Saturday. The record-high fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, have prompted cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers. On Sunday, petrol was priced at ₹85.70 and diesel was selling at ₹75.88 per litre in Delhi. In Mumbai, the petrol rate was ₹92.28 per litre and diesel was ₹82.66. In Kolkata, petrol was priced at ₹87.11 per litre and diesel at ₹79.48 per litre.मोदी जी ने ‘GDP’ यानी गैस-डीज़ल-पेट्रोल के दामों में ज़बरदस्त विकास कर दिखाया है!जनता महँगाई से त्रस्त, मोदी सरकार टैक्स वसूली में मस्त। pic.twitter.com/FsiG8ECajkState-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Since then, rates have gone up by ₹1.99 a litre on petrol and ₹2.01 in case of diesel.Though the price of commercial use cylinders was raised, that of non-subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was left unchanged at existing levels on January 1, 2021, following two hikes of a cumulative ₹100 per cylinder in each of the four metros. Commercial customers will now have to pay an additional ₹17 per cylinder. Consumers of the commercial cylinders will pay ₹1349 in Delhi, ₹1410 in Kolkata, ₹1297.50 in Kolkata and ₹1463.50 in Chennai per cylinder.Earlier this week, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan attributed the rise in prices to lower production in oil-producing nations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Our main challenge is, we have to import 80 per cent of crude oil of our requirement. Due to coronavirus, many oil-producing countries stopped production or reduced it. There is a pressure on fuel price due to imbalance in demand and supply," he had said.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. The government had then cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremendous-growth-of-gdp-rahul-gandhi-jabs-pm-modi-over-fuel-price-hike-101611471461183.html

The Indian gift to Dhaka was a fulfilment of the assurance given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the December 17, 2020, virtual summit. Both the countries have been cooperating in the field of Covid-19 vaccine, including Phase III testing, distribution, co-production and delivery in Bangladesh.Also read | Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishiled after concerns over Chinese vaccineThe leadership of Sri Lanka and Nepal also expressed their apprehension about the Chinese vaccine to their Indian interlocutors. The demand of Indian vaccine has come from small countries far and away like Barbados, whose Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley wrote to PM Modi on January 22 for the supply of 200,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with the proviso of purchasing half of the doses. The request has been approved.Also read | Will India send vaccines to Pak if there is a request? MEA respondsAccording to diplomats based in Dhaka and Delhi, around October 2020, the Chinese wanted to sign a contract with the Sheikh Hasina government to supply CoronaVac vaccines. One of the terms of the contract was that Dhaka had to share the cost of the clinical trials. While Dhaka refused to share the cost of the trials, the Chinese company said that Bangladesh could not be an exception to not sharing costs as Sinovac was putting the same conditions for countries in which clinical trials were conducted and as a precursor to jab supplies.Also read | Global Covid-19 infections near 100 million markIt was only then that Dhaka moved swiftly and tied up with SII with the Modi government doing the facilitation for commercial supply of 30 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Three million doses of commercial supplies have already landed in Dhaka.India has already rolled out five million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to seven countries in the neighbourhood, the first being Bhutan on January 20 and the latest being Mauritius on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-dhaka-got-vaccines-from-india-after-china-asked-it-to-share-trial-costs-101611459036601.html

Even in this case, the accused was a relative of the unsuspecting and innocent girl. Other instances of use of malwares to tap the webcam of unsuspecting victims for either taking pictures or stealing information were also found, said police officials.There seems to be no end to the menace of child pornography. Last January, a US-based NGO, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, handed over a list of 25,000 Tipline reports on suspected child pornography material uploaded on social media in India, triggered a heated discussion in the Parliament.Kerala seems to have made considerable progress in tackling the menace, statistics show. Kerala Police Cyberdome—formed to meet the long term security challenges and to combat emerging cyber threats-- launched a special operation named P Hunt, which resulted in cracking 525 cases and arrest of 428 accused in two years, said the police.Experts working in the area say active monitoring and action creates a deterrent effect.“Our cyber monitoring cell patrols the dark net through geo-fencing (a real world geographic area) and we have some of the best software networks to help us with this. It is a strenuous job, once we identify an offender, we procure his IP address with the help of the service provider and his activities are monitored. Once the location is identified we make local inquiries discreetly and collect all digital evidence before booking the person,” says Manoj Abraham, additional director general of police, Cyberdome.Around 100 well-trained officers are working in his team.“We have different tools and software to go after individuals and groups catering to child pornography in social media. Since we are deeply invested in the programme, agencies like the Interpol, US-based International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, India Child Protection Fund, and others help us profusely,” he said, adding the situation worsened during the lockdown. He said some of the arrested were IT professionals and doctors among others. Some of them were repeated offenders and they need treatment, he added.Watching or sharing child pornography images, videos and literature is a crime in India and can invite up to five-year jail and maximum fine of ₹10 lakh.“The scourge is on the rise. Safety of children is everyone’s responsibility. People need to guard against the exploitation of the innocent,” said the decorated officer. In 2019, he received the Champion of Child Protection award.Also Read: No clear definition, computer-aided offence a cybercrime: MHA reportInterpol secretary general Jurgen Stock recently said that the visible part of the problem was just the tip of the iceberg. He added that the issue aggravated during the pandemic.“Many cases go unreported as parents fear stigma and taboo. Internet penetration is quite high these days. This offense can’t be prevented by police alone and parents and family members need extra care,” said a child rights activist.She said in 60% of the cases, offenders are either family acquaintances or relatives and in 50% cases, pornographic materials were filmed or shot without the knowledge of the abused child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-rise-in-child-pornography-cases-worry-experts-101611457879318.html

A Rafale aircraft will fly with two Jaguars and two MiG-29 fighter jets in one of the formations at the flypast, which will wrap up with the Rafale carrying out another manoeuvre.Soldiers in masksFollowing the new norms of Covid-19, soldiers marching down the Rajpath will also be seen wearing masks along with spectators. The number of officials participating in the parade has also been reduced to 96. Earlier, there was a 12x12 contingent system which had 144 soldiers.Bangladesh Armed ForcesAt least 122 soldiers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces will be taking part in the parade. According to a press statement issued by the high commission of India in Dhaka, this is only the third time since Independence that a foreign military contingent has been invited to participate in the national parade.CRPF tableauIn another first, a tableau of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is also set to wow spectators during the Republic Day parade. "This year we will be having our own tableau and its theme will be combat skills of CRPF in conflict zones," RK Yadav, inspector general (training) has said, according to ANI.Schilika weapon system with woman commanderThe upgraded Schilika weapon system will roll down in Rajpath for the first time this year in the Republic Day parade, led by the only woman contingent commander from the army.Ram Mandir tableauUttar Pradesh's tableau will feature a replica of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is currently under construction. It will also display the culture, tradition and art related to the temple town.Things that will be missing this year:No chief guestIn more than five decades, this year's parade will be the first Republic Day parade to be organised without a chief guest. Before this, there were no chief guests during the Republic Day parade in 1952, 1953 and 1966.No motorcycle stuntsOne prominent event that that always draw cheers during the parade - stunts on motorcycles by the army and the personnel of the paramilitary forces – will also be missing this year.No veterans’ paradeThe veterans’ parade by ex-servicemen and women, too, has been knocked off the programme chart due to the pandemic, and so is the parade by recipients of the national bravery awards.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-fighter-pilot-rafale-jets-and-soldiers-in-masks-key-things-to-watch-for-this-year-s-republic-day-parade-101611456767485.html
24-01-2021||India||India, China to hold ninth round of talks to resolve Ladakh border standoff||Indian and Chinese military commanders will meet for the ninth time on Sunday to discuss and defuse tensions in the eastern Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The corps commander-level talks will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, said officials familiar with the development.Like the previous rounds, the meeting may not yield a positive outcome in the short-term, officials said, adding that, the dialogue, however, has to go on. Experts too are not expecting any major breakthrough through the military talks.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said it is a good thing that talks are going on and communication is being maintained between the two sides. “However, it is unlikely that any breakthrough will take place as there does not seem to be any common ground on the basis of which an agreement can take place. This common ground has to be established in political or diplomatic level engagements. Since this has not happened, we should not expect much from the military talks,” he added.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had said during the eighth round of talks on November 6 that they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said earlier this month that India was committed to resolving the situation along the contested LAC through talks but no one should test India’s patience. “We are committed to resolving disputes through talks and political efforts. However, no one should make the mistake of testing India’s patience,” he had said.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. The PLA has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged.India has been pushing for a comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks. China, however, wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.On Saturday, in a warning to China, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said, "If they (China) can get aggressive, we will also get aggressive. We have full preparations (to meet any eventuality).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-ninth-round-of-talks-to-resolve-ladakh-border-standoff-101611455043352.html

The notice has been issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT after reviewing replies of blocked apps, according to a source who did not wish to be identified. When contacted, Tiktok confirmed to have received a reply from the government. "We are evaluating the notice and will respond to it as appropriate. TikTok was among the first companies to comply with the Government of India directive issued on June 29, 2020. We continually strive to comply with local laws and regulations and do our best to address any concerns the government may have. Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users remains to be our topmost priority," a TikTok spokesperson said. The government had blocked 59 Chinese apps in June and 118 more apps, including PUBG mobile game, in September. The Ministry of Information Technology had blocked the apps under section 69A of the Information Technology Act after learning that the apps are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-continue-ban-on-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-101611449871189.html
24-01-2021||India||BSF unearths tunnel used by Pak to send in terrorists to India||The Border Security Force (BSF) on Saturday found a 150-metre-long underground tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir that had been used by Pakistani intelligence to infiltrate terrorists into India. It is the second tunnel to be discovered in 10 days by the force that last year went on a campaign mode to detect and destroy a web of tunnels believed to have been built by Pakistan’s deep state, a senior BSF official said on Saturday.The 39-metre-deep tunnel was detected between Border Post number 14 and 15 near BSF’s outpost at Pansar, Kathua district. On the other side of the fence are Pakistani border outposts of Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-de-Kothe in Shakargarh district.Shakargarh, the area across the fence, is home to a terror training facility overseen by one of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s operational commanders, Kasim Jan, who, Indian intelligence believes, was involved in the November 19 Nagrota encounter in Jammu and is the principal accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack. Jan is also one of the main launch commanders of the Jaish terrorists into India.“This is huge,” said the senior BSF official cited above, who requested anonymity. Because the tunnel appears to be at least six to eight years old, it would have been used for infiltration for a long time. Also, it is located in a place that has seen action in the past, right from 2012 when Pakistan mounted an assault on the forward duty point and constructed a new bunker on the zero line in the vicinity.Not far from where the tunnel was found, BSF assistant commandant Vinay Prasad, who was leading a border domination patrol, was killed by sniper fire from across the border in January 2019. A group of terrorists was noticed in the same area in November 2019.It is very important to detect all the tunnels built by the Pakistani military and its terrorists because the infiltration of terrorists through them practically nullifies the utility of deployment of soldiers along the Line of Control (LoC). When it becomes too difficult to cross the LoC, Pakistani terrorists use these tunnels, a senior counterterror official said in Delhi.Border Security Force director general Rakesh Asthana had ordered the force to step up efforts to detect tunnels after the Nagrota encounter in November when security forces were able to trace the route taken by the terrorists who had crossed over using one of the many tunnels the Pakistani military built for the terrorists to sneak into India.Security officials underscore that proper engineering efforts had gone into the construction of the tunnels that have been detected in recent times, pointing to the involvement of the Pakistani military along the heavily guarded border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-unearths-tunnel-used-by-pak-to-send-in-terrorists-to-india-101611449366277.html
24-01-2021||India||Republic Day tableau to honour Indian worker||The Rafale fighter jets won’t be the only stars of the Republic Day parade this year. The humble Indian worker, who bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, will be part of the show, too, in the labour ministry’s first tableau at the parade, both in a salute to his resilience and a bit of political messaging.The ministry is still wrapping up some of the initiatives it introduced in 2020 for the benefit of migrant workers, millions of whom fled the cities and headed back home to the countryside in an exodus that followed the lockdown enforced on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)The theme of the tableau, which features workers in hard hats and safety gear, is encapsulated in the slogan: “Mehnat ko samman, Adhikar ek samaan’’ (Respect for hard work, Equal rights for all).Also Read | No chief guest this Republic DayA spokesperson for the labour ministry pointed out that the occasion precedes the imminent implementation of the new labour codes, which aim to bring the unorganised section of the workforce under the social security net. The government this week held its final round of consultations with stakeholders to sew up the rules for the code.“The design {of the tableau} is a celebration of workers’ well- being and security,’’ minister for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar said.The three labour code bills — the Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020; the Industrial Relations Code, 2020; and the Code on Social Security, 2020 — merged 24 central labour laws and were passed by Parliament in September as part of National Democratic Alliance government’s reform agenda. The Code on Social Security, 2020 promised universal social security for the first time, for both organised and informal workers as well as gig and platform workers.Labour unions haven’t been enthusiastic about the new labour codes. Tapan Sen, a leader of the Centre for Trade Unions, said labour groups had met the minister on January 20 and rejected the changes, calling them exploitative because they allowed hiring and firing of workers by management teams.“ We want this to be scrapped and fresh discussions to be initiated. This R-day initiative is just to hide the governmenr’s misdeeds,’’ said Sen.The tableau will also have gig workers, platform workers and artistes performing as delivery agents and cargo carriers.Also Read | Ayodhya, upcoming Ram Temple in Uttar Pradesh’s tableau for Republic Day“With the tableau, we want to showcase how the new labour code will give a new direction to the lives of labourers,’’ said Gangwar. The front of the tableau will have a “confident and empowered worker holding a tool and leading the way. A yellow safety cap suggests social security, wage security and health security under labour reforms.’’Anindita Adhikari, who works with the Stranded Workers Action Network that has done several studies on the impact the lockdown had on the informal workforce, said the government was “valourising the workers after crushing them’’ — a reference to the impact of the lockdown that cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.She also mocked the image of the tableau. “Which worker looks like this? Certainly not the informal workers who make up the bulk of the workers in the country,’’ Adhikari said.A labour ministry spokesperson responded by saying the government had set up 24x7 helplines, helped release wages and cleared emergency provident fund withdrawals in record time. According to the government’s own report, prepared by a group of ministers, 95 million urban workers felt the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-tableau-to-honour-indian-worker-101611448943408.html
24-01-2021||India||1.5 million Indians receive Covid -19 vaccine in 8 days: Govt data||Eight days after the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the total number of people vaccinated against the coronavirus disease across the country crossed 1.5 million, with 146,598 health care workers receiving the first shot on Saturday.The daily number of shots administered had risen to 230,000 on Thursday after changes were made to the Co-WIN platform to allow walk-ins on Tuesday. The app now allows registered beneficiaries to get the shot out-of-turn even if their name does not figure on the list for a particular day.University of Oxford’s Our World in Data showed on Thursday that India is now the fastest country to breach the million-mark in immunisation, taking only six days compared to nine by the US. The country has set a target of vaccinating 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase.The data showed a vaccination rate of 55.3% on Saturday, down from 57% on Thursday. However, some parts of the country reported a jump in the vaccination rate, including Delhi, where the vaccination centres saw over 86% of the target achieved.“The number of people getting vaccinated is gradually going up. This is largely due to the health care workers seeing their seniors and peers receiving the shots without any adverse events. Slowly, the hesitancy is going down,” said a senior doctor from one of the central government-run hospitals in Delhi on condition of anonymity.The pace of the vaccination drive so far has worried authorities as well as experts who have raised concerns about the wastage of doses since vaccinators at some locations could not find enough recipients to finish doses from the vials that they had opened.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that many health workers were hesitant of receiving the vaccine.Meanwhile, seven states — Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal — will start using Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the coming week. Initially, 12 states were administering the indigenously produced vaccine to the health workers.On Saturday, 123 adverse reactions were reported across the country, according to the provisional data provided by the Union health ministry. So far, only 11 people have had to be hospitalised after receiving the shot.The death of a 56-year-old health worker was reported on Friday, days after she was given the first vaccine dose. The postmortem exam, however, said that death was caused due to an underlying heart disease and was not linked to the vaccine. Since the start of the immunisation programme on January 16, six deaths have been reported across the country but none of them have been caused by the vaccine, the Union health ministry has said.The Union health ministry is also training immunisation programme managers of 13 countries — Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Seychelles and Sri Lanka — using Indian vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-million-indians-receive-covid-19-vaccine-in-8-days-govt-data-101611448220800.html

I condemn this," Chowdhury said.Chowdhury said he had political differences with Mamata Banerjee but added that she is the Chief Minister of West Bengal and "has been insulted in official ceremonies".The West Bengal Chief Minister did not deliver her speech "in protest" during the event at Victoria Memorial to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose after 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans were raised when she was invited to speak.The Chief Minister said "government program should have some dignity" and it "is not fair to insult somebody whom you have invited".The event was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In her brief remarks, a visibly upset Mamata Banerjee said it was a government program and not that of a political party.The Trinamool Congress leader also said that she was grateful to the Prime Minister and Cultural Ministry for organising the event in Kolkata.Netaji's birth anniversary is being observed as Parakram Diwas in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raising-slogan-was-attempt-to-insult-mamata-at-netaji-event-says-congress-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-101611447502065.html

24-01-2021||India||Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishield after concerns over Chinese vaccine||Several countries that have been offered or purchased Chinese Covid-19 vaccines, including Brazil and Cambodia, have turned to India for supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine amid questions about the efficacy of some of the Chinese jabs.India is receiving numerous requests for vaccines, both as grant assistance and commercial supplies, and these have increased since New Delhi rolled out nearly five million doses of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, for seven countries in the neighbourhood.On Friday, India rolled out two million doses as commercial supplies to Brazil, where the question of opting between the AstraZeneca vaccine and Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine is at the heart of differences between President Jair Bolsonaro and several governors, including Sao Paulo governor João Doria, widely seen as Bolsonaro’s main rival for the 2022 presidential race.Bolsonaro had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 8 to expedite the shipping of two million doses of Covishield as he hoped to launch the vaccination drive from the presidential palace this week. At the time, however, India was yet to launch its own vaccination drive and officials were working out the timeframe for rolling out vaccine grants and commercial supplies.Doria subsequently launched the vaccination drive with CoronaVac, and Brazil plans to cover 230 million people with its vaccination drive. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Brazil intends to acquire more of the AstraZeneca jab and also manufacture it.Indonesia, which has received three million doses of CoronaVac for its free vaccination drive, too is looking to acquire the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Indonesia’s Indofarma company is in talks with the Serum Institute to procure Covishield. “Hopefully, this will be realised soon,” said a person aware of the discussions.On Monday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen made a request for vaccine assistance from India during a meeting with Indian envoy Devyani Khobragade. Officials in Phnom Penh said the country is interested in both Covishield and Covaxin, which is made by Bharat Biotech, as they can be stored at temperatures suitable for Cambodia.China, one of the biggest supporters of Cambodia that has provided soft loans worth billions of dollars, has donated one million doses of Sinovac vaccine to vaccinate 500,000 people. However, the people cited above said Cambodia will need many more doses to cover a majority of its population of nearly 17 million.At the same time, questions have been raised about the efficacy of CoronaVac after trials in Brazil demonstrated an efficacy rate of around 50% – significantly lower than the vaccines from AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer. A trial in Indonesia also showed an efficacy of 65.3%.Though Sinovac is conducting trials in several countries, experts have questioned its lack of openness and noted the company has not released much data. John Moore, a vaccine researcher with Weill Cornell Medicine, told NPR: “It's science by press release. The Chinese are being, well, characteristically less than transparent.”Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “If you look at it from the viewpoint of beneficiary countries, no single supplier can provide their entire need for vaccines and they are looking for more options. They cannot say no to China and some vaccines may not be up to the mark though they want to exercise other options.“There is a clear preference for multiple options, and India is preferred option for potential beneficiary countries because of its global reputation as a vaccine manufacturer. Besides, the Serum Institute has the Oxford-AstraZeneca connection. This is good for Indian diplomacy in both South Asia and the extended neighbourhood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countries-seek-doses-of-sii-s-covishiled-after-concerns-over-chinese-vaccine-101611446715420.html
24-01-2021||India||Mollem project: Board passed clearances in haste||Three members of the Goa State Wildlife Board have submitted a memorandum to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), constituted by the Supreme Court, stating that the clearances granted by the Board were passed in haste, without recording their objections, and without clearly explaining the potential damage to the eco-sensitive zones, and the mitigation measures planned.Rajendra Kerkar, who called on the CEC, which is currently on a site visit to Goa, said that the members were surprised after the meeting to note the minutes mentioned that the projects were ‘recommended by the Board’. “The matter was not on the agenda for the day’s meeting but was mentioned nonetheless, with the nature and scale of the projects, including the harmful effects and possible mitigation measures not fully explained. Our objections were not recorded. We have explained this to the CEC,” Kerkar told HT.“We also explained to them that these are tiger habitats, thick forests and biodiversity hotspots and that they should be preserved and cared for. We are opposed to all the three projects because it will be damaging to the ecosystem,” Kerkar said.Kerkar was present in the meeting held in December 2019 when the three projects were allegedly cleared. Environmental NGO, the Goa Foundation, had petitioned the CEC challenging the decision of the standing committee of the National Board of Wildlife to grant clearances to three infrastructure projects.After an initial hearing via videoconference, the CEC decided to hold site visits to examine veracity of allegations.Besides environmental groups, leading members of the opposition, including Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat called on the CEC to explain their reservations against the government’s plans to push ahead with the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mollem-project-board-passed-clearances-in-haste-101611445034468.html
24-01-2021||India||Adjudicating during Covid pandemic: Judges weigh in||Decades after the 1975 Emergency, four judges of the Supreme Court on Saturday recalled how the Covid-19 pandemic presented a somewhat similar situation before the courts which had to adopt a much finer line of judicial review to scrutinise state actions that curbed fundamental freedoms of individuals without resorting to emergency powers.Recalling these times when the country saw frequent lockdowns, restriction on movement of citizens and enhanced power of the executive, Justice DY Chandrachud said, “Even as emergency in the constitutional sense was not declared in India, several executive and legislative actions were initiated to meet the extraordinary challenge of our times. It became incumbent upon courts that state action is a rational means to secure a legitimate aim with least infringement of fundamental rights of individuals.”The judge was speaking at an online event organised to release a book “The Law on Emergency Powers: Comparative Common Law Perspectives” written by senior lawyer and Member of Parliament Abhishek Manu Singhvi along with Khagesh Gautam, a professor of law at Jindal Global Law School. The book was originally the doctoral thesis submitted by Singhvi during his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, almost four decades ago. It was reviewed by Gautam and reproduced in the contemporary context.Releasing the book, Justice NV Ramana, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court after the CJI, said, “Emergency had a long-lasting impact on generations,” recalling how those years shaped him personally to be part of the civil liberty movement. The book analysed the concept and need of emergency powers, martial laws, military action in aid of civil authority by making a comparative analysis of the law existing in common law jurisdictions in India, the US and the United Kingdom.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul recalled the ADM Jabalpur case of 1976 where a majority bench refused to act against the executive action to suspend fundamental rights during the Emergency. This decision was overruled by a majority ruling of a nine-judge Supreme Court bench in the KS Puttaswamy case on August 24, 2017 by which the right to privacy was declared a fundamental right.In his address, Justice Kaul spoke of the global threat where a de facto emergency-like situation could occur without resorting to emergency provisions. As many as 13 countries imposed an emergency on account of the extraordinary situation due to Covid-19. However, in the Indian context, he said the balance between public health and rule of law was maintained.Justice Surya Kant, the fourth judge to speak on the occasion, noted that no formal emergency was declared during the Covid-19 pandemic. He felt that the real issues facing countries in the contemporary context were terrorism and domestic unrest and to deal with them, nations were using ordinary laws and delegated powers instead of emergency provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adjudicating-during-covid-pandemic-judges-weigh-in-101611444166632.html
24-01-2021||India||India is ready to match China’s aggression, says Air Force chief||On the eve of military talks with China, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday that India was ready to match China’s aggression in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where the two countries have been locked in a border row since May 2020."If they (China) can get aggressive, we will also get aggressive. We have full preparations (to meet any eventuality),” the IAF chief said during a media interaction in Jodhpur, where India and France are carrying out joint air force drills.Bhadauria’s comments came a day ahead of the ninth round of military talks with China to defuse border tensions in Ladakh.The corps commander-level talks between the Indian army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on Sunday, said officials familiar with the development. Last month, the IAF chief said the likely reasons for Chinese actions could include a planned escalation and an attempt to establish border claim lines and start border talks on the new positions, military signalling, domination efforts with escalation control and deployment and training of their Western Theatre forces in real war-like scenarios wherein the Galwan Valley incident was an overreach.On June 15 in the Galwan Valley, a violent clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers left at least 20 Indian troops dead and caused an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.Senior Indian and Chinese commanders last met on November 6. The situation in the Ladakh sector remains tense and the ongoing military dialogue has not led to any breakthrough. “Talks may not yield a positive outcome in the short-term but the dialogue has to go on,” said one of the officials cited above.Experts are also not expecting much from the military talks. It is a good thing that talks are going on and communication is being maintained between the two sides, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“However, it is unlikely that any breakthrough will take place as there does not seem to be any common ground on the basis of which an agreement can take place. This common ground has to be established in political or diplomatic level engagements. Since this has not happened, we should not expect much from the military talks,” Hooda said.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China are prolonged.During the eighth round of talks on November 6, the Indian army and the PLA said they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. The PLA has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.Earlier, Naravane said India should not read too much into the withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no reduction of troops by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.He said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks whereas the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-ready-to-match-china-s-aggression-says-air-force-chief-101611443870528.html
24-01-2021||India||Discontent at CWC meet over polls for Congress election panel||As more details of Friday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting emerged, it is now clear that the new bone of contention between party leaders who in August called for an overhaul of the organisation and staunch loyalists of the leadership is a demand that members of the Central Election Committee (CEC) be elected, not nominated.Hindustan Times has spoken to several delegates who attended the meeting, including signatories to the letter written in August to chief Sonia Gandhi in which they demanded a “full-time and effective” leadership that is “visible” and “active”. The people, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the schedule for elections to the post of president and CWC members was accepted, but a spat ensued when the demand was voiced for CEC members to be elected.The demand was articulated by Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, his deputy Anand Sharma, and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who wasn’t a signatory to the original letter, but supported elections to the CEC, the people said. They said CEC members should be chosen by the same electoral college that takes part in the election of the president.The CEC, headed by Sonia Gandhi, selects the party’s candidates to all elections. At present, its members include Rahul Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, senior leaders AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal, Mohsina Kidwai, Girija Vyas, Janardan Dwivedi, M Veerappa Moily and Oscar Fernandes.The opposition to the proposal was initially in the form of a healthy debate. Antony opposed the proposal in what one letter writer described as a “sober manner”. Soni asked if election to the CEC would require an amendment to the Congress’s constitution and Sharma clarified that it didn’t.It was around that point of time that Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot used “harsh words” against the letter writers. Since the December 19 meeting with Gandhi, there had been a feeling that a reproachment was in the works, especially with Venugopal and Soni reaching out to the letter writers to understand their concerns and implement reforms within the party.Gehlot is learnt o have questioned the need for the 23 leaders to send such a letter in the first place. “Nobody even knows your names, nobody recognises you,’’ Gehlot is learnt to have said. To which Sharma responded: “That may well be true. I don’t have any identity but that of Indian National Congress. And it’s because of that our faces and names are known. And that’s why you are also known. This is not the way to talk. Nobody has given you the authority to insult your colleagues.’’Rahul Gandhi then intervened. “I can understand the emotion that Ashok Gehlot had expressed (his views with) and what he was feeling, but at the same time I agree with Anand Sharma ji and feel that harsh words should never have been spoken,” people who attended the meeting quoted him as saying.A letter writer said the delegates were taken aback by the Rajasthan CM’s words. “Just because he is a chief minister, it doesn’t give him authority over us. There are six former chief ministers among the letter writers,’’ said this person.HT reached out to Gehlot’s office, but received no response. A spokesperson for Congress denied that there had been any harsh exchange of words at the meeting.While the letter writers want elections at all levels and the CEC is one such forum, a former CWC member told HT that the CEC’s membership carried the kind of prestige that even the CWC, the party’s top decision making body, didn’t have. “It’s the only one where a member can feel important and seems to influence who gets a party ticket,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discontent-at-cwc-meet-over-polls-for-congress-election-panel-101611443465055.html
24-01-2021||India||Jagan, state poll panel tussle over local elections escalates||In an unprecedented development, the Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday boycotted the start of the process initiated by state election commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar for the conduct of village council elections next month after he refused to delay the polls until after the Covid-19 vaccination drive is completed.State chief secretary Adiyanath Das, director general of police Gautam Sawang, panchayat raj principal secretary Gopala Krishna Dwivedi and panchayat raj commissioner Girija Shankar stayed away from a video conference held by Kumar discuss the state’s preparedness for elections, which were notified in the morning.All district collectors, superintendents of police, district panchayat officers and other field officers also boycotted the video conference that had been scheduled to start at 3 pm. After waiting until 5 pm, Kumar left his office to go into a huddle with legal advisors. Soon after releasing the notification for the gram panchayat elections in the morning, the SEC sent a communication to the chief secretary and other officials for attending the video conference to discuss the process of conducting elections without affecting the Covid-19 vaccination process.The chief secretary wrote back to Kumar asking him to defer the video conference until the Supreme Court takes a decision on Monday on the state government’s special leave petition to stall the election process until the completion of the coronavirus disease vaccination exercise.Kumar said that since the notification for the four-phase gram panchayat elections had already been issued and the nominations for the first phase would begin to be filed on Monday, the preparatory exercise should begin immediately. Polling for the 13,000-odd gram panchayats is scheduled to be held on February 5,9,13 and 17.Kumar said he would abide by whatever the Supreme Court decides. “I have complete faith in the judiciary,” he said.The government of chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy also decided to defy the SEC’s directive to remove as many as nine “tainted officials,” including two district collectors and a superintendent of police, who allegedly failed to prevent irregularities in local body polls in March 2020 and curb violence.The chief secretary wrote to the SEC the government won’t take action against them at this stage as they were actively involved in the fight against the Covid-19 and engaged in implementation of vaccination drive.The Andhra Pradesh state government employees’ federation chief Venkatrami Reddy found fault with the SEC’s release of the notification for the local body elections heedless of the pandemic. “There is no question of taking part in the election process unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccination,” he said.Reddy said the employees were not worried about disciplinary action. “What can he {SEC} do? He can at the most suspend a few senior officials. Can he suspend thousands of government employees with one stroke? Even if we are suspended, we would be back in our jobs the moment Kumar steps down from his post two months later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-state-poll-panel-tussle-over-local-elections-escalates-101611443227521.html

This plan will prove to be effective in preventing migration and making rural areas self-sufficient through tourism,” Maharaj said.He further said that homestays developed in these villages will be constructed following local traditional architectural style.The tourism department has selected villages in districts like Uttarkashi, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Chamoli.Under the Trekking Traction Homestay Scheme, villages near important and popular trekking routes are being developed by the tourism department as trekking clusters. This will give a lodging facility to the tourists and they will be able to enjoy the place by staying there. Under this scheme, financial assistance of ₹60,000 per room is given to locals for building new rooms in their houses for the purpose of home-stay and ₹25,000 for constructing new toilets with the rooms. The financial assistance is provided for a maximum of up to six rooms.Dilip Jawalkar, secretary for tourism in the state said that the beneficiaries of the scheme will be selected through a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate.He further said that the committee will conduct an evaluation after which the amount of grant will be transferred directly to the beneficiary's bank account through Direct Bank Transfer under the recommendation of the district magistrate.The state government has already selected eight beneficiaries from Agora and Dasna villages in Uttarkashi district which fall on the Dodital trek route.The state tourism department started the scheme from Chopta village near Tungnath shrine, the world's highest temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.To increase lodging facilities in such areas, the secretary for tourism has also instructed district officials to renovate the old bungalows of Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam after permission is obtained from the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-tourism-dept-selects-29-hill-villages-to-promote-trekking-clusters-101611433321986.html
24-01-2021||India||1000 held for rioting at Bhopal rally against farm laws||Nearly 1000 unidentified people including Congress workers have been booked for allegedly rioting and using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty during a rally against the Centre’s three new farm laws in Bhopal on Saturday, the police said.110 Congress leaders, including former chief minister and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh, Congress MLAs PC Sharma, Sajjan Verma, Jaivardhan Singh, Kunal Choudhary and others were arrested under Section 151 of CrPC (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offence), said Upendra Jain, additional director general of police (ADG), Bhopal.During the rally, a large number of unidentified Congress workers clashed with police personnel in which the police, mediapersons and about a dozen Congress leaders and workers sustained injuries, said the ADG.“Congress workers and other protestors went out of control and manhandled police personnel. They also vandalized barricades and police vehicles. Police resorted to baton charge, used water cannons and fired tear gas to control the mob, said the ADG.A case has been registered against 1000 unidentified people under Section 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), he added.However, Congress leaders accused the police of using force to create a nuisance during a peaceful protest of farmers and Congress. Former minister and Congress MLA Brijendra Singh Rathore said, “Police used force to create a nuisance during the peaceful protest. Many leaders were injured seriously in the baton charge of the police.”Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath also attacked the BJP-led state government and said, “Police used force against the farmers and Congress workers during the peaceful protest. This barbaric act of the BJP-led state government is unacceptable. But this will not stop us. We will continue our struggle against the anti-farmers laws of the Centre,” said Kamal Nath.However, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “The protest is not for farmers but for retaining the posts in MPCC. Congress leaders are more concerned about their posts than farmers. We had already seen during the regime of the Congress government that how sensitive they were for farmers. They cheated farmers in the name of a farm loan waiver scheme. The protest was just a drama and nothing else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1000-plus-congress-leaders-held-for-rioting-at-bhopal-rally-against-farm-laws-101611431207777.html
24-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand to give ₹15 lakh to kin of martyrs, says CM Trivendra Singh Rawat||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday announced that the state government would now provide a sum of ₹15 lakh to the families of martyred soldiers hailing from the state.Rawat made the announcement while laying the foundation of Sainya Dham-- a memorial dedicated to soldiers-- in Dehradun’s Purkul village on Saturday in the presence of other cabinet ministers and retired army officers.Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling Uttarakhand the Sainya Dham - fifth dham after the traditional Char Dhams -- Rawat in 2019 had announced that the state government will set up a Sainya Dham in Dehradun.Making the announcement, Rawat said, “Till now the amount provided by the state government to the families of martyred soldiers was ₹10 lakh which has now been increased to ₹15 lakh. It is a small gesture to assure that the government is always there for the family members of our brave soldiers.”Informing about the details of the Sainya Dham to be built in an area of five hectares, the CM said that the administration will bring soil from the house of every martyr in the state while building the structure.“We want the visitors to know that the dham comprises the soil in which the martyrs spent their childhood and grew up to serve the nation. We will also try to bring at least one item belonging to the martyr from his house to be kept in a museum in the Sainya Dham. It would motivate the youths, sisters and mothers visiting the site,” said Rawat adding that water from the major rivers of the state would also be used in building the dham.Hailing the initiative, he also said that the government wants the Sainya Dham to be a “lively” one.“We want that every pebble in it should narrate the stories of our martyrs so as to bring enthusiasm in visitors. It would be such that the future CMs would take their oath here and every visitor coming to Dehradun would come here to pay tribute to the martyred soldiers,” said Rawat.He also informed that there would also be a centre in the dham to train those children who want to join the army.“We have formed a special committee which will contemplate all these features and decide its structure to set it up as a major landmark in the state as well as country,” he said.The initiative of setting up the Sainya Dham was taken after Prime Minister Modi, during an election rally in Rudrapur in March 2019, said: “Devbhumi Uttarakhand has char dhams, but today I add a fifth -Sainya Dham- as every second house in this state is of an army man.”Following that, Rawat last year made the announcement of setting it up while addressing a gathering of ex-servicemen at Sainya Sammelan organised in Dehradun as part of the government’s week-long state foundation day celebrations for which the theme was ‘Mere Sainik Mera Abhiman’ (my soldiers, my pride).Once built, it will have details of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. It will also house details of the rich legacy of soldiers from Uttarakhand and their contribution over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-give-rs-15-lakh-to-kin-of-martyrs-says-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-101611429910166.html
