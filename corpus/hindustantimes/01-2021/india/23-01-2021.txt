The Rafale fleet is ready to undertake any operation. Rafale is not only able to operate in different parts of the county but across the world. It is able to complete all the tasks that any fourth-generation or fifth-generation fighter can do," Kumar told ANI."The Rafales we (IAF) have are the fastest and most advanced as of now," said the Rafale pilot, when asked if Indian Rafales were more advanced than their French counterparts.Kumar further said that the 'Desert Knight-21' was a successful exercise."This has been a really important exercise for the integration of Rafale in the operations of the IAF. The basics of all these exercises were all about cooperation, learning from each other's experiences while operating in different terrains, spectrum and thereafter applying it to enhance our operational capability. So this has been a really successful exercise," he said."We have flown with their (France) pilots in Rafale cockpits. We learned from them what they do in different situations and similarly, they have also learned from us. Both of us learned great lessons," he added.India and France have fielded a number of fighter jets in the exercise which include Rafales of two sides besides Mirages and the Sukhois of the Indian Air Force.The French are participating in the exercise with Rafale, Airbus A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), A-400M Tactical Transport aircraft and approximately 175 personnel.The IAF aircraft participating in the exercise include Mirage 2000, Su-30 MKI, Rafale, IL-78 Flight Refuelling Aircraft, Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS) and an AEW&C aircraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-ready-to-tackle-any-challenge-from-leh-to-kanyakumari-says-rafale-pilot-101611426082068.html
23-01-2021||India||4°C fall in temp from Jan 26, cold wave return likely: IMD||After a brief respite, the capital is likely to return to cold wave conditions starting on Republic Day when the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius -- the fallout of weather factors at play in the Himalayas and in the northern plains, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.The Western Himalayas experienced widespread snowfall and rain on Friday and Saturday, and an induced cyclonic circulation was over Punjab and its neighbourhood in the plains . A western disturbance loomed over north Pakistan and its neighbourhood as a cyclonic circulation.Under the influence of such atmospheric factors, widespread rain or snowfall with moderate thunderstorms, lightning and hail are likely to lash Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh over the weekend, according to the IMD’s Saturday bulletin.Uttarakhand is also expected to experience similar weather. Light rain and thundershowers are likely in isolated places over north Punjab, north Haryana and Chandigarh until Sunday.“There has been widespread snowfall in the hills on Friday and Saturday. Rain is also likely over north Punjab and north Haryana. From January 25 onwards; very cold northwesterly winds are likely to blow over Delhi which will lead to a significant fall in minimum temperatures. On January 26, 27 and 28, minimum temperature is likely to fall to 4 degree C over Delhi,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting centre.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 20.4 degrees C, 1 degree below normal ,and minimum temperature of 8 degree C on Saturday. Delhi recorded “very poor” air quality on Saturday with an air quality index reading of 326.“Wind speed is likely to reduce on Sunday as wind direction will change from southeasterly to northwesterly tomorrow. During transition of wind direction, wind speed is low which affects dispersion of pollutants. Winds are likely to be northwesterly during next three days blowing at 10 to 12 kmph, not enough for adequate dispersal of pollutants so air quality is likely to be in poor to very poor category for the next few days.,” said VK Soni, a scientist at IMD’s air quality division. Dense to very dense fog is likely over pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the next 4-5 days; and over Bihar, north Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Odisha during the next 2-3 days.Cold day or severe cold day conditions are likely over some pockets of Uttar Pradesh during the next 2-3 days and over Haryana during the next 24 hours. Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over north Rajasthan during January 24 to 27 and over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on anuary 26 and 27, according to the bulletin.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degrees C below normal. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches less than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees C in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4c-fall-in-temp-from-jan-26-cold-wave-return-likely-imd-101611425691831.html
23-01-2021||India||In poll-bound Bengal, politics overshadows Netaji’s birth anniversary||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to celebrate Subhas Chandra Bose’s birthday in Kolkata as Parakram Diwas, or day of valour, ran into a political debate on Saturday with chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressing anger at Bharatiya Janata Party supporters present at the PM’s main event raising the Jai Sri Ram slogan hours after she accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of not showing respect to the iconic freedom fighter.With political tension rising in the state where elections are due in March-April, the tussle between the saffron camp and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) intensified, with the Left and Congress, who are now electoral partners, not missing the opportunity to take potshots at their rivals.Some leaders and political experts even described Modi’s visit as an exercise to woo Bengali voters on whom Bose’s ideology has great influence even after 76 years of his mysterious disappearance.Sparks started flying in the afternoon when Banerjee, after leading a roadshow sans any TMC flag through the heart of Kolkata, said that if the Centre really wanted to show respect to Bose it would not have dissolved the Planning Commission of India that Bose conceived. She even questioned large central spending on aircrafts (she did not specify which one) and a new Parliament building but not on a monument dedicated to Bose.She demanded revival of the Planning Commission and a national holiday on January 23.Without naming the BJP or Modi, whose flight was yet to arrive, Banerjee said, “They want to celebrate the day as Parakram Diwas (day of valour). Kiya hai Parakram? (What is parakram?). They could have consulted us on use of the right word. We are celebrating Desh Nayak Diwas (day of the national hero). Netaji does not need anyone’s favour. We will set up a monument dedicated to the Azad Hind Bahini (Indian National Army that Bose led). We will show proper respect to Netaji.”Banerjee even demanded that India should have four capitals in four corners of the country where Parliament sessions can be held on rotation. “A one party, one government system will not work in this country. States have equal rights. Netaji believed that the nation belongs to Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and people from all religions and class,” she said.A few hours later, Modi’s main event at the Victoria Memorial Hall pushed politics to the fore when Banerjee lost her temper on hearing the Jai Sri Ram slogan while she was about to address the audience.“I feel a government programme must have some dignity. This is not a political programme but a government programme and it is for the public and all political parties. I am grateful to the Prime Minister that this event is being held in Kolkata. But you have no right to invite someone to a government programme and insult that person. In protest, I am not saying anything,” said Banerjee before raising her own slogan Jai Hind, Jai Bangla, which is meant to project Bengal’s identity against her repeated assertion that the BJP is “a party of outsiders.”Speaking after her, Modi said the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India project, which focuses on indigenous production of all products, would have made Bose proud had he been around.“The nation is following the path Netaji showed. I often think how Netaji would feel seeing India surging ahead, its army getting modern weapons and planes like Rafale guarding the nation. How proud he must have felt seeing India giving vaccines to other nations,” said Modi.All political parties, including the CPI(M), as well as eminent intellectuals of Kolkata condemned the sloganeering. Some BJP leaders tried to play down the incident while others argued that it is a way of greeting people and does not carry any political message.“Modi’s speech made the purpose of his visit before the polls quite apparent. But it misfired. It will have no impact on voters,” TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy told HT while condemning the raising of the slogan.Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay too felt Modi’s visit will not impact voters. “Netaji’s real followers believe in his secular and all-inclusive nationalism. These people will not vote for the BJP. If the BJP wants to reach out to them it has to alter its approach,” Bandopadhyay told HT.“Banerjee’s demand for multiple capitals, however, will not work in India as we have a federal structure,” he added.Former Tripura governor and BJP leader Tathagata Roy was present at the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds when the Jai Sri Ram slogan was heard. “Some people were simply teasing Banerjee since she had chased at people in the past for raising it in her presence. I don’t read any politics into this,” Roy told the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-poll-bound-bengal-politics-overshadows-netaji-s-birth-anniversary-101611424000448.html

But don’t indulge in politics in issues that deal with peoples’ health” said Shah.Earlier in the day, Shah chaired the 69th plenary session of North Eastern Council (NEC) in Meghalaya’s capital Shillong where he asked states of the region to sort out their border disputes.“There is a need to resolve the disputes between the states. The whole country is one, so we need to find solutions for them. Under PM Modi’s leadership, we will resolve border disputes in the northeast. Without this development is not possible,” Shah said at the NEC meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-launches-cashless-medical-scheme-for-capf-personnel-families-101611423879034.html

23-01-2021||India||Odisha govt plans to launch employment scheme for urban poor||In a bid tgive a fillip to employment in urban areas ahead of civic polls later this year, the Naveen Patnaik government plans to convert an existing wage employment initiative that it had launched during Covid-19 lockdown into a full-fledged scheme to achieve the objective of sustainable livelihood opportunities for about 4.5 lakh urban poor families.Titled Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan or Mukta, the scheme aims at building on the relative success of the Urban Wage Employment Initiative that was launched in April last year during Covid-19 lockdown to help the informal workforce in the state’s 114 urban local bodies. Under the initiative, around ₹100 crore was allocated for all labour-intensive projects in the urban local bodies in the state for providing temporary employment to the urban poor.As per the urban development department, in the last 9 months, more than 6,000 projects have been completed under the initiative with an expenditure of ₹70 crores spent and generation of 13 lakh person-days generated. At least 3.5 lakh workers, of which 40 per cent were women, participated in the initiative.To build on the success of the initiative, the department now plans to make it a full-fledged scheme called Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan under which activities like stormwater drainage, rainwater harvesting, green cover increase, sanitation and creation of community centres and peripheral development around water bodies would be undertaken.“The new scheme would be NREGA scheme for urban areas,” said Pratap Jena, minister for urban development. “This would be a state government programme funded from its own budget."Officials of the urban development department said the scheme will build on the existing and robust welfare schemes, legislations and technological interventions (like GIS database) and converge and integrate funds and resources of its own with those of the large on-going welfare schemes."The scheme aims at reduction in livelihood vulnerabilities of the urban poor including migrant labourers and informal workers, economic empowerment of the urban informal workers especially economic empowerment of women informal workers, increased involvements and empowerment of women self-help groups and slum development associations. It would be an urban equivalent of NREGS and wages of workers would be credited to their bank account through Direct Benefit Transfer," said a senior official of the department.As Odisha receives high rainfall over a short period during monsoon, desilting and repair of stormwater drains to prevent local flooding would be a big component of the programme. They create systems to conserve rainwater, prevent flooding and beautify the state’s urban areas, rainwater harvesting structures would be constructed to conserve water and recharge groundwater sources and natural ponds and reservoirs.In addition, there will be development of new water bodies, public parks and playgrounds based on local needs and land availability, all with proper walking tracks, adequate lighting, drinking water, toilets, garbage bins and plenty of greenery. Manual clearing of water hyacinths in existing ponds and plantation drives on public land, roadsides and on river banks are envisaged.The scheme will bolster the resilience in cities by strengthening the capacities of community organisations of the urban poor to execute the scheme activities, by reducing the economic vulnerabilities of the urban poor and by creating climate-resilient assets. The scheme is expected to create community assets worth more than ₹150 crores primarily in the form of Parichaya centres and Mission Shakti Grihas. The scheme will combine resources of the ongoing development schemes with innovative approaches and technology. Further, the projects and institutions created under the Scheme will contribute to building resilience in communities.Officials said by safeguarding the livelihood needs and rights of the urban poor and by using innovative technology, appropriate implementation approaches and community strengthening, the scheme will prove to be unique safe, resilient and sustainable. The scheme is expected to generate more than 35 lakh man-days per year.The new wage employment scheme for the urban poor is the latest among a series of measures by the ruling BJD government to woo the informal workers in cities. Last month, the state government had sanctioned 1.39 lakh dwelling houses for urban homeless persons in 114 towns and cities of Odisha under the Odisha Urban Housing Mission.In April 2019, the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh had launched a similar employment scheme called ‘Mukhyamantri Yuva Swabhiman Yojana’ for young people in urban areas that guaranteed 100 days of employment every year to young people. However, the scheme did not meet with much success as only 3 per cent of the urban youth in Madhya Pradesh who were offered 100 days of employment under a state job guarantee scheme received their stipends over next 6 months.In June 2020, Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand had launched a 100-day employment scheme for urban unskilled workers calling it Mukhyamantri Shramik (Shahri Rozgar Manjuri For Kamgar) Yojna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-plans-to-launch-employment-scheme-for-urban-poor-101611422573713.html
23-01-2021||India||Appoint chairman, members for PMLA Appellate Tribunal: Lawyer’s plea in SC||Mounting pendency at the Appellate Tribunal, Prevention of Money Laundering Act (ATPMLA) which has remained without a chief since September 2019 has forced a lawyer to approach the top court and demand for the vacancies of Chairman and three members to be filled up urgently.The ATPMLA deals with sensitive and crucial cases arising out of appeals under not just PMLA, but other laws such as Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA), the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), and the Prohibition Of Benami Property Transactions Act.The petition filed by Delhi-based lawyer Amit Sahni said, “The tribunal is struggling to dispense justice particularly in absence of its Chairman and three members out of sanctioned strength of four and acute shortage of administrative staff.” The Ministry of Finance is the sole respondent in the petition.In November 2020, the petitioner sought information from the Government under the Right to Information Act on total pendency of cases and vacancies in the Tribunal.As per the reply received, the post of one Member fell vacant in 2018 followed by that of the Chairman and two other Members in 2019. “The Tribunal is constrained to function with its sole member and therefore sufficient number of matters cannot be taken up in absence of Presiding Officers,” the petitioner said. About 20 administrative posts at the Tribunal also need to be filled up.Presently, over 5,000 cases are pending with the Tribunal of which the bulk of matters arise out of proceedings under PMLA. Before filing the petition, Sahni filed a representation before the government in December 2020 for taking adequate steps to fill the pending vacancies. However, no action has been taken on his request till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appoint-chairman-members-for-pmla-appellate-tribunal-lawyer-s-plea-in-sc-101611419691828.html
23-01-2021||India||'People of Tamil Nadu will determine their future, not Nagpur': Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that the people of Tamil Nadu will determine its future and not Nagpur - headquarters of BJP’s ideological parents the RSS. Gandhi promised his party will work with the southern state's people to give them a new government that they deserved.Gandhi kicked off the Congress’ election campaign from Coimbatore district for the ensuing assembly elections by attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP-led central government and the RSS for its ideology and other aspects. “You have a government in Tamil Nadu that is compromised,” Gandhi said in Coimbatore his first stop during his three-day visit to the state.“Modi uses the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate to get what he wants. He thinks just because he controls the government of Tamil Nadu, he can control its people. Nagpur cannot determine the future of Tamil Nadu. People are going to show Modi that only they can determine its future. The prime minister and RSS treat communities with disrespect.”The former Congress chief picked on issues of the centre-state divide where Tamil Nadu has viewed the BJP as a Hindi party trying to impose the language. “Currently, they are trying to bring the idea of one language, one culture which we are fighting,” said Gandhi from an open campaign van. “Modi has no respect for the culture, language and people of Tamil Nadu. He thinks Tamil people, language and culture should be subservient to his idea. We feel all languages - Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, English - have a space in the country."Also read: 'If China gets aggressive, so will India' IAF chief on eve of talks with PLAGandhi’s effort was to emotionally connect with the state by invoking his love for the language and culture and Tamil Nadu’s relationship with former prime ministers and his late grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv Gandhi. "My relationship with Tamil Nadu is not political but a family relationship. I’m at your service to protect the interest of Tamil people.”Besides holding two roadshows, Gandhi interacted with MSME representatives during the day and with industrial labourers in the evening. During the interactions, he criticised PM Modi for the implementation of GST and demonetisation and promised that the UPA would simplify the GST by restructuring it to one tax and minimum tax.Gandhi spoke of NYAY with an assurance of minimum income of 72,000 per year. He said that the country was moving in a dictatorial direction given the protests in the country, particularly on farm legislation. “The current dispensation in Delhi is not interested in negotiation, listening, and conversations,” Gandhi said. “Modi’s job is to divide the country and our job is to unite the people.”He met labourers in Tiruppur district after moving from Coimbatore. Gandhi is on a tour of the western belt where he will next visit Erode, Tiruppur, Karur and Dindigul districts to meet farmers, weavers and youngsters. The western region of the state is the bastion of the AIADMK which Congress’ longstanding ally and the principal opposition DMK is trying to breach. “We want to further strengthen our vote base and not just be dependent on alliance partners but we want to help our partners,” said AICC in-charge for Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Dinesh Gundu Rao.Gandhi’s visit comes amidst severe strains in the DMK-Congress relationship in Puducherry. Local DMK leaders in the Union territory want to contest alone where the Congress’ V Narayanaswamy is the chief minister. “Puducherry is a Congress-based state and statements from the local DMK leadership were unwarranted,” said Rao. “DMK president MK Stalin has clarified on that issue. I hope things get sorted out,” he said adding that it will not cast a shadow in Tamil Nadu. In 2019, the DMK-led alliance with Congress in the state won 38 out of 29 Lok Sabha seats.Incidentally, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami was also campaigning in Coimbatore on Saturday. Wearing a skull cap and addressing Muslims at an event, Palaniswami said, “We will never allow differences on religious lines. The AIADMK, which allied with the BJP before 2019 elections, will fight the 2021 polls together. “There is some fear over the centre's laws but minorities need not be afraid. Our government will protect you. We will not compromise on your rights under any circumstances. No one can intimidate anyone born in this soil. Everyone has a right to live,” Palaniswami said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-of-tamil-nadu-will-determine-their-future-not-nagpur-rahul-gandhi-101611419749937.html
23-01-2021||India||'Let's have a duel': Amit Shah slams Covid-19 vaccine critics||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday came down heavily on those criticising the efficacies of Covid-19 vaccines, asserting that there should be no politics on public health.Addressing a function to extend the benefit of the government's healthcare programme to the central armed police forces, he said the vaccines developed by Indian scientists are fully safe."There are some people who are spreading misinformation on the vaccines. Come to another platform and let's have a duel. But why are you creating doubt over people's health and doing politics?" he asked."I appeal to all of you to go for the vaccine when your turn comes. Do not have any doubt over its efficacy. We've already launched the world's biggest vaccination drive," he added.Shah ceremoniously distributed the 'Ayushman CAPF' health cards among some personnel from the seven Central Armed Police Forces here.He said the CAPFs had three prime concerns -- the existing health coverage was not comprehensive, the satisfaction of housing was not there and long duty hours without leaves due to non-timely recruitment."Our government is addressing all the three concerns. For the health issue, we've launched the 'Ayushman CAPF' today. This will give health insurance benefit to around 50 lakh people," Shah said.By May 1, the 'Ayushman CAPF' process will be completed by offering health cards to all the personnel of the seven central police forces, he added.The home minister said the government and the forces are trying to increase the satisfaction ratio to 55 per cent by 2022 from 36 per cent two years ago, and further take it to 65 per cent by 2025."We've completed the examination process for 50,000 recruitments. Now, we'll start the process again to hire another 50,000 persons in the CAPFs. Our target is one hiring against one departure in five years. With this, everyone will be able to stay home for 100 days in a year," he added.An MoU was signed between the National Health Authority (NHA) and Union Home Ministry in presence of Shah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and state Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the CRPF Group Centre in Guwahati.Under the initiative 'Ayushman CAPF', around 28 lakh personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), Assam Rifles and NSG and their families will be covered by the 'Ayushman Bharat: Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana'.CRPF Director-General AP Maheshwari expressed his gratitude for bringing the CAPFs under the scheme.The Home Minister also virtually inaugurated Sashastra Seema Bal's (SSB) 168 quarters, a 10-bed hospital and an administrative building located at different places of Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-have-a-duel-amit-shah-slams-covid-19-vaccine-critics-101611419653858.html

It (legal education) requires urgent and immediate reform.""I hope something can be done and we can take up this issue in the coming days," he added.The remarks by the two apex court judges came during an event for the release of the book -- The Law of Emergency Powers -- authored by Singhvi and professor Khagesh Gautam, who teaches law at Jindal Global Law School, on a legal and constitutional study of emergency powers.Speaking at the event, which was conducted virtually, Singhvi lamented upon the "glaring absence of genuine legal research in large parts of India"."Part of this is due to the many factories of legal education we produce with hardly any quality control. The negative impact of the stratification of law colleges must be urgently addressed."Central universities set up by Parliament operate their law faculty as law schools, while state universities act mostly as affiliating universities which are affiliating colleges set up by private trusts and societies," he said.He said that the major problem facing Indian legal education, particularly good legal research, was the affiliated law college system."Many do not have adequate or qualified faculty or libraries or e-resources and they omit regular classes and examinations," he added and demanded that substandard and mediocre law colleges ought to be closed down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legal-education-in-the-country-needs-urgent-reforms-supreme-court-judges-101611417640650.html
23-01-2021||India||Gujarat state election commission announces local body elections in February||Elections to six municipal corporations in Gujarat will take place on February 21 and to 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on February 28, state election commission said on Saturday.Counting of votes for the six municipal corporations will take place on February 23, and for the 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on March 2.The ruling BJP expressed confidence about winning these polls, while the opposition Congress said it would mount a legal challenge on poll authorities announcing two separate days for counting of votes.The six municipal corporations to go to polls are Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar."Polls in six municipal corporations will be held on February 21 and counting of votes will take place on February 23. Polls will take place in the 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on February 28 and results will be declared on March 2," Gujarat Election Commissioner Sanjay Prasad said.The last date to file nominations for the municipal corporation elections will be February 6, while it will be February 13 for the other set of polls, he said at a press conference here, adding that the model code of conduct had come into force immediately.These polls were to be held in October-November last year but were pushed back due to the coronavirus outbreak, and Prasad reiterated it would be conducted with strict adherence to all health protocols in place.He said standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the polls will be declared soon, and five meetings on this issue had been held so far with the state health department.EVMs will be used for the polls, of which the SEC has adequate numbers, but the VVPAT mechanism will not be deployed, Prasad informed.A total of 47,695 booths will be set up for the polls, of which over 6,000 have been marked sensitive, and 4.2 crore voters are eligible to vote for 574 corporators in six corporations, 2,720 representatives in 81 municipalities, and 9,049 representatives in district and taluka panchayats, he said.In reply to a query on the counting of votes of the municipal corporations and other local bodies being kept on two separate days, Prasad said the SEC had followed the tradition laid down earlier, and added that the coronavirus outbreak and resultant protocols had made it difficult to hold counting of votes for different polls at the same time.Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi expressed his party's displeasure at the counting of votes of the six municipal corporations being held earlier."We will legally challenge the early declaration of results of six municipal corporations as they will influence later elections," Doshi said.On the other hand, BJP Municipal Board chairperson Dhansukh Bhanderi said his party was confident of a win in these polls due to public support.Apart from the BJP and Congress, mainstays of the state's political theatre for several decades now, parties like the AIMIM and AAP have also said they would fight local bodies' polls this time.

23-01-2021||India||'Stand up to bigoted bulldozing or..': Mahua Moitra on Mamata-Jai Shri Ram row||A debate was triggered off on Saturday after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee left the stage at the Centre's event on Netaji anniversary in a huff, following chants of 'Jai Shri Ram' just before she was about to speak. Terming Mamata's reaction 'allergic', BJP leader and Netaji's grand-nephew Chandra Kumar Bose said CM need not have reacted adversely to the slogan. "This is not the day to do any politics. It is a day to celebrate. Netaji had people from all communities in Azad Hind Fauj. Whether you say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Shri Ram'. I don't find any difference," Bose told ANI.Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra trained her gun on the BJP for what happened at Saturday's event in Victoria memorial. "This government has completely violated all sanctity of a multi-faith democracy. In an official event, you can't have religion chants as long as this is a secular democracy. And it is only lumpen, uneducated people like in the BJP that can defend this kind of nonsense," she told ANI.Taking to Twiter, Moitra also urged people to "either stand up to this bigoted bulldozing where religion is equal to the government or India perishes". She also claimed that Netaji's daughter Anita Bose has said that her father would not have approved of Hindus being intolerant to other religions.Jai Shri Ram at official event to celebrate Netaji’s 125th? Jai Shri Ram in Parliament? Either we stand up to this bigoted bulldozing where religion = government or India perishesNetaji’s daughter Anita Bose tells it like it is to the radical lunatic fringe - that her father would not approve of Hindus being intolerant of other religionsJai Shri ConstitutionAnother MP Derek O'Brien criticised the "heckling" of Mamata Banerjee at the event and said dignity can't be taught to "lumpens".BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said Mamata's action showed her frustration. "I fail to understand what is the problem in chanting Jai Shri Ram and why Mamata Ji gets annoyed with it. I think the slogan was raised in her honour when she stood up. Leaving the dais because of the slogan shows nothing but her frustration," he said.Political tempers are rising in West Bengal ahead of the assembly elections slated to be held in May this year. With several heavyweight leaders, ministers leaving the Trinamool, cracks inside the party are wide open in public. Celebration of Netaji birth anniversary has also been a clashing point between the BJP and the Trinamool. Given this situation, PM Modi and Mamata Banerjee's joint appearance at the event was surprising, but Mamata refused to speak at the event as she said she felt "insulted".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stand-up-to-bigoted-bulldozing-or-mahua-moitra-on-mamata-jai-shri-ram-row-101611415165385.html

The tunnel was detected between the Border Outposts (BOPs) on Pakistan's side Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-De-Kothe, Sakargarh. The tunnel is about 140-150 metres long. It is 10-12 feet deep, the downside from the entry point and 25-30 feet deep, entered in the Indian territory. The diameter of this tunnel is 2-3 feet so that a man can easily cross by crawling," NS Jamwal, Inspector General (IG) BSF, Jammu told reporters.IG Jamwal also said that Pakistani bags and some old bags were discovered in the tunnel.The tunnel detected today is the fourth one in the last six months in Samba, Hiranagar and Kathua areas and the tenth in total in Jammu region, according to a BSF press release.Talking about the operation, the BSF IG said, "Acting upon specific intelligence inputs for a while that there was the possible existence of a tunnel in the Pansar area. Our unit detected this tunnel under the ongoing anti-tunneling campaign. It is the fourth one in the last six months in Samba, Hiranagar and Kathua areas and the tenth in total in Jammu region," he said."We consider this area a sensitive area because it is surrounded by dense forest. Some notorious incident like in June 2020, the BSF had shot down a Pakistani Hexacopter and terrorist activities are also seen in the area," he said."Ahead of January 26, we are on high alert regarding border security. I want to give credit to the troops and the Intelligence agencies who has been provided inputs (to locate the tunnel)," he said.In November 2019, BSF had foiled an infiltration bid in the same area, wherein some troops had fired upon the party trying to infiltrate into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-dug-tunnel-in-j-k-s-pansar-from-zero-line-says-bsf-ig-101611415153431.html

"Farmers will take out 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' on January 26. Barricades will be opened and we will enter Delhi. We (farmers and Delhi Police) have reached an agreement on the route, final details are to be worked out tonight," Yogendra Yadav, Swaraj India founder told ANI. "We will take out a historical and peaceful parade and it will have no effect on the Republic Day parade or the security arrangements," Yadav said. Opening border points that have remained shut for two months now, Delhi police will allow farmers to enter Delhi from five entry points. "We have been allowed to cover 100 km distance on each route," farmer leader Darshan Pal told Hindustan Times. The tractor parades will start from the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi, but details will be finalised tonight, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said after attending a meeting between the unions and the police.Farm leaders, representing thousands of agitated farmers who are camping on the borders of Delhi in the bitter cold for nearly two months now, had told the police previously that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The barricades set up at Delhi border points will be removed on January 26 so that farmers can take out their rallies, Pal said. The farmer unions have been adamant about taking out their tractor parade on Delhi's busy Outer Ring Road on January 26, even as the Delhi Police urged them to hold it outside the national capital, a request that was publicly rejected by the unions.The meeting was held between a group of farm leaders and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to discuss alternative routes for the tractor parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-march-will-have-no-effect-on-r-day-parade-says-yogendra-yadav-101611410525486.html
23-01-2021||India||Cavalcades of tractors from Punjab, Haryana set out for R-Day tractor parade||Several batches of farmers from Punjab and Haryana set out on Saturday in their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles to take part in the proposed tractor parade on January 26 in Delhi.Carrying some ration, mattresses and other essentials, cavalcades of tractors left for Delhi to press the Centre to accept their demands.Tractors carried the flags of the unions, some sported the tricolour, and also posters with slogans of 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad', 'No Farmer, No Food' and 'Kaale Kanoon Radd Karo'.Farmer unions protesting the Centre's three farm laws had said they would go ahead with their tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day.Farmer leaders said that the tractor parade would be peaceful."Over 30,000 tractors and trolleys today moved from Khanauri (in Sangrur, Punjab) and Dabwali (in Sirsa district, Haryana) to join the tractor parade in Delhi," said Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan on Saturday.They are expected to reach the Tikri border on Saturday night.Some farmers even mounted tractors on trailers and a few even towed their tractors in order to save diesel, said the farmer leaders."Some loaded their tractors in trailers and some even towed their vehicles in order to save fuel," said Kokrikalan.Similarly, a cavalcade of around 1,000 tractors left from Phagwara area and 150 tractors from Hoshiarpur in Punjab to become part of the parade, said the farmer leaders.A farmer leader in Barnala said they were getting a very good response to the call for joining the tractor parade."Youth and elders are going in their tractors towards Delhi in a peaceful manner," he said.A batch of tractors and other vehicles from Fatehabad in Haryana also left for Delhi to join the parade, they added.Many farmers from Karnal and other districts would leave for the national capital on Sunday.Independent MLA from Dadri in Haryana, Sombir Sangwan, who recently withdrew his support to the Khattar government over farmers' issue, told reporters on Saturday that the Centre will have to agree to farmers' demands.Sangwan, who had gone to meet protesting farmers at the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari, also told reporters that farmers should be freely allowed to take part in tractor parade on January 26. Kirpal Singh Moosapur, Vice-President, Bharati Kisan Union (Doaba) in Phagwara, Punjab, said, "More farmers with tractors will leave tomorrow as well. We expect over 5,000 tractors from Doaba region (in Punjab) alone to reach Delhi for the parade."Moosapur slammed the Centre for not accepting farmers' demands."Farmers have been agitating at Delhi borders for the last several weeks but the Modi government has turned a deaf ear to their demands," he said.Before heading for Delhi, many farmers got their tractors inspected from mechanics for any fault so they can have a hassle-free journey, said the farmer leaders.At many places in Punjab and Haryana, tractor marches were taken out on Saturday to mobilise more people for the tractor parade.Meanwhile, some women in Bathinda said they have asked their male members who are at the Delhi borders not to worry about homes."We are taking care of the farm and other works. We have told our male members to stay put until the demands are met," said an elderly woman in Bathinda.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops. They claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the Centre says the MSP system will remain and the new laws only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cavalcades-of-tractors-from-punjab-haryana-set-out-for-r-day-tractor-parade-101611411393119.html
23-01-2021||India||Jagan govt boycotts panchayat election process after poll panel's notification||In an unprecedented development, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh on Saturday boycotted the process initiated by the state election commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar for the conduct of gram panchayat elections in the state.State chief secretary Adiyanath Das, director-general of police Gautam Sawang, panchayat raj principal secretary Gopala Krishna Dwivedi and panchayat raj commissioner Girija Shankar stayed away from the video conference held by the SEC to discuss the preparedness for the gram panchayat elections, notification for which was released in the morning.Not just these senior officials, all the district collectors, superintendents of police, district panchayat officers and other field-level officials also boycotted the video conference that was scheduled to start at 3 pm.After waiting till 5 pm, Kumar left his office to go into huddle with his legal advisors.Soon after releasing the notification for the gram panchayat elections in the morning, the SEC sent a communication to the chief secretary and others for attending the video conference to discuss the process of conducting elections without affecting the vaccination process, while taking precautions in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.Also read: 'Won't speak at this platform' - Mamata feels 'insulted' at Centre's Netaji eventThe chief secretary wrote back to Kumar asking him to defer the video conference till the Supreme Court takes a decision on Monday on the state government’s special leave petition to stall the election process till the completion of the Covid-19 vaccination exercise.However, Kumar said since the notification for the four-phased gram panchayat elections had already been issued and the nominations for the first phase would begin on Monday, the preparatory exercise should begin forthwith. The polling for the 13,000-odd gram panchayats is scheduled to be held on February 5,9,13 and 17.He, however, said he would abide by whatever decision the Supreme Court would take on the conduct of local body polls. “I have complete faith in the judiciary,” he said.The Jagan government also decided to defy the SEC directions to remove as many as nine “tainted officials,” including two district collectors and a superintendent of police, who allegedly failed in preventing irregularities in the local body elections in March 2020 and curbing incidents of poll violence.The chief secretary wrote to the SEC that the government won’t take action against them at this stage as they were actively involved in the pandemic situation of Covid-19 and engaged in the implementation of the vaccination programme.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh state government employees’ federation Venkatrami Reddy found fault with the release of notification for the local body elections ignoring the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no question of taking part in the election process unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccination, he said.Reacting to the SEC warning that he would take serious action against those who did not cooperate with the SEC in the conduct of panchayat elections, Reddy said the employees were not worried about disciplinary action.“What can he do? He can, at the most, suspend a few senior officials. Can he suspend thousands of government employees with one stroke? Even if we are suspended, we would be back in our jobs the moment Kumar steps down from his post two months later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-boycotts-panchayat-election-process-after-poll-panel-s-notification-101611411026542.html

He said the party will take enough measures to attract the youth and fulfill their aspirations. “Our manifesto will reflect people’s aspirations and emotions. It will set the tone for the poll,” Chandy said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala will begin his state-wide yatra on January 31.This is the first time that the state unit is giving a key responsibility to the three-time MP. A hit among youngsters, the party is all set to use Tharoor’s social media outreach and inspiring lectures and writings to its advantage.The party’s central leadership has given strict instructions to the state unit to field more youngsters and women in the April-May assembly elections. The party pressed the emergency button after the ruling CPI (M) notched an emphatic win in the local body elections last month. In a recent poll survey also, the majority supported Pinarayi Vijayan as the first choice for next CM and it forced many Congress leaders to close their ranks and work for victory.Going by the poll history of the state which never gives the incumbent a chance to continue in power, the Congress was overconfident but local body results dented its expectations and the party high command stepped in.AICC observers-- Gehlot, former Goa CM Luizinho Faleior and former Karnataka deputy CM G Parameswara-- who arrived in the state on Friday held a series of talks with leaders and party legislators and MPs. They also met sulking leader K V Thomas, former Union minister, and got an assurance from him that he won’t leave the party. He will be given a new position, possibly the post of the working president, said a senior leader.Denied a Lok Sabha seat in the last election, Thomas was sulking for some time after the state leadership failed to accommodate him properly. He had approached the party seeking an assembly seat but he was told that there were specific instructions from the party high command to try more young leaders this time. After this, he started charting out his future plans and turned to the Left. Thomas later said party president Sonia Gandhi had called him and he assured her that he will work to strengthen the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-role-for-shashi-tharoor-as-kerala-congress-gets-into-poll-mode-101611408486273.html

Farmers have been allowed to enter Delhi and travel up to 100km distance on each route, farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The tractor march on Republic Day was planned for a long time but it hit a roadblock after the Centre approached the Supreme Court through Delhi Police against the march, claiming that it would dishonour country's pride if protesters attempt to disrupt Republic Day parade. The unions said that they would not disrupt the Republic Day parade.Police proposes route map for tractor rally, farmers to respond todayThe Supreme Court left the decision on whether to allow farmers' tractor march or not on the Delhi Police which held several rounds of discussion with union leaders on the issue of the tractor march.Farmers, as they have been preparing for long, plan to enter the Capital on that day displaying their tableaux of tractors belonging to different states. But Delhi Police initially did not agree to allow them to enter the Capital apprehending disruption in law and order situation. Instead, the farmers were asked to hold their tractor march on the Kundli border, which the union leaders didn't accept and remained stuck to their plan of holding the march on the Outer Ring Road.On Friday, the Delhi Police proposed a route map for the tractor march on which discussions were held on Saturday following which farmers have been allowed to take their march up to 100km inside Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-republic-day-tractor-march-in-delhi-allowed-unions-urge-for-peace-101611409236771.html

The chants were loud enough to prompt the commentators on the stage to urge people to be quiet. As the video shows, in the audience too those who raised the chants were asked to be quiet. As this derailed the programme for a second, the commentator on the stage again announced Mamata Banerjee's name."No, I feel government programmes must have some dignity. This is not a political programme. This is a government programme. This belongs to all political parties and people.

It (Ramani's claim of Akbar's sexual misconduct in a hotel) is complete hearsay, fabricated and false,” Luthra saidShe said that Nilofer, Ramani's friend and a key witness in the case, was not an eyewitness.The court will further hear the matter on January 27.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018. He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as "media's biggest predator" that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment he faced from the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metoo-ramani-s-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-false-akbar-reiterates-before-delhi-court-101611403887763.html

Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on, the ministry said.The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium) labs, the ministry added.The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by several countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.The B.1.1.7 variant genome, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last two months.From November 25 to the midnights of December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK, the government said. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect the presence of the new variant.The government took cognisance of the reports of the virus reported from the UK and said it has put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant.This strategy included temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK from December 23 to January 7 and mandatory RT-PCR test for all UK-returnees.The samples of all those found positive in the RT-PCR test will be genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-strain-of-covid-19-infects-150-people-in-india-govt-101611400846814.html

Banerjee also questioned why Centre called it 'Parakram Divas', why January 23 is not a national holiday, why there is no memorial for Netaji.

23-01-2021||India||42 pc girls allowed access to mobile phone for less than an hour a day: Survey||A new survey has found that about 42 per cent adolescent girls are allowed access to a mobile phone for less than an hour in a day with most parents feeling that they are "unsafe" and an "unhealthy distraction" for them.Centre for Catalyzing Change (C3), a New Delhi-based NGO, in association with Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) conducted the survey in 29 districts of 10 states with 4,100 respondents to understand digital access to young girls in India.The survey, released ahead of the National Girl Child Day, covered 4,100 respondents across four key stakeholder groups – adolescent girls, family members, teachers, and representatives of community organisations (like NGOs) in ten states -- Assam, Haryana, Karnataka, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.The survey found that there is a crisis of access to digital devices for adolescent girls in India."Access differs from state to state. Karnataka is where the maximum amount of adolescent girls enjoyed easy access to digital or mobile devices, with 65 per cent."Boys have easier access. In Haryana, the gender gap is the widest, while Telangana reported the lowest difference between the percentage of boys and girls having digital access (12 per cent)," it said.The survey said family attitudes and biases restrict the time given to girls to access a digital device – 42 per cent of girls are allowed access to a mobile phone for less than an hour in a day.And on top of this, the survey found that 65 per cent of teachers and 60 per cent of community organisations say being a girl is a factor in accessing digital technology. Most parents felt that a mobile phone is "unsafe" and an "unhealthy distraction" for an adolescent girl, the survey said."Even when families and adolescents can afford smartphones, computers or other digital devices, it is always the male family members' usage of such devices that is prioritized," the survey found.Noting that financial affordability is a major cause for lack of access, the survey said 71 per cent of the girls do not own a mobile phone because they cannot afford it."81 per cent of families say they cannot afford one, while 79 per cent do not have a computer at home," it said.Access to digital modes in community facilities like schools, community centres and internet cafes is limited -- 83 per cent of the girls get less than an hour's access in a week, the survey said.The survey found that girls also remain at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to digital literacy as only 32 per cent of adolescent girls know how to "receive calls" on a mobile.About 26 per cent know how to "use features like clock, calculator, torch and other offline apps", it said."A mere 15 per cent know how to use online apps and 16 per cent of parents said their daughters had no knowledge of computers," the survey said.Releasing the findings of the survey to mark National Girl Child Day, Dr Aparajita Gogoi, Executive Director, C3 said the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the inequalities girls in India face."The aim of our survey has been to suggest a framework to address the everyday challenges adolescent girls experience in owning, accessing, understanding and using digital technology," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/42-pc-girls-allowed-access-to-mobile-phone-for-less-than-an-hour-a-day-survey-101611396826507.html

It took many hours for forest officials to remove the calf to a nearby elephant rehabilitation centre after firing sedation shots. Many forest officials were in tears after watching the baby jumbo’s plight.“It seems to be a 40-year-old milking elephant and the baby is healthy. No external injuries were found on the body of the mother. We are not suspecting poisoning now because if it was so, the baby should also have tasted the same food,” said divisional forest office of Thiruvananthapuram, Pradeep Kumar. He said the carcass will be sent for an autopsy and the exact reason of the death can be ascertained after examining the internal organs.Rubber tappers of the estate first noticed the carcass of the wild elephant and trumpeting baby in the morning and alerted forest officials. They were not allowed to come near the carcass by the angry baby. And it took nearly five hours for officials to remove the baby elephant from the site.Officials said they waited for some time for the jumbo herd to come back to take care of the baby elephant but their efforts were in vain and they decided to shift the calf to Kotoor, the country’s first elephant rehabilitation centre in Thiruvananthapuram district, home to 15 elephants including seven abandoned and injured calves. Local people said jumbo incursion into human settlements was regular in the area.The latest incident surfaced when the state was yet to recover from the shocking tale of ‘leopard curry.’ Forest officials had arrested five villagers in Idukki district who killed a six-year-old leopard after laying a snare and trapping it and later feasted on its meat on Friday. During the raid, officials recovered cooked leopard meat curry, uncooked meat, teeth, nails and skin of the killed cat.Shocked forest officials said it was the first time they came across a ‘leopard curry’. Initially they thought that the cat might have been trapped in the snare accidentally put up to net wild boars. But later the accused told officials they did it deliberately to trap the big cat that strayed into their habitat and often killed their pets and cattle.“The animal had recently killed a goat of Vinod P K, one of the accused and he and his friends laid a snare using brake cable, net and other materials. The animal was netted on Wednesday and they killed it and later distributed its meat,” said Mankulam forest range officer V B Udayasooryan. He said the animal weighed around 50 kg. The incident came to light two days later after one of the informers alerted forest officials.Later, officials recovered 10 kg of uncooked meat and other remains of the animal from the houses of the accused. They said the accused were planning to sell the skin, teeth and nails of the big cat.“It is a shocking incident. Killing of wild animals occurs but this is the first time we are hearing that its meat was consumed. A special investigation team will be constituted soon,” said another senior forest official. During the investigation, officials found they killed many such wild animals including boars, deer and flying squirrels like this earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wild-elephant-found-dead-in-kerala-s-kallar-calf-s-plight-moves-forest-staff-101611400096116.html

We would appreciate your kind consideration of half of the supply and, if necessary, we would be willing to purchase the other 100,000 doses should it meet your favorable consideration," PM Mottley wrote in her letter adding that the situation in her country has been exceptionally challenging as it has been affected by two waves of the virus.Watch: India sends vaccines to Nepal & BangladeshPM Mottley also underlined how India and Barbados have enjoyed a long history of good relations. She also said that Barbados’ economy is highly dependent on travel and tourism and the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a fall of 90 per cent in tourists' arrival in 2020. This caused a significant fall in government revenue and economic activity, she wrote.According to the letter, all medical and national security installations of Barbados have been heavily strained by the pandemic. “Persons who are on the front-line of our response to COVID-19 across the medical, protective services and border agencies will need to get immediate access to vaccines. Similarly, we need it for other critical people on the frontline,” she wrote.Under the Vaccine Maitri commitment, India has already been shipping consignments of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured in India - Covishield, and Covaxin by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech - to its neighbours. Countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and friendly nations such as Maldives, Seychelles, Brazil and Morocco have already received the first shipments.Also read: Will India send vaccines to Pak if there is a request?Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica, Barbados’s neighbour in the Caribbean, also had written a letter to PM Modi seeking for Covishield vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barbados-pm-writes-to-pm-modi-seeking-2-lakh-doses-of-covishield-101611399366063.html
23-01-2021||India||Mask mandate, immunity, climate helped India lower Covid-19 cases: Report||From a Covid-19 hotspot nation with over 90,000 cases in a day four months ago to recording its lowest daily infection tally, India is seeing a steady decline in cases, showing a grasp over handling of the coronavirus disease outbreak.The decline in rising cases can be attributed to India's stringent mask mandate enforced by the government, the country's demography, robust inherent immunity among people who have battled diseases like Malaria, Typhoid and Dengue, and a comparatively warmer climate, according to experts as quoted by the npr.org.Also read: Where India stands in global Covid-19 spreadThe report quoted health policy expert Genevie Fernandes who said mask mandates are one of the things that may have helped bring down India's Covid-19 caseload. The worst-affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Delhi among several displayed stringency in asking people to wear masks whenever they step outside. Non-compliance with the instruction carried a hefty fine."...In this particular case, the police, the monitoring, enforcement, that was ramped up. Every time they fine a person 200 rupees, they also give them a mask to wear," Fernandes told NPR.The number of new cases India reported in August and September was more than any other country (the US, with half the number of new cases, was in the second position). In terms of deaths as well, India was the country with the highest number of reported Covid-19-related deaths in September.Another factor that may be helping India is the widespread heat and humidity. "There is some evidence they may reduce the virus' spread," Dr Daksha Shah, a government epidemiologist, told NPR."The temperature, of course, is in the favor. We do not have too much cold climate over here. So many of the viruses, they are known to multiply more in the colder regions," Shah said.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageRobust immunity has also been backed as a reason that may have helped India fight the global disease outbreak better.India's population exhibits inherent immunity to so many infections, the government epidemiologist said.She adds: "Malaria, typhoid, dengue fever are all endemic in India. People with robust immune systems are more likely to survive here in the first place, Shah says. Plus, more than half of the population is under age 25. They're less likely to die of Covid-19 and more likely to get it asymptomatically. But India's climate and demographics have not changed during the pandemic, and the drop in cases here has been recent."Without ruling out virus' mutant behaviour, health economist Jishnu Das told NPR that akin to the deadly virus which was first found in the UK, a less infectious variant may have mutated in India.All this remains under consideration as even scientists don't know the clear picture."Three options. One is it's gone because of the way people behaved. So we need to continue that behavior, right? It's gone because it's gone and it's never going to come back - great. Or it's gone - we don't know why it's gone and it may come back," NPR quoted Das as saying.An average of nearly 22,000 new cases was recorded in India every day in the week ending December 27, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. This is less than a quarter of the nearly 92,000 daily new cases reported on average in mid-September. This drop in new cases is not a reflection of a global trend.This is in sharp contrast to countries like the US and Russia where the cases continue to grow.India imposed a stringent lockdown to curb the spread of the viral contagion in late March while its daily new cases peaked in the middle of September.India’s share of new confirmed infections in the world kept increasing every month in this period. Less than 1% of the new cases in March were reported from India while its share in new cases in September was an overwhelming 31%, which means nearly every third positive case in the world was reported in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-mandate-immunity-climate-helped-india-lower-covid-19-cases-report-101611394444383.html

So why can’t the city be declared as the second capital of India once again? Kolkata has to be made the second capital of India,” Banerjee said while addressing a public rally in Kolkata to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.The Bengal CM made the remark a few hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to arrive in Kolkata for six-hours to celebrate Netaji’s birth anniversary.“Why should there be only one capital. India should have four capitals in four corners of the country. Parliament sessions should be held in all the four capitals,” she said while directing TMC MPs to raise the demand in Parliament.The chief minister said that one capital should be set up in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka or Kerala. Another capital should be made in states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab or Rajasthan. Another capital should be there to cater to states like Bihar, Odisha or Kolkata in Bengal. The fourth one could be set up in the north east.“One leader, one nation, one ration card, one political party – this point of view needs to change,” she added.Earlier in the day the West Bengal chief minister attacked the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre over dismantling the Planning Commission.“National Planning Commission was Netaji's brain-child. But that has been dissolved. I would like to put this question today. If we love Netaji, why was the commission dissolved?” Banerjee said.“Why should parliament session be held in Delhi alone? What is there is Delhi? In Delhi most people are outsiders,” she said while quickly adding that people in Delhi are nice and they welcome everyone.

We have to come out of the colonial mindset," he asserted.Observing that different leaders approached the freedom movement in different ways, the vice president said the ultimate goal was to achieve the country's freedom from colonial rule.Noting that Netaji wanted abolition of the caste system in the country, Naidu said as far back as in the 1940s, soldiers of all castes, creeds and religions lived together, ate together in common kitchens and fought as Indians first and last.Bose always used to stress that the progress of India would be possible only with the uplift of the downtrodden and marginalised sections of the society, he said.The vice president recalled that Bose believed in giving an equal pedestal to women in every sphere of life -- be it social, economic, or political."The progressiveness of Netaji's ideas can be gauged from his decision to form a women's corps in the INA named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment," he said and appreciated the government's decision to provide permanent commission to women in the armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youngsters-should-take-inspiration-from-netaji-s-life-venkaiah-naidu-101611394290348.html

23-01-2021||India||On Parakram Diwas, a look at Bose’s Indian National Army||The Indian National Army (INA), also known as the Azad Hind Fauj, was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists, through the patronage of the Imperial Japanese Army, to secure India's independence. First formed in 1942 by Mohan Singh with Indian prisoners of war of the British Indian army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and in Singapore, INA was revived by Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943.Here’s everything you need to know about the Indian National Army:1. After the outbreak of World War II, Japan invaded Southeast Asia and conducted a lightning campaign which culminated in the fall of the Malayan peninsula and Singapore in 1942. From the prisoners of war who were captured, the Japanese created an auxiliary army to fight against the British which led to the formation of the first INA under Mohan Singh. Singh was a former officer of the British Indian army. But disagreements between Mohan Singh and Japanese army command regarding the autonomy of the Indian National Army led to the disbandment of the first INA in December 1942.2. After this Mohan Singh recommended Subhas Chandra Bose as the leader of the second INA. The Japanese were ready to support him and invited him to Singapore in July 1943 to take command of the second Indian National Army.3. Under Bose's leadership, there was a swell of volunteers in the INA. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose named the brigades/regiments of INA after Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Azad, and himself. There was also an all-women regiment named after Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmibai.4. The INA participated in operation U-Go, the 1944 Japanese campaign towards British India. Following Japan’s defeat in World War 2, most of the members of the INA were captured by the British. Subash Chandra Bose himself eluded capture and was reported to have died in a plane crash near Taiwan in September 1945.5. The surviving members of the INA were to be tried by the British colonial government for treason. As the trials were to take place at the Red Fort, they led to a new wave of nationalism in the country as the Indian population saw the members as patriots fighting for independence.6. The trial also led to a mutiny within the British Indian army, with most notable being that of the Royal Indian Navy. This made the British realise that they were effectively losing the support of the army and their exit from India therefore became inevitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-parakram-diwas-a-look-at-bose-s-indian-national-army-101611393163491.html

This tunnel is also the 10th to be found in the Jammu region.“The BSF has detected a 150 meters to 175 meters-long trans-border tunnel along the Indo-Pak international border in Kathua district. It is 30 feet deep and has a diameter of two to three feet,” said BSF inspector general NS Jamwal.“The tunnel appears to be six to eight years old and it has been found at the same place where BSF had shot down a Pakistani drone last year on June 20,” Jamwal added.The BSF IG said that the tunnel has been detected near the Pansar post of the BSF.“Across the international border, it originated from Shakargarh. Just opposite to the tunnel, Pakistan has its Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre De Kothe posts,” said the IG.Jamwal said that such tunnels cannot be built without the involvement of the Pakistani establishment.“A proper engineering effort has gone into this tunnel as well, he said, and added that possibilities of it having been used by Pakistani terrorists cannot be ruled out.The tunnel was detected between border pillar number 14 and 15, said the IG.The BSF troops had also foiled an infiltration bid in the same area in November 2019. On June 20 last year, BSF had shot down a Pakistani drone in Rathua area around 5.10 am. The drone fell into a field. The BSF had recovered a M-4 US-made semi-automatic rifle, 60 rounds in two magazines and seven M67 grenades among other items.The hexa copter drone itself weighed around 17.5 kilograms and the consignment weighed around five to six kilograms.There has been a spike in the incidents of Pakistani drones dropping arms, ammunition, drugs along the international border and line of control in Jammu and Kashmir.Pakistan has been digging trans-border tunnels along the international border, especially in Kathua and Samba sectors.On January 13, BSF detected another trans-border tunnel along the 198km long Indo-Pak international border in Bobbyian village of Hiranagar sector in Kathua district.Also Read: India calls out Pakistan on religious freedomThe tunnel was 150 meters to 160 meters long with a diameter of two feet to three feet. It was dug 25 feet to 30 feet beneath the ground.On November 22, BSF had detected a similar trans-border tunnel near Regal post in Samba sector that was used for crossing over by four Jaish terrorists, who were eliminated at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota of Jammu district on November 19.The four terrorists had used the tunnel to cross over from Pakistan and had travelled in a Kashmir bound truck before being eliminated in swift operation at Ban toll plaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-pakistan-terror-tunnel-found-in-jammu-4th-in-last-6-months-101611392811480.html

But that has been disbanded. I would like to put this question today. If we love Netaji, why was the commission dissolved?” Banerjee asked.The Narendra Modi government disbanded the Planning commission in 2014 and formed Niti Aayog. The Planning Commission, set up in 1950, was a government institution which formulated India’s Five-Year Plans besides performing other functions.The Centre has announced that it would celebrate Bose's birth anniversary as Parakram Diwas (day of valour). The Mamata Banerjee-administration in West Bengal has declared that the state would celebrate the day as Deshnayak Divas. The chief minister launched the celebration in the state by blowing a conch shell“I don’t know whether Parakram is a Bengali word, English word or a Sanskrit word. All I understand is that he [Bose] was a Desh Nayak. We would be celebrating this day as Desh Nayak Day because Rabindranath Tagore first described Netaji as Desh Nayak.”She was addressing a gathering organised at Netaji Bhawan, the ancestral house of Bose in south Kolkata.Benerjee changed her plans at the last minute and headed to Netaji Bhawan where Modi is also expected to visit later in the day during his six-hour stay to Kolkata. She later visited Shyambazar in North Kolkata to pay tribute to Netaji to start the day’s celebrations. A huge statue of Netaji, riding a horse, is located at the five-point crossing at Shaymbazar crossing.“A grand padyatra will be held today. This year's Republic Day parade in Kolkata will also be dedicated to Netaji. A siren will be sounded today at 12.15 pm. We urge everyone to blow shankhs at home. The Centre must also declare January 23 as a National Holiday. A monument, named after Azad Hind Fauj, will be built at Rajarhat. A university named after Netaji is also being set up which shall be funded entirely by the state, and will have tie-ups with foreign universities. #DeshNayakDibas,” Banerjee tweeted earlier in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-attack-centre-over-disbanding-netaji-s-brainchild-101611391679822.html

"But the said appointment was thereafter not notified and the post of chairman is lying vacant since then."The plea, filed on January 20, also referred to a response received under the Right to Information Act and said there has been acute shortage of secretarial and other staffers in the tribunal, adversely impacting the functioning of the tribunal.It said the court in numerous cases has held that "justice delayed is justice denied" but the ATPMLA, New Delhi, is "struggling to dispense justice particularly in absence of its Chairman and three members out of sanctioned strength of four and acute shortage of administrative staff”.The plea added that the ATPMLA deals with "sensitive and crucial matters" pertaining to Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA), the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Prohibition Of Benami Property Transactions Act (PBPT).The plea, filed through lawyer Preeti Singh, said the Finance Ministry has failed to take appropriate steps in filling up vacancies in the tribunal on a priority basis and in an expeditious manner."The tribunal is mandated to consist of a Chairman, who has to be a retired Judge of this Court or High Court and Four Members, who can be from the fields of Law, Finance and Management. But the Tribunal is constrained to function with its sole member and therefore sufficient number of matters cannot be taken up in absence of Presiding Officers," it said.The very object for constituting tribunals is to supplement the functions of the High Courts and the other courts and to ensure that consumer of justice gets speedy redressal to his grievances, it said.The plea said the CPIO of the tribunal informed that "there are 2822 cases of PMLA, 66 cases of SAFEMA, 270 cases of NDPS, 1077 cases of FEMA and 1134 cases of PBPT are pending before the Tribunal and there were 23 vacancies in the tribunal".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-seeking-direction-to-govt-to-fill-vacant-atpmla-posts-filed-in-sc-101611389051969.html

23-01-2021||India||Petrol, diesel prices touch all-time highs||Petrol and diesel prices in the country on Saturday touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.This took the petrol price in Delhi to ₹85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to ₹92.28.Diesel rate climbed to ₹75.88 a litre in the national capital and to ₹82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed.This is the second consecutive day of rate increase and the fourth this week. In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week.Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Since then, rates have gone up by ₹1.99 a litre on petrol and ₹2.01 in case of diesel.This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India.Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018.At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence.Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-prices-touch-all-time-highs-101611387326175.html

This is the second tunnel to be spotted in 10 days by the border guarding force that last year went on campaign mode to detect and destroy a web of tunnels believed to have been built by Pakistan’s deep state, a senior BSF official said on Saturday.The 30-feet deep tunnel has been detected between Border Post number 14 and 15 near BSF’s outpost at Pansar, Kathua district. On the other side of the fence are Pakistani border outposts of Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-de-Kothe in Shakargarh district.Pakistan’s Shakargarh, the area across the fence, is home to a terror training facility overseen by one of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s operational commander Kasim Jan who, Indian intelligence believes, was involved in the November 19 Nagrota encounter in Jammu and is the principal accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack. Jan is also one of the main launch commanders of Jaish terrorists into India.“This is huge,” a senior BSF official said. Because the tunnel appears to be at least 6 to 8 years old and would have been used for infiltration for a long time. Also, it is located in a place that has seen action in the past, right from 2012 when Pakistan had mounted a heavy fire assault on the forward duty point and constructed a new bunker on the zero line in the vicinity.Not far from where the tunnel was found, a BSF assistant commandant Vinay Prasad who was leading a border domination patrol was killed by sniper fire from across the border in January 2019. Ten months later, a group of terrorists was noticed in the same area in November 2019.Also Read: Tunnels, drones part of Pakistan’s strategy to keep Jammu sector activeIt is very important to detect all the tunnels built by the Pakistani military and its terrorists because the infiltration of terrorists through them practically nullifies the utility of deployment of soldiers along the Line of Control. When it becomes too difficult to cross the LoC, Pakistani terrorists use these tunnels, a senior counterterror official said in Delhi.Watch: BSF officer enters tunnel used by Jaish terrorists in Nov, nails Pakistan roleBorder Security Force director general Rakesh Asthana had ordered the force to step up efforts to detect tunnels after the Nagrota encounter in November when security forces were able to trace the route taken by the terrorists who had crossed over using one of the many tunnels that the Pakistani military have built for the terrorists to sneak into India.Security officials underscore that proper engineering effort had gone into the construction of the tunnels that had been detected in recent times, pointing to the involvement of the Pakistani military along the heavily-guarded border.BSF seizes weaponsMeanwhile, the BSF carried out an intelligence-backed raid in Poonch district that led to the seizure of one AK-47 rifle, three China-made pistols, an under-barrel grenade launder and a radio set.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paks-secret-tunnel-to-push-terrorists-for-8-years-in-jammu-detected-by-bsf-101611386495290.html

23-01-2021||India||PM Modi gives 106,000 land certificates in 1st visit ahead of Assam polls||In his first visit to Assam, where assembly election is scheduled in April-May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless indigenous families on Saturday. He personally handed over certificates to 10 recipients.“When our party came to power in Assam there were nearly 600,000 families who were landless and had no land documents. Earlier governments didn’t care for these families. But our government started working on it earnestly to give them land certificates,” he said.The PM said allotment of these certificates would ensure benefit of several central and state government schemes to these families and they would even be able to take bank loans based on land ownership.As part of the initiative, landless families in rural areas will get seven ‘bighas’ of agricultural land and another one ‘bigha’ to construct houses. One ‘bigha’ is equal to 14,400 sq. ft. In urban areas, allotment would be 1.10 ‘katha’ and in Guwahati, it would be 1.50 ‘katha’. One ‘katha’ in Assam is equal to 2,880 sq. ft.Modi addressed a large gathering estimated to be over 200,000 at Jerenga Pathar, a historic site where Joymoti, an Ahom princess, sacrificed her life in 17th century to protect the life of her husband Prince Godapani, who went on to become a king of the Ahom dynasty.“Jerenga Pathar is the ‘balidan-bhoomi’ (sacrifice land) of Joymati. I salute her indomitable courage and this land. Considering the importance of this place, we are taking steps to include it in a list of five iconic archaeological sites in the country,” said the PM.Jerenga Pathar is located in Sivasagar district in upper Assam, which was earlier called Rangpur and was one of the capitals of the Ahom dynasty for nearly six centuries.Giving land rights to indigenous landless families was an important promise made in 2016 by the BJP, which came to power in Assam with the slogan of protecting ‘jaati’, ‘maati’ and ‘bheti’ (community, land and hearth).According to government data, the state had around 575,000 landless families in 2016. Since coming to power five years ago, the government has given land allotment certificates to nearly 228,000 such families. Saturday’s event was a continuation of that initiative.Also Read: PM Narendra Modi to visit Kolkata to celebrate Netaji’s 125th birth anniversaryIn his speech, Modi listed the central and state schemes that have benefited people in the state in the past few years. He also highlighted the schemes for the tea-tribe community, which is influential in many assembly constituencies in upper Assam.“The steps taken by our government in the past four and half years have ensured protection of rights of the state’s indigenous people and ensured peace and development,” said chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in his address.Modi’s visit was preceded by torch rallies across the state on Friday evening against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), carried out by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and several indigenous organizations.AASU, which spearheaded the anti-CAA protests in the state in December 2019, launched a three-day protest against the legislation beginning Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-gives-106-000-land-certificates-in-1st-visit-ahead-of-assam-polls-101611386524596.html

We are questioning him, but nothing has so far been found that points to any kind of conspiracy, as is being alleged," the official said, adding that further investigations are underway.At the Singhu border press conference late on Friday night, the farmer leaders presented the man who claimed that his accomplices were asked to pose as policemen and baton-charge the crowd during the proposed tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.The farmer leaders claimed that they caught the man from the protest site at the Singhu border. He was subsequently handed over to the Haryana police.Farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu alleged that attempts are being made to disrupt the ongoing agitation against three farm laws.The man, who had his face covered with a scarf, claimed at the press conference that a plan was hatched to shoot four farmer leaders, who are known faces in the media, at the stage on Saturday."On January 26, there was a plan to create disturbance during the tractor parade by opening fire on Delhi Police personnel, which would prompt them to retaliate against the protesting farmers in a strong manner," he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-handed-over-to-haryana-police-by-farmer-leaders-being-quizzed-101611384607780.html

23-01-2021||India||Don’t destroy your kids’ childhood in your ego clashes: SC to warring couples||The Supreme Court has cautioned warring couples against destroying the childhood of their kids and the bond between siblings while they exasperate each other through endless litigation. “In this endeavour to destroy each other, such couples destroy the childhood of their kids. Torn between their parents, children are left confused, and they lose the bond they should have with their siblings. We always say that these are not the cases for a court to adjudicate. When a couple has a fallout and they come to a court, everything is hit below the belt,” said a bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul. The bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, regretted that the top court has to deal with several such cases where “children have to suffer because of the ego of their parents.” The comments came while the bench spoke to a woman in tears and her estranged husband during a hearing through videoconferencing on Monday. The court lamented that the couple, which had a love marriage around two decades ago, is “now hell-bent on destroying each other even at the cost of their children’s well-being and their future.” During the proceeding, Justice Kaul also counselled the couple: “You were once in love. You had three children together. And look at yourself now. In your attempt to exasperate each other, you care about nothing else, not your children and not even your own happiness.” The judge said that despite having a good education and financial background, both of them are focussed only on pulling each other down instead of making out something better of their lives. “Just think about your children and if not them, for yourself. Why can’t you two think of a time in future when you can meet sometime, have a cup of coffee with each other. Why can’t you two move on? If not for anyone else, for your own self...” Kaul told the couple. The couple was before the court on the contention where their children should study. The three children have the dual citizenship of the USA and Thailand, but the parents would not agree with each other on their school or college. In a previous order, the bench had sent one of the three sons for higher studies to the USA even though the mother opposed it. The question of where the youngest son will go for his schooling had remained pending, as the mother favoured he should go to Thailand whereas the father wanted him to stay in Mumbai. The bench ordered that the youngest child will go to a school in Thailand and thereafter to the USA for higher studies just like his elder siblings. “It is better for your children to stay away from both of you until you give up this animosity. Also, you both agreed that your children will take the citizenship of Thailand and the USA. But now you want a court in this country to spend its judicial time on all this. We take strong exception to this.” The bench concluded in its order: “Insofar as the parties are concerned, they seem to be on an endless journey of battling each other and we wish them good luck in their endeavour!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-destroy-your-kids-childhood-in-your-ego-clashes-sc-to-warring-couples-101611383569725.html

The corps commander-level talks will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the officials said.Senior commanders had last met on November 6. The situation in the Ladakh sector remains tense and the ongoing military dialogue has not led to any breakthrough.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China are prolonged.During the eighth round of talks on November 6, the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Experts said talks are deadlocked because of serious differences between the two sides on the conditions of disengagement.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months.The PLA recently moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged, as previously reported by the Hindustan Times.Earlier, Naravane said India should not read too much into the withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no cut in troop strength by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector, where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.He said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-ninth-round-of-corps-commander-level-talks-tomorrow-101611383025729.html

Our tableau will showcase the ancient heritage of the town, revered by countless people across the country," an official of the Uttar Pradesh government, accompanying the state team, said.A group of artistes, including two women dancers will be part of the tableau and one person will be dressed up as Lord Ram.A media preview of the various tableaux, including a total of 17 states and union territories, was held at the Republic Day's cultural camp at Delhi Cantonment on Friday.Ajay Kumar, who wore a yellow silk dhoti and rudraksh garland around his neck and held a bow in his hand, said, "I am very excited and happy that Ayodhya and its heritage will be showcased in our tableau and I have been chosen to play our beloved Lord Ram"."We have been waiting to see Ayodhya's heritage being showcased on Rajpath," said Kumar, a resident of Laxmangarh in Chandauli district, as he posed for photographers.Ayodhya's Deepotsav celebrations with earthen lamps is depicted on one side of the tableau, while other murals show embracing of Nishadraj by Lord Ram and eating of Shabri's berry by him, salvation of Ahilya, bringing of Sanjeevani by Lord Hanuman, Jatayu-Ram samvad, Ashok Vatika and other scenes.On November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court had settled the fractious Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue going back more than a century and backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.Prime Minister Narendra Modi last August had performed the 'bhoomi pujan' of a Supreme Court-mandated Ram temple in Ayodhya, bringing to fruition the BJP's mandir movement that defined its politics for three decades and took it to the heights of power.The Ram temple is scheduled for completion in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/replica-of-ram-temple-ayodhya-s-heritage-to-be-showcased-in-up-s-r-day-tableau-101611379967677.html

23-01-2021||India||Survey estimates 73 snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh||A survey to assess the population of snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh has found that there are an estimated 73 big cats in the Himalayan state, Forest minister Rakesh Pathania said.Snow leopards live in several Himalayan states of India but a scientific estimate of their population has never been made before anywhere in the country because the animal lives in remote, high-altitude regions and is elusive by nature.In Himachal Pradesh, the survey to assess the population of snow leopards was held by the state wildlife wing in collaboration with the Nature Conservation Foundation Mysore following the Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India protocols set by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.A similar assessment is underway in several other states and UTs, including Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, with Himachal Pradesh now becoming the first state to complete it.Pathania said that the first of its kind assessment revealed that snow leopard density in the state ranges from 0.08 to 0.37 individuals per 100 square kilometres, with the trans-Himalayan regions of Spiti, Pin valley and upper Kinnaur recording the highest densities of both the predator and its prey (mainly ibex and blue sheep).The minister said the study covered the entire potential snow leopard habitat of Himachal Pradesh -- an area of 26,112 square kilometers -- utilising a stratified sampling design.Camera trapping surveys were conducted at 10 sites to representatively sample all the strata i.e. high, low and unknown, Pathania said.The camera trap deployment over the mountainous terrains was led by a team of eight young persons from Kibber village, he added.More than 70 frontline staff of the forest department was trained in this technique as part of the project, Pathania further said.Snow leopards were detected at all the 10 sites -- Bhaga, Chandra, Bharmour, Kullu, Miyar, Pin, Baspa, Tabo, Hangrang and Spiti -- suggesting that the animal was found in the entire snow leopard habitat in Himachal Pradesh either as resident individuals of a population or as dispersing individuals navigating through these connecting habitats, he said.The minister said it is the first scientifically robust estimate of snow leopard and its prey for the state.“Another revelation from the study is that a bulk of snow leopard occurrence is outside the protected areas, reiterating the fact that local communities are the strongest allies for conservation in snow leopard landscapes,” he said.“The assessment will serve as a robust baseline for the wildlife wing for long-term monitoring of the snow leopard landscape,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-estimates-73-snow-leopards-in-himachal-pradesh-101611373154718.html
23-01-2021||India||Parakram Diwas: Remembering Subhas Chandra Bose on his birth anniversary||Popularly known as 'Netaji', Subhas Chandra Bose is one of the many freedom fighters who laid their lives for the nation. This year, the central government has decided to observe Bose's birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in the first Parakram Diwas event in Kolkata and inaugurate an exhibition on the grounds of the National Library to mark the occasion.Here’s everything you need to know about Netaji and Parakram Diwas:1. 'Netaji' was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack in Odisha. He graduated from Kolkata and proved his mettle by becoming an Indian Civil Services (ICS) officer. But he left the comfort and amenities that came with his job and decided to be part of the freedom struggle. With the slogan “Give me blood and I will give you freedom”, he awakened the country towards fighting against the British.Read more: 'Great freedom fighter, true son of Mother India: PM Modi pays tribute to Subhas Chandra Bose2. Netaji built a force known as the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) giving the slogan of “Dilli Chalo”. Thousands of soldiers of his 60,000-strong army sacrificed their lives for the country.3. At the time of India’s Independence, Clement Attlee the British Prime Minister said that the loyalty of the Indian army and navy to the British state was declining due to the increasing military activities of Bose’s Azad Hind Fauj and this was one of the major reasons that nudged Britishers into leaving India.4. The Centre has also planned to celebrate Bose’s 125th birth anniversary in 2022. A panel headed by Union home minister Amit Shah has been made for the same. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, her predecessor, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the BJP’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh, among others, are part of the panel.5. The announcement by the Centre over Parakram Diwas was mired in controversies. West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Forward Bloc, which was formed by Bose in 1939, have alleged that they were not consulted in the decision-making process for Parakram Diwas. The TMC also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of performing a “stunt” ahead of the assembly elections in Bengal, where Bose is an icon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parakram-diwas-remembering-subhas-chandra-bose-on-his-birth-anniversary-101611372389660.html

The Home Office has previously said that the delay in signing off was due to a technicality.There has been speculation that Mallya has sought asylum in the UK, which can be requested on a number of grounds, from a human rights perspective to political asylum.At the High Court on Friday, Mallya's lawyer Philip Marshall said: "The extradition was upheld but he (Vijay Mallya) is still here because as you know there is another route for him to apply to the Secretary of State for the status," said Vijay Mallya's barrister Philip Marshall.The submission was made during Mallya's case at the Companies and Solvency Division of the High Court where he is appealing for substantial funds to be released to him to cover his living expenses as well as the vast legal fees that he has accrued and continues to do so.Mallya has specifically asked for funds from the sale of a luxury property he owned, located on an island off the French Riviera and amounting to nearly £3 million to be released to him.The money is held in the UK's Court Funds Office (CFO) as part of bankruptcy proceedings brought by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) in lieu of loans that went unpaid by Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-appeals-to-uk-home-secy-for-another-route-to-stay-in-the-uk-101611370276364.html

23-01-2021||India||Five held in Kerala for killing leopard and eating its meat||Five villagers from Kerala’s Idukki, who ensnared a six-year-old leopard and feasted on its meat after killing it, were arrested by forest officials on Friday after a tip-off. During the raid, officials recovered cooked leopard meat, uncooked meat, teeth, nails and skin of the killed cat.Shocked forest officials said it was the first time they came across such an incident. Initially, they thought that the cat might have been trapped accidentally in the snare, put up to net wild boars. But later, the accused told officials they did it deliberately to trap the big cat that strayed into their habitat and often killed their pets and cattle.“The animal had recently killed a goat owned by Vinod P K, one of the accused and he and his friends laid a snare using auto brake cable, net and other materials. The animal was netted on Wednesday before it was killed by its captors and its meat distributed,” said Mankulam forest range officer V B Udayasooryan. He said the animal weighed around 50 kg. The incident came to light two days later after one of the informers alerted forest officials.Officials recovered 10 kg of uncooked meat and other remains of the animal from the houses of the accused. They said the accused were planning to sell the skin, teeth and nail of the big cat. “It is a shocking incident. Killing of wild animals do occur but this is the first time we are hearing that its meat was consumed. A special investigation team will be constituted soon,” said another senior forest officer.Leopard was listed in the schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and the accused will get a maximum punishment of seven-year jail and a heavy fine, said the forest official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-held-in-kerala-for-killing-leopard-and-eating-its-meat-101611368530401.html

23-01-2021||India||Local Body elections: Andhra govt, state poll panel at loggerheads||The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government of Andhra Pradesh and state election commissioner (SEC) Ramesh Kumar on Friday headed for a showdown over the conduct of elections to village councils in the state in February.As Kumar prepared to issue a notification on Saturday for the first phase of the gram panchayat elections, the state government sent a note to the SEC asking for a deferment of the election process pending a Supreme Court directive on the matter.Meanwhile, state government employees, including those from revenue, panchayat raj and the police departments, announced that they would boycott the election process, stating that they cannot risk their lives amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In the morning, the Supreme Court rejected a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government challenging the Thursday’s state high court order giving a green signal to the SEC to go ahead with the local body elections.The apex court said there were flaws in the SLP and asked the government to file a fresh petition by Monday. The elections to as many as 13,371 gram panchayats will be held in four phases – February 5, 9, 13 and 17.Kumar rejected the state government’s appeal and announced that he would go ahead with initiating the election process.He also issued orders suspending two district collectors, a superintendent of police, two DSPs and five circle inspectors. The SEC charged them with failure to prevent irregularities and curb poll violence during the initial phase of elections to block parishad and zilla parishad elections in March 2020, before they were postponed due to the imposition of a lockdown in the country on account of Covid-19.In the afternoon, representatives of several employees’ unions met chief secretary Adityanath Das and submitted a nine-page memorandum, stating that they would not be able to participate in the gram panchayat elections until the Covid-19 vaccination programme was completed.The employees’ joint action committee leader Boppa Raju found fault with the SEC for deciding to hold elections during the vaccination period. “How can vaccination and elections be held simultaneously? We can’t take part in the election process, unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccine,” he said.With the employees refusing to cooperate, Kumar met governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and explained the situation. He asked the Governor to issue directions to the state government to cooperate with the SEC in smooth conduct of the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-body-elections-andhra-govt-state-poll-panel-at-loggerheads-101611366805139.html

The workers were digging a hole but suddenly their mechanical structure got snapped and broke the digging tool carrier due to which they fell into the pit and died,” he said.Five of the six deceased have been identified, the official said, adding that most of them are from neighbouring Assam.The bodies have been taken to the hospital for post-mortem examination, he said.Kharmalki said it was yet to ascertained if the deceased were engaged in coal or stone mining as “no coal was found in the hole they were digging”.Police have lodged a case against the employer and investigation is under way.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned coal mining in the state in 2014 over environmental concerns.At least 15 labourers were trapped after water from Lytein river inundated an illegal mine in Lumthari village, also in the same district, in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-killed-in-illegal-meghalaya-coal-mine-case-filed-against-employer-101611366312488.html
23-01-2021||India||New Congress president’s term could end in 2022||The electoral college for the election of both the Congress president and the Congress Working Committee, in this case, is the All India Congress Committee, said party functionaries. They pointed out that the election to the post of the president will be a by-election because the president will just be seen to be completing the term of the Congress president who took over in 2017 for a five-year term. This was Rahul Gandhi; he resigned in 2019, and Sonia Gandhi has been interim president since. This means there is no need as per the party constitution to convene the AICC plenary, which is made up of Pradesh Congress Committee delegates.The electorate for Congress president in the by-election are AICC delegates, pointed out two leaders who asked not to be named. “So in June, when the elections are now scheduled, the president will be elected by AICC meeting with the participation of 1500-2000 members.”“For the Congress Working Committee election, the AICC, in either case, forms the electoral college. So it remains to be seen whether the AICC, which elects the new president for a truncated term that will last till December 22 (counting five years from when Rahul Gandhi took over) decides on electing CWC or authorising the president to constitute the body. “When Rahul Gandhi was elected the president, Ghulam Nabi Azad moved a resolution to nominate the 24-member CWC (besides the president),” said a third leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-congress-president-s-term-could-end-in-2022-101611366106192.html
23-01-2021||India||PLA soldier handed over to China recently hadn’t strayed into India, says intel||Communication intercepts by Indian intelligence agencies from across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh reveal heightened activity of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) own intelligence all along the undefined border with India in an attempt to get information on Indian Army movements and the on-going border infrastructure upgrade being carried out by India.While the South Block is tight-lipped about the issue, intelligence agencies have been able to spot movement of entities in the Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) sector near Karakoram, the contested points on banks of Pangong Tso and across the LAC in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The movement of these entities identified on the basis of communication intercepts has been conveyed to Indian Army brass and the national security establishment at the apex level.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in an impasse all along the LAC in East Ladakh for the past eight months. The two sides have held eight rounds of talks, but not been able to arrive at a workable mechanism for de-escalation and disengagement.The arrest of an unidentified Chinese solider in the early hours of January 8 in the area south of Pangong Tso in East Ladakh came after he was tracked through technical means; intelligence officials say this was not a benign incident of a PLA trooper simply straying across the undefined border.China military online, an official website of PLA claimed: “Due to darkness and complicated geography, a solider of the Chinese PLA defence force went astray on the China-India border early Friday (January 8) morning.” The trooper was handed over by Indian Army to the Chinese side on January 11 at the Chushul Moldo point.Similarly, PLA Corporal Wang Ya Long was picked up by the Indian Army in the Demchok sector of East Ladakh on October 19 and handed back to PLA on October 21. The apprehended corporal claimed that he was trying to help local herders locate a lost yak.While PLA has tried to dismiss these incidents and claims to be committed to disengagement and de-escalation from contested points in East Ladakh, Indian intelligence agencies are worried about movement of Chinese individuals (entities or resources in intelligence lingo) in sensitive East Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal sector, with communication intercepts showing that they cross over to Indian territory and remain there for days.For example, in East Ladakh, entities have been located across DBO sector, Pangong Tso, Khurnak Fort in occupied Aksai Chin as well as in Chumbi Valley and just across the Arunachal LAC. Communication intercepts show strong Chinese activity across LAC with the construction of new roads, temporary shelters and sometime permanent settlements.Since PLA has only exchanged maps of its positions in the Central sector, the entities are using the non-demarcated border to their advantage. Given the experience with Pakistani intruders in Kargil in 1999, Indian intelligence officials said they are taking no chances.In response to the furious military infrastructure activity by PLA across LAC, the Indian Army has put the reserve troop division also called strike division attached to Eastern Command on stand-by in north Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-intel-spots-chinese-spies-along-lac-cautions-army-to-stay-alert-101611361159099.html
23-01-2021||India||Congress wants JPC to probe Arnab Goswami's WhatsApp chat transcripts||The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest executive body, on Friday stepped up its attack on the chat transcripts between journalist Arnab Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into what it called a breach of national security.The transcripts between the editor-in-chief of Republic TV and the ex-CEO of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) were a part of a Mumbai Police probe into an alleged television ratings scam. The portions of the chat referred by the Congress pertain to the 2019 Pulwama attack and India’s retaliation.“The CWC demands a timebound investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the breach of national security, violations of the Official Secrets Act and the role of the persons involved. Ultimately, those who are guilty of treasonous behaviour must be brought before the law and punished,” the CWC resolution said.CWC met on Friday to discuss dates for organisational polls, the farm protests and the chat leak. Its resolution, read out to the media by general secretaries Randeep Surjewala and KC Venugopal, said that CWC expresses its “grave concern at recent revelations “ exposing the “sordid conversations that have undoubtedly compromised national security”.The Congress maintained that people in the “highest echelons of government” were involved in the breach, raising secrecy concerns of “vital and sensitive military operations”.“The revelations also point to inexcusable and deliberate subversion of government structures, scandalous and extraneous influence over Government policies, and a vicious attack on the independence of the judiciary. The shameful compromise of the Modi Government with non-government players has been exposed,” it said.In her opening speech, too, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said, “the silence from the government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed”.Reacting to the CWC’s demand, the Republic TV management reiterated their statement on the matter issued on January 19. The statement by Goswami had said, “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime...It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. There are thousands of articles from that time suggesting a hard and tough response from the India Forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-wants-jpc-to-probe-arnab-goswami-s-whatsapp-chat-transcripts-101611365004172.html
23-01-2021||India||Follow my father’s ideology... he’d never, ever give up on idea of India: Mufti||Mehbooba Mufti, 61, was the last chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir before the momentous events of August 5, 2019, when the Centre scrapped the special status and converted the state into two Union territories. A former ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mufti, who heads the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), also spent the maximum time under detention before being freed in October 2020. She spoke to the Hindustan Times on a range of issues. Edited excerpts:How has August 5, 2019, changed you? Are you disturbed, or has it made you more determined?August 5 was a black day in the history of our country. It destroyed the trust that people of Jammu & Kashmir had placed while choosing to be a part of this country. People like me who believed in the Constitution of this country too felt cheated. It was disturbing, and quite humiliating to see our special status robbed.Do you still see yourself as an Indian or only as a Kashmiri -- a sentiment many expressed after the special status was changed?Well, it has been a very difficult and traumatic experience, swinging from one extreme to another. But my politics has revolved around my father’s ideology, and I am sure he would never ever have given up on idea of India. He believed that J&K had to be resolved to restore peace with dignity, without compromising on sovereignty of the country. It has to become a bridge of friendship rather than a battlefield between India and Pakistan. So that vision is more relevant today, and needs to be fulfilled for lasting peace in the region.Have you ever thought of quitting politics or would you be willing to be the chief minister of the UT of J&K?Yes I did think about it but then the thought of giving up on everything that my father held so dear to his heart would be a betrayal of sorts. But my politics is going to be much more than just fighting for power. I will continue my struggle for peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue.After your release, you said you don’t recognise the Indian national flag. Many called it sedition.Unfortunately, a majority of the embedded media chose to distort my statement deliberately. Because J&K’s constitution and flag was snatched unconstitutionally, I said I will wait for it to be restored, and hold both the flags together. Let’s not forget both the Indian and J&K flag derived their legitimacy from the Indian Constitution. If that amounts to sedition, then so be it. Students are called anti-nationals, activists and NGOs as urban Naxalites; Shaheen Bagh protestors as Pakistani; farmers are Khalistani; and we Kashmiri as terrorists. So in any case, dissent or criticism of the ruling party has become anti-national and sedition in today’s India.What message do you derive from the local DDC polls as far as you and your party’s political future is concerned?The message was quite clear that PDP’s strength is its vision and party worker. Despite Delhi engineering a split in our party, our workers continue to work tirelessly to fulfill the party’s vision of peace with dignity. Their hard work paid off, and even though we fought fewer seats, our strike rate was good. So that’s very encouraging.The people of Kashmir are angry with mainstream parties such as the NC and the PDP, and feel that since both have allied with the Centre, particularly the BJP, you are responsible for Aug 5. How much blame are you willing to take?We placed our faith in the Prime Minister of this country and assumed he would carry forward the peace process initiated by (former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee). Assuming that the resolution of larger J&K issue has to come from Delhi, we tried to engage the BJP by aligning with them. Sadly, the BJP views everything through the prism of petty electoral gains, and lacks the vision and resolve to take decisions that will heal and build the country. Instead, it has chosen to take India down a dark and regressive path steeped in division, bigotry, and hatred for minorities. Unfortunately, J&K became a political experimental laboratory.Let’s be candid and honest: did you ally with the BJP because of your father Mufti Saeed, or did you see some political merit in it too?My father had a political vision not only for J&K but also for the country. He put everything at stake, including his credibility, while aligning with the BJP, only with the intention to secure what we already had -- our special status – and to find a peaceful and dignified solution to the Kashmir problem. He was of the firm opinion that the resolution of Kashmir issue would not only end the bloodshed in the state but would also be in the interest of the country nationally as well as internationally. So even though I have never been a great fan of the BJP, I could not walk away from his decision.Will you ever ally with the BJP again? It was my father’s decision for a larger cause, and I honoured it. That’s that and doesn’t go beyond it.Will the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) fight elections collectively going forward?The PAGD was formed for a larger cause and fighting assembly elections separately or together is going to be a collective decision. There are bound to be teething problems as we have been political rivals traditionally. The spirit and larger purpose of this alliance will take time to reach to our grass root workers. Sajjad Lone’s leaving has been a loss too.You had said that there would be no one to hold the Tricolour if Article 370 was touched. How do you explain the lack of protests?Well the way BJP has vandalised the Constitution and are running the country on their party agenda, they themselves have sidelined everything that this country stood for. They used the Tricolor to protest in support of rapists in Kathua. Mainstream parties in J&K held the Tricolor for the last 70 years not out of fear of being called anti-nationals, but out of their conviction. But when you destroy the faith and trust that Kashmiris put in the country, how does holding or not holding the flag matter? They have terrorised and stunned people into silence. All the central agencies such as NIA, ED, CBI etc. are used to threaten people here. Such draconian measures have led to an uneasy and forced sense of calm.Are you in touch, or in occasional conversations with the current government, either directly or through the L-G and the NSA? What do you discuss with them?There hasn’t been much conversation but whenever there is, I tell them to let democracy prevail and allow people to express themselves. You can jail a person, not his ideas or thoughts.When you think of your political future -- what do you envisage?I can’t separate my destiny from that of the people of J&K anymore. We are all in it together, so we either sink or swim. For me, resolution of Kashmir is the most important issue, and it was also my father’s desire to see it resolved in a peaceful and dignified way.Do you fear being arrested again?The Enforcement Directorate has been burrowing through my bank accounts and that of my family. Since they couldn’t find any financial impropriety, they started auditing the expenditure on my father’s mausoleum. Three senior PDP leaders have been arrested for a month now without being served any order for the detention. Our youth president Waheed Parra, too, has been jailed under UAPA on flimsy charges. All this is being done to blackmail me into silence. And frankly, they are capable of anything if they can send NIA summons to an organisation such as the Khalsa Aid which has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-my-father-s-ideology-he-d-never-ever-give-up-on-idea-of-india-mufti-101611364480646.html
23-01-2021||India||‘Our only goal was to ensure that India became free’||By Sadia AkhtarOn a sunny afternoon, as one walks through the quiet lanes of Fazilpur Badli village in Farrukhnagar, a faint yet powerful lilting sound wafts through the air as one approaches the house of freedom fighter Parmanand. Dressed in a pale white kurta-pyjama, the 100-year-old lies on a charpoy in the courtyard of his house reciting fragments of poems from memory.“Gandhi, Nehru aur Subhas, Azad jo brigade they/ Singapur ke junglomein mein hum roz karte parade they,” recites Parmanand, one of the last surviving members of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army or INA). He was among the four INA veterans who took part in the Republic Day parade in 2019, and is among the few surviving freedom fighters who took part in the national struggle for independence.In April 1940, Parmanand, then 20, joined the First Regiment Army in Gurugram. He was sent to Ambala and further to Karachi for training, and then through the ship, the regiment left for Singapore to fight against Japan in the ongoing World War II. In December 1941, the Japanese aircraft attacked the British Army base in Singapore, after which Parmanand and others were taken into captivity.“We could hear the planes hovering in the air. I quickly went and informed my senior. Following the escalation of the attacks, Japan took British soldiers under captivity,” recalled Parmanand. He and other Prisoners of War (PoW) were told that Japan would help them in fighting against the British for India’s independence. It’s here when Parmanand’s life turned turtle, and from being a loyal solider in the British army, he eventually joined the INA to fight for India’s independence.Subhas Chandra Bose, who had staged a daring escape from house arrest in Calcutta in 1941 had one aim as the world war raged across the globe, between the Axis powers on one side (Italy, Nazi Germany, Japan) and the Allied powers (Britain and its colonies, later, United States of America) on the other. Rather than support Britain, Bose wanted to use the war to establish a provisional Indian government and a military presence that would fight against the colonial power. Not everyone supported his decision to take help from fascist states like Italy and Germany. However, it was only in 1943 that Bose, who had left Berlin for Tokyo, Japan, proclaimed the establishment of a provisional independent Indian government, and the INA, which comprised several thousand troops trained with Japan’s help.Parmanand recalled meeting Bose for the first time in 1943. To welcome Bose, he penned a special song that exhorted Churchill to leave India. Over the years, the memory of the lines in the song has dulled, but a little nudge from his family members gives him the incentive to recite it with full gusto. “Paapi Churchill se kehdo, bhaag jaye Hind se [Tell the sinner Churchill to leave India with haste], ” he said.The trials and tribulations of the INA are recurring themes in his poetry.“I used to recite poems to motivate my friends and fellow soldiers. Sometimes, they would request for particular poems. I always obliged. Our job was tough and we needed to keep our spirits high among the difficult conditions,” said Parmanand, pausing intermittently to recite another stanza.“Netaji used to love me a lot. He used to call me affectionately with love, like one reaches out to children. ‘Parmanand, come here!’ he would say and ask me to do chores. ‘Haan ji,’ I would say. He used to give me attention. I, on the other hand, was from a village and not very well-read,” Parmanand said.“Azad Hind Fauj had four brigades: Nehru, Gandhi, Subhas and Azad. The Bahadur brigade was a microcosm of all the four brigades. It included people from different brigades. I was a havildar in this unit,” Parmanand recalled.“Our work was very difficult. Even narrating the ordeal of those days sends shivers down my spine. We soldiers were ready to die. Many of us did. We never gave up. We vanquished the Britishers,” he said.After Singapore, the INA’s next base was Myanmar (then called Burma). For three months, INA fought with British and American armies in Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and entered Assam. “In Kohima, a major battle took place in 1944. In retaliation, the British Army damaged the bridges through which we used to get food grains,” Parmanand said.The siege of Imphal, or the Battle of Kohima as this confrontation came to be called ended badly for the Axis powers (Japanese forces, and the supportive INA), but Bose’s liberation army succeeded in establishing itself as a scrappy force to reckon with.During this time, Parmanand was asked to spy on the British base. But he, along with two other soldiers, got arrested. “From the headquarters in Assam, we were sent to some forest area where there were already six prisoners,” said Parmanand, who faced physical torture while imprisoned in Jhikargachha Jail (in present-day Bangladesh).Six months later, Parmanand was sent to Multan jail. “I was court-martialed for deceiving British government. I was asked about the consequences of cheating British government. I only said, shoot me,” he said.On February 11, 1946, several months after the Second World War ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and the reported death of Subhas Chandra Bose, Parmanand travelled back home to his village in Farrukhnagar where he told people about the INA and his days of struggle. “When I came back to the village, people asked me questions. They were curious. I told them about the war and our stories. I told them whatever I remembered, stories of our valour and sacrifices,” he said. On returning, he eventually took to farming.In August 2021, Parmanand will turn 101. In all these years, his commitment to the country has not waned. “Every time, someone asks about my time in the INA, I recall the painful memories that linger for many hours. Azad Hind Fauj sacrificed for the freedom of the country. Our only goal was to ensure that India became a free country. We got imprisoned. If we weren’t caught, we would have killed more and more would have died but we would not have given up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-only-goal-was-to-ensure-that-the-country-was-free-101611364173305.html
23-01-2021||India||India calls out Pakistan on religious freedom||India and Pakistan squared off at the United Nations over a resolution on safeguarding religious sites around the world, with the Indian side criticising Pakistan for co-sponsoring the move weeks after the demolition of a Hindu temple.The resolution on “promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites” was sponsored by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and several other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.It was passed unanimously on Thursday after Saudi Arabia and Morocco piloted delicate negotiations on a consensus text.The resolution condemned all acts of violence and destruction directed against religious sites around the world and denounced “any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites”, while strongly deploring violence against people on the basis of their religion or beliefs.It also expressed concern about an increase in instances of racial and religious intolerance and stereotyping, and condemned any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and urged states to take effective measures to combat such incidents. The resolution also called on the UN secretary general to convene a global conference to advance the UN Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites.The Indian representative at the world body, TS Tirumurti, while explaining the country’s position on the resolution, called for objectivity and impartiality in discussions at the UN, without nations taking sides.“It is a matter of great irony that the country where the most recent attack and demolition of a Hindu temple took place in a series of such attacks and where the rights of minorities are being emasculated is one of the co-sponsors of the resolution under the agenda item ‘Culture of Peace’,” he said.“The resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,” he added. Religious and cultural sites remain vulnerable to attacks by violent extremists, as was seen when a Hindu temple was set ablaze and razed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan last December, while the authorities stood idly by, the Indian representative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-out-pakistan-on-religious-freedom-101611362287802.html
23-01-2021||India||PM Modi talks to health workers to dispel fears over vaccines||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought to set at rest fears and misconceptions over the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines, and sought to dispel the “vaccine hesitancy” that has kept the turnouts low at inoculation centres.In an interaction with health workers in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency, Modi said the vaccines had been launched after completing all scientific processes of trial and testing. It was only when scientists gave the green signal that the vaccination drive, billed as the world’s biggest, started on January 16, he added.“When doctors and health workers give a clean chit to the vaccine, it sends a very strong message among people about the efficacy of the shots,” he said through a video conference with the health workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemicUnion health ministry data showed that till 6pm on Friday, there were close to 230,000 more vaccinations were done across the country -- a total comparable to what was seen the day before. But there were also significantly more vaccination sessions on Friday, 6,230 compared to 4,043, implying that turnout had dropped again after a brief increase on Thursday.During each session, 100 people are selected and invited -- on Thursday, almost 57% showed up, but on Friday, this proportion fell to 36%.Modi’s interaction came a day after the government launched a mass awareness campaign to drive home its message that the made-in-India vaccines -- Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India; and Covaxin, developed locally by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International -- were completely safe.The two vaccines received emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator on January 3, clearing the ground for the start of the vaccination drive.Health practitioners who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus or have administered the shots to others took part in Modi’s interaction with Varanasi’s health workers, sharing their first-hand experience.“Really, corona warriors have done a wonderful job,” Modi said in the 30-minute interaction during which he spoke to a government doctor, a lab technician and three nurses deployed at three vaccination centres —the District Women’s Hospital, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay District Hospital and the Haathi community health centre -- in Varanasi.“Our preparation has been such that the vaccine is fast reaching every corner of the country,” Modi said. “And on the world’s biggest need today, we are completely self-reliant. Not just that, India is also helping out many countries with vaccines.”He appealed to doctors, hospitals and vaccinators to accelerate the inoculation of all health workers in Varanasi so that the next phase of the vaccination drive can get underway soon.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-talks-to-health-workers-to-dispel-fears-over-vaccines-101611358753514.html
23-01-2021||India||Talks break down, govt tells unions it won’t accept demand to repeal laws||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday told farm unions that the government would not repeal three contentious agricultural laws, and a proposal to suspend the legislation for 18 months was the best it could offer, leading to the collapse of a long series of negotiations just two days after an agreement appeared in sight.No dates were announced for any further discussions.Tomar said the dialogue process could only restart if the farmers reconsidered the government’s most far-reaching proposal so far, and asked the farm unions to inform the latter by January 23 if they were ready to change their minds.The farmers, who have rigidly called for either a repeal of the laws or nothing, on Friday vowed to intensify their agitation — the biggest the Modi government has faced so far, and one that has seen tens of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana camping on the Capital’s borders for 57 days.The farm unions stressed that they would be going ahead with a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26, but said they would do it after India’s Republic Day celebrations and not disrupt the official function.“I am not an astrologer. I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” Tomar told reporters after the 11th round of negotiations with representatives of a common platform for multiple farm unions. “This is the best we could have offered to the farmers.”The agriculture minister blamed unnamed “forces” for failure of the talks and criticised “people with vested interests who wanted the talks to be unsuccessful”.“When an agitation is named after farmers, is related to farmers’ issue, and the government tries so hard to resolve it with one proposal after the other, then there is some force which wants to the agitation to continue so that farmers’ welfare cannot happen,” the agriculture minister said. “If there are other interests at play, then farmers’ interests can’t be secured. If farm unions have people who are interested in farmers’ welfare, then our proposal would have got considered.”Tomar said he told the farm unions the government’s proposal (to put the laws on hold and form a committee to look into the farmers’ demands) was the “best we could have done”. The minister added that he urged farm unions to reconsider their decision because the offer of the government was in the “best interest of farmers and nation”.On the question of whether the government would ever consider a repeal, Tomar said: “The government has always said farmers can ask for anything other than repeal.”In the negotiations on Friday, there was hardly any issue left to discuss when farm unions told the government at the outset that they wanted nothing short of a full repeal of the laws as well as a new legislation guaranteeing assured prices for farm produce.Leaders representing the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a collective of farm unions on strike since November, told the government that the farm unions had collectively decided against accepting the government’s proposal to put the laws on hold.Late on Friday night, farmers gathered at the Singhu border alleged that attempts had been made to engineer violence at their protest site or during their upcoming tractor rally. Union leaders said they had detained a man who was moving suspiciously among them.The Modi government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.In the previous round of negotiations with a 41-member delegation representing farm unions on Wednesday, the Union government offered to suspend the three pieces of legislation. It also proposed a committee with representatives from the government as well as farmers to look into “all issues related to the farmers’ agitation”.The farmers, however, hardened their stand to reject both the proposals instead of agreeing to meet the government midway. They said they would not budge from their demand for a complete repeal of the laws.“There is no new date for further talks. We will see what to do after January 26, when we will bring out a farmers’ Republic Day parade in Delhi. We appeal to the Delhi Police to allow it,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a senior leader of the agitation.“In the talks with the (Delhi) police, the officers proposed a roadmap in front of the farmer leaders (on farmers’ Republic Day parade). Leaders will give their reply on this proposal after holding a farm unions’ meeting tomorrow (Saturday),” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the agitation.A senior farm leader, Balbir Singh Rajewal, said farmers were preparing full steam for a peaceful and colourful farmers’ parade on Republic Day. He said farmers would now focus on the future course of the agitation.Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan said it would be wrong to say the talks were inconclusive. “The government has broken off the discussions. What is the logic of suspending the laws for one-and-a-half years? The government hasn’t said anything meaningful yet on a law for minimum support prices,” he said, adding the main reason for not accepting the government’s proposal was that “the suspension is a limited-period offer and not a solution to the demand for a repeal of the laws.”Experts said the farmers’ position now appeared untenable.“The issue is no longer about reformist policies and a perceived threat to livelihoods. We haven’t so far heard about any specific fallout of the reforms from the unions. The issue is one of a status quoist demand by farmers and a lack of trust between the two sides,” said Abhinav Saikia, an agronomist with the farm startup IndAgro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-break-down-govt-tells-unions-it-won-t-accept-demand-to-repeal-laws-101611358402431.html
23-01-2021||India||Congress to elect new president by June||The Congress party will hold its internal polls to elect a new president this June, after the upcoming round of assembly elections, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) announced on Friday after brainstorming for at least three hours on internal polls as well as issues such as the farmers’ agitation and the alleged breach of national security as evident in the WhatsApp chat transcripts of journalist Arnab Goswami.The Congress Election Authority (CEA), the party’s panel in charge of the elections, proposed a timeline between May 15 and 30 to hold organisational elections, although some leaders, particularly those in charge of poll-bound states, said this could clash with the assembly elections. CEA also proposed a schedule for the election of 12 members of the new CWC. At the end, the schedule for both the polls were left for the party president to decide.If the CWC is eventually formed through an election, it will fulfil a key demand of the 23 signatories to an August letter to the Congress leadership, seeking sweeping changes in the party hierarchy. The last such election took place in 1997. CEA will meet again to decide if the new president will have a full term, or will serve the remainder of the current term that runs till December 2022.The meeting saw some exchanges between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, and Anand Sharma and Ghulam Nabi Azad, two of the signatories to the letter, over the need for an election. Sharma and Azad also wanted the schedule for the election to be decided at the meeting itself. “The Central Election Authority has already given a schedule for conducting election in May , but all CWC members unanimously requested the Congress president that it (party polls) should not affect the election prospects of the Congress party in assembly elections,” said party general secretary Randeep Surjewala, adding that “a little rescheduling will be needed” for the internal polls. Four states -- Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam -- go to the polls in the first half of the year.While Sharma and Azad stressed on the importance of internal polls, Gehlot said that the need of the hour is to fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and not internally. Gehlot said he had been in the party since 1973-74 but did not remember a time when there was a poll in CWC. Pointing out that BJP president JP Nadda or its former president Amit Shah were not elected, he said that for years people in the Congress had held party posts through nominations.Elections to CWC were held in Tirupati and Kolkata in 1993 and 1997 under the presidentship of PV Narsimha Rao and Sitaram Kesari respectively.Sharma, who spoke much after Gehlot, complained that he was being targeted by Rajasthan CM, at which point Ambika Soni reminded him that no names had been taken. She said that the party president has been entrusted to decide the dates, and that the party constitution should be seen to determine how CWC is to be elected. According to a senior leader, Sharma agreed that the Congress president should finalise the schedule of the elections.KC Venugopal, general secretary, organisation, later told the media, “As per our constitution, little clarities are needed for whether the elections for Congress president and working committee can be held together or working committee election should be held after the Congress president election.”Rahul Gandhi spoke towards the end of the meeting. He tried to pacify both sides and said both Gehlot and Sharma had raised important points. Rahul Gandhi maintained that the party elections should be held soon but that the need of the hours is to focus on farmers issues and fight against the BJP-RSS.According to a senior leader who asked not to be named: “Rahul also said, ‘let’s go through with the elections’, and that comment puts to rest any doubt about the party holding polls.” Several Congress leaders are hopeful that the former party chief Rahul Gandhi will return to the top post in the party polls. In the CWC meeting, Gandhi trained his guns at the RSS, terming it as “poisonous” and spoke on farmer issues.In her opening speech, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that the government has shown “shocking insensitivity and arrogance going through the charade of consultation” with the farmers. She maintained that the new farm laws will destroy the foundations of food security that are based on the three pillars of the minimum support price (MSP) , public procurement and PDS (public distribution system). She also reacted to the WhatsApp transcripts of Goswami’s conversations that seemed to suggest he had prior knowledge of a strike against Pakistan and said “national security [has been] thoroughly compromised” . “Yet the silence from the Government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed.”The Congress president hailed the vaccination drive but slammed the government for its handling of Covid. “The government has inflicted untold suffering on the people of our country by the manner in which it has managed the Covid-19 pandemic. It will take years for the scars to heal,” she said. Gandhi also touched upon the “grim economic situation” and said that “large parts of the economy like MSME and the informal sector have been decimated with the Government refusing to extend a lifeline.” “When public expenditure has to be carefully prioritised, it is very painful to find huge amounts of money being allocated and spent on initiatives that can only be described as ‘personal vanity projects’,” she said, in an apparent reference to the Central Vista project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-elect-new-president-by-june-101611358162620.html
23-01-2021||India||CBI books Cambridge Analytica over Facebook data theft||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against Alexander Nix of British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) and Aleksandr Kogan of Global Science Research Limited, UK, for allegedly harvesting personal data of up to 562,000 Indians from Facebook for commercial purposes, officials said on Friday.The move comes after a two-year-long investigation.The CBI enquiry revealed that Kogan, founder and director of Global Science Research, created a Facebook app, “thisisyourdigitallife”; the app was authorised to collect certain specific data of the users for academic and research purposes.The agency said that the app illegally collected additional unauthorised data of users as well as their friends’ network on Facebook; in all, data of 335 users and their network of 562,000 of their friends were compromised. Globally, it is believed that the app compromised the data of 87 million Facebook users.Kogan has been named as accused in the CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered on January 19 and has been charged under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Information Technology Act.Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny sometime around March 2018 when several international media platforms, citing former CA employees, associates and documents, claimed that the company had harvested private information without their consent from the Facebook profiles of 87 million Facebook accounts.The reports said the data may have been used to shape the outcomes of the 2016 US presidential election as well as the 2016 Brexit referendum. Last year, the UK Information Commissioner said CA was not involved in the Brexit vote.Union law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Rajya Sabha in 2018 that the probe will be handed over to the CBI.The anti-corruption agency launched a preliminary enquiry (PE), a precursor to an FIR, against CA in July 2018 on a complaint by the ministry of electronics and information technology.During the enquiry, CBI contacted 335 app users out of which six responded to the agency and were examined during the course of enquiry. “They unanimously stated that they were misled by the app and were not aware of the fact that their personal (data) and (their) friends’ data was harvested. They also said that they would not have used the app if they knew that it would do so,” the CBI FIR added. HT has reviewed a copy of the FIR.Global Science Research, CBI said, entered into a criminal conspiracy with CA in 2014 .“Facebook had collected written certificates from Kogan (Global Science Research) and CA during 2016-17 declaring that all such data obtained by them through the app, thisisyourdigitallife, was accounted for and destroyed. This facts confirms that Global Science harvested data sets and provided the same to CA for commercial purposes,” the CBI FIR stated.The FIR also adds that the agency could not ascertain the veracity of claims by Global Science and CA that they had destroyed the data sets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-cambridge-analytica-over-facebook-data-theft-101611357394409.html
23-01-2021||India||Police proposes route map for tractor rally, farmers to respond today||New Delhi: The Delhi police on Friday proposed a route map to the farmers where they could hold a tractor rally on January 26. Police officers did not share details of the proposed route but earlier the farmers had been told to take out the rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway on the periphery of the capital.The farmer groups confirmed they had received a proposal from the police but said they would respond only after holding a meeting on Saturday. They had planned the rally on the Outer Ring Road and had assured the police that it will be completely peaceful and that the protesters will not try to reach other areas in the city.Until Friday night, it was not clear if the police had proposed a route inside the national Capital or on the highways connecting Delhi.Senior police officers are holding talks with the farmers protesting against the three contentious farm laws over their planned tractor rally. Talks are being held daily since January 18. Police officers have maintained that no official permission has yet been given to the protesters for the rally since it could create a law and order problem on the Republic Day and trigger traffic chaos.Darshan Pal of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of the Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said the officers have proposed a “road map” to the farm leaders. “We will give our reply to their proposal after holding a meeting of the farm unions tomorrow,” Pal said.On talks with the government, the farmer leader said, “The deadlock continued as the government came with the proposal to suspend these laws for 18 months, while the farmers demanded the repeal of the laws,” he said.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said they are waiting for the farmer’s response and the future course of action would be decided accordingly.Meanwhile after the 11th round of meeting between the farmers and the government, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said that the government has told them that it will stick to its initial proposal. “They said if the farmers agree to it there can be further talks between the government and the farmers. We have told them that we will respond to the offer made,” he said outside Vigyan Bhawan.The farmers said that the date of next meeting with the government has not been decided yet.At the Singhu, Tikri and other borders where the farmers are camping, protests remained peaceful throughout the day even as police maintained adequate deployment. The farmers at Singhu border spent the day mostly marching, shouting slogans against the farm laws, delivering speeches from the stage, and cooking and distributing food at langars.In the afternoon, however, there was some ruckus near Vigyan Bhawan when a group of farmers heading to the meeting venue in a car alleged that they were stopped by the police and the rear windshield of their car was broken by policemen.Police officials said that every vehicle carrying farmers, coming to Vigyan Bhawan from Singhu Border, is escorted the police.Senior officials said they did not have any information about the vehicle joining the police escort and it was therefore stopped before Vigyan Bhawan. “On this, the farmers in the car got agitated and themselves damaged the car using a baton. There was no police action in this incident,” a senior officer said, who wished not to be named.Additional deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Ghanshyam Bansal said situation at Singhu Border on Friday remained peaceful as farmers continued their agitation. “We had sufficient deployment in place and the situation is being continuously monitored,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-proposes-route-map-for-tractor-rally-farmers-to-respond-today-101611356088968.html
23-01-2021||India||The patriot who will never die||By Ronojoy SenThere are few Indian icons around whom there is such a vivid mythology and “life-after-life” as one biographer put it, as Netaji Subhas Bose. Leonard Gordon, who has written one of the standard biographies of Bose, noted in 1990 that Netaji’s story had “begun to resemble that of an Indian deity”. Not much has changed in 2021, the 125th birth anniversary of Bose.As West Bengal heads to elections this year, Netaji’s legacy is once again up for grabs. The central government has announced that Netaji’s birth anniversary will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas. It has also set up a committee to plan year-long anniversary programmes. The Trinamool Congress has countered this by saying that the day should be remembered as Desh Prem Diwas. It has also pointed out that West Bengal celebrates Bose’s birthday every year as Subhas Diwas and that their plea that his birthday be declared a national holiday has found no takers.Thus, Netaji is well and truly alive in Bengal politics and the people’s minds. While the current claims and counter claims over Bose is geared toward electoral gains, his memory endures because of the many what-ifs associated with him. That is why Gopalkrishna Gandhi suggests that Bose continues to be popular since he serves as an “alter ego to the nation’s power structure”.Part of the continuing fascination with Bose is the attraction of the rebel. His dramatic escape from house arrest in Calcutta in 1941 and arrival in Berlin is the stuff of myth. Bose’s subsequent setting up of the Indian National Army and his alliance with the Japanese is also well known. What is less known is that Netaji was a maverick since his early days. He was not only expelled from the elite Presidency College, he also spurned, in 1921, the dream job of any self-respecting Bengali — a chance to become part of the Indian Civil Service. This non-conformism would surface at different phases of Netaji’s tumultuous political career.A strong reason for Bose’s appeal is that, as historian Sugata Bose puts it, Netaji’s legend “cuts across religious, linguistic, and national boundaries.” Yet another cause for Bose’s popularity is the belief he was a strongman, who could have steered the nationalist movement and independent India in a different direction from Jawaharlal Nehru.Netaji’s mysterious death in an air crash in Taiwan in August 1945 and the clutch of conspiracy theories around it have also fuelled the myths around Bose. Everybody loves a good conspiracy, especially those surrounding a sudden or violent death. In the case of Netaji, his antagonism to mainstream nationalist politics and his links with fascists made him a particularly apposite candidate for conspiracy theories.Sugata Bose, who is also a grandnephew of Netaji, notes that an overwhelming majority of Netaji’s closest associates believed that he had died in the crash. However, since 1946, there began ‘’sightings’’ of Netaji in different locations. Perhaps the first such ‘’sighting’’ was recorded in 1946 when a certain KSM Swamy claimed to have met Netaji in a third-class compartment of the Bombay Express. Since then Netaji spotting became a cottage industry. One of the better known of these theories was the discovery that Netaji had resurfaced as a Hindu ascetic — Gumnami Baba — in Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh. Indeed, there were several Hindu sadhus who had been linked to Netaji at various times.An organisation called the Subhasbadi Janata kept these stories in circulation through pamphlets, newspapers and weekly meetings. At the same time, there were rumours of Netaji having shown up in Russia or China. The Netaji sightings peaked in the 1960s when there was a general disillusionment with politics of the day.These rumours might have died down had not the Indian State stepped in and set up a commission to investigate the death of Bose. This had the effect of legitimising, in a sense, the conspiracy theories. The first was the Netaji Inquiry Committee, set up in 1956, consisting of a former comrade of Netaji, Shah Nawaz Khan, an elder brother of Netaji, Suresh Bose, and a government officer. The committee went through the evidence, including interviewing the Japanese doctor who treated Netaji after the crash, and found that Netaji had died in 1945. Its findings were, however, undermined by the dissent of Suresh Bose who stated that Netaji was still alive.In 1970, another inquiry commission headed by Justice G.D. Khosla was instituted. There was some remarkable testimony before the panel: A bank official from Sholapur claimed that he received direct messages from Netaji by tuning his body like a radio. The Khosla report, like the earlier commission, concluded that Netaji had indeed died in the crash.A one-man commission, headed by a retired high court judge, Manoj Mukherjee, was the third such body to look into the Netaji mystery. After six years of hearings, Mukherjee concluded in 2006 that the air crash that killed Bose had not happened. It did so on the flimsy basis that the government of Taiwan did not have records of the crash. Sugata Bose has a simple explanation for this, pointing out that Taiwan had then been under Japanese occupation. He adds that the Mukherjee Commission “made no distinction between the highly probable and the utterly impossible.” However, the Mukherjee Commission, as well another one headed by Justice Vishnu Sahay, found no credible evidence that Gumnami Baba was Bose.But this too has not stopped the conspiracy theories. In 2019, a Bengali feature film titled, Gumnaami, directed by Srijit Mukherjee lent credence to the theory that Gumnami Baba might indeed have been Netaji in disguise. The same year, a book titled Conundrum peddled the same theory. While several descendants of Bose publicly voiced their disapproval of the film, Mukherjee stated he was merely putting before the pubic different theories about Netaji’s “disappearance” in 1945.Ronojoy Sen is Senior Research Fellow, ISAS & SASP, National University of Singapore.

23-01-2021||India||Record 3 billion days of work generated but women’s share shrinks||For the first time since it was expanded to cover the entire country by April 2008, India’s flagship rural jobs programme has generated more than three billion days of work in less than a year, but as more people scrambled for work, the share of female workers and the average days of employment for families shrank for the first time in five years, according to government data.The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Jobs Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has this financial year generated 3.11 billion days of work, 460 million days more than last year, according to data by the ministry of rural development. The surge in the year that began in April is attributed to the pandemic and the lockdown enforced at end-March that forced millions of workers to return to the countryside from the citiesBut as more people demanded work, employment opportunities for women have shrunk. In the current year, 52.7% of work (share in persondays) has been done by women, the lowest in five years. Between 2016-17 and 2019-20 , women’s share of work allotted under MGNREGS was 54.77%, 54.59%, 53.53% and 56.16%.MGNREGS, a rural jobs guarantee programme, stipulates that half the employment generated by the scheme be earmarked for women. Under the scheme, at least one member of each poor rural household is assured 100 days of work in a year.More people seeking such work meant fewer average days of employment for households. In this financial year, rural households have found an average of just 44.8 days of employment. Only 3.1 million families have completed the full quota of 100 days of work per year.The scheme, widely seen as the last resort for rural households, received the highest annual funding this year of more than R1 lakh crore. MGNREGS work was also included in the special package to offer employment to labourers who returned home during the initial months of the pandemic.This year, 105 million people have participated in MGNREGS, the highest in five years, indicating the surge in demand for jobs even as the Indian economy contracted by a record 23.9% in the quarter ended June, followed by a decline of 7.5% in the three months ended September.Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said: “Usually, the men go to cities or take up other work and women engage in MGNREGS for extra family income. But this year, it might be that the health concerns have seen a section of woman workers reluctant to come out and work.” He added, “The fall in average days of employment is likely to improve as young men have returned to the cities and now less families are likely to see work in the remaining months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-3-billion-days-of-work-generated-but-women-s-share-shrinks-101611355631915.html
23-01-2021||India||Sole BSP MLA Md Jama Khan set to join JD(U) in Bihar||Within a week, soon when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) projected Shahnawaz Hussain as a nominee, the Janata Dal–United (JD-U) too is all set to welcome the lone Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Md Jama Khan to the party fold.Khan won from the Chainpur Assembly seat on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket in the 2020 assembly elections and is all set to join JD-U soon.“Yes, I am going to meet Bihar CM Nitish Kumarji this evening,” the BSP MLA said adding, “I do feel I can fulfill promises made to people during elections by joining the government.”Talking to HT over the phone, Khan said, “You can translate your words into action fully if you are in the ruling party and I see nothing wrong in joining the ruling party for the sake of the people.” He is likely to get a ministerial berth in Nitish Kumar’s cabinet.Khan surprised everyone by defeating veteran BJP leader and minister Brij Kishor Bind by a margin of over 24,000 votes in the last assembly polls. He had unsuccessfully contested the seat on a Congress ticket in 2010 and lost to BJP leader Brij Kishor Bind by a small margin of 674 votes in 2015.An alumni of BHU, the BSP leader is known for his deep insight into UP politics and JD-U is all set to enter into the political arena in UP in the next assembly elections.Just before the 2020 assembly polls BSP’s Bihar president Bharat Bind had switched over to RJD and later won the Bhabua seat on a RJD ticket.“This is the second blow to BSP in Bihar in quick succession and now BSP has to reconsider its strategy in Bihar,” political observer Amitesh Tiwari said.He added, “JD-U can’t miss the opportunity as the party wants to take revenge for Arunachal Pradesh where JD-U MLAs had switched over to BJP,” a political observer said.Both of NDA’s allies—the BJP and JD-U have wooed Muslim leaders in Bihar politics to show their interest in minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sole-bsp-mla-md-jama-khan-set-to-join-jd-u-in-bihar-101611346810755.html

Now, the government has offered 4.38 hectares of land to them for this near Ganga," said Kaushik.The Akhada Parishad in a meeting with the CM last year had demanded a land space adjacent to Ganga ghat in Haridwar.Informing about another major decision, Kaushik informed that the cabinet also decided to pay 155 teachers of the Sanskrit department according to their teaching experience."Under the move, a teacher who has been teaching Sanskrit for about five years, would be paid ₹15,000/month. Similarly, a teacher with experience between five to 10 years would be paid ₹25,000 per month and a teacher teaching the subject for over 10 years would be paid ₹30,000 a month. Apart from this, a Sanskrit teacher having a UGC approved M Phil or PhD will get a ₹5000 bonus," said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-accepts-saints-request-for-burial-land-to-check-jal-samadhi-101611343155052.html

Officials didn’t give any specific reason for the change.AASU, which spearheaded the anti-CAA protests in the state in December 2019, launched a 3-day protest against the legislation beginning Friday.Police resorted to baton-charge at a torch rally organised in Tezpur and in Guwahati a large rally was blocked by the police on Friday evening. Tension was also reported from Sivasagar and Dhekiajuli during similar rallies.“Modi is coming to make false promises to Assamese people again before the assembly polls. We oppose the visit and Centre’s forcible enactment of CAA. We were carrying our peaceful protests, but the police restricted us from exercising our democratic right,” AASU general secretary Sankar Jyoti Baruah told journalists.AASU and several other organizations have decided to greet PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah (who is scheduled to address rallies on Sunday) with black flags.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-pm-modi-s-assam-visit-aasu-takes-out-torch-rallies-against-caa-101611342381696.html
23-01-2021||India||Short of attendance while pregnant, DU law student gets relief from top court||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Delhi University to issue a certificate and marksheet to a law student who was detained for falling short of attendance in 2018 following her pregnancy.Noting that the order was being passed in the peculiar circumstances of this case, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We direct the University to declare the 5th semester supplementary examination results of the petitioner and issue the provisional degree along with necessary certificates, if she had passed the examinations, subject to the petitioner clearing the other formalities. The order is passed in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.”The petitioner, Ankita Madan had joined the three-year law course at Law Centre-II of the Faculty of Law, Delhi University in August 2016. She was a married woman who attended the evening law course and successfully cleared three semesters. In the fourth semester, she became pregnant and could not attend classes. She was unable to join classes till March 2018. During that same time, a teachers’ strike beginning March 16, 2018 hampered conduct of classes due to which she fell short of the 65 per cent attendance criteria required under Rule 10 of the Bar Council of India Rules.The University issued notice on May 9, 2018 detaining her and preventing her from appearing for the fourth semester examinations. She approached the Delhi High Court for relief. A single judge bench dismissed her plea. In appeal, a division bench in September 2018 found the University’s decision to be correct.She brought her cause before the Supreme Court seeking an indulgence to attend classes. In October 2018, the apex court allowed Madan to attend classes at her own risk. Over the years, she secured interim orders of the Court to appear in subsequent examinations. Her result was made subject to the final outcome of her petition.Justice Ramasubramanian, writing the judgment for the bench, noted that the petitioner had already taken the fourth, fifth and final semester examinations. The University declared all but one result of her fifth semester supplementary examinations. It even held back the provisional certificates to be granted at the end of the course awaiting the Court’s final order. Last year, Madan moved an application through her lawyers Ashish Virmani and Himanshu Dhuper for grant of degree, marksheet and character certificate by the University.The bench observed, “Once the petitioner has completed the course and also written her fifth and sixth semester examinations and even got the results of all the semester examinations except the fifth semester supplementary examinations published, the adjudication of dispute in the petition will only be a matter of academic interest.”Continuing with the string of interim reliefs extended to the petitioner from time to time, the Court finally let the University declare the pending result and clear all formalities by way of documents to be issued on successful completion of course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/short-of-attendance-while-pregnant-du-law-student-gets-relief-from-top-court-101611341516615.html

This will help in spreading a feeling that the police is there to help the people and not to scare them,” Rawat said.During the event, chairperson of the child rights body Usha Negi and state director general of police Ashok Kumar were also present.Usha Negi while addressing the gathering said, “This move by the commission and police will help in providing special counselling for street children and missing minors so that they do not step into the world of crime but become good citizens by pursuing their dreams.”“The members of the commission who will be present at the police station to counsel them, will help them get a good education and keep them away from any wrong doing,” said Negi adding, “Similar police stations will soon be set up in 12 other districts for which a fund of ₹1 lakh has been granted to each district.”Mani Bhushan Srivastava, station house officer of Dalanwala revealing further details of the child-friendly police station said, “It has been prepared with interiors comprising of cartoons and other paintings to make a child comfortable in it.”“Under the initiative, the police will bring orphaned or unclaimed children living in the streets to the child-friendly police station. They would be made comfortable in it which has beds, books and toys for them. The children would be then offered counselling by the members of the state commission for protection of child rights,” Srivastava said.The police officer said that that after counselling the children would be handed over to the commission which would then shift them to proper shelter homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-announces-rs-1-crore-fund-for-welfare-of-orphans-street-kids-101611339122375.html
23-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu: Elephant dies of burn injuries; two arrested||A horrific video emerged on Friday of two men throwing a flaming cloth onto an elephant in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district and the animal trumpeting and running away in pain. The 40-year-old elephant died on January 19 of the injuries it suffered in the attack earlier this month .The two men, identified as Prasath, 36, and Raymond, 28, were arrested for animal cruelty. Officials also sealed a homestay that the men were running; the elephant had intruded into the facility and the men tried to scare it away.“This is heartbreaking and cruel. The action we take against them should serve as a deterrent,” said Nilgiris district collector J Innocent Divya. “They have been booked for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.”Forest officials had been following the elephant since November. “It (the elephant) had an injury on its back and it was roaming around in human habitation without going to the forest,” said LCS Srikanth, deputy director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in Masinagudi.The department tranquilized the pachyderm in December. “But it was still weak and moving around very slowly,” said Srikanth. “This video {of the attack} is from January 3rd midnight.”Forest officials noticed serious injuries to its ear in the first week of January. On the morning of January 19, they tranquilized the elephant again to take it for treatment to a nearby camp. “It suddenly died when we were nearing the camp,” Srikanth said.Animal rights activists said such cruelty was a part of the larger man-animal conflict.“Outsiders like {people who run} resorts, factories, brick kilns have encroached on forest and tribal lands and they don’t understand animals,” said S Muralidharan, founder of the Chennai-based Indian Centre for Animal Rights and Education (INCARE). “This is a criminal act and punishments under the Wild Life Act aren’t severe. The court should take suo motu cognisance of this; go out of the law books and pronounce stringent imprisonment so it serves as an example.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-dies-of-burn-injuries-two-arrested-101611338926107.html

Among the various programmes being organised across the nation, one special programme is being held at Haripura in Gujarat. Do join the programme, which begins at 1 PM," the PM tweeted."Haripura has a special relation with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was at the historic Haripura Session of 1938 that Netaji Bose took up the Presidentship of the Congress Party. Tomorrow’s programme at Haripura will be a tribute to Netaji Bose’s contribution to our nation," he further tweeted.Ahead of Bose's birth anniversary, the PM remembered the affection people showed on the day the e-Gram Vishwagram Project was launched from Haripura. "On the eve of Netaji Bose’s Jayanti, my mind goes back to 23rd January 2009- the day we launched e-Gram Vishwagram Project from Haripura. This initiative revolutionised Gujarat’s IT infrastructure and took the fruits of technology to the poor, in the remotest parts of the state," he said."I can never forget the affection of the people of Haripura, who took me through an elaborate procession on the same road as Netaji Bose was taken, in 1938. His procession included a decorated chariot drawn by 51 bullocks. I also visited the place where Netaji stayed in Haripura," he added.The ideals of Bose inspired us to work towards making India a strong and self-reliant nation, he said, adding that this vision of the country is what the freedom fighter would have been proud of. "May the thoughts and ideals of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose keep inspiring us to work towards building an India that he would be proud of…a strong, confident and self-reliant India, whose human-centric approach contributes to a better planet in the years to come,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parakram-diwas-pm-modi-pays-tribute-of-netaji-on-eve-of-his-jayanti-101611337213317.html
23-01-2021||India||Strategically important Ujh hydroelectric project in J&K gets forest panel nod||The Ujh Multipurpose Hydro Electric Project in Jammu and Kashmir, a project of strategic importance, has got the green nod from the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) according to the minutes of FAC meeting published earlier in the week.The project will involve the loss of about 680ha of forest land with a large share—609.1ha—in Billawar Forest Division, and over 200,000 trees according to project documents on environment ministry’s Parivesh website.The Ujh multipurpose project in Kathua district has been envisaged to utilise water from Ujh, a tributary of Ravi, which is one of the three eastern rivers of Indus Basin system. The project will involve the construction of a 116m-high concrete face rock-fill dam (CFRD) and power generation of about 186MW. The irrigation benefits will comprise annual irrigation to area of 31,380ha, besides providing 18.92 million cubic metres (MCM) of drinking water supply to the region.Also Read: Kashmir braces for fresh spell of snowfall; traffic to be disrupted“This project is of national importance, providing geo-political strategic advantage in form of much more effective use of water of Ujh river. This project will ameliorate the agricultural and power sectors in the otherwise barren Kandi area. It will also be a boon in the dry Kandi belt which is reeling under the peril of impending water crisis during dry season and also reduce the miseries of floods in the monsoons,” FAC stated in its minutes.The project will involve the displacement of around 8,648 persons and the gross area under submergence is likely to be 34.50sqkm. Documents on Parivesh website dated suggest that the FAC had noted that there was marked difference in the number of trees enumerated for felling which was 296,000 in the online proposal and 338,000 as confirmed by the field officers during the site visit.“Large number of trees are proposed to be felled due to the project. Every effort shall be made to ensure that trees are felled only when felling is unavoidable, and it shall be done in a phased manner. The Union Territory administration shall therefore also ensure that compensatory afforestation is taken up in the first year of the construction of the project, and adequate post-planting measures are taken to ensure healthy growth of regenerated forest,” the FAC noted in the minutes.The minutes also state that the resettlement and rehabilitation plan shall ensure that no rehabilitation is proposed over forest land. A copy of the resettlement plan shall be submitted by the user agency to the UT administration who will monitor to ensure that no project affected person occupies forest land, FAC said."Any rehabilitation and resettlement exercise should be preceded by determining whether the land acquisition in question will serve public purpose. This cannot be determined by a government agency or an expert committee. The FAC’s observations don’t indicate whether this has been discussed with the 9000 people who will be directly affected by the project," said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research."It is critical that the forest diversion process be planned carefully and slowly for J&K as the central laws have been made applicable only recently, and there needs to be a much more considered view of prevailing rights. Else, large scale land use change and acquisition can result in social and environmental injustices," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strategically-important-ujh-hydroelectric-project-in-j-k-gets-forest-panel-nod-101611311984941.html
