He had also inaugurated the picture gallery consisting of portraits of freedom fighters, chairpersons of the Council and name plates of the current members.Looking at Savarkar’s portrait, the chief minister said, “He was a great freedom fighter and philosopher whose personality was a source of inspiration for every Indian.”Objecting to Savarkar’s portrait, the Congress lawmaker said, “It was an insult to the freedom fighters, who did not bow to atrocities of the British. They laid down their lives fighting for the freedom of the country.”He said the portrait should be removed and placed in the BJP office.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said there should be a debate on what Savarkar contributed to the freedom struggle.“All those who contributed to the freedom struggle should be honoured, but there are different kinds of allegations, documents and stories that raise question marks on his role in the freedom struggle,” Yadav said.BJP state unit spokesperson Chandramohan said, “The life and struggle of Savrakar is an inspiration for the people across the country. The Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders are indulging in politics to serve their vested political interests. Both the Congress and Samajwadi Party indulged in dynasty politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/savarkar-portrait-in-up-legislative-council-picture-gallery-sparks-row-101611166391053.html

20-01-2021||India||Ghaziabad court awards death penalty to man for toddler’s rape and murder||A Ghaziabad court on Wednesday awarded death penalty to a 30-year-old man for brutally raping and murdering a two-and-half-year-old daughter of his colleague on the night on October 19 last year, terming the case as “rarest of rare”.The court fast tracked the case and held the accused guilty on January 18 after a trial of about a month and pronounced quantum of punishment on Wednesday.The crime took place on the night of October 19, 2020 when convict Chandan Pandey, who is colleague of deceased girl’s father, went to her house and forcibly took away the child from her mother on the pretext of taking her to a nearby shop.After Pandey did not return till late night, the family began a search for her and also approached the police. Her mutilated body was found from near a drain near the transport department office in an industrial area on the afternoon of October 20, 2020.Pandey was nabbed thereafter.The prosecution said that the autopsy report confirmed eight external injuries on the victim including a broken hyoid bone and concluded rape and death due to asphyxia resulting after antemortem throttling.The court also relied upon the “last seen” theory besides the forensic test reports which confirmed that the DNA of the man was found on body of the victim girl.Mahendra Srivastava, Special Judge (POCSO Act), held Pandey guilty on January 18 and awarded him death penalty under the provisions of the Act on Wednesday. Pandey was also awarded life imprisonment section for murder and seven years imprisonment for destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code.“The man brutally raped the minor girl and also murdered her and hid the body near to a drain at scene of crime. The prosecution produced 10 witnesses while no one, including the family of the convict, turned up for his defence. We also produced witnesses including girl’s mother who confirmed that the man took away her daughter. One witness also saw Pandey taking away the girl on his shoulders near the scene of crime,” said Utkarsh Vats, special public prosecutor.The Ghaziabad police also procured a CCTV footage from a mobile shop which confirmed that Pandey between 8.50 pm to 8.55 pm was seen taking away the girl with him.The police filed the charge sheet in the case on December 16, 2020 and charges were framed on December 24, 2020 under sections of the POCSO Act and also under IPC sections 302, 201, 376(a), 376(ab).The girl’s father and Pandey were known to each other for about 10-12 years and worked at a same factory in Ghaziabad. At times, Pandey used to stay with the family and the girl also called him as “chacha” (uncle).“The court relied on several rulings and observed that the act also impacts society besides there is no possibility of revival of the convict. Besides, there was also a high level of brutality done with the deceased girl. Taking these into consideration, the court pronounced death penalty for the man,” Vats, added.Pandey is married and has two minor children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-court-awards-gives-death-penalty-to-man-for-toddler-s-rape-and-murder-101611163383964.html
20-01-2021||India||BJP has set an example of how a party can be a tool for social service: Nadda||As a political party whose “goal is to win elections and work tirelessly for the goodwill and betterment of the common people” the Bharatiya Janata Party has set an example of how a political party can “effectively work as a potent tool of social service and help people in times of need” said party president JP Nadda on Wednesday in a letter to the party cadre.Nadda who completed a year in office on Wednesday said the party cadre worked “tirelessly and with full devotion to work for mankind during the pandemic.” During the lockdown that was imposed to check the spread of the Covid-19, the party chief had set the task for workers to feed five families everyday apart from ensuring that basic necessities of those in need are met.While the opposition has targeted the government on several issues including the Citizenship Amendment Act and the recently passed farm laws, the BJP chief hit back claiming that the concerns raised by the opposition parties are “misleading”.“While on the one hand you work tirelessly and with full devotion to work for mankind during the coronavirus pandemic, on the other hand you effectively counter all the false propaganda and canards of the opposition against the Citizenship Amendment Act, farm sector reform laws. You also exposed before the people the false propaganda and fake campaign of the Congress and its allies on the China issue,” the letter reads.The BJP chief had a word of appreciation for the party workers in West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala where he said they have to work “under very adverse circumstances”.Nadda recounted the attack he faced during a rally in West Bengal when his convoy was pelted with stones and said, “When a person like me who is the national president of India’s largest political party and who is always covered with security personnel, had to face a murderous assault during daylight while on a visit to West Bengal, it can be well imagined how difficult it would be for a common BJP worker to work under such tough and demanding circumstances. In the past few years, more than 300 BJP workers and our supporters have been brutally murdered for being associated with and for working in West Bengal.”He also paid tribute to the party workers who were killed in Jammu and Kashmir. “They laid down their lives to strengthen democracy and to spread the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” he said. The BJP which is working to expand its footprint in the Kashmir Valley faced setbacks when as many as nine workers were killed between July and October last year. Nadda referred to the party’s performance in the district development council elections in the Union Territory where it won 75 seats as something that was made possible by “the sacrifice of party workers.”He also credited PM Modi for “putting the brakes on the coronavirus cases” and said, “...India reported the least death rate while our recovery rate kept on improving. Yet again in response to the call of the honourable Prime Minister our scientists weresuccessful in making two made in India vaccines, a feat which only 4 to 5 nations have been able to achieve.”Referring the party’s performance at various elections during the last year he said, “We have a strong, decisive and committed leader in our honourable Prime Minister. We also have a strong organisation and highly committed party workers whose strength and efficiency in electoral strategy no one can match.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-set-an-example-of-how-a-party-can-be-a-tool-for-social-service-nadda-101611162918182.html

20-01-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses to entertain plea against fake godmen||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to act on a petition seeking action against fake babas in the country and said that if such self-styled godmen have already been convicted in criminal cases, that is sufficient reason for people to avoid going to them.The petition styled as a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by a Secunderabad resident Dumpala Ramreddy who was upset over his daughter being kept in an ashram run by a self-styled godman based in Delhi. During efforts to rescue her from the ashram named Adhyatmika Vidyalaya run by one Veerendra Dev Dixit in Rohini, the petitioner stumbled upon a list of fake ashrams released by the apex body of sages – Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad.This list contained names of 17 fake godmen and their institutions which included the likes of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Dera Sacha Sauda, Radhey Ma, Nirmal Baba, Rampal, Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai. The list also included the name of Dixit, with whom the petitioner was concerned.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy who represented the petitioner informed the Court that it should direct the Centre to verify the details of the list supplied by Akhada Parishad and order closure of the ashrams run by these fake godmen.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) AS Bobde said, “We are not disrespecting the Akhara Parishad. But how does the Court get to know who is a fake baba. This list is prepared by the Akhada on its own. We don’t know whether they have some animus with these persons.”Guruswamy told the Court to consider the fact that criminal cases have been filed against most of these persons named in the list. In some cases, the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing serious charges of misappropriation of funds, crimes of rape and murder.“This gives all the more reason that people should not go to them. Why do you want the Supreme Court’s imprimatur on them,” observed the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.As a last resort, the Court allowed the petition to be converted into a representation to the authorities in the Central government. “If the Union government thinks your problem is genuine, they will act on your representation,” noted the bench.On July 8 last year, the petition first came up for hearing before the Court when the bench agreed to consider it and allowed a copy of the petition to be supplied to the Solicitor General. On Wednesday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared in the case and opposed the petition. Mehta said, “The petitioner has already filed a petition of habeas corpus to rescue his daughter before the Delhi High Court. Their concern can be addressed there. We are opposing the prayer made in this petition.”Guruswamy requested to withdraw the petition which the bench accepted. In addition to verifying details about fake babas named by Akhada Parishad, the petition made several prayers which included vacating the ashrams run by these self-styled godmen and closing down ashrams other than those in the list where it is found that the people running them have criminal records. The petition also urged the Court to frame guidelines with regard to setting up of Ashrams and spiritual centres across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-fake-godmen-101611158375645.html

Investigation is underway," said circle officer BP Tripathi.In the videos, posted by some people on social media, a group of men are seen demolishing a recently renovated public toilet inside a roadways bus stand. They used iron rods, hammers to demolish the structure and raised religious slogans.Sources said a few activists of the same group had warned the roadways officials two days before to remove the toilet constructed near a temple and had claimed that if it wasn't done, they would do so themselves.Bimla, the caretaker of the toilet complex, claimed that urinals had been there for decades, and nobody objected to it ever. She said that a drain flows between the wall of the temple and toilet complex and it was wrong to say that it was next to the temple wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-file-fir-against-8-for-demolishing-toilet-near-temple-in-saharanpur-101611161104162.html

The villagers found her remains in the forest, 300 metres from Barangal village.Kheema Nand Balodi, the village head said, “Her torch was lying at the main door.

We have been permitted to tranquilize and cage the leopard first. In the condition of failing to catch the leopard, then we have been instructed to shoot it.”This leopard has previously attacked three women, including two in Almora and one in neighbouring Pauri Garhwal district. After these attacks, furious locals demanded that the leopard be shot.There has been a rise in leopard attacks in Uttarakhand recently. On December 1, a 65-year-old man was killed by a leopard in Chamoli district. In the first week of November, a 21-year-old woman was killed in a leopard attack in Champawat district.

The saffron party, however, bagged the district’s Hooghly Lok Sabha seat. One EVM can record up to 2,000 votes.“The TMC pressured district officials not to count the votes in 16 machines. Otherwise, the BJP would have won the Arambagh seat. But we are surging ahead in the district. A number of TMC legislators will join us because they cannot work for the people if they stay in the ruling party,” Adhikari said at a rally at Mankundu in Hooghly district.He raised the allegation hours before Chief Election Commissioner of India Sunil Arora arrived in Kolkata with his entire team to review ground situation before the assembly polls due in March-April.Reacting to the allegation, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Adhikari is making random allegations. If such a malpractice took place, why didn’t he speak up one year ago?”The TMC lost a prominent legislator on Wednesday when Arindam Bhattacharya, who represents the Shantipur assembly seat in Nadia district, joined the BJP in Delhi.Bhattacharya, 40, an international trade lawyer and social entrepreneur who studied in foreign universities, won the seat on a Congress ticket in 2016 but joined the TMC a year later. He was earlier a president of the Bengal youth Congress. “I left my career to join politics because I wanted to work for the people. But there has been no progress, no industrialization and no employment generation during the TMC regime,” said Bhattacharya.Ranjan Banerjee, senior vice-president of a nationally known industrial group, also joined the BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday.At the rally, Adhikari brought charges of corruption against the TMC, saying it was running sand and coal smuggling operations. He also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of telling lies to the people and running the Centre’s welfare schemes by changing their names in Bengal.“It is essential that the same party rules the nation and Bengal. Unless you (voters) drive out the TMC people won’t get jobs. This government has kept appointments by the school service commission on hold for years. There is no industrial growth but you see only hefty expenses being made on annual investment summits,” said Adhikari.He also appealed to Left voters to support the BJP in the interest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-accuses-tmc-of-malpractice-in-2019-lok-sabha-polls-101611157979316.html

The central government should take appropriate steps to avoid such tensions,” he said.Deshmukh said that the Uttar Pradesh police had sought permission from them for the investigation in Mumbai in three cases lodged against Tandav.“They had sought our permission for the investigation and it is a routine process to visit other states in relation to the investigation. Even teams of Maharashtra police keep visiting other states for investigation,” he said.Several FIRs have been filed against the web series for allegedly inappropriate depiction of Hindu deities.

We did not intend to hurt or offend the sentiments of any individual, caste, community, race, religion or religious beliefs or insult or outrage any institution, political party or person, living or dead.

We thank the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for the guidance & support in the matter.

20-01-2021||India||BJP a threat to nation’s unity: NCP supremo Sharad Pawar||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is a serious threat to the unity of the nation, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar who is in Goa as part of a Parliamentary Committee visit, said Wednesday.Addressing a press conference at the state party headquarters in Panaji, Pawar cited the Centre’s “communal politics” as well as the government’s lack of sympathy for the protesting farmers' demands to press his case.“By and large we are seeing throughout India that the BJP is a serious threat to the unity of this nation,” Pawar began.“I'm a member of Parliament. He (pointing to Churchill Alemao, Goa’s lone NCP legislator) is a member of the legislative assembly. We got every right to follow our religion, our thinking. There are no two ways about that. But we also should not forget that we are elected representatives. When we are elected representatives we belong to all sections of voters… we represent each and every individual. But being an elected representative (if) I become head of a religious section or temple or any other thing, I think I'm going away from my commitment to the masses,” Pawar said.He also accused the Central government of ignoring the plight of the farmers who are agitating on the borders of Delhi for the repeal of three controversial farm laws.“India is an agricultural rich nation. Now for more than 50 days the whole country and those outside the country are also watching poor farmers sitting in such a cold atmosphere on the streets of Delhi or somewhat near to Delhi. They have certain issues, but I don't see any sympathy being shown by the government of India. They might have held some discussion but that discussion has no meaning. So where the 65% of the population is dependent on the agriculture sector and that sector is fighting for their genuine demand for the last practically more than 50-55 days that shows the total approach of the BJP,” Pawar said.“We have given our support to the Kisan Andolan some time back. I have said that the Government should hold discussions with them and resolve the issue. They have been sitting there for so many days and for the government to ignore them is wrong,” Pawar said.Pawar was visiting Goa to hold meetings with Defence Establishments located in Goa and Karwar in Karnataka including with the Indian Navy, the Coast Guard and the Goa Shipyard Ltd and said he was initially reluctant to hold party programmes during what was a non-partisan visit but later relented on the request of his party’s local unit.The NCP chief said that his party was looking to form an anti-BJP alliance ahead of the Goa assembly election early next year.“In Goa we have not taken any final decision. But within our party there is definitely a thinking that in the Vidhan Sabha election in Goa we should contest as an alliance of NCP, Congress, Goa Forward and some other like minded parties. We have not yet discussed, but within our party there is a discussion [that]... if possible we will contest the election as a front to provide a viable alternative to BJP and a stable government to Goa,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-a-threat-to-nation-s-unity-ncp-supremo-sharad-pawar-101611156436895.html

In the coming days, we will enlist more eligible youth in the scheme to help them become economically independent,” said chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal during the ceremonial launch of the scheme in Guwahati.To claim benefit of the scheme, the applicants will have to be below 40 years of age, must have passed Class X and should be part of existing self-help groups (SHGs).According to state finance and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Re-SVAYEM is the biggest self-employment programme launched by any government in Assam since independence.“This scheme is aimed at providing working capital support to enterprising individuals and groups to undertake new activities or expanding existing enterprises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-launches-self-employment-scheme-of-rs-1000-crore-to-help-2-lakh-youth-101611155008571.html

However, reports of an infiltration bid being foiled and three militants killed are not true,” he said.A police officer in Akhnoor also substantiated the army’s claims and said that four soldiers were injured in a ceasefire violation when a two-inch mortar from across the Line of Control (LoC) exploded near them. “Our soldiers also retaliated to the enemy fire,” he said.The officer also said that he had no reports with him of a major infiltration bid being foiled and three militants killed in the firefight.“Since no bodies have been recovered, how could we say that three militants have been gunned down?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-soldiers-injured-in-pak-shelling-in-akhnoor-but-no-infiltration-bid-army-101611154593621.html

20-01-2021||India||Centre proposes to suspend farm laws for 1.5 years, next meeting on January 22||The 10th meeting between the Centre and protesting farmers resulted in what can be termed as a breakthrough in the ongoing impasse, as the Centre has proposed to suspend the three contentious farm laws for 1.5 to two years. The farmers, however, want a complete withdrawal of the laws as a mere suspension of the laws for some period of time will not bring about any change, farmer leaders said on Wednesday after the 10th round of talks concluded. The next round of meeting will be held on January 22.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, however, is hopeful of a resolution in the next meeting. "I am happy that farmer unions have taken our proposal seriously and said that they would consider it tomorrow and consider their decision on January 22. I feel that the talks are progressing in the right direction and there is a possibility of finding a resolution soon," he said."Talks were held in a cordial atmosphere despite some 'naram-garam' moments," the minister said adding that it will be a victory for Indian democracy the day the protest ends.Click here for live updates of farmers' protestHere is where the farmers' protest stands now:1. This is for the first time the government has offered keep the farm laws suspended for 1.5 to 2 years. What the Centre conveyed earlier was contrary to this spirit. Union ministers had earlier urged farmers to let the laws be implemented for a few years and then decided.2. The apex court, on the other hand, mentioned staying the implementation of the laws until the stalemate gets resolved several times and in its last verdict it stayed the laws.3. The government on Wednesday once again offered to amend the laws as the 10th round of meeting started. The leaders stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the laws and alleged that the Centre was avoiding discussion on a legal guarantee for MSP.4. In the first two sessions of the day, there was no breakthrough as the discussion went on the beaten track of amending the laws.5. Then the centre proposed to keep the three farm laws suspended for a fixed time period of one year or so and form a committee comprising of farmer union leaders and government representatives.6. The ministers proposed that the laws would remain suspended till the committee gives its report and urged farmer unions to suspend their agitation till that time.7. Farmer leaders, however, did not consider this as any breakthrough. But some unions said a final decision would be taken after their own internal consultations on Thursday.8. The Supreme Court committee, set up to find a solution to the impasse, held its first meeting on Tuesday. It will start meeting various stakeholders from Thursday. It has been given a deadline of two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-major-breakthrough-centre-proposes-to-suspend-laws-for-2-years-next-meeting-on-january-22-101611152130487.html

The company operates oil and gas drilling sites in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.In the video, Kumar and Gogoi stated that they had been abducted by ULFA-I and Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and appealed to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to get them released.“I have been abducted by NSCN-IM and ULFA-I due to their issues with my company and held hostage for a month. I appeal to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to talk with Assam CM and ensure my release,” Kumar says in the video.“Even after a month of our abduction, our company hasn’t initiated any measures to secure our release. I request the company to talk to both ULFA-I and NSCN-IM for my release. I appeal to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to save the life of a fellow Assamese,” Gogoi said in Assamese.On January 12, ULFA-I commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told local TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a ‘victim’ if the company did not pay the outfit its ‘due share’ for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region.Baruah added that Gogoi who is an Assamese will not be harmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebels-release-video-sos-of-2-oil-firm-workers-kidnapped-in-arunachal-pradesh-101611151644892.html

20-01-2021||India||India, Singapore sign pact on submarine rescue support||India and Singapore on Wednesday signed an implementing agreement on submarine rescue support and cooperation between their navies during the 5th Defence Minister’s Dialogue held over video conference, a joint statement said.The signing of an implementing agreement is very significant between two submarine operating navies, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd).“We have had a growing defence relationship with several ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members and naval cooperation between Singapore and India goes back to the early 1990s. Cooperation in submarine rescue enables sharing of resources and expertise and much faster response should an accident happen. It is cost-effective and, importantly, time-effective when time is the most critical factor,” Shrikhande said.In another move to deepen military cooperation, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Singaporean counterpart Ng Eng Hen expressed their support to the early conclusion of agreements to facilitate live firing drills and to establish reciprocal arrangements for the cross-attendance of military courses.“Defence and security engagements between India and Singapore have broadened significantly in scale and scope across all three services of the armed forces as well as in the areas of defence technology and industry,” the statement said. The talks covered initiatives to enhance bilateral defence cooperation including the implementing agreement on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) cooperation in August 2020 for the two militaries to have closer operational collaboration in response to disasters.The cyber agencies of the two militaries have also deepened their engagements, officials said.During the virtual interaction, Singh complimented Singapore for the effectiveness of its pandemic mitigation measures and the contribution of that country’s armed forces in restricting the spread of Covid-19. He also highlighted the role of the Indian military in combating the pandemic and missions undertaken to repatriate Indians stranded abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-singapore-sign-pact-on-submarine-rescue-support-101611149679852.html

On January 7 he sent a complaint to the chief secretary saying officials misbehaved with him and threatened to implicate him in the case. We condemn this irresponsible attitude,” said the CM while replying to a question by ruling party legislator V Joy.He said central agencies cannot intimidate government officials and demoralise them. Vijayan said the state was keen to ensure that there is no repeat of such incidents and it was duty-bound to protect its officials. “We can’t tolerate such indecent and immature behaviour” he said.The government had earlier raised a similar allegation against the Enforcement Directorate. Vijayan even wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to rein in central agencies alleging they were tarnishing the image of the government.The Customs denied the CM’s allegations. “We cannot conduct our investigation as per the directive of the state government. We have recorded all questioning sessions. These allegations are aimed at obstructing the ongoing investigation into the gold smuggling case,” said a senior official of the Customs.He said the Customs was yet to give a clean chit to state minister K T Jaleel and it will summon Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan next week.After the gold smuggling case surfaced in July, there were reports linking the main accused Swapna Suresh with the Speaker. He later acknowledged that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and attended some functions on her invitation. But opposition Congress and BJP leaders alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to West Asian countries.They also alleged the accused smuggled US dollars to the Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. The Speaker had denied these allegations and said he was ready for any probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-agencies-threatening-our-officials-says-kerala-cm-customs-deny-charge-101611148511257.html
20-01-2021||India||V K Sasikala taken to Bengaluru hospital after complaints of fever, breathing difficulty||With a week left for her release from Bengaluru prison, V K Sasikala on Wednesday has been taken to Bengaluru, after she suddenly complained of difficulty in breathing and fever. She has been taken to the Bowring and Lady Curzon government hospital in Bengaluru from the central prison, according to the news agency ANI.Sasikala, a close confidante of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalitha, was arrested in 2017 after the Supreme Court of India pronounced her term in a two-decade-old disproportionate assets case.After serving her term in the prison for more than four years and a fine of ₹10 crore was paid, Sasikala was set for release from the prison on January 27, 2021, according to her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian, who confirmed the news on Tuesday. He also said that Bengaluru prison authorities have confirmed the same to him.Also read: Sasikala to be released from jail on January 27“She has been having intermittent fever for the past week. Doctors in the prison have been treating her for the same. Since morning today, her oxygen level has been observed to be low. She will be taken to the hospital and would return back to the prison,” he said while talking with a Tamil TV news station on Wednesday.When asked if fever and drop in oxygen levels are symptoms of the Covid-19 disease, Pandian said doctors haven’t confirmed it, though she might be also tested for coronavirus infection while at the hospital.He also denied possibilities of her medical condition impacting her release from the prison. “On January 27, 2021, at 10am she will be released as I have already said. We have got an official letter regarding the matter and there are no changes in it. Until she is in the prison, her protection and medical complaints would be attended by the prison authorities,” he added.Tamil Nadu assembly elections are only months away and Sasikala’s return at such a time was highly anticipated. However, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami during his visit to Delhi on Tuesday ruled out all chances of her joining or leading the AIADMK party. “There is no chance of her joining. She is not in the AIADMK party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/v-k-sasikala-taken-to-bengaluru-hospital-after-she-complains-of-fever-101611148047171.html

BJP members of Parliament Arjun Singh and Locket Chatterjee were also present at the rally.A section of TMC workers had raised the slogan at a roadshow in south Kolkata on Tuesday afternoon.“TMC workers should not have uttered it but the BJP has proved once again that it believes in the culture of violence in letter and spirit,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya tried to make a distinction between the slogans chanted by his party and the opposition Trinamool.“Our party does not endorse it at all. People carrying the BJP flag cannot talk like that. However, one must understand that when we talk of traitors of India we mean mercenaries and terrorists who kill innocent citizens and pose a threat to the nation. The intention of the TMC workers was quite different because they talked of traitors of Bengal,” he told the media in Kolkata.The incendiary slogan first made headlines when it was chanted by BJP leaders in rallies in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act amid nationwide protests against it. Union minister Anurag Thakur had raised the slogan last January against CAA protesters in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goli-maaro-slogan-for-2nd-day-in-bengal-this-time-at-bjp-rally-101611148087795.html
20-01-2021||India||Govt offers to amend farm laws; Farmer leaders insist on repeal||The government on Wednesday offered to amend the three contentious farm laws at their 10th round of talks with protesting unions but farmer leaders stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the Acts and alleged that the Centre was avoiding discussion on a legal guarantee for MSP.Farmer leaders said there was no breakthrough in the first two sessions as both sides were stuck on their stated positions vis-a-vis the three farm laws and there was little hope of any outcome other than fixing the date for the 11th round.Sources also said the government proposed to keep the three farm laws suspended for a fixed time period of one year or so and form a committee comprising of farmer union leaders and government representatives.The ministers proposed that the laws would remain suspended till the committee gives its report and urged farmer unions to suspend their agitation till that time, sources added.The proposal, however, did not find any support from the farm leaders.The laws have already been stayed till further orders by the Supreme Court, which has formed a committee to resolve the deadlock. The committee, which had its first meeting on Tuesday, has been asked to give its report in two months.Farmer leaders also raised the issue of NIA notices being served to some farmers, alleging it was being done just to harass those supporting the agitation, to which the government representatives said they will look into the matter.The two sides took a break after around one hour of discussions when farmer leaders had langar food.During the break, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) general secretary Yudhvir Singh told PTI, "The stalemate is continuing over the three laws and I don't think any solution will emerge from today's meeting. Both sides are adamant on their position."He said the government is insisting on first discussing the three laws and wants to take up the MSP (Minimum Support Price) matter later."We will insist on a discussion on MSP after the tea break and also try to seek the next date for meeting before January 26," Singh said.Another farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said, "The government is not ready to repeal the three laws and farmers are not ready for amendments. The government doesn't want to discuss MSP.""No solution will emerge from today's meeting. We will meet again on the next date," he said.Tikait also said the union leaders raised the NIA (National Investigation Agency) issue in the meeting, to which the ministers said they will look into it.The meeting began at around 2.45 pm with the three ministers greeting farmer leaders on the occasion of Gurupurab. The meeting resumed at around 5.15 pm after a lunch break, but the two sides took another break at around 6 pm.During the second break, farmer leader Kavitha Kuruganti said the meeting began with the NIA issue, followed by unions' demand for a repeal of the laws.The farmer leaders presented multiple Parliament replies given by the agriculture minister where he had stated that agriculture is a state subject, while one reply mentioned even agri-marketing as a state subject.She said the discussion did not appear progressing anywhere."The government offered to carry out some amendments, but farmer leaders maintained they do not want anything less than a complete repeal of the laws," Tikait said.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding the talks with the representatives of around 40 farmer unions at the Vigyan Bhawan here.Before the meeting, the three ministers also met senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.The tenth round of talks was initially scheduled on January 19, but later got postponed to Wednesday.In the last round of talks, the government had asked protesting farmers to prepare a concrete proposal about their objections and suggestions on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting to end the long-running protest. But, unions stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws. Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati are the other three members on the panel.On Tuesday, the SC panel held its first meeting in the national capital.Under attack from protesting unions for their "pro-government" public stand on three contentious farm laws, the members of the committee said that they would keep aside their own ideology and views while consulting various stakeholders, even as they indicated a complete repeal won't augur well for much-needed agriculture reforms.Earlier in the day, a group of farm union leaders met top officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police to discuss the route and arrangements for their tractor rally on January 26 to protest against the three farm laws.But the unions rejected a suggestion by police officers to hold their rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway instead of Delhi's Outer Ring Road, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-offers-to-amend-farm-laws-farmer-leaders-insist-on-repeal-101611147502412.html
20-01-2021||India||Kerala, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh add more bird flu deaths amid second wave||There appears to be a second wave of bird flu hitting Indian states with fresh cases of the disease reported from Kerala and suspected cases from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.The first case of bird flu was reported from Jhalawar in Rajasthan on December 29 and slowly the virus, deadly for birds but not humans, spread to 10 other states, resulting in the deaths of thousands of birds. The animal husbandry departments of state governments have culled lakhs of birds to prevent the spread of the disease.On Wednesday, Kerala was put on high alert after fresh cases of bird flu were reported from Alappuzha, said the state animal husbandry department, following the Bhopal based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases confirming presence of the virus in at least 300 samples.The officials said the culling of birds will begin on Thursday and in the first phase 5000, mostly ducks, will be destroyed. In January first week at least 80,000 ducks and 10,000 chickens were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts and the Centre had rushed a high-level team to the state. The state government had announced ₹100 per bird to compensate poultry farmers.Fresh cases were reported a few days after the state made a claim that the flu was localised and contained effectively. The animal husbandry department has called an emergency meeting in the evening to review the situation. Later experts had identified the latest virus strain H5N8 and said it was less pathogenic when compared to H5N5 detected in the area in 2016.In Chhattisgarh, at least 45 mynas were found dead near a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in Bijapur district of Bastar region, officials said on Wednesday. Samples of five mynas have been sent for avian influenza tests, they said.“There is a CRPF camp in Naimad area where the carcasses of the birds were found on Monday and Tuesday. We rushed to the spot and sent five dead birds for tests on Tuesday evening,” said AP Dohare, Deputy Director of Veterinary Services.He said that no signs of bird flu have been found in the domestic birds of the district but precautions are being taken. Till now, Bijapur has not reported any bird flu cases but transportation of poultry birds and products to the district has been stopped. In Chhattisgarh, the first confirmed bird flu case was reported from poultry in Balod district on January 14. On Monday, bird flu was reported in two more districts, Bastar and Dantewada, which comes under Bastar region which is a thickly forested area of Chhattisgarh.In Jharkhand, around 200 pigeons were found dead in Hazaribagh and authorities have rushed teams there. The local villagers said that they had buried the carcasses of birds themselves as the district animal husbandry department officials did not respond, a charge denied by officials.“We have sent teams to take samples,” a department official said. The department has so far sent 4,300 samples of birds from across the state to a Kolkata lab for bird flu testing but no deaths because of the virus has been confirmed yet.Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds. It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say. There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say. According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans. Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-jharkhand-and-chhattisgarh-add-more-bird-flu-deaths-amid-second-wave-101611145835299.html

The DDC elections took place soon after the PAGD was formed. No one denies that there could have been shortcomings in the PAGD but they could have been rectified from within and not from the outside," Tarigami said.He also said the PAGD leadership will be meeting soon to discuss pressing matters. "We need to broaden the base of the alliance by including more people and groups as we have not reached a significant section of people in J&K and Ladakh. We alone can’t fight it and need more people and groups as part of the alliance."Awami National Conference vice president, Muzaffar Shah who is also senior member of PAGD said that the alliance came into being for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A and that Lone was wrong to quit."Elections are a minor thing. If Lone took a decision it was his choice but to me his decision was wrong. PAGD is much stronger even today. All three regions are together for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35 A. The matter is in court. Our case in the court is water tight. Let the court begin its hearing and you will see what PAGD will do. Our job is to get the crown back," said Shah who is a nephew of Farooq Abdullah.He said that it is the Centre’s effort to weaken the PAGD’s fight for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. "Our minor issues will not weaken our major resolve."On Tuesday, Lone wrote to PAGD chairperson and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah saying that the Peoples’ Conference decided to part ways with the PAGD over the issue of fielding of proxy candidates by constituent parties against the officially mandated candidates of the alliance during DDC elections.“No party is willing to cede space; no party is willing to sacrifice. We fought against each other in Kashmir province not against the perpetrators of August 5 (2019). And those who perpetrated August 5 and their minions are now vocally gleeful. It is difficult for us to stay on and pretend as if nothing has happened,” Lone wrote.“Trust between allying partners who have been rivals all along can be very elusive and extremely fragile. Proxies have made it perpetually elusive. This alliance needed sacrifice,” he said.The PAGD was formed on October 20, 2020 after six political parties, some of them rivals, – National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, CPI (M), Awami National Conference, Peoples’ Conference and Peoples’ Movement came together to fight for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution that was revoked by the Centre on August 5, 2019.Sources said Lone's exit from the PAGD could give his party a chance to head the chairmanship of two DDC councils in Kupwara and Baramulla districts. The Peoples’ Conference leadership was already eyeing those two districts in north Kashmir which it considers as its bastion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-alliance-puts-up-brave-face-after-sajjad-lone-s-exit-101611145770151.html
20-01-2021||India||'Obviously': Minister on whether beneficiaries were aware of Covaxin fine print||Defying detractors on social media who are raising questions over the transparency of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin as the company released a fact sheet after the emergency vaccination drive began in the country, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday took to social media and said it was quite obvious that beneficiaries were made aware of all the conditions. Thinking that they were not made aware, on the contrary, is as "naive and presumptuous as boorish", the minister wrote on her Twitter handle answering to a question."It's OBVIOUS, Govt advisory shared on social media is made available at ground level first," the health minister wrote.'Advisable to not take vaccine if...': Bharat Biotech issues Covaxin fact sheetClearly as naive & presumptuous as boorish!It's OBVIOUS, Govt advisory shared on social media is made available at ground level first.It is evident your propensity for unfruitful discourse has no bounds, no point in expecting you to focus your energy on anything constructive. https://t.co/KedVYNJO7dOn January 3, the Drug Control General of India gave emergency-use authorisation to Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. The nod for Covaxin was in clinical mode trial wich specified that beneficiaries will have to sign a consent form before vaccination and they will also be monitored.The Centre sent a detailed fact sheet of both the vaccines to all states. The consent form for Covaxin also became public on January 16, the day the vaccination drive began in India.On January 19, Bharat Biotech on its website uploaded a fact sheet which says if a person has allergies, fever or bleeding disorder or in on a blood thinner, then it is not advisable for him or her to take the vaccine. Pregnant, lactating women, people suffering from immuno-compromised situation are also advised to take the vaccine.This led to another battle of barbs with several opposition leaders questioning whether the beneficiaries were aware of these terms and conditions.Terming this as fear-mongering and spreading misinformation, the health minister had slammed these "over-reactions" and clarified that these facts have been in the public domain.

Blinken, a career diplomat who served as deputy national security advisor and deputy secretary of state under former president Barack Obama, made the remarks during a hearing before the US Senate foreign relations committee to confirm him for the position. His remarks signalled that the Biden administration is likely to adopt an approach towards India and China that is largely on the lines of the position assumed by President Donald Trump, though experts have said president-elect Joe Biden is likely to be less confrontational than his predecessor. Also Read: How inauguration day 2021 will be the most unique in American history“As we look at China, there is no doubt that it poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the US in terms of our interests, the interests of the American people,” Blinken said in response to questions from senators. The US-China relationship includes “rising adversarial aspects”, some competitive aspects and some cooperative aspects when it is in the mutual interest of both countries to work together, he said. On India, Blinken adopted a position that has been trotted out by many senior American leaders in recent years – that the relationship with New Delhi has widespread bipartisan support in Washington, or backing from both the Republican and Democratic parties. “I think India has been very much been a bipartisan success story over successive administrations. It started...toward the end of the Clinton administration, after the nuclear tests when relations were put back on a better footing,” he said. “I think there are many ways in which we can deepen that cooperation to pursue the path that successive administrations have put us on,” he added. Blinken noted that Biden had, as a senator, led the efforts in the foreign relations committee to push through the India-US civil nuclear deal under then president George W Bush. “I think during the Obama administration, we deepened cooperation with India, particularly in the defence procurement area, also on information-sharing,” he said. The Trump administration had carried forward the cooperation, including “with this concept of an Indo-Pacific and to make sure that we were working with India so that no country in the region, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism”, Blinken said. One area with potential for greater collaboration is climate change, he said. India is poised to catch up to China in terms of the emissions over the next two or three decades, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a strong advocate of renewable energy and technologies, creating strong potential for jointly working in this area, he said. Blinken endorsed the tough stance taken by Trump towards China but said he differed on the methods adopted by the outgoing president in a number of areas. The US has to start by approaching China “from a position of strength, not weakness” and this has to be done by working with allies, leading international institutions, and standing up for values such as human rights in Xinjiang and the trampling of democracy in Hong Kong, he said. “I also believe President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China. I disagree very much with the way that he went about it in a number of areas but the basic principle was the right one and I think that’s actually helpful to our foreign policy,” he said. For decades, China had a policy of “hiding their hand and biding their time” in terms of asserting its interests beyond the country’s borders, but following the rise of President Xi Jinping, the “hiding and biding has gone away and they are much more assertive in making clear that they seek to become in effect the leading country in the world and sets the norms”, Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-bipartisan-success-story-biden-s-pick-for-secretary-of-state-101611144245730.html
20-01-2021||India||Goan guitarist rebuilds collection of rare guitars he lost in fire two years ago||What does one do when one loses an entire collection of rare and limited edition guitars -- many of them autographed by famous musicians painstakingly collected over the years?For Sebastian Almeida, a guitarist and avid country music lover, he overcame his deep disappointment and instead set about rebuilding his collection.Almeida, who is popularly known among friends and family as ‘Sabby’ lost a collection of 62 guitars in a fire that ravaged his studio in Socorro in North Goa. The wood paneled studio was reduced to ashes and took with it several limited edition guitars. Among those was a limited edition diamond studded 60th anniversary Stratocaster guitar made by Fender Music Instruments Corporation, USA. It was one among 1954 guitars that were made worldwide in 2014 to commemorate 60 years of the iconic Stratocaster guitar that first made its debut in 1954.Almeida also lost another limited edition guitar that had its metal parts including keys flats plated with 20 microns gold and which too had been released as part of a commemorative anniversary.Other guitars he lost included a Les Paul 120th anniversary edition as well as guitars autographed by singers like Charley Pride, an American Guitarist and Baseball player, the Bellamy Brothers and Keith Urban, an Australian singer and songwriter.“I had built my collection over three decades with the help of my friend who used to work at a guitar shop in Muscat (Oman) and every time a limited edition guitar was introduced he used to give me a heads up and ask me if I wanted one. It also included the very first guitar that was gifted to me by then girlfriend who is today my wife,” says Almeida who is in his mid-50s.“Each of the guitars would have cost ₹3-4 lakh in today’s market price. Not a trace of the guitars or the diamonds was found,” Almeida told HT.Almeida said he was initially heartbroken and didn’t hope to rebuild his collection.“Only about six guitars which were with me in my practise room did we manage to save and the rest were all destroyed. It was my friends who encouraged me to restart the collections and started keeping an eye out for rare guitars. I have also bought guitars from others who had rare guitars but were willing to sell since they needed the money,” Almeida said.“Some of the guitars in the collection are not replaceable as those musicians who signed them are no longer alive, but I will have others” he said.“If I have bought from a collector who was doing a distress sale especially a musician who was out of work during the pandemic I have told him that he can take it back at any time when things get better,” Almeida said.But for several other guitars he got more than what he bargained for. After hearing of his lost guitar collection, the Bellamy Brothers, a famous country music troupe in America, signed guitars and other paraphernalia to be included as part of his collection.Randy Hiebert, lead guitarist of Bellamy Brothers, posted another message: “Wow!!! I'm so blown away and honored by this my brother!!! Losing your entire collection was a heartbreaker for sure... but this, THIS is the way to heal it my friend! Beautiful display, thanks for the love Sabby!!”Almeida’s tryst with music began during his younger days. Born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, Almeida’s family moved back to Goa as part of the exodus of Goans from East Africa that coincided with the end of the British rule there and he went on to start and be part of several live music bands in Goa as well as in Muscat.The collection now boasts of an oil can guitar from South Africa, guitars signed by friends and well wishers as well as the autographed guitars that he is collecting through visits to live performances wherever he can.The collection now stands at 82 guitars, 20 more than what he last had when he lost it all in the fire. This time he hopes it is here to stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goan-guitarist-rebuilds-collection-of-rare-guitars-he-lost-in-fire-two-years-ago-101611142674887.html

The villagers burst firecrackers and distributed sweets on Wednesday while children held placards of Harris.“We feel proud as though India has won an Olympic gold medal,” said Vinod Pulavendran, a resident of the village and an employee of the Trichy airport. “It is common for Indians to become American citizens, but how often does an Indian become the vice president of the US? She has put us on the map,” he added.Joe Biden will take oath as the 46th President of the United States on January 20 and Harris will be the vice-president, becoming the first woman to hold the position besides being the first African-American woman and first person of Indian-origin to have achieved that.The Dharmasastha Temple in Thulasendhirapuram conducted a special pooja for Harris as her maternal grandfather PV Gopalan was born in this village and her family has been offering donations to the temple. Her late mother Shyamala Gopalan’s younger sister Dr Sarala Gopalan visited the temple last December soon after the results made it clear that Harris will be vice president.A placard in the temple bears the name of Kamala Harris. “We are planning to invite Kamala to the temple through her aunt,” said temple in-charge SV Ramanan.Ever since Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate, the village has been celebrating by conducting special poojas and erecting flex banners praising Harris.When the US presidential elections were held in November, local leaders here offered annadhanam (free food for the poor). They had offered idli-sambhar which Harris revealed is her favorite south Indian dish, relished during her childhood visits to Chennai with her mother who was born in the city and later moved to the US.“Her victory is a motivation for the entire village to dream of achieving something,” said Arulmozhi Sudhakar, a local village head of Thulasendhirapuram. “We hope she visits us as it is her roots.”Harris particularly struck a chord with Tamil people and her heritage when she called out to her ‘chithis’ (referring to a parent’s younger sister in Tamil) during her speech in August at the Democratic National Convention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-winning-olympic-gold-kamala-harris-village-gears-up-for-her-oath-taking-101611136405241.html
20-01-2021||India||Farm laws: SC irked over criticism of court-appointed committee members||Faced with criticism over the appointment of a four-member committee to hear farmers’ point of view on the validity of farm laws, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said there was no question of bias as the committee has not been given any adjudicatory powers.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was hearing an application moved by Bhartiya Kisan Party that demanded filling up of a vacancy in the committee due to the resignation of member Bhupinder Singh Mann. Advocate Ajay Chaudhary, representing this farmers’ union, argued that there was apprehension among the farmers based on the other members’ opinions in favour of the laws as reported in newspapers.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, issued a notice to the Centre on the application and said, “You can’t brand people like this and cast aspersions on Court.. . .We have serious objections on people whom we have appointed being called names and that this Court has interest in selecting them. We will decide on Constitutionality of the laws but we will not expose the members whom we appointed to such maligning based on public opinion decided by majority. “Chaudhary pointed out news clippings where committee members openly expressed their view in favour of the three farm laws—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.“Where is the question of bias when the Committee is not given any power to adjudicate. We have asked them to hear the grievances of farmers and give us a report.”Regarding Mann, the court said he had sought modifications to the farm laws.“You unthinkingly cast aspersions on people because they have expressed some opinion in the past and you think they are disqualified to sit in the Committee. This has become a culture of branding people whom you do not want and criticising them. The reputation of people we appointed has been torn to shreds. Public opinion is important but it is not determinative for the Court to decide.”The CJI said that the only interest of the court was to find a solution to the dispute and that’s why the Supreme Court on January 12 formed a committee of four experts. Mann resigned from the committee, leaving three others— Pramod Kumar Joshi, Ashok Gulati and Anil Ghanwat of Shetkeri Sangathana.“They are the most brilliant minds in the field of agriculture. Do you think they don’t understand the subject. Even the best of judges have given an opinion but have later delivered judgment taking an opposite view,” said the bench.Advocate Prashant Bhushan informed the court that the eight farmer unions he represented did not wish to appear before the committee. “We are convinced that these laws need to be repealed. We don’t want to discuss amendments. The unions are proposing a tractor rally on January 26 to peacefully protest.”The bench asked Bhushan about his absence on January 12 when it constituted the committee after taking consent of the farmers’ unions. It added that it was not its mandate to force the unions to go before the committee but asked Bhushan to counsel his clients to stop agitating and ensure Delhi citizens of complete peace.“In democracy, other than repeal, the power to set aside a law lies with the Court. We are seized of it. But we request you to stop the agitation,” the bench said.Attorney General KK Venugopal informed the court that 5,000 tractors are sought to be brought in that day. In this connection, even an application by Delhi Police was pending before Court seeking an injunction against holding of a tractor rally.The Supreme Court said, “These are matters purely in the domain of the executive. We consider it highly irregular and improper to disallow any rally or procession. It is for police to grant permission. You are the executive of the country. You are free to take any action.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested the court to keep the matter pending till January 25 in view of the situation’s development. The bench refused and asked police to withdraw its application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-sc-irked-over-criticism-of-court-appointed-committee-members-101611135544809.html

Hence, the number of complaints is higher than that of actual bird deaths.”As of now, Mumbai has reported two confirmed bird flu deaths. In the state, more than 6,000 birds have been culled but none in Mumbai yet.Also read | Bird flu spreads among poultry in 5 of 11 afflicted states despite cullingDeonar abattoir general manager, Dr Yogesh Shetye, said, “We have not undertaken culling of any bird because of bird flu yet. All deaths that are being reported in Mumbai are of crows, pigeons and other birds. However, no death of any chicken has been reported yet.”Since the outbreak of bird flu in the city, Byculla zoo authorities in Mumbai are on high alert as the zoo is home to over 200 exotic and aquatic birds.A zoo official said, “At Byculla zoo, there is no mingling of caged birds with migratory birds, and hence we have not reported any symptom of bird flu or any case.”The BMC’s market department is also conducting visits to retailers and wholesalers dealing in poultry since for two weeks now in order to create awareness about bird flu.Meanwhile, since the outbreak of bird flu, the demand for chicken has gone down by 5-15%, according to poultry sellers’ association in Maharashtra, while that of meat and sea food has risen, leading to price hike in these products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avian-flu-1-795-complaints-of-bird-deaths-in-mumbai-says-bmc-101611134464801.html

The driver of the car, 25-year-old S Amrut, has been booked under Section 304 (ii) (punishment for an act that is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death), of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), said police.CCTV footage shows that while the policemen, identified as B Raveendran, 32 and V Karthik, 34, were taking a right turn on their bike, the speeding black BMW, hit them, throwing them off the two-wheeler. The accident occurred near a private school in Chennai’s Mogappair East while the policemen were on their way to work in Koyambedu.Raveendran, who was riding the bike, died on the spot while Karthik, the pillion rider, succumbed to his injuries at a government hospital around 11am, police said.“It wasn’t a case of drunk driving,” said inspector Hari, who is attached to the Thirumangalam traffic investigation police station. Amrut and two of his friends, all in their early 20s, were in the BMW.“All of them, including the driver, are students who were returning home early morning from a birthday party. The driver was speeding and couldn’t control the car,” the inspector added.The driver has been remanded to two weeks’ judicial custody at the Saidapet jail.

20-01-2021||India||India Innovation Index ranking out, Karnataka retains top spot||Karnataka has maintained its top position among the major states category in Niti Aayog’s India Innovation Index ranking released on Wednesday, while Maharashtra has leapfrogged over Tamil Nadu to occupy the second place followed by Telangana, Kerala, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.Among Union Territories, and North-Eastern and hill states, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh occupy the top spots respectively.“As the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic this year, the significance of innovation is even more greatly felt. While innovation has always been pivotal for higher productivity and economic growth, it is also crucial for bolstering a post-crisis economy. In this light, the foresight of the Central government in fostering a culture of innovation through initiatives like the Atal Innovation Mission, Startup India, etc. is laudable,” Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said. “The second edition of the index will allow states to continue to evaluate their innovation environment and assess their progress. The division of innovation into two dimensions, namely innovation capabilities (Enablers) and innovation outcomes (Performance) will give the states a better perspective for identifying the critical focus areas.,” he added.The last edition of the India Innovation Index, released in October 2019, was a first-of-its-kind metric for assessing the innovation capabilities of Indian states and Union Territories.“Since then, India, and the world, have undergone a tectonic shift due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With the pandemic triggering an economic shutdown, the role of innovation to revitalise the economy, has never been more important,” the report said.The 2020 edition builds on the previous year’s methodology by introducing more metrics to provide a more holistic outlook of the Indian economy. The framework is updated to include globally considered parameters for measuring innovation, such as the percentage of GDP spent on research and development, while keeping them specific to the Indian economy, it noted.

Akbar will replace ambassador Raja Ali Ejaz, who is retiring in May. Ejaz, a career diplomat, has been Pakistan’s ambassador in Riyadh since January 2019. Akbar’s appointment on the “recommendation of the General Headquarters indicates military’s desire to take control of the bilateral ties that have lately been hit by turbulence to prevent them from further deterioration”, the influential Dawn newspaper reported. Also Read: Sena questions Centre over reports of China building village in ArunachalPakistan was perturbed by Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane’s recent visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia – the first by an Indian service chief to both West Asian countries. Experts have said the move by both countries was a signal regarding enhancing defence and security ties with India. Saudi Arabia has also sought the early repayment of a $3 billion loan, extended in 2018 to Pakistan to help the country tide over its economic problems, amid the Covid-19 crisis. Observers had pointed to this development as an indicator of the dip in ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The Pakistani ambassador’s position in Riyadh has often been held by retired military officers, reflecting the fact that defence ties form the bedrock of bilateral ties, the Dawn reported. Riyadh has become “closer to New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was invited to the key financial conference and the two countries launched a Strategic Partnership Council to guide their relations”, the report added. Retired Pakistani generals are appointed against a 20% quota for political appointees. Besides the mission in Riyadh, Pakistan’s envoys to Brunei, Jordan, Syria, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, the Maldives, Nigeria and Libya are also retired armed forces officers. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has rarely made political appointments to ambassadorial posts, and most of the quota for non-careerists is being taken up by retired military officials, the report said. Akbar had retired from the army last December, and his final appointment was chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factory at Wah. He also served as chief of general staff and commander of the Rawalpindi-based 10 Corps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-names-general-envoy-to-saudi-arabia-as-military-seeks-control-of-ties-101611132304512.html

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said that the country awaits a similar cross-border action against China as was ordered after Uri and Pulwama attacks originated from the Pakistani soil.NDTV has reported that China has built the new village of 101 homes about 4.5 km “within Indian territory of the de facto border” between the two countries, citing satellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US-based imaging company.Also read | Remember his promise: Rahul Gandhi targets PM over Chinese village in ArunachalThe Sena called the report shocking and concerning. It asked what was the strong government doing when the village was constructed. “What China did in Ladakh, now it is doing in Arunachal Pradesh. China has made a whole village inside Arunachal Pradesh. How did nobody come to know about this? If anyone makes a small house, the neighbours get to know about it. Here, a whole village has been built, with proper structures, and nobody came to know about it? All this did not come up in a night.”The editorial asked if the Centre will demolish the illegal structures inside India’s borders or will suffer silently. “Whenever there is illegal construction, officials of a local municipal corporation visit the site and demolish the structure. India has the right to keep aside international law and exercise this right to demolishing it. The question, however, is whether we will exercise this right or suffer the blow of Chinese shamelessness silently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-questions-centre-over-reports-of-china-building-village-in-arunachal-101611130030024.html

"The government has to make legislation on Minimum Support Price and repeal the three farm laws. Our protest is against the government and the corporate system," said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) which is spearheading the movement.Leaders of all 40 farm unions which are taking part in the protest will meet three cabinet ministers of the government for talks this afternoon in an effort to end the impasse.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also assured that the government will hear the proposal with an "open mind".Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are agitating against three farm laws enacted by the government in September last year. The central government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these laws will remain and have offered to make amendments into the law.The contentious farm laws are farmers are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the legislation till further orders.

The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal has confirmed the presence of the virus in at least 300 samples, said the department. Culling of birds will begin on Thursday with 5,000 birds, mostly ducks, in the first phase. In the first week of January, at least 80,000 ducks and 10,000 chickens were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts and the Centre had rushed a high-level team to the state.

20-01-2021||India||Maharashtra to launch counselling drive to improve Covid vaccination numbers||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state health department has decided to launch a information, education and communication (IEC) drive and go for the counselling of health care workers (HCW) to improve the Covid vaccination percentage among them. The decision has been taken after the second day of the vaccination drive saw a 10 per cent fall, down to 54 from 64 per cent on day one on January 16.The minister said the low turnout was due to the technical glitches witnessed in the Co-WIN app and because of the apprehension among the beneficiaries about the probable side effects of the vaccine.“I would not call the turnout low, as Maharashtra saw among the highest responses in the country on day one. It is true that all the HCWs enrolled are not coming up for the vaccination, but we should not go into the percentage of the turnout. To improve it further, I am releasing a video appealing to our HCWs to come forward and set an example for others about the drive. Ultimately, they are the message givers and idols for many,” he said.Tope said both the vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - are safe for use and there has been no incident of any major reaction after vaccination.“We still are facing technical problems with the Co-WIN app and some beneficiaries find their names cancelled after the initial enrolment. Second, the HCWs are still hesitant over safety and want to first gauge the efficacy for a few days of the drive. Because of these two reasons the turnout is not up to the mark,” Tope said.The minister said that there should not be any apprehension about Bharat Biotech Limited’s Covaxin as it has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India and ratified by the scientists as safe for use.The ministers were not participating in the drive, Tope said, as it’s against the set protocol of the vaccination. “First two phases are meant for HCWs and frontline workers and I would not break the rules set by the Centre. I would be the first person to go for it, when my turn comes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-launch-counselling-drive-to-improve-covid-vaccination-numbers-101611128258681.html

We are not going to pass the orders. You are the authority to take action," Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told the Centre.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for eight farm unions seeking to take out the tractor rally, told the court that the farmers have no intention to breach peace. However, Attorney General KK Venugopal argued, “5000 tractors are coming into the city. It certainly can't be maintained on roads. They will go everywhere. Bhushan is well intentioned that peace will be maintained. In Karnal, the farmers destroyed the pandal. There was a law and order situation and CM Haryana could not meet them. The police will take a call.”The court told the farmers to assure the citizens of Delhi of complete peace and told the Centre to ask authorities how the march can be peaceful. “These are matters purely in the domain of the executive,” the top court said.Later in the day, a group of farm union leaders will meet top officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police to discuss the route and arrangements for their tractor rally on January 26 to protest against the three farm laws, a union leader was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Slamming the criticism against the members of the panel it appointed to discuss the matter, the Supreme Court asked, “Where is the question of bias when the committee is not given any power of adjudication?” The top court also issued a notice to the Centre on an application by Bhartiya Kisan Party for filling up vacancy in the four-member Committee after Bhupinder Singh Mann of BKU recused himself from it.The top court had, on January 12, stayed the implementation of the three laws passed by Parliament in September. The farmers who have been protesting for 56 days now want a complete roll-back of the legislation, however, the government has ruled out that possibility and has offered to make amendments. .As nine rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have remained inconclusive, they will meet later this afternoon for the 10th round of talks in an effort to end the impasse over the three contentious agricultural laws enacted during the monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-for-police-to-decide-sc-refuses-to-rule-on-plea-against-farmers-proposed-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-centre-withdraws-plea-101611127531705.html
20-01-2021||India||Bhutan, Maldives first to benefit from India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’||Bhutan and the Maldives on Wednesday became the first countries in India’s neighbourhood to benefit from the government’s rollout of millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines under a grant assistance programme dubbed “Vaccine Maitri”. Two aircraft took off several hours apart, carrying 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccine for Thimphu and 100,000 doses for Male. The external affairs ministry had announced on Tuesday that India would begin providing doses as grant assistance to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles from Wednesday. India also plans to supply vaccines neighbouring and key partner countries such as Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, from which confirmation of regulatory clearances is awaited. “India fulfils commitment to give vaccines to humanity. Supplies to our neighbours will start on 20th January. The Pharmacy of the World will deliver to overcome the COVID challenge,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted regarding the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative. With the shipping of supplies to Bhutan and the Maldives, India also became the first country to provide South Asian nations with vaccines as aid. This comes against the backdrop of three meetings held by China with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since July last year to discuss Covid-19 cooperation. Supplies of two million doses of Covishield to be provided to Bangladesh as aid will begin from Thursday, and a formal announcement about supplies to Nepal is expected on Wednesday. Bhutan Prime Minister Lotay Tshering had earlier congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the launch of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive and said he hoped it would come as an “answer to pacify all the sufferings we have endured [during] this pandemic”. According to a statement from the Bhutan Prime Minister’s Office, Thimphu plans to stockpile vaccines, including the 150,000 doses from India, and carry out the first round of vaccinations for all citizens within a week. Bhutan’s the nationwide vaccination programme will be rolled out “only when we have sufficient doses for all the targeted population”, the statement said. “We are well on track with health facilities and human resource planning. That time, movement of people will be stopped for one week. The second dose of the vaccine will be administered in the same arrangement four weeks after the first dose,” it added. Also Read: India ‘deeply honoured’ to meet the world’s healthcare needs: PM ModiWith a targeted vaccine population of more than 533,000, Bhutan needs around 1.2 million doses. The Prime Minister’s Office also said the vaccination drive will be rolled out after an “inauspicious month” between February 14 and March 13. However, it said this wait will help Bhutan learn from “experiences, possible side effects and lessons” of other countries that have rolled out vaccination programmes. India had earlier provided essential medicines and medical supplies, including paracetamol, hydroxychloroquine and PPEs worth more than ₹2.8 crore to Bhutan. It also expedited the release of ₹501 crore for priority projects to counter challenges brought on by the pandemic. The Maldives’ government has reciprocated India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy with its own “India First” policy. During a visit to Male last November, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had said India will accord priority to the Maldives for providing vaccines. In September 2020, India provided urgent financial aid worth $250 million to the Maldives through investment government bonds by the State Bank of India. This was the first aid package of such magnitude announced by India for any country to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhutan-maldives-first-to-benefit-from-india-s-vaccine-maitri-101611127804320.html

20-01-2021||India||Manipur’s women market’s closure may have wiped off ₹3,879 cr: Researcher||The shutting down of Nupi Keithel, one of Asia’s largest all women run markets, located in Manipur’s state capital, might have caused a minimum loss of ₹3,879 crore to vendors in the last about 10 months, an independent social researcher in Imphal claimed.Researcher Serto Tondana Kom, who came up with the figure, said that the estimation required calculating the numbers of closure days and license holding women vendors at the Nupi Keithel, along with the loss of average per day establishment profit, based on available official data .The Manipur government announced the closure of Nupi Keithel-- which has three different market sheds, namely Purana Keithel, Laxmi Keithel and New market—on March 21, 2020, as a preventive measure amid the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. The market has since remained closed for a total of 304 days till January 19.As per Manipur economic census reports of the Economics & Statistics department, the state has two types of economic activities - agricultural and non-agricultural, Serto said. A total of 50,435 workers are engaged in agriculture, and 406,755 in non-agricultural activities. Similarly, 151,330 residents are into retail trade, of which, 52,966 are women who run the retail business, he said.The state domestic product for 2019-20 is said to be ₹194,840 lakhs as per the economic census reports and it indicates that the average daily state domestic product is ₹353.There are 6,522 license holding vendors under Imphal Municipal Corporation. Out of them, 3,614 license holding women vendors sit at Nupi Keithel (1,690 at Purana Keithel, 1,196 at New Market and 728 at Laxmi Keithel) in Imphal city.Assuming that each woman vendor earns ₹353 per day, the 3,614 vendors lose ₹1275,742 in a day and ₹3879 crores in the last 304 days, he claimed.Expressing serious concern over the loss, the researcher urged the state government to aid the women vendors like the financial assistance provided to the state residents who were stranded and stuck outside the state during the initial period of nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic.He also urged the authorities to reopen the women’s markets while maintaining strict regulations to contain the spread of the disease.He, however, appreciated the license holding women vendors in Imphal for following the government directives and maintaining the existing protocols to prevent spread of Covid-19 pandemic in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipurs-women-market-s-closure-may-have-wiped-off-rs-3-879-cr-researcher-101611125186669.html

Cases have been recurring in areas from where they were first reported and federal teams are assisting all states in coordinating containment measures, an official of the animal husbandry ministry said. The H5N8 bird flu has spread among poultry in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra despite culling, the mainstay of stopping the spread of the virus, an official of the animal husbandry department said. Avian influenza was confirmed in poultry again on Tuesday in samples from Allapuzha district in Kerala, the official said. In Maharashtra, fresh samples have tested positive in the districts of Nanded (Chikhari and Talahari villages), Satara (Marai Wadi), Latur (Davangaon), Nagpur (Waranga), Gadchiroli (Gadchiroli), Mumbai (Kalyan, Thane) and Beed (Warati). Also Read: Bird flu: Red Fort shut till January 26 after sample of dead crow tests positive“In all other affected epicentres, RRTs have been deployed and culling of poultry birds is underway. Surveillance work continues at the places where positive results have been reported in crows/migratory/wild birds,” an official statement said Wednesday. New cases of bird flu have been confirmed in crows and wild migratory birds in Uttar Pradesh (Aliganj, Kheri), and Punjab (Rupnagar). Culling operations continue in the districts of Harda and Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh and Balod of Chhattisgarh as well as in Panchkula district of Haryana, officials said. “According to unofficial estimates, losses amount to possibly ₹3,000 crore,” Surinder Khanna, a poultry consultant, said. The bird flu epidemic has been confirmed so far by the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD) in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Avian flu has significant economic impact. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes. Maize is a major feed used for poultry. The poultry industry consumes about 14 million tonne of corn annually. While some samples from Balod in Chhattisgarh tested negative, the state still faces a higher threat level because of more bird deaths reported in the past 48 hours. India has one of the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it is in the path of three transnational flight corridors of migratory birds. “The virus involved is zoonotic,” said C Tosh, a senior scientist from NIHSAD. The term zoonotic refers to any pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans. However, the threat to humans is extremely low at this stage, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-spreads-among-poultry-in-5-of-11-afflicted-states-despite-culling-101611124564295.html

Electricwala is being prosecuted in a drug racket busted by the Charlotte unit of the anti-terrorism squad.

I, therefore, request, with great humility and respect, that you assist us by donating the doses we need to make our population safe (optimally 70,000 first and second doses).”PM Modi has already tweeted that India is committed to meeting the health care needs of the global community. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said India, the pharmacy of the world, will deliver vaccines to overcome the pandemic challenges.In his letter, PM Skerrit said: “I draw your kind attention to the enormous challenge faced by our people in obtaining a vaccine for Covid-19. Notwithstanding the pledge by Oxford-AstraZeneca to provide more than half of its doses to the world’s developing nations, as it currently stands, the large number of Dominicans will not be able to obtain a vaccine for a very long time. We are a small island developing nation, and are unable to compete with larger nations with greater demand for vaccines and more funds with which to pay for it.”He reminded PM Narendra Modi that his country has often been the fortunate recipient of assistance from India. “In 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Government of India graciously provided USD 100,000 for immediate relief, as well as a further USD 1 million for the rebuilding of essential infrastructure. In 2016, India also provided medicine for Dominicans as part of a grant in aid scheme.

The hurried shifting has raised eyebrows as the initial plan was to do so during the one-month gap between the first and the second part of the Budget Session that begins on January 29.The shifting was planned to make space for the ongoing construction of the new Parliament building.Officials in the Speaker Om Birla office were surprised at the hasty shifting. The space in front of the statue has been a preferred location for the Opposition lawmakers to protest against the government policies and proposed laws. During the last monsoon session, some Opposition lawmakers camped overnight in front of the statue to protest against the hurried passage of the farm bills.Officials said the Public works Department, the government’s construction arm, carefully shifted the statue and placed it in a small lawn near the gate used exclusively by the Speaker to reach his office.Also read | RT-PCR tests for MPs; Zero, Question hours back in Budget sessionOfficials added the Gandhi statue is eventually planned to installed just outside the current Parliament building, where that of late former Union home minister Govind Ballabh Pant currently stands.

So we have given it the name 'Kamalam'," he said.Asked why the name 'Kamalam' has been given to the fruit, Rupani said, "Farmers say it looks like lotus and that is the reason we have named it 'Kamalam'."Notably, 'Kamal', or lotus, is the poll symbol of the BJP and Gujarat party unit headquarters is named Shri Kamalam.There is nothing political behind renaming of the fruit, Rupani said.The fruit is found in arid areas of the state and it is known for its nutritional value, like it also helps in increasing the hemoglobin, Rupani said in reply to question on the need to rename it.The CM also said it is the most expensive fruit available in the market at this time.The change in nomenclature of the fruit is yet to find its way among the masses and farmers.Ahmedabad-based housewife Gayatri Vyas, who regularly eats the fruit for its nutritional value, said she is not aware that its has been changed as it is available as 'dragon fruit' only in markets.The fruit comes from several different cactus species and is recommended to be eaten as it can boost immunity.Lately, cultivators from some of the state's arid regions like Kutch have largely taken up farming of this fruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-government-renames-dragon-fruit-as-kamalam-101611119097769.html

At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Austin also said that if he is confirmed for the post, he will work to continue elevating the defence partnership with India and work to “further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defense Partner’ status”. Austin, 67, would be the first African American to run the department of defence but needs to be granted a waiver by both the House of Representatives and the Senate because the National Security Act requires the secretary of defence to wait seven years after active duty service before taking up the job. Also Read: 78-yr-old Joe Biden will be oldest US president to take oathHe retired in 2016. The former four-star general has served as head of the US Central Command, which oversees operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In his testimony to the Senate committee, Austin said on the global stage, Asia must be the focus of the US effort, and that he sees “China, in particular, as the pacing challenge for the Department”. “Globally, I believe the most significant challenge I will face will be to ensure the Department of Defense’s continued efforts to prepare and strengthen the US military for a dynamic, future security landscape driven by accelerating competitions with China and with Russia – with China as our pacing threat in most areas – while still ensuring our ability to deter today’s range of threats,” he said in written replies to advance policy questions from the committee. He said he assessed the “rapid development and operational focus” of China and the modernisation of the People’s Liberation Army, including its ability to conduct information, cyber and space operations, “constitutes a significant and long-term security threat to the United States and to our allies and partners”. China’s “increasingly aggressive actions” in the Indo-Pacific too are concerning and the US needs a “more resilient and distributed force posture in the Indo-Pacific in response to China’s counter-intervention capabilities and approaches”, he said. Asked if there had been any change in Pakistan’s cooperation with the US after American security aid was cut off in 2018, Austin replied: “I understand Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete.” He added, “Many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack.” Austin said Pakistan will continue to play an “important role in any political settlement in Afghanistan” and the US also needs to work with the country to defeat al-Qaeda and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province and enhance regional stability. He added that he intended to “press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organizations”. Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will “provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues”, he said. In response to a question on his priorities for India, Austin said his “overarching objective for our defense relationship with India would be to continue elevating the partnership”. He added, “I would further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defense Partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure the US and Indian militaries can collaborate to address shared interests. I would also seek to deepen and broaden our defence cooperation through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bidens-pick-for-pentagon-chief-says-pak-action-against-let-jem-incomplete-101611119883610.html

The BJP government has a great opportunity on January 26. The BJP government can show its nationalism, love for the Constitution by accepting their demands. There cannot be anything better than this," he said while addressing a press conference at the party's state headquarters in Lucknow on Tuesday.The press conference was held on the sidelines of an event where several national and state youth award winners joined the party. Some of them are the ones who won the UP youth icon awards last year."BJP people don't know about agriculture. Their people are not farmers. Samajwadi Party people are farmers. We understand them. We are with them and will stand by them. They have our support. BJP does not support farmers, it (BJP) only supports the businesses related to farming," the SP president said.Addressing the youth who joined the party, Akhilesh said the SP was a youth and farmer-oriented party. He recollected that the party on January 12— the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand—had held youth connect interactive programmes across the state."The youth are distressed under this government. Unemployment is rising. The way politicisation of educational institutions has started happening in the country is something that has never happened before. The NSA is being imposed on the youth when they raise their voices of dissent. Quality of education is falling, the fee and the cost of education is rising," he added."Without creating or consolidating online education infrastructure and backup, the government pushed students for online education. Most of the students suffered all the more because of the digital divide," the former UP chief minister said.Also Read: 3.75 lakh youth got jobs in UP since 2017: CM AdityanathAttacking the state government, he said: "UP is number one in poor education quality, poor health index, rape incidents, crime against minors, communal riots and fake encounters. The state is number one even in reprimands from the judiciary. It is such a state where serious crime cases were against those who became chief minister and deputy chief minister."He further alleged that the state government was good at taking credit for previous governments’ work, changing names of projects and places and in political vendetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-great-opportunity-on-republic-day-to-repeal-farm-laws-akhilesh-yadav-101611118755746.html

20-01-2021||India||Nadda as BJP president: A look at one year in office||After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious in the fiercely contested Bihar assembly election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave credit for the win to party chief JP Nadda. At the BJP headquarters where the Prime Minister addressed a crowd that had gathered to celebrate the party’s success, Modi said the poll results are an outcome of the leadership of the party president and the strategies he made. He then went on to describe how unlike the other parties where only a few can rise to the very top, the BJP is a party with a difference. “This is the party where the country‘s prime minister can chant ‘Nadda ji tum aage badho, hum tumhare saath hain,” he said. The Prime Minister’s rousing reception and acknowledgement of Nadda’s leadership was seen as the final stamp of approval of his presidency. Since electoral wins are considered the hallmark of the party boss’s leadership and a measure of success, Nadda, in the 12 months of being in the hot seat can claim credit for electoral victories in the Bihar assembly elections, bypolls in 11 states; and eight local body elections. “It was under Naddaji’s leadership that Kamal (lotus, also the BJP’s symbol) bloomed in Kashmir and spread to down south and the far northeast,” said former minister and national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain. Also read | JP Nadda to meet with party leaders, discuss preparations for West Bengal pollsTo buttress his claims, he said from Arunachal Pradesh where the BJP established victory in 184 of the 242 zila panchayats, to Gujarat where the party won all eight seats in the bypolls and to by-election in Telangana, the BJP has performed well. “A big victory was in Uttar Pradesh bypoll, where the BJP won six of seven seats and in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation where the party created history by winning 48 seats, up from just four in the previous election,” said Hussain, who was given in-charge of overseeing the DDC election in Jammu and Kashmir. In this election, BJP won 75 seats. It wasn’t however a smooth start for the 60-year-old, who started his political innings with the RSS’s student body, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). Soon after he was appointed as the working president of the BJP in June 2019, with Amit Shah continuing as the party president, the BJP faced elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand. While it could not form the government in Maharashtra after a fallout with its oldest ally, the Shiv Sena, over power-sharing; the party lost power in Jharkhand and cobbled up a government in Haryana with support from the JJP. The party also could not wrest power from the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi in 2020. Coronavirus Winning elections was not the only challenge for the leader who cut his teeth in Bihar politics and moved to Himachal Pradesh. Months into his presidency, a global pandemic led to a grinding halt in every sphere. The BJP, which was known for its ‘boots on the ground’ approach, had to reinvent its political outreach. With party activity on hold and workers unable to congregate, it was a challenge to keep the political machinery rolling. “The victory march that Amit Shah started has been continued by Nadda. But the biggest challenge he faced was the pandemic. Everything was shut. But he found a way. He took up the PM’s directions of ‘seva hi sangathan’ and ‘aapda mein avsar’ and came up with the idea of keeping the party workers connected digitally. Food and necessities were supplied to households across the country, a network was ready through digital connectivity even during the lockdown,” said Sanjay Mayukh, the national media co-head and an MLC from Bihar. Sanjay Jaiswal, president of the Bihar unit, credits Nadda’s “feed the needy” programme, the insistence of reaching out to the people on the ground and the way he used the internet as the reasons that helped the party succeeded in Bihar. “He fought like a karyakarta (worker),” said Jaiswal. Also read | BJP will protect Assam’s culture, language, identity, says Nadda in Silchar rallyComparisons with Shah A delay in announcing the new national team led to murmurs that Nadda would borrow from the Amit Shah playbook. A party colleague speaking on condition of anonymity said, “There has been no major change in the party in last one year. It is a continuation of what Shah started.” This was countered by many others who pointed out that opportunity given to “new faces” is an indication that the Nadda “has stepped out of the shadows of Shah”. “Just as Nitin Gadkari did during his tenure as president, Nadda has a mostly- new team in place. He has shown his political acumen by handling crisis in the party’s unit Rajasthan and Karnataka and the BJP’s fallout with the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal,” said another senior leader requesting anonymity. Political commentator Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) said Nadda‘s presidency has “been fairly decent” as he has performed well in two areas. “An indicator of performance is winning elections; he won the Bihar election, which was not easy because there was the 15 year anti-incumbency factor against Nitish Kumar. And the second achievement is that he has been able to undertake changes in the party structure without facing any criticism or rebellion,” Kumar said. Challenges ahead The challenges ahead for Nadda include the electoral battles in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and Assam; and continuing to expand the reach of the party by inducting more members, winning more states and establishing its presence in the local bodies. He will also have to find a way to keep the flock of allies together, with SAD and Sena having broken ties, the BJP does not want to be seen as a party that cannot take allies along. “He has already announced that he will be visiting each state for two days and will be leading the charge in WB along with Shah. But these elections will be the litmus test of his leadership,” said one of the functionaries quoted above. National media head Anil Baluni, however, said the upcoming elections will not be the only pulpit to showcase Nadda’s leadership. “The party takes all elections, from the panchayat to Parliament, as a challenge and under his leadership, it will contest the upcoming state elections with its full might,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-as-bjp-president-a-look-at-one-year-in-office-101611116162635.html

Authorities said if the export to Bahrain is successful, more consignments would follow. Talks are also being finalised to export the highly perishable product to Italy and Canada.“This is for the first time Joynagar Moa is being exported since it was introduced in 1904.

GI tag signifies a product has a specific geographical origin and enjoys a reputation because of it.Kanakchur Khoi (fried aromatic paddy), nolen gur (molasses), ghee, khoya kheer, cardamom, raisins, and cashew nuts, among others, are used to prepare the delicacy.“It [export] is a trial run. Normally, the shelf life of moa is five days. But we are sending them in special boxes packed in dry ice. If we find that it can be stored for at least 9-10 days, more consignments would follow to European and American countries later this month and in the coming month,” said Sandeep Saha, regional in-charge of Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).As of now, the manufacturers have tied up with two exporters through APEDA. Talks are being held with more exporters.Even though the markets of Bengal are flooded with Joynagar Moa and almost every neighbourhood shop sells the product around this time of the year, manufacturers said that they have tied up with only a select few outlets of certain sweet shops in Kolkata and elsewhere in the country to sell the product. Only these outlets are authorised to sell the authentic GI-tagged moa.“Each moa would cost you around ₹30. We have come up with packets containing six pieces which are sold at ₹150. A kilo would cost ₹500,” said Kayal.According to the GI Journal of November 2014, Ashutosh Das, a resident of Joynagar, first prepared the moa in 1904.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-s-winter-delicacy-exported-abroad-for-the-first-time-101611115622454.html

Soon, it will also send invitations to the farmers' unions and associations to discuss their views on farm laws.In its meeting on Tuesday, the panel discussed the roadmap of activities for two months to prepare their recommendations after discussion with farmers, their unions and other stakeholders.Other two members of the panel - Dr Ashok Gulati, former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, Dr Pramod Joshi, former director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute - were also part of the meeting. Bhupinder Mann, the fourth member of the committee, has already recused himself.On January 12, the top court had stayed the implementation of the three laws, against which tens of thousands of farmers are protesting at various Delhi borders, till further orders.

The farmers are adamant on the demand to repeal the laws which the government has refused and is firm on their offer to amend the legislation.

20-01-2021||India||Rajasthan, Bihar seek on-spot registration to bypass Co-WIN glitches, reluctance||As Covid vaccination drive has been hampered by the glitches in the Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application, at least two state governments, Bihar and Rajasthan, have sought Union health ministry’s permission to bypass the application and conduct on the spot registration of beneficiaries.On the second day of the vaccination drive on Monday, glitches in the Co-WIN application was reported from several states, leading to delays in vaccination. As messages could not be sent to the beneficiaries through the app, they had to be called individually by officials. Also, as there were server problems, the data of the beneficiaries had to be manually updated.Till Tuesday evening, about 429,500 people had been vaccinated across India, about 70% of the target. Officials said apart from the glitches, the turnout was also poor at some places because of concerns over the safety of the vaccine. The hesitancy had emerged after it came to light on Saturday that approval for Covaxin was given for emergency use for clinical trials and beneficiaries had to be monitored actively on a daily basis and made to fill up a form for seven days after receiving the jab.“We have asked the government of India to allow vaccination through on the spot registrations as there is some technical snag with the (CoWIN) software,” said Dr Sudheer Bhandari, principal of Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Medical College in Jaipur, and a state level coordinator for Covid vaccination in Rajasthan.The glitches in CoWin application had affected the vaccination drive in Rajasthan. The second day of the inoculation program on Tuesday saw 11,288 healthcare workers getting vaccinated, about 5% less than the first day. Also, 15 AEFI (adverse event following immunization) cases have been reported from the state. A total of 23,546 people have been vaccinated across the state in the first two days, the official data shows.Bihar government also allowed the vaccination centers to change the beneficiary list on the Co-WIN portal, if those listed for inoculation did not turn up at the designated time. The Co-WIN portal hitherto did not allow any change in the beneficiary list generated randomly through the portal at the eleventh hour.With the changes, Bihar government expects to stem the declining vaccination footfall, which was a matter of concern for the government, said health officials. Bihar’s vaccination percentage slid from 62% on the inaugural day (January 16) to 51.2% on day two (January 18). It further dipped to 50.1% on Tuesday, the third day of the vaccination campaign in the state. The number of session sites (vaccination centres) had gone down from 301 to 298 in the state.The declining vaccination footfall, said officials, had a direct correlation with vaccination hesitancy among doctors.“Some of our doctors have refused to take the vaccine because they are not sure about its efficacy as the Covaxin is still at the trial stage,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), where the vaccination percentage has dipped to 17.46% on Tuesday from 28% on the inauguration day, Saturday.“The Co-WIN portal was updated today to allow facilities in-charge the option to include beneficiaries from among their healthcare workers, who are already enrolled on the portal for vaccination. We will now train our data-entry operators before they can utilise this option,” said executive director of the Bihar health society, Manoj Kumar, who is also the state’s nodal officer for vaccination.After a 12% drop in vaccination, the Uttarakhand government decided that doctors would counsel the health workers who fear side effects from Covid-19 vaccine.“We have identified a few reasons for lesser turnout for vaccination and it is not necessarily that people are hesitant. Doctors would provide counselling to health workers on the benefits of vaccination,” said Dr Ashutosh Sayana, principal of Government Doon Medical College Hospital, one of the biggest vaccination centres in Dehradun district.72% registered beneficiaries had received the vaccine on Monday in the state, which reduced to 60% on Tuesday.(With inputs from Dehradun bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-bihar-seek-on-spot-registration-to-bypass-co-win-glitches-reluctance-101611112250117.html
20-01-2021||India||10th round of talks between Centre, protesting farmers to be held today||The tenth round of talks between the Centre and protesting farmers over the three farm laws enacted in September will be held on Wednesday, days after the previous discussions between the two sides made no headway on Friday. The farmers, who have threatened to march to Delhi on Republic Day (January 26) if the laws are not scrapped, have been camping on the outskirts of Delhi in protest against the laws. The government says the laws are meant to benefit the cultivators as they no longer will be required to sell produce at regulated wholesale markets. The farmers maintain that legislation was introduced to benefit big corporations.Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Singhu, Tikri other key Delhi borders remain closedUnion agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said the ninth round of talks with farmers unions were inconclusive but they will hold another round of discussion on Tuesday. The tenth round was later deferred by a day.Tomar expressed confidence on Friday that they will be able to come to an agreement. He added they were concerned about the health of farmers, who have been protesting despite cold weather and heavy rains over the last month.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who attended the meeting on Friday, echoed Tomar, saying they were committed to finding a solution through dialogue and that is why they agreed to meet again.Farm unions again demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws at Friday’s talks. The government reiterated its position and ruled out a repeal. It proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on the laws”.The Supreme Court last week named a four-member panel to talk to the farmers as it stayed the implementation of the laws. Farmer unions have questioned the panel’s composition and have said they will not appear before it as the panel members have favoured the laws.Bhupinder Singh Mann, who was named as one of its members, has recused himself from the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10th-round-of-talks-between-centre-protesting-farmers-to-be-held-today-101611112443198.html
20-01-2021||India||Covid vaccine drive: Health ministry allows on-spot beneficiary registration||To deal with the issue of low turnout of healthcare workers at the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination sites, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has modified the Co-WIN app to now allow on-spot beneficiary registration, and with the upgrade, the states can accommodate walk-ins.“The average vaccination sessions allowed per site are 100, and we were told in some centres fewer people were turning up. We have made a provision in the app to also accommodate beneficiaries scheduled to take the jab on other dates. Earlier, the software wasn’t designed to accept beneficiaries outside the day’s list but now they can,” said Dr RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.“It made sense to make changes in the software because a lot of resources otherwise could go to waste, such as, manpower that was there at the centre, vaccine supplies etc. So long as the person who has landed at the session site is eligible to receive the vaccine, even if they are registered for any other day, there should be no problem. Why waste resources and time, since we have to vaccinate a particular number of healthcare workers anyway,” said Sharma.Also read | 9 states, UTs among better performing areas during Covid-19 vaccination driveHe, however, refuted allegations that there were major glitches in the Co-WIN app that is the backbone of Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system.“There are minor hiccups, which are normal to have when you put such a large-scale system in production. Dry runs are one part but in real-time, there is always a possibility of encountering issues which may have been missed otherwise. None of what we have seen so far is anything major, in fact, some are even procedural issues that are being rectified,” he said.The officials in the ministry said that there were no issues with the app; in fact, the vaccination process will also be scaled up soon.“It also depends on how tech-savvy are the people handling the software. There is also the option of manually uploading data but that is only in extreme situations and has to be done real-time otherwise the backlog will be huge,” he said.While walk-ins have been allowed, priority will still be given to current day beneficiaries.“Those who are registered for the day will have to be vaccinated first, and others should be accommodated only if registered beneficiaries do not turn up. Certain conditions are non-negotiable such as eligibility, so that those not eligible don’t jump the line; record the vaccination event real-time, and issuing of vaccination certificate. Everyone who gets vaccinated must be accounted for so that tracking is effectively done,” said Sharma.“This software is an empowering tool, not a disabling tool,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-health-ministry-allows-on-spot-beneficiary-registration-101611112322014.html

20-01-2021||India||Farmers want permission for tractor rally on Republic Day, Supreme Court hearing today||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday resume the hearing on the application filed by Delhi Police seeking a direction to put an injunction on the proposed tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day. The farmers, who have been protesting against the three central farm laws, have vowed to take out the rally on January 26.The Delhi Police in its application has said that no tractor rally by farmers should be allowed it will malign the nation globally.The case is being heard by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde. This bench, which last assembled on January 12, also comprises justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. On that day, the court had stayed the implementation of the three farm laws under challenge and formed a four-member expert committee to study the concerns raised by the farmer unions and submit its recommendations to the court in two months.Bhupinder Mann, one of the members of the committee, had recused himself leaving just three members on the panel. Today, the bench could even decide on filling up the vacancy created by Mann.On Monday, while hearing a case, the bench had said, "Right now, we can't deal with it... the question of entry into Delhi is a law and order situation that is to be determined by the police."Meanwhile, the protesting farmer unions, which plan to hold the rally on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi, have begun preparing for it in villages in Punjab. They are mobilising people for the parade and said more farmers will be heading to the national capital in batches later this week.“There is a great enthusiasm among people in Punjab to become part of the tractor parade. Our batches will start moving towards Delhi from January 23 and 24,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) president Jagjit Singh Dallewal said 20,000-25,000 tractors would come to Delhi from Punjab alone for the planned parade.“We want the government to give us permission for our rally. This is our country and it is our constitutional right to voice our needs and demands," said Amarjeet Singh Rarra, general secretary, Deaba Kisan Committee, said on Delhi's Singhu border.While the final plan for the rally is yet to be formulated, volunteers from among the protesters have been roped in to ensure discipline during the march, farmers said.For nearly two months now, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been protesting against the new farm laws near Delhi. They say the laws will erode the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government, however, has discounted these fears and projected the three laws as major agricultural reforms. The tenth round of talks between the two sided will take place on Wednesday.The three contentious laws are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-want-permission-for-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-sc-hearing-today-101611108850091.html

The decision, however, was rejected by farmers’ representatives.Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader who represents the unions at the talks, said that the two sides discussed Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, one of the laws farmers want scrapped. Union minister Piyush Goyal defended the new amendments in the act but signalled the government’s willingness to make changes.He told the unions that “some changes can be made in the Act too without quite saying that (what specific) amendments will be made,” according to Kuruganti.On Tuesday, a committee appointed by the Supreme Court to scrutinise three agricultural laws held its first and finalised its roadmap for wide consultations with farmers, farm collectives and unions as well as state governments and state-run agricultural organisations, a member said.The committee will begin its consultations with farm unions on January 21 over the legislations, which have been stayed by the apex court for the time being. “Invitations have been sent to unions which are both pro- and anti-farm laws,” Anil Ghanwat, a member of the committee told HT.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year demanding a complete rollback of three farm laws—Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-govt-to-hold-10th-round-of-talks-to-end-impasse-over-agri-laws-today-101611107180030.html

20-01-2021||India||SC panel on farm laws holds first meet, invites farmers for talks||A committee appointed by the Supreme Court to scrutinise three agricultural laws that have prompted farmers to stage a weeks-long protest held its first meeting on Tuesday and finalised its roadmap for wide consultations with farmers, farm collectives and unions as well as state governments and state-run agricultural organisations, a member said.The committee will begin its consultations with farm unions on January 21. “Invitations have been sent to unions which are both pro- and anti-farm laws,” Anil Ghanwat, a member of the committee told HT.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading protests against the laws, has however said its members would not appear before the committee.“We have said this before and reiterate that our demand is a complete repeal of the laws and we will only talk to the government,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm leader.On January 12, after two days of deliberation, the Supreme Court stayed the pro-reforms farm laws approved by Parliament in September. Judges dealing with the case also appointed a four-man committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws.The court named economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi as well as farm activists Bhupinder Singh Mann and Anil Ghanwat to the panel. A day later, Mann opted out of the committee, citing the “interests of farmers”.Ghanwat, a member of the now three-member panel, said the committee has drawn up a list of categories of organisations which would be invited over the course of the consultations.According to the Supreme Court’s instructions, the committee had to meet within 10 days of its constitution and submit a report to the apex court in two months.“In our first meeting, we took note of our terms of reference and chalked out processes we will follow,” Ghanwat said. He said it was up to the Supreme Court to appoint a member in place of Mann, who has recused himself but the committee’s work would continue.“Our basic terms of reference are to look into the laws and consult stakeholders to address grievances of farmers,” Anil Ghanwat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-on-farm-laws-holds-first-meet-invites-farmers-for-talks-101611093950966.html
20-01-2021||India||1,000 vaccine doses wasted in Delhi so far: Health officials||With the Covid-19 vaccination drive completing three days in Delhi, officials involved in the immunisation programme flagged another problem on Tuesday - that of wastage of doses.Teams from a number of vaccination centres and health officials overseeing the city’s inoculation drive said at least 1,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccines have been wasted in Delhi so far. Health officials attributed the wastage mostly to fewer people coming up to get the jab.“As per the guidelines, vials of both Covishield or Covaxin have to be used and discarded within four hours of being opened. Each Covishield vial has 10 doses, and the low turnout is only adding to the wastage. If the hesitancy was not as high as it actually is now, then people would be queueing up and we could have grouped them in slots of 10 to reduce wastage,” said a senior health official.Although Delhi government officials said it has not yet compiled data on the total number of doses discarded so far, health department officials said initial estimates indicate that on an average five doses are being wasted at the 81 vaccination centres each day.At Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital, 9 doses were wasted on Day One, 6 on Day Two and 2 on Day Three. The Delhi State Cancer Institute discarded 14 doses in three days.“Today (Tuesday), we had to open the third vial for just one beneficiary and the rest of the nine doses had to be discarded as no one else came by the end of the day. We have strict instruction from the government that no body can be turned away from the vaccination centres,” said Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer at Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI).But, Dr Ravinder Pal Dhingra of Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, another vaccination centre, described it as “a number game”.“Even if the turnout is as high as 91 at a centre, still 9 doses would go waste on that day. It’s mostly a game of numbers. But it is true that if more people were willing then we could have scheduled 9 more people for the day and shifted the remaining ones to the next day. At our hospital, we have vaccinated around 39, 49 and 55 people in the past three days,” said Dhingra.A senior doctor from Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital said the government anyway already considers that 10% of the total stock of doses would go in vain either through wastage or breakage.“However, to ensure that not too many doses go waste, after about mid-day we wait for a few people to come in before opening any new vials,” said the doctor.To ensure fewer doses are wasted each day, many centres started walk-in vaccination from Tuesday. While Ram Manohar Lohia hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical Colleges allowed this from Monday, several others such as DSCI and GTB hospital started it from Tuesday.“Today, 24 healthcare workers got the jabs at our centre as per the list generated by the Co-WIN app. But, by 4pm our district administration allowed us to vaccinate even those healthcare workers who are not in the list but are registered and verified in the Co-WIN app. So, to ensure minimum wastage of doses, I took the shot and so did two additional medical superintendents and one senior doctor of the hospital. So, only one dose was discarded today,” said Dr Sweta, the nodal officer of the vaccination programme in GTB hospital.A senior official from the Ministry of health and family welfare said the shelf life of unopened vials of both Covishield and Covaxin is six months from the date of manufacturing. “Irrespective of which vaccine is being used, every vial, once opened has to be used within four hours at a temperature between 2 and 25 degrees Celsius. Open vial policy has not been allowed in India yet,” said the ministry official on condition of anonymity.With 75 of the 81 centres giving Covishield jabs, Delhi primarily is using these doses over the Covaxin doses which is being used in only six centres. While each vial of Covishield has 5ml of the vaccine with each dose being 0.5 ml, which is equivalent to 10 doses, a Covaxin vial contains 20 doses.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the government should consider increasing the duration of usage of each opened vial of Covishield vaccine from the existing 4 hours to 6 hours.“Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Covishield vaccine says an opened vial can be used up to a maximum of 6 hours. The government should allow centres which are able to maintain the desired room temperatures to use vials up to 6 hours instead of 4,” he saidJohn suggested that the open vial policy can still be considered for Covaxin, but stated the same can never be possible for Covishield.“Reusing the vial is called open vial policy. Covishield vaccine contains live virus because of which no preservative can be added to it. Therefore, an open vial policy cannot be allowed. But, Covaxin does not contain any live virus and it has a preservative called 2-phenoxyethanol. Therefore, the government should declare an open vial policy for Covaxin at least. This will ensure reduction in wastage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hesitancy-causes-wastage-of-1-000-vaccine-doses-in-delhi-say-health-officials-101611091051711.html
20-01-2021||India||Police urge farmers to shift R-Day tractor rally to KMP e-way||Police officers from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana met farmers at Singhu border on Tuesday, urging them to either cancel the proposed tractor rally on the Republic Day or organised it on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway. The farmers, however, turned down the proposal but assured the police that it would be a peaceful protest and stay confined to only the outer Ring Road in Delhi.While special commissioner (intelligence) Deependra Pathak led the police team from Delhi, seven leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, including Balbir Singh Rajewal and Darshan Pal, represented the farmers.Since no consensus could be reached on issue, another meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday morning, a senior Delhi Police officer who was present in the meeting said, requesting anonymity.“We told the farmers representatives that the tractor rally may lead to law and order issues and traffic and security chaos and asked them to cancel it. Since they refused, we suggested that the rally could be shifted to the KMP expressway. They remained adamant on taking out their rally for 50-60 kilometres on Delhi’s outer ring road,” the officer said.This was the second meeting between the police and leaders of farmer unions since Monday, when the Supreme Court refused to pass any order on the Delhi Police’s plea for stopping the tractor rally. On a plea by Delhi Police, the top court had said that entry of farmers into Delhi is a law and order problem and any decision in this regard should be taken by the Delhi Police.Tuesday’s meeting was held at a farmhouse in Delhi, nearly a kilometre away from the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws. The farmers’ agitation entered 55th day on Tuesday.“The farmer leaders in fact asked the police officers if they would be granting permission for their Kisan Tractor Parade on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road about which the officers said that they were not the deciding authority. The officers showed their concerns regarding law and order, traffic, and security issues that our tractor rally may cause. However, they were assured that our rally will be peaceful and it will not disrupt the official Republic Day parade,” said Harpreet Singh Kahlon, convener of Krantikari Kisan Union.On Tuesday, the farmers also shared the route map of their proposed tractor rally and said that the parade will touch all the borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be participating in the tractor rally, they said.“Our parade will be similar to that of the national parade where tableaux of different states are shown. The farmers of different states would be showcasing their traditional style of farming and agricultural tools they use in agriculture. All tractors will have the national flag and our rally will start after the parade on Rajpath is concluded,” said Parmeet Singh, a farmer from Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-urge-farmers-to-shift-r-day-tractor-rally-to-kmp-eway-101611089573981.html
20-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi says India ‘owned’ by a few; Centre hits back||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that a handful of people close to the Prime Minister now “own” the country through “massive monopolies”, demanded a probe into information that has come to light after Arnab Goswami’sWhatsApp conversations went public, and lashed out at the government for not resolving the crisis brought about by the farm laws, triggering a war of words with the BJP that snapped back saying “monopoly of one family during the UPA rule was overthrown by the people.”In a no-holds-barred attack against the ruling dispensation a day before the tent round of talks between farmers and the Centre, Gandhi compared the alleged monopolies that he said were being created with the British Raj and said at a press conference on Tuesday that “there are millions of people who do not accept this nonsense that’s going on in this country”. He refused to answer questions posed by BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda, dubbed protesting farmers as “patriots” and claimed the Congress will provide “the vision for India”.“Across the board , what we are watching is the development of massive monopoly in this country. This country is owned by a small group of three to five people who are close to the PM,” he said, expressing apprehension that the new farm laws are intended to monopolize the agriculture sector.“Farmers won’t get the value they deserve. Mandis will be destroyed. Those three, four people will be able to store millions of kilos of grains. This is an assault on the middle class and youngsters who will not able to get a job,” Gandhi alleged, releasing a party booklet on the farm issues.But ahead of Gandhi’s press conference on Tuesday, Nadda trained his guns at the Congress leader and demanded answers on why “time and again the Congress party surrenders to China” and why it has been “misleading” the farmers about the new farm laws. Nadda also took pot shots at Gandhi and tweeted, “Now that Mr. @RahulGandhi has returned from his monthly vacation, I would like to ask him some questions. I hope he will answer them in today’s press conference.”He went on to say, “When will @RahulGandhi , his dynasty and Congress stop lying on China? Can he deny that thousands of kms, including the one (area) in Arunachal Pradesh he is referring to was gifted by none other than Pandit Nehru to the Chinese? Time and again, why does Congress surrender to China?”When asked, Gandhi refused to reply to Nadda. “Who is he? Why should I answer him? ...Is he my professor? I will answer to the country,” Gandhi said. Within hours, the BJP hit back. Union minister Prakash Javadekar said “A national party president is asking questions, you should reply. He (Gandhi) has run away from giving replies.”Alleging that the Congress is not interested in resolving farmer issues and doesn’t want the talks to be successful, Javadekar said, “He (Gandhi) said there is a monopoly of a few families in the county. Monopoly of one family during the UPA rule was overthrown by the people. They are upset by that...there is a change, now 125 crore people rule the country. During the Congress rule it was only one family that remained in power,”While Gandhi said that China has a “clear strategic vision” but India doesn’t and China has twice tested India in Doklam and Ladakh, Javadekar retorted that the Congress must answer why Aksai Chin was given away by it and land parcels in Arunachal Pradesh.Gandhi demanded that both journalist Arnab Goswami and the person who provided him information about the Balakot airstrike on Pakistan should be booked as such leaks were against national security.His reference is to a transcript of Goswami’s WhatsApp conversation with a rating agency chief going public (it was part of a charge sheet on rigging of rating points). The conversation seems to suggest Goswami had prior knowledge of a coming strike by India against Pakistan. “Sharing official secrets with a journalist is a criminal act. There is nothing patriotic at putting our airforce at risk. I want to know who told Arnab Goswami about the airstrike? Only five people—the PM, the Home Minister, the defence Minister and the NSA must have known about it,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-india-owned-by-a-few-centre-hits-back-101611086435432.html

The deceased included six men, eight women and the baby girl.Expressing grief over the incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ex-gratia of Rs.2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the next of kin of each of the deceased and ₹50,000 for the injured.“The loss of lives due to a truck accident in Surat is tragic. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying that the injured recover at the earliest,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) tweeted.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also announced a compensation of Rs.2 lakh to the kin of each deceased.The incident took place near Kosamba village, around 60 km from Surat, when the truck driver apparently lost control over the vehicle after hitting a sugarcane laden tractor.The truck ran over the construction workers on the Kim-Mandvi road shortly after midnight, Surat SP Usha Rada said, news agency PTI reported.“The truck was on its way to Mandvi from Kim. The driver lost control of the vehicle after it hit sugarcane hanging out of the tractor trolley coming from the opposite direction,” she said.“The truck’s front window pane shattered on impact, which blocked the driver’s vision. The truck then veered off the road and crashed into the sleeping labourers,” she added.The driver, who sustained injuries and is undergoing treatment, has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act, police said.Besides the driver, the vehicle’s ‘cleaner’ was also injured in the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-migrant-workers-a-yr-old-infant-crushed-by-truck-in-surat-101611085777243.html
20-01-2021||India||India, France air exercise to kick off in Rajasthan today||The air forces of India and France will kick off a five-day joint exercise in Rajasthan on Wednesday with a raft of aircraft, including Rafale fighters jets, Mirage 2000s, Sukhoi-30s, mid-air refuellers and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) platforms, the Indian Air Force (IAF) said in a statement on Tuesday, announcing the line-up of aircraft taking part in the wargames.The exercise, code-named Desert Knight-21, is being held at the Jodhpur air force station.“As part of Indo-French defence cooperation, the IAF and French Air and Space Force have held six editions of exercises named ‘Garuda’, the latest being in 2019 at Air Force Base Mont-de-Marsan, France,” the IAF said on the eve of the exercise.The French air force has also flown its A-400M military transport aircraft to Jodhpur for the exercise, they added. The French contingent consists of 175 personnel, the IAF said.The IAF said the two sides would “put into practice operational experience gained across terrains and spectrums and endeavour to exchange ideas and best practices to enhance interoperability”. “For sure air crews imbibe information from each other’s operating procedures from military exercises between nations but they are more a demonstration of strategic relations than one of tactical learning,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-air-exercise-to-kick-off-in-rajasthan-today-101611084059582.html
20-01-2021||India||India begins vaccine export from today||Bhutan, the Maldives and Bangladesh will be among the first countries in the neighbourhood to receive Covid-19 vaccines from India as grant assistance, with supplies of millions of doses to six nations set to begin on Wednesday.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccine will reach Bhutan on Wednesday. Another 100,000 doses of Covishield vaccine will be sent to the Maldives later the same day under emergency use approvals to vaccinate frontline and health workers and senior citizens.Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said on its Facebook page the country will receive two million doses of Covishield, the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, from India as a “gift”. It said: “A special flight of India carrying the consignment will land at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka [on January 21].”The external affairs ministry said supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles will begin from Wednesday in line with India’s commitment to use its vaccine production and delivery capacity to help the world fight Covid-19.The ministry said there were also plans to provide vaccines to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, after “confirmation of necessary regulatory clearances”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi branded the move as “VaccineMaitri” and tweeted: “India is deeply honoured to be a long-trusted partner in meeting the healthcare needs of the global community. Supplies of Covid vaccines to several countries will commence tomorrow, and more will follow in the days ahead.”“It will be ensured that domestic manufacturers will have adequate stocks to meet domestic requirements while supplying abroad,” the external affairs ministry said.A training programme covering administrative and operational aspects is also being conducted between January 19 and 20 for immunisation managers, cold chain and communications officers and data managers of recipient countries.The only country in the region unlikely to be an immediate beneficiary of India’s efforts is Pakistan, which has not made any formal request for vaccines.Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League party said on Twitter the two million doses of Covishield would be in addition to the 30 million doses that the government contracted for with the Serum Institute of India (SII) in November.Since Maldives has a population of about 500,000, India’s grant will cover the vaccination of a significant percentage of the population. In addition, the Maldives plans to buy 300,000 doses from SII at commercial rates.India’s grants are part of plans to provide up to 10 million doses of both Covidshield and Covaxin, the vaccine made by Bharat Biotech, to friendly countries, the people cited above said.Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives are among the countries in the region with closest ties with India, and have benefited from projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few months.SII has an agreement to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a facility coordinated by Gavi and the World Health Organisation to provide vaccines to lower income countries.“Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout [of the immunisation programme], India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” the external affairs ministry said. India will also “continue to supply countries all over the world with vaccines” and this will be “calibrated against domestic requirements and international demand and obligations, including under Gavi’s Covax facility”, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-vaccine-export-from-today-101611082992448.html

The murder took place close to the victim’s home. The assailants came on a motorcycle, eyewitnesses told the police. A grainy video of two men getting on a motorcycle and the bleeding victim lying on the ground was later widely shared.Shortly after the incident, Kalipada Sarkar, the president of the local panchayat samity was admitted at Gangarampur hospital after he was allegedly chased by some TMC workers from a rival group. Sarkar later died of heart attack.Biplab Mitra, a former legislator and newly-appointed chairman of the TMC’s district committee, said, “Sarkar died of a heart attack. His death has nothing to do with the murder. He was ailing for a long time and had been to Chennai for treatment.”Debarshi Dutta, the district superintendent of police, said, “The murder took place during a clash between two small groups.

20-01-2021||India||Covaxin recipients under stricter watch, says Centre||The central government on Monday spelt out a detailed policy of monitoring Covid-19 vaccine recipients for adverse responses and assured people that the immunisation programme, which has been dogged by fears of side-effects and hesitancy, is safe.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the government had opted for a passive monitoring approach for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India and known locally as Covishield. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine recipients are being actively followed for any adverse reactions, he added.“In Covishield vaccine, the monitoring is passive monitoring. The recipient is observed for initial 30 minutes; if he is fine, he is sent home. However, if they develop symptoms later, then the onus is on the recipient to report it to the hospital. Whereas in case of Covaxin, it is active followed up, which means a doctor rings you up on a daily basis and you are given a form that you fill for seven days. That’s the difference,” said Bhushan.He also pointed out that the number of mild Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) –pain, nausea, mild fever – were reported in 0.18% of people vaccinated till Monday night. Severe AEFIs, which require hospitalization or high fever, accounted for 0.002% of the shots administered.This was one of the lowest in the world, he added.“And there it is clearly mentioned that if there is a causal relationship between immunisation and the adverse event, whether it is severe or serious, the cost of hospitalisation would be borne by the authorities,” he added.Director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, said Covaxin recipients were being closely monitored. “As we cross the half a million number mark in the past three days, it is very clear that both these Covid-19 vaccines are very safe. Also, vaccine does not cause Covid-19; vaccine prevents Covid-19; vaccine prevents Covid-19 deaths. So, the time to take the vaccine is now, and we can break the chain of virus transmission,” he added.The officials also drew a distinction between Covishield, which finished late-stage trials abroad and whose efficacy data is publicly known, and Covaxin, which is currently in phase 3 trials.“There are two vaccines; one has been given emergency use authorisation, and there is another vaccine which has been given emergency use authorisation under clinical trial mode.”He added that the vaccine given emergency approval under clinical trial mode – Covaxin — is accompanied by three documents: a fact-sheet and a consent form that are read out and explained to beneficiaries. “It is in regional languages depending on the state...; and third is the adverse event reporting form where the recipient has to report it for the first seven days.”He said that states were in charge of deciding which vaccine is allotted to a particular immunisation site.“The Union government got the supplies, but which vaccine will go to which vaccination session was a decision which has been a decision left entirely to the states. What vaccine will be used in AIIMS, Delhi, was a decision of the state government, and local government in other states...,” he added.Adverse reactions can be caused by allergies or underlying medical conditions and are not necessarily causally linked to vaccines.But reports of adverse reactions to immunization have fuelled rumours and vaccine hesitancy, forcing authorities to fall short of inoculation targets.“Adverse reactions that have been seen so far are negligible. The side effects are practically nil,” added VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The ministry said nine AEFIs have required hospitalization until Tuesday. In Delhi, three cases have been discharged and one case is under observation.An AEFI case in Uttarakhand has been discharged. In Karnataka, one person is discharged and other person is stable. In Chhattisgarh, one person was discharged.In Rajasthan, one case is of suspected anaphylaxis is under observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-recipients-under-stricter-watch-says-centre-101611081235873.html
20-01-2021||India||‘To her, patients always came first’: Cancer care pioneer dies at 93||Dr Viswanathan Shanta, a pioneer of cancer care in the country, passed away in Chennai in the early hours of Tuesday. Chairman of the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, V Shanta was working Monday night when she complained of chest pain and was admitted to Apollo Hospitals. “She called me around 8:30pm complaining of chest pain,” said her younger sister V Susheela, who is a member of the governing board of the institute. V Shanta died of a myocardial infarction and was laid to rest with full state honours later in the evening. She was 93.Born on March 11, 1927 in Chennai, V Shanta belonged to a family of achievers. Her grand-uncle CV Raman and her uncle, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, were both Nobel laureates. After completing her post graduate medical degree in gynaecology from Madras Medical College, she joined the Cancer Institute in 1955 established a year before by one of the country’s first women medical graduates, Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy. Dr S Krishnamurthi, Reddy’s son, was V Shanta’s collaborator and mentor.V Shanta made the hospital her home, living in a room in the institute from her first day till Monday night. She steered it from a 12-bed hospital to a state-of-the-art cancer care centre and research institute that catered to more than 15,000 poor persons annually, and where 40% of the patients received free treatment with residence and those who could not pay were offered subsidised treatment.“For a lot of people who got cancer, she was the person you thought of. I think people felt good going to her,” said Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, whose now deceased mother Sushila Viswanathan was V Shanta’s patient in 2005. “She helped a lot of children,” said Anand, a regular donor to the institute.V Shanta inspired generations of health care providers. “The country’s first paediatric oncology centre was established under her,” said Dr R Swaminathan, a statistician and epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute, who was a colleague. “Nobody valued data more than her. When people ridiculed us that we could never follow-up on patients in India, Dr Shanta showed the way to assess a cancer patient’s survival rate.”“To her, patients always came first. Today, the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar is one of the most premium cancer institutions in India because of her hard work along with her mentor Dr S Krishnamurthi,” said Dr CS Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.V Shanta was on the WHO Advisory Committee on Cancer till March 2005. She was a recipient of several national and international awards including the Ramon Magsasay award for public service, Padma Shri (1986), Padma Bhushan (2006) and Padma Vibhushan (2016). Prime Minister Narendra Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other leaders condoled her death. “Dr V Shanta will be remembered for her outstanding efforts to ensure top quality cancer care. The Cancer Institute at Adyar, Chennai, is at the forefront of serving the poor and downtrodden. I recall my visit to the Institute in 2018,” the PM tweeted.With inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-her-patients-always-came-first-cancer-care-pioneer-dies-at-93-101611080884236.html
20-01-2021||India||Senior docs told to get vaccinated to instil confidence||A little less than half the number of people scheduled to get the Covid-19 vaccine jabs on Tuesday turned up at their designated centres, prompting some hospitals to ask the head of departments to take the shot themselves and motivate those working under them.With 4,936 beneficiaries receiving the shot, Delhi saw the highest turnout in terms of absolute numbers on Tuesday.However, the number only accounted for 48.75% of the 10,125 health care workers who were scheduled to get the jabs, with the government having increased the number of beneficiaries each of the 81 sites could vaccinate, data seen by HT suggested.In comparison, 4,319 people had received the jab on Saturday – the day the nation-wide roll-out happened – accounting for 53.3% of the beneficiaries selected to receive the vaccine.On Tuesday, the turnout was much higher for the centres administering Serum Institute’s Covishield – 50.6% — when compared to the centres administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – 27.4%, as per data.With more centres administering Covishield, 15 of the 16 adverse reactions noticed were in those who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot on Tuesday. All the adverse events were minor ones such as rashes, headaches, and fever.In the three days since launch, 12,853 health care workers have taken the shots, out of a targeted 26,397, records showed.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said, “The current turnout is not low if one compares it with other states and the overall average in the country. Confidence building will take some time. The Delhi government is leaving no stones unturned in confidence building drives and increasing the turnout ratio in vaccination centres.”On Tuesday, the CoWIN app was tweaked, allowing the ‘add beneficiary’ option to incorporate walk-in immunisation for registered health care worker.Max hospital, Saket, and BL Kapur hospital both saw 100% immunisation on Tuesday. The number of people who received the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences jumped to 55 on Tuesday from just eight a day ago.Hospitals that have consistently seen low turnout, like Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital , asked its senior faculty members to come forward and take the shot.“The hospital has issued a circular asking senior doctors and administrators to take the shot and motivate those working under them also to take it. Four of the senior doctors from the hospital received the shot today. This should instil confidence about the vaccine, among others,” said a senior doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which had seen 24 people being vaccinated on Monday and 28 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-docs-told-to-get-vaccinated-to-instil-confidence-101611079986044.html
20-01-2021||India||Vaccination lagging, govt appeals against hesitancy||There are at least three states where fewer than 40% of people turned up for coronavirus vaccination, top government officials said on Tuesday, calling hesitancy among doctors and nurses “upsetting” and issuing fervent appeals for them to come forward.The remarks were made at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19, which was opened by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who said three regions – Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Punjab – vaccinated fewer than 40% of their targets. Figures released later showed till Tuesday, 631,417 people have been inoculated in 11,660 sessions – translating to a coverage rate of 54 people per session, nearly half of the 100 identified as an appropriate threshold.Officials who asked not to be named said the situation is now so serious that in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where the health minister and a bevy of top officials launched the mammoth vaccination drive on Saturday, did 55 vaccinations on Tuesday, a day after doing only 8.Staff in other hospitals across Delhi now fear that vials of vaccine may go to waste if they don’t have 10 people to administer doses to within four hours of opening a vial.“If doctors and nurses are declining to take vaccines, it is upsetting. The government appeals to you – please come don’t be reluctant. Because we don’t know how the pandemic will shape up in the coming days,” said VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health).Paul and Bhushan said that three days of vaccinations have shown that adverse reactions were lower than what has been seen globally, and the adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI) monitoring mechanism was robust enough to catch any problems. Bhushan said the number of mild AEFIs – reactions such as pain, nausea, mild fever – were reported in 0.18% of people vaccinated till Monday night. Severe AEFIs, which required hospitalisations, accounted for 0.002% of the immunisations.“Look at the data, look at the AEFI surveillance system we have put in place. This system has been built over two-and-a-half decades. We should have faith on such a system. If something serious comes up, we will respond to it. But if there isn’t, why are we afraid? Vaccine hesitancy among health workers should end,” Paul said.Paul added that by India’s capacity and speed, health care workers in the country can be vaccinated “in a matter of not even months, but days”, and this, he said, could allow all health care services to be opened up.“We are very fortunate that we are able to begin vaccinations when our pandemic is under control. In this period, the most we can vaccinate, we must. We will reach vaccine-induced herd immunity soon,” he said.His appeal was reiterated by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director Balram Bhargava. “As we approach half a million vaccinations, it’s very clear both vaccines are very safe. There are three things we must remember about Covid vaccines: they do not cause Covid-19, they prevent Covid-19 infections, and they prevent Covid-19 deaths. The time to take a vaccine is now, when we can break the chain of transmission,” he said.Tuesday’s 54% vaccination rate was only marginally better than the 50% seen till Monday. According to preliminary figures released by the Union health ministry late in the evening, there were 3,800 sessions across the country throughout the day and roughly 180,000 vaccinations were done.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria told HT in an interview on Monday that some of the hesitancy has been fuelled by misconceptions about vaccines in general and due to misplaced concerns about safety of the two vaccines being used in India in particular. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that one of the vaccines, Covaxin made by Bharat Biotech, is yet to draw any significant clues from Phase 3 trials.The other factor hampering the colossal exercise has been glitches in the digital tool to identify and track recipients. The government moved to address problems with the Co-WIN mobile application after complaints from states. The app identifies 100 recipients for a particular session and triggers automatic SMS alerts. But as selected recipients failed to turn up, vaccinators discovered a flaw in the design that would not allow them to call in others instead – this problem was rectified on Tuesday.“We have made a provision in the app to also accommodate beneficiaries scheduled to take the jab on other dates. Earlier, the software wasn’t designed to accept beneficiaries outside the day’s list,” said Dr RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.The application is particularly crucial because India has created a matrix of recipients based on their vulnerability to the disease and their likelihood of catching the virus. First among the priority groups are health workers, who will be followed by frontline essential workers like police and cleaning staff, and ultimately people above 50 and those younger but with associated comorbid conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-lagging-govt-appeals-against-hesitancy-101611077863927.html
20-01-2021||India||First military team heads to Russia to train on S-400 air defence systems||The first group of Indian military specialists is set to travel to Russia for training in operating the S-400 air defence systems, deliveries of which are set to start this year against the backdrop of possible US sanctions.Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev on Tuesday described the upcoming departure of the Indian military team as a “remarkable occasion” that will usher in “a new stage in our strategic partnership”.He defended the $5.4 billion deal with India for five S-400 systems as part of Russia’s “bilateral and multilateral commitments” within the framework of “just and equal relations based on the international law and the UN Charter”.Kudashev was speaking at an event hosted by the Russian embassy in honour of the first team of Indian military specialists heading to Russia for the S-400 training courses.“S-400 supplies initiative is one of the flagship projects in the Russian-Indian military and military-technical cooperation, which historically constitutes the main pillar of the special and privileged strategic partnership between our two friendly countries,” he said.“It is based on mutual trust and reflects the true spirit of our bilateral and multilateral commitments in the framework of our vision towards just and equal relations based on the international law and the UN Charter.”Also Read: UN rights office ‘deeply troubled’ by Russian activist Alexei Navalny’s arrestKudashev had said last month that Russia’s ongoing deals with India for military hardware, including S-400 air defence systems, were “advancing well” despite the threat of potential US sanctions.India and Russia signed the $5.4 billion deal for five S-400 systems in October 2018, and the first batch is expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. All deliveries will be completed in a five-year period, Russia has said.The outgoing Trump administration in the US has reportedly told India it is unlikely to get a waiver under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the acquisition of the S-400, raising the risk of sanctions similar to those imposed on Turkey for buying the same systems.The Indian side is now keeping a close watch on the approach that will be adopted by the incoming Biden administration to arms purchases from Russia.Earlier this month, the external affairs ministry defended the S-400 deal as part of India’s independent foreign policy that guides defence acquisitions in line with national security interests.“India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests,” he added.Kudashev said Russia was also “successfully moving towards implementation” of several other arms deals, including the production of more than 700,000 AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles by a joint venture in India, the supply of 200 Ka-226 helicopters and production in India, advanced cooperation in combat aviation, main battle tanks, frigates, submarines and missiles, and joint production of the BrahMos cruise missile.The two countries are “deeply involved” in joint development and production of military equipment, components and spare parts, sharing of technologies and improving after-sales service. “We have developed an advanced legal base for this purpose,” he said.The India-Russia partnership is “becoming even stronger” in new areas and forms of mutually beneficial and forward-looking cooperation as the world moves from a bipolar order towards the “establishment of the polycentric order”, and this is “absolutely true for our military and military-technical ties”, Kudashev said.Russia is also looking towards the early implementation of a spare parts joint production agreement, which would fit well with the “Make in India” and “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives, he said. “Work also is going on [on] the mutual logistics support agreement, strengthening maritime cooperation, including in the Indian Ocean,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-military-team-heads-to-russia-to-train-on-s-400-air-defence-systems-101611052111424.html
20-01-2021||India||Government writes to WhatsApp, asks it to withdraw new privacy policy||The government has written to WhatsApp head Will Cathcart asking him to “respect the informational privacy and data security of Indian users” and withdraw the latest terms and privacy policy in India proposed by the messaging service for users. In a letter, it has expressed strong concerns over the policy days after HT on January 11 reported that the government was closely examining the matter.WhatsApp on January 4 updated its privacy policy to allow it to share user data with its parent company Facebook and other group firms . The data includes location and phone number.The move has triggered a backlash across the world and led to a surge in the downloading of alternative messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram. India is WhatsApp’s biggest market with 400 million users.The government has sent a questionnaire to WhatsApp seeking more details about its data-sharing protocols and business practices. It has sought the exact categories of data that the application collects from Indian users, details of the permissions and user consent sought by and utility of each of these with respect to the functioning and specific service provided. The service has been asked whether it profiles users based on their use of the application.The government has also sought details of the difference between WhatsApp’s privacy policies in India and other countries along with details of its data security, information security, cyber-security, privacy, and encryption policies.A WhatsApp spokesperson said, “We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.” Also read | The government can, and must, stand for privacyThe government has highlighted the latest policy will lead to the collection of “a vast amount of highly invasive and granular metadata”.“With this, any meaningful distinction between WhatsApp and Facebook companies will cease to exist. Given the huge user base of WhatsApp and Facebook in India, the consolidation of this sensitive information also exposes a very large segment of Indian citizens to greater security risks and vulnerabilities creating a honeypot of information,” a person familiar with the matter said, citing the contents of the letter to the WhatsApp chief.“This all-or-nothing approach takes away any meaningful choice from Indian users. This approach leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain, which may infringe on their interests in relation to informational privacy and information security. It is expected that Facebook will value the principles of privacy and consent as laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment of Justice K S Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017). The PDP [Personal Data Protection] Bill is under consideration, then why these changes.”The letter noted the “integration of data between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies” denies the user the choice to opt out of the policy.Also read | Don’t use WhatsApp if concerned about data: Delhi HCThe government has “raised strong objections against the differential treatment by WhatsApp to its users in India and in the European Union”. It added this has triggered serious criticism and “shows lack of respect for the rights and interests of Indian citizens, who form one of the largest user bases for WhatsApp”.The government underlined such treatment is “prejudicial to the interests of Indian users and is viewed with serious concern. “In this context, it [the letter] reminds WhatsApp that the Government of India owes a sovereign responsibility to its citizens to ensure that their interests are not compromised and therefore it calls upon WhatsApp to respond to concerns raised in this letter,” said the person cited above.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has summoned Facebook officials on January 21 amid privacy concerns about WhatsApp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-writes-to-whatsapp-asks-it-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-101611046410921.html
