He expanded the reservation system in the state to include Other Backward Classes to cover all types of backward and marginalised communities in Gujarat.“The KHAM theory was originally conceived by the Congress’ grassroots leader Jinabhai Darji and another veteran Sanat Mehta at Gela-Somnath in Surendranagar district. Solanki is being credited for the theory, but he was the one who effectively put it into action,” said veteran journalist MK Mistry, an eminent English journalism in Gujarat.Also read: Bengal governor meets Amit Shah, fears violence in run-up to crucial pollsCongress' fall in Gujarat, that began after Solanki’s resignation months after that huge victory in the wake of anti-reservation riots taking a communal turn in 1985, has only continued and the nonagenarian passed away amid its debris.The whiff of air - howsoever symbolic - that may have been left in the void in the Congress party, has gone with Solanki. The void is complete.The principal opposition party in Gujarat is yet to see a leader with the class that spawned from his knowledge of the social and democratic values nor has there been anyone with the gravitas of Madhavsinh Solanki. Many a political journalist, researcher, academician and bureaucrat would visit his personal library with over 5,000 books, including some rare ones that he painstakingly sourced from across the world.His background in literature and journalism is something that has found prominent mention in the tributes from CM Vijay Rupani-led government’s cabinet in an official resolution to pay homage to Solanki.Also read: Over 1,200 birds found dead across India; UP 7th state to report avian influenzaBorn on July 30, 1927, in Pilundra village of North Gujarat’s Mehsana district, Madhavsinh Solanki was the first to introduce the revolutionary mid-day meal scheme for government school children in Gujarat.“The Tamil Nadu government under MGR had first introduced mid-day meals. Solanki (as the CM) sent two senior bureaucrats to Chennai to study it. He wasted no time to implement it in Gujarat,” MK Mistry noted.“Solanki’s contribution towards inclusive education was immense. In those days, the initiative meant a great deal when he instructed his education minister Prabodh Rawal to ensure that every taluka (tehsil) in Gujarat had an ITI (Industrial Training Institute),” Mistry, 85, pointed out.Former chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, who grew and resurrected the BJP along with PM Narendra Modi fighting against Solanki and the Congress, said, “It was Madhavsinh Solanki who laid the foundation of the Sardar Sarovar Narmada project that you see today.”He went on, “I haven’t seen any politician with a rich library that he had. He was a visionary and his departure is a huge loss to Gujarat and the country.”It wasn’t the Mumbai-Pune toll expressway or the Ahmedabad-Vadodara toll expressway, but the Vadodara-Halol highway leading to Indore that became the first toll road initiated by Solanki.Solanki, who started his political career way back in 1947, became a chief minister for the first time in 1976. Next, from 1981 to 1985 and 1989 to 1990. He was Union external affairs minister between 1991 and 1992 and also of planning. Solanki’s son Bharatsinh is a senior leader and a former Union minister.The Gujarat government observed a day’s state mourning, as chief minister Vijay Rupani said Solanki’s death was a huge loss to Gujarat and created a void that was difficult to fill. The Gujarat Congress leaders, right from state president Amit Chavda, working president Hardik Patel, to Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani and a battery of others, besides party workers across Gujarat were left in grief by his departure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remembering-madhavsinh-solanki-congress-veteran-doyen-of-gujarat-politics-101610214744338.html

He also said that a 24-hour helpline has been set up for assistance of people.He said the Delhi government is following all guidelines and directions issued by the central government with regards to bird flu."Rapid response teams have been formed in every district to contain the spread and conduct proper surveillance, and they will function under the district magistrates. Our veterinary officers are conducting proper surveys in all bird markets, wildlife establishments and water bodies across Delhi."The special focus of the teams are poultry market Ghazipur, Shakti Sthal Lake, Bhalswa Lake, Sanjay Lake, Delhi Zoo, DDA Parks, situated at Hauz Khas village, Pashchim Vihar and Dwarka," Kejriwal added.At least 24 crows have been found dead at a district park in south Delhi's Jasola in the past three days and 10 ducks have died at the famous Sanjay Lake, officials said."The samples of ducks found dead have been taken by the veterinary department authorities to ascertain if the cause of death was bird flu or not," a senior DDA official said.On the death of crows, the DDA has informed the Delhi government's forest department, he said.Three recreational parks and famous Sanjay Lake in Delhi were closed by authorities amid an avian flu scare in the city as several birds were found dead on their premises in the last couple of days, officials said.Besides, the popular Hauz Khas Park in south Delhi, which is a huge water body and attracts a large number of crowd every day, has also been shut, they said.As many as 900 hens have died at a poultry farm in Murumba village in Parbhani district of Maharashtra, a senior official said.Their samples have been sent for investigation to identify the exact cause of the death, Parbhani district collector Deepak Mulgikar told PTI.He said the poultry farm where the death of birds was reported is run by a Self Help Group (SHG).Prima facie, the death of hens could be related to nutrition, the collector said, adding that the test results are awaited.Over 350 birds were reported dead in Rajasthan, taking the death count to 2,512, an official said.Of the 356 birds reported dead on Saturday, 257 were crows, 29 pigeons, 16 peacocks and 54 others.Even as Gujarat recorded its first confirmed cases of bird flu, four crows were found dead at a village in Mangrol taluka in the state's Junagadh district.The state on Friday recorded its first cases of bird flu after samples taken from two dead lapwings recovered in the district tested positive for the infection."We found carcasses of four crows at Loej village on Friday evening. The remains will be sent to a laboratory in Bhopal to ascertain the cause of death," said Ashok Kumbhani, veterinary officer of Mangrol veterinary dispensary in the district.Out of 10 birds found in the area, four were dead at the spot and six are currently under treatment, the official said.Six crows were found dead in Dakshina Kannada, bordering Kerala and samples have been sent for testing to ascertain the cause of death.Five crows were found dead in a drain in the Sitabpur area in Uttarakhand's Pauri Garhwal district. Samples of the dead birds have been sent to a laboratory in Bhopal for testing, Veterinary Officer BM Gupta said.A response team headed by a doctor and four health workers has been formed at the district level to keep a track on the death of birds and chickens and taking the samples for testing, Chief Veterinary Officer in Pauri SK Bartwal said.A drive to cull over 1.60 lakh poultry birds at five poultry farms commenced in Haryana's Panchkula district on Saturday, officials said.The move comes after samples of some birds in two poultry farms at Kheri and Ganauli villages in Panchkula tested positive for the H5N8 strain of avian flu on Friday."The process (to cull birds) started today by the state's animal husbandry department," Panchkula Deputy Commissioner M K Ahuja said.He said it will take around two to three days to complete the drive.The deputy commissioner further informed that a team of National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal would visit Panchkula next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-200-birds-found-dead-across-india-up-7th-state-to-report-avian-influenza-101610212424432.html

The man was rushed to a local hospital in Sonipat where he died, said Sonipat's Kundli police station's inspector Ravi Kumar.Farmers from various parts of the country, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month now demanding repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.The three laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40yearold-punjab-farmer-dies-after-consuming-poison-at-singhu-border-police-101610211046719.html

But, the leaders of the farmers are not ready. Therefore, I request all the leaders...on 15th (of January), there is a meeting with (Union agriculture minister) Narendra Singh Tomar," he said."I have confidence that leaders of the farmers... they should accept the proposal of the Government of India...," he told reporters here.It is not good for democracy if the laws are repealed as there could be more demands to abolish the laws made by Parliament, he said.The Centre is ready to make amendments with regard to the laws on the points raised by the leaders of farmers, he said.Farmers from Punjab are active in the ongoing agitation and those from other states are not so active, he claimed.He appealed to the TRS government in Telangana to provide five acres of land to landless poor, irrespective of caste affiliations, for their uplift.Athawale, president of Republican Party of India (RPI-A), favoured extending reservations to people from economically backward classes in the society.Referring to the demand by Maratha community in Maharashtra for quotas, he said the Reddy community in Telangana should be given reservation and the TRS government should take such a decision like the Maharashtra government did, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-leaders-should-discuss-with-govt-and-resolve-stir-ramdas-athawale-101610210676406.html

This is quite a huge number by any reckoning. 11 of these 30 governments had less than one year, ranging from six days to 334 days,” Naidu said.“Another three governments lasted less than two years. Only three governments lasted the full term of five years. The state was placed under the president's rule as many as five times of a total of 659 days which is about two years,” Naidu added.“Change of government mid-course for genuine and compelling reasons are democratically sanctioned. Frequent such changes raise the question of stability and the ability of the governments to deliver. Why? How has it happened? Stability and ability go together to make progress. Though Goa has done well despite such frequent changes of government, it is difficult to understand such a political flux," he stated.Also read: MP anti-conversion law comes into effect - All you need to know“This results in negative perceptions. The question I would like to raise is would Goa have done better with better political stability?” he asked.Naidu also lamented that the image of politicians is ‘going down’.“Unfortunately, the people's perception is that the right character among the politicians is in short supply. I am sorry, I am frank. One has to be frank. This is what is happening. The image of the politicians is going down, because of the conduct of some people,” Naidu said.The function was attended by Governor of Goa and Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari, chief minister Pramod Sawant, Speaker Rajesh Patnekar, Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat, among several other legislators of the past and present day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-govts-in-57-years-vp-naidu-questions-frequent-change-in-goa-s-leadership-101610208194109.html

Now, workers will also get an amount equivalent to the average pay of the last three months as compensation, a state government release said.Earlier, workers needed to be given three months' notice or wages for the notice period before retrenchment, while, as per the amendment, workers can be retrenched after giving them three months' notice only.Mittra said the exemptions are aimed at reducing the compliance burden on industries, which in turn will help the state attract new industries and investments to create more employment opportunities."The Covid-19 pandemic has adversely impacted industries and, thereby, economic growth. The government is trying to play the role of a facilitator to put growth back on track," Mittra said."These labour reforms, coupled with industry-friendly policies, quick decision-making, and availability of skilled manpower, will help Gujarat attract new industries. However, we are ensuring that interests of workers are protected," he added.Since the Industrial Disputes Act is a Central law, any change that states want to make must get the approval of the president.The Gujarat government has planned a series of measures to boost industrial activity, while also protecting workers' interests, an official release said.More ordinances were passed in the Assembly on the Contract Labour Act, Factory Act and Child act, and they are also expected to be approved soon, said the government release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarats-amendment-to-industrial-disputes-act-gets-presidential-nod-101610202392278.html

These institutions were working with just 60 to 70 per cent of the workforce."Baghel said this increased the income of the state during the pandemic.Regarding the ongoing protests by the farmers over newly enacted farm laws, he said: "The central government have understood that the new farm laws are not beneficial to the farmers, but are being hesitant to revoke the laws. This is why they asked the agitating farmers to go to Supreme Court."The Chhattisgarh CM is on his three-day visit to the Bastar division of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-must-distribute-coronavirus-vaccine-for-free-bhupesh-baghel-101610200265132.html
09-01-2021||India||AP govt moves HC against SEC's decision to hold gram panchayat polls||The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government on Saturday challenged the State Election Commissions decision to conduct elections to the gram panchayats and hurriedly moved a 'House Motion petition' in the High Court seeking that the poll process be stalled.The government did not get any relief as the High Court has not immediately taken up the petition and may consider it on Monday, authoritative sources said.State Election Commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar announced the schedule late on Friday night, overruling the state governments objections against the conduct of the elections, saying the polls to gram panchayats would be held in four phases in February.The ruling YSR Congress alleged that the SEC is "dancing to the tunes of Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu."YSRC MP V Vijaya Sai Reddy went on to announce that the gram panchayat elections would be held only in May-June after completion of the impending by-election to the Tirupati Lok Sabha seat.Taking strong exception to this, the State Election Commissioner wrote a letter to the Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das that such utterances would conclusively influence the government action (if not already done) vis-a-vis the local body elections."It is also indicative that the party (and the government by default) is not in favour of holding elections during the tenure of the present Commissioner and shall hold elections only after my demitting the office (on March 31, 2021)," Ramesh Kumar averred in the letter.The governments official line, however, has been that holding the elections would be difficult in view of the invocation of the National Disaster Management Act."The Covid-19 pandemic is tackled along with the vaccination programme being undertaken by the Union Ministry of Health and the whole state machinery would be engaged in the massive operation, " the Chief Secretary said in his reply to the SECs letter.But, with the SEC going ahead with the announcement of the poll schedule, the government minced no words in attacking Ramesh Kumar."The SEC acted in a pre-determined fashion and stubbornly announced the gram panchayat election schedule without considering the state governments request for further consultations," Panchayat Raj Principal Secretary Gopal Krishna Dwivedi said. "He did not consult the government while postponing the elections (in March last) and now while announcing the fresh schedule.This exposes the SECs intentions," he said in a statement.The SEC has put the public health at stake by unilaterally announcing the poll schedule, he alleged.The AP Non-Gazetted Officers Association president Chandrasekhar Reddy said the government staff would not take part in the poll process as it would jeopardise their lives.The Revenue Services Association president Bopparaju Venkateswarlu also opposed the SEC decision.The main opposition Telugu Desam Party welcomed the SEC decision to conduct the gram panchayat elections and said the governments stance on the issue amounted to breakdown of the Constitution."The government is supposed to act as per the Constitution but the Jagan regimes acts could lead to constitutional breakdown.Elections are inevitable and even the Supreme Court made it clear that seeking postponement of the polls without reason was not right," TDP senior leader and former minister Alapati Rajendra Prasad said.He wondered why the YSRC was shying away from the panchayat elections when it claims to have the support of 50 per cent of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-govt-moves-hc-against-sec-s-decision-to-hold-gram-panchayat-polls-101610201932212.html

Badal also said that all Congress party leaders, including chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, should support Rajoana’s release. The SAD chief also said that setting Rajoana free would be in consonance with Centre’s commitment to commute the death sentence into life imprisonment as a special gesture to the Sikh community on the eve of the 550th Parkash Utsav of Shri Guru Nanak Dev.“I request the union govt to set Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana free as a humanitarian gesture. He has served nearly 2 life terms in prison. All Cong leaders including Punjab CM @capt_amarinder should also back the release of Bhai Rajoana,” Badal wrote on Twitter.The Supreme Court had on Friday asked the Centre to take a decision before January 26 regarding Rajoana’s plea which sought commutation of his death penalty in the assassination case. Rajoana, a former constable of the Punjab police, was convicted for his involvement in the bomb blast outside the Punjab civil secretariat which killed Beant Singh and 16 other people in 1995. He has been serving time in jail for over 25 years.I request the union govt to set Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana free as a humanitarian gesture. He has served nearly 2 life terms in prison. All Cong leaders including Punjab CM @capt_amarinder should also back the release of Bhai Rajoana. 1/2Rajoana had approached the top court in 2019 complaining about the delay on the government’s part to process his mercy petition, which was filed in 2012 with the then president of the country. The Supreme Court had also questioned the government on December 4 last year over delay in sending the proposal for commuting his death sentence to the President. The top court further instructed the government to inform it about the date the authority would send the proposal in this regard to the President under the Constitution's Article 72.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who is appearing for Rajoana, argued that his client’s mercy petition was pending since 2012. “This court has held that the death sentence of a person, if delayed for over eight years, can be commuted. He has been in jail for 25 years,” Rohatgi added.Also Read| SC urges Centre to decide on Rajoana’s plea by Jan 26Meanwhile, the Union home ministry said a decision on Rajoana’s mercy petition was put on hold as the appeals filed by other co-accused in the case, were pending before the Supreme Court.

It is my job to keep the Centre informed. 2021 is a crucial year because of the elections. I have been constantly appealing for free and fair polls and asking public servants to shun politics. I hope people organizing the elections will take note and take action so that Bengal becomes an example for the rest of the country and the world,” said Dhankhar.“The Election Commission of India (ECI) is competent but every citizen has a role. As governor I have to protect the Constitution. I am not a stakeholder in politics. My only concern is that the election process should not tamper the Constitution. I confine myself to constitutional limitations,” said Dhankhar when asked to react to the TMC’s allegation that he crosses his jurisdiction.“Public servants (in Bengal) indulging in political activity are playing with fire. They should stop being political foot soldiers. My repeated warnings have had some effect. Most of them have rectified themselves,” Dhankhar added.Senior TMC leader and Rajya Sabha Member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said the governor stepped out of his jurisdiction once again.“The governor, knowing it fully well that conduct, superintendence and control of assembly, Lok Sabha and Rajya elections are within the domain of the ECI, is shamelessly repeating the rhetoric and he will ensure free and fair elections,” Roy told HT.“He has also alleged that the 2019 elections were not free and fair in West Bengal. The question is whether such wild allegations of the governor are endorsed by the ECI. Isn’t the governor, who is otherwise a magnificent cipher, not only stepping out of his jurisdiction but is also transgressing into the jurisdiction of the ECI?” said Roy.Roy was among the five TMC MPs who made an appeal to the President in December seeking Dhankhar’s removal.“In exercise of your power conferred under Article 156(1) of the Constitution of India, you may be graciously pleased to kindly consider withdrawing your pleasure for holding the office of Governor of West Bengal by Hon’ble Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar for a serious breach of oath of his office.....,” read the letter the MPs wrote to Ram Nath Kovind.Though increasing acrimony has marked the relationship between the Bengal government and the Governor House, Dhankhar told the media on Saturday that neither he nor chief minister Mamata Banerjee were aware of any tension between them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-meets-amit-shah-fears-violence-in-run-up-to-crucial-polls-101610206602019.html

09-01-2021||India||23 Indian sailors stranded in Chinese waters set to return next week||Twenty-three Indian sailors stranded in Chinese waters for almost seven months are set to return home after a crew change was arranged for their vessel at a Japanese port, minister of state for shipping Mansukh Mandaviya said on Saturday.A total of 39 Indian seafarers on the MV Jag Anand and MV Anastasia have been stranded off two Chinese ports for months, and India had been exploring several options to bring them back. The situation is believed to be the outcome of the China-Australia trade row - both vessels were carrying Australian coal and weren’t allowed to discharge their cargo.The 23 Indians on MV Jag Anand are now expected to return next week, though there was no official word on the status of 16 Indians on MV Anastasia.“Our Seafarers stuck in China are coming back to India! Ship M.V. Jag Anand, having 23 Indian crews, stuck in China, is set to sail toward Chiba, Japan to carry out crew change...This could only happen due to strong leadership of [Prime Minister] @NarendraModiji,” Mandaviya said in a tweet.The seafarers are expected to reach Chiba port on January 14, and will fly back to India after the completion of procedures related to Covid-19 protocols, Mandaviya said.The minister said he appreciated the humanitarian approach of Great Eastern Shipping Company, the owner of MV Jag Anand, towards the sailors and for “standing by them in this crucial time”.India had on Friday said it had again taken up with China the issue of bringing back all 39 stranded sailors and was awaiting a response from Beijing and shipping companies to various options for handling the matter. Among these options was seeking early approval from China for a crew change, as is being done in the case of MV Jag Anand.Chinese authorities have outlined detailed steps for a crew change in view of the country’s strict pandemic control and prevention measures, and these have to be complied with by the shipping companies, the external affairs ministry had said.MV Jag Anand has been at anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, while MV Anastasia has been on anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20.In a separate development, the Indian embassy in Beijing said on Saturday that it has been repeatedly advised by Chinese authorities that Covid-19-related restrictions in place are unlikely to be relaxed in the coming months and courses for Indian students studying in China “are likely to continue only through online means” for the next semester.A statement issued by the embassy indicated that it wouldn’t be possible for Indian students to return to China in the near future. “Even as the embassy continues to take up the matter with Chinese authorities, there has unfortunately been no positive evolution of this situation,” it said.Following reports of resurgence of Covid-19 cases in China, authorities have reinforced epidemic controls and restrictions on travel and entry. “The suspension of visas of Indian nationals issued before November 2, 2020...is an instance of these enhanced controls,” the statement said.Chinese authorities have also denied permission for chartered flights between the two countries in view of the strict control measures.“While the embassy is aware of the difficulty of undertaking courses in medicine in online format, Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities are advised to take note of the restrictions currently in place and make appropriate arrangements for continuing their education,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23-indian-sailors-stranded-in-chinese-waters-set-to-return-next-week-101610203639651.html
09-01-2021||India||Kerala local body polls: Polling officer says MLA threatened him during polls||The State Election Commission has sought a report from the Kasaragod district collector on a complaint filed by a polling officer alleging that a CPI(M) legislator from the district had threatened him during the local body polls held last month.A polling officer on duty at the GLP school in nearby East Chekapara has complained to the State Election Commission (SEC) recently that the Uduma MLA K Kunhiraman had threatened him, for verifying credentials of voters."We have sought a report in the incident from the District Election officer (District Collector) and from the returningofficer of the panchayat.Based on the report, we will take necessary action," State Election Commissioner V Bhaskaran told PTI.K M Sreekumar, Professor, Agricultural Entomology, Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) in nearby Peelicode, was on election duty as the presiding officer at the polling station.Sreekumar accused the MLA of silencing him when he raised a dispute over bogus voting during the third phase of the local body polls on December 14."Let the first polling officer verify and you keep mum.If you don't listen to what we say, your legs will be chopped off," the complaint, quoting the MLA's alleged remarks, said.Sreekumar, a leftist and also the president of the Peelicode unit of the Teacher's Organisation of Kerala Agricultural University, has also claimed there were only CPI-M agents at the booth, facilitating unquestioned bogus voting.The incident came to light when Sreekumar posted about the incident on Facebook.Senior officials from the election commission said the polling officer was supposed to report incidents of bogus voting or threats, to the police and the returning officer concerned the same day or the next day.The CPI-M block panchayat candidate first intervened and demanded that he desist from the formality of identifying the voter and later the MLA asserted the demand, the complainant alleged."The MLA threatened me when we continued with formalities as the same voters who cast their votes earlier returned to cast bogus votes," Sreekumar alleged.However, the MLA has denied the charges and said he intervened when the officer tried to refuse the right to vote for a voter.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala said a criminal case should be registered against the MLA for threatening a poll officer."A criminal case should be registered against the MLA for threatening the poll officer who tried to stop the bogus voting," Chennithala said.Polling,held in three phases, was completed on December 14 and the results were out on December 16 in which the Left parties got a comfortable victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-local-body-polls-polling-officer-says-mla-threatened-him-during-polls-101610203799784.html
09-01-2021||India||Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan will make world order more just and fair: Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday that the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan would make the world order more just and fair, promoting greater cooperation and peace.Virtually addressing the valedictory session of the 16th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention, he said that the idea of self-reliant India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, does not mean seeking self-centred arrangements or turning the country inwards."It is about self-belief, leading to self-sufficiency. We intend to contribute towards mitigating disruptions in global supply chains by enhancing the availability of goods and services," the president said."The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan of India will make the world order more just and fair, promoting greater cooperation and peace," Kovind said."Our diaspora has an important role in the realisation of India's global aspirations. Our diaspora is our face to the world and champions India's cause on the global stage,” he said.Kovind said it has always come to India's aid, whether it is for advocacy regarding international issues of concern to India, or contributing to the Indian economy by way of investments and remittances.The president said that on this very day in 1915, Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest Pravasi Bharatiya, returned to India."He gave a much wider base to our social reforms and freedom movement, and during the next three decades, he changed India in many fundamental ways.“Before that, during his two decades of stay abroad, Bapu had identified the basic principles underlying the approach India should adopt for its growth and development,” Kovind said.He said that Pravasi Bharatiya Divas is also an occasion to recall Gandhiji’s ideals for individual and collective life.“Gandhiji's emphasis on Indianness, nonviolence, ethics, simplicity and sustainable development remain our guiding principles,” Kovind said.The president said, "We are indebted to Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee whose vision re-energised the links with our diaspora. The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas celebrations started in 2003 when he was the Prime Minister of India. Atalji's initiatives have proved immensely helpful in strengthening the engagement of diaspora with the motherland."Kovind noted that India has one of the largest diaspora populations of nearly 30 million, residing in every corner of the world today.Addressing the Indian diaspora, he said, “You have spread the soft power of India and made your mark on the global stage. Your continued emotional attachment to India, its culture and traditions makes all of us very proud of you."“You have been contributing to the growth and development of the countries of your residence and, at the same time, you have been carrying your Indianness in your hearts. This emotional bonding has also translated into tangible gains for India. You have expanded India’s global embrace.”Speaking about the coronavirus pandemic, the president said that year 2020 has been the year of a global crisis caused by COVID-19.“India has been at the forefront in forging a global response to combat the enormous challenges posed by the pandemic. We supplied medicines to nearly 150 countries, making the world look at India as the ‘pharmacy of the world."“The recent success of our scientists and technicians in developing two COVID vaccines is a major achievement for the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan which is driven by the spirit of global well-being,” he said.Kovind said that the seeds of an Atmanirbhar Bharat were sown many years ago by Mahatma Gandhi's call for Swadeshi and self-reliance.“Our vision of aatmanirbhar Bharat has five key pillars of economy, infrastructure, demography, democracy and supply chains. Successful integration of all these factors will help achieve rapid growth and development,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmanirbhar-bharat-abhiyaan-will-make-world-order-more-just-and-fair-kovind-101610202322233.html

The Tirumalai Nayak Mahal, Madurai, Marudhu Pandiyar Fort in Sivagangai district, Udayagiri fort in Kanyakumari district among others which were refurbished were inaugurated by the chief minister through video conference from the secretariat, a release said. According to sources in the archaeology department, adequate amenities have been provided at the renovated sites for the benefit of the tourists. "Restoring the forts and palaces was a herculean task. The Marudhu Pandiyar fort, for instance, was reduced to rubble in 1800. We resurrected it at a cost of ₹60.13 lakh," a senior official in the Archaeology department said. Similarly, the Thirumalai Nayak palace built in 1636 AD and the Udayagiri fort, which was originally a mud structure and rebuilt with stones by King Marthanda Varma, were also painstakingly restored. The timely intervention by the Archaeology department in the form of restoration and conservation saved the ancient heritage monuments from further deterioration, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-cm-inaugurates-eight-renovated-heritage-structures-101610203041369.html

09-01-2021||India||Farm laws: Congress to protest outside governor houses across country on Jan 15||The Congress party on Saturday announced that it will stage protests outside governor houses across the country on January 15 to extend its support to the ongoing farmers' agitation."Why the government is not fulfilling its duties towards people? The government is sold out to few capitalists. The Congress party has decided to celebrate 'Kisan Adhikar Diwas' on January 15 while holding protest and demonstration at district headquarters. We will also organise rallies and after the rallies, we will march towards governor houses across the country. Now, the time has come to listen farmers' voices," said Congress' General Secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala.This comes a day after the eighth round of talks between the government and the farmer unions remained inconclusive. The government asked farmer unions to "give an option other than repealing" and the next round of talks is proposed for January 15.While addressing a press conference here, Surjewala alleged that government is playing the games of meetings instead of repealing "black laws"."Instead of repealing the black laws, Modi government is playing meeting-meeting, giving dates for talks. Farmers have been protesting for the last 40 days and 60 farmers have died. Prime Minister has not spoken a word condoling the demise of those farmers. This is the fight against the attrocities of government by farmers," he added.The Congress party will also run a campaign on social media with *SpeakUpForFarmers on January 15, Surjewala said.This comes after a meeting, which was charied by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, with party general secretaries and in-charges in connection with the ongoing farmers' agitation at the borders of Delhi.According to sources, in the virtual meeting discussion was held on the situation and to chalk out a strategy to support farmer's protests. Congress has been in support of the farmers in their movement against the newly enacted farm laws by the Centre in September.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party is anti-farmers while Congress works towards their betterment. He said Congress will fight with the farmers to get the three farm laws repealed.The Congress party has time and again slammed the Union government over the farm laws. Earlier, Rahul Gandhi met with President Ram Nath Kovind to discuss the laws and the issues faced by protesting farmers.With concerns that farm laws would weaken the minimum support system and mandi systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital for over a month against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Maintaining that the apprehensions are misplaced, the government has ruled out repealing the laws and asked farmer leaders to hold a discussion on clause by clause of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-congress-to-protest-outside-governor-houses-across-country-on-jan-15-101610198435593.html
09-01-2021||India||‘Ready to contest polls if Cong offers seat in Ernakulam’: Ex Kerala HC judge||Former judge of the Kerala High Court, Justice B Kemal Pasha, who is known for his proactive stand on critical issues, said on Saturday that he is willing to contest the upcoming assembly polls if the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) offered him a seat in Ernakulam district.Talking to reporters in Ernakulam he said lone voices won’t make much of an impact in the present world and it is always good to be part of a collective movement. “Earlier some leaders have approached me with a suggestion to contest from Punalur, my native place in Kollam district. Since I am settled in Ernakulam I told them if you give me a seat in the district I will consider it,” he said adding if elected he won’t accept the salary of a legislator.Asked if the ruling CPI(M) or the BJP offered him a seat instead, he said he won’t accept it because he was more inclined to the Congress ideology and fascinated by its role in the freedom movement. People with integrity and eminence should join politics rather than criticising the system sitting on the sidewalks. “I have taken a strong position against corruption throughout my life. If I get a chance to extend my fight and take my ideals into politics, there is nothing wrong in it. Personally I feel more people should join politics,” he said. Congress leaders are yet to react to his suggestion.A staunch critic of the ruling party he was chided by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday while inaugurating two flyovers in Kochi. Pasha had supported “We for Kochi, a non-political youth movement, activists last week when they opened one of the flyovers for traffic. Activists had claimed that it was waiting for the date of the CM for inauguration, though its works were completed long back. Later many activists of the movement were arrested and slapped stringent charges. Pasha had justified their act saying “any beggar can cut the ribbon once work is completed.”Two years back his security was withdrawn after he criticised the government on a number of issues. He was given security after intelligence agencies warned that he was facing threats from some extremist elements. When five nuns staged a sit-in in Kochi in 2018 seeking action against rape accused former bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mullakal he openly supported them. Similarly he criticised the alleged inaction of the government in the rape and murder of two siblings in Walayar. Since his retirement in 2018 he extended his support to many popular issues in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-contest-polls-if-cong-offers-seat-in-ernakulam-ex-kerala-hc-judge-101610196888722.html

In the last year, NRIs have strengthened their identity in every field.Colleagues,I have had discussions with many Heads of the state in the past months. State Heads specifically mentioned how their country has been served by expatriate Indian doctors, paramedics, and ordinary Indian citizens.

The contribution you made to PM Cares is being used to strengthen Health Infra in India. I thank all of you for this.Colleagues,The great saint and philosopher of India, Saint Thiruvalluvar has said in Tamil, the oldest language in the world, and we should say it proudly, the oldest language in the world-Kaa-dariyak ketta iddattum vadngundra.Nadenp Nattin Talai.Its sense is that - the best land in the world is that which does not learn evils from its opponents and which, if ever in trouble, does not decrease the welfare of others.Colleagues,You all have shown this mantra by living it. This has always been the specialty of our India. Whether it is time for peace or crisis, we Indians have always faced every situation firmly. Because of this, we have seen a different behavior about this great land. When India opened the front against colonialism, it became the inspiration for the freedom struggle in many countries of the world. When India stood in front of terrorism, the world also got new courage to fight this challenge.Colleagues,India today is using technology more and more to end corruption. Lakhs of crores of rupees, which earlier used to reach the wrong hands due to all the deficiencies, are now reaching directly into the bank account of the beneficiary.

Those fears proved to be wrong, and we gained freedom.Colleagues,When India got independence, it was also said that such a poor and so little educated India, this India will be broken, shattered, democracy is impossible here. Today's truth is that India is also united and if democracy is the strongest, vibrant, vibrant in the world, then it is in India.brothers and sisters,For decades after independence, it was also operative that India is poor and uneducated, hence the possibilities of investment in science and technology were underestimated. Today, our Tech Startup eco-system, India's space program, is a world leader. In the year of Kovid's challenge, many new Unicorns and hundreds of new Tech Startups have come out of India.Friends,In this era of Pandemic, India again showed what our potential is, what our potential is.

We have hereShathaast Samah Sahastharast San KiranThat is, earn with hundreds of hands, but share with thousands of hands. This is also the sentiment behind India's self-reliance. The products that will be made in India by the hard work of millions of Indians, the solutions that will be prepared in India, will benefit the whole world. The world can never forget how India played a role in Y-2, how India had worried the world. The role of our pharma industry even in these difficult times, it shows that in whatever field India is capable, its benefits reach the whole world.Colleagues,Today, if the whole world has so much trust in India, then all you overseas Indians also have a big contribution in this. Wherever you went, took India along with Indianness. You continued to live Indianism. You have also awakened people with Indianness. And you see Food or Fashion, Family Values ​​or Business Values, you have spread Indianness. It has always been my belief that if the culture of India has become popular all over the world, all this is possible because of the life of you, more than the magazines, cookbooks or manuals, because of your behavior, because of your behavior is. India has never imposed or tried to impose anything on the world, has never thought of imposing it, but all of you in the world have created a curiosity, an interest for India. It may have started with prodigy, but it has reached conviction.Today, when India is moving forward to become self-reliant, here too your role is important in strengthening the identity of Brand India. When you make more and more use of Made In India Products, then the confidence around them will also increase. When you see your colleagues, your friends using Made In India Products, will you not be proud of it? From Tea to Textile and Therapy, it can be anything.

In such a situation, it is time to remember those comrades, even those fighters who worked for the independence of India while staying outside India.I would urge all the people of the Indian community around the world, all those who are sitting in our mission, to create a digital platform, create a portal and in that portal for the overseas Indians who played a special role in the freedom struggle Have played, all their fact-based things should be kept in it.

09-01-2021||India||In Bengal, Nadda defends agri laws, reaches out to farmers||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda on Saturday defended the three farm laws enacted in September, saying they will enable farmers to set the prices of their products and choose the buyers even as the legislation has triggered protracted protests.Speaking at the launch of BJP’s first campaign for farmers in poll-bound West Bengal’s East Burdwan, which is considered the state’s rice bowl, Nadda cited the measures the government has taken over the last six years for the farm sector. “Since the BJP came to power at the Centre [in 2014], Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made a six-fold increase in the central budget for farmers. He implemented the minimum support price [at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production] recommended by the Swaminathan Committee,” Nadda saidNadda insisted the three farm laws will make farmers free. “These will enable farmers to set the price of their products and choose the buyer,” Nadda said.Nadda’s statement came a day after the eighth round of talks between the Centre and farmer unions failed to end the deadlock on Friday. The Centre maintained it would not scrap the three laws and asked farmer unions to wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. The farm leaders stuck to the stand that the laws must be repealed and raised placards saying they will “prevail or die”.Sharp exchanges and tense arguments between the two sides were also reported even as they agreed to meet again on January 15.Thousands of protesting farmers have encircled Delhi for 45 days, demanding the government scrap the laws.The Supreme Court is set to take up a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the laws on Monday. The petitions have argued that the federal government does not have the powers to bring legislation on the agriculture sector because it falls in the domain of states. The farm leaders have said even if the laws were declared constitutionally valid, they would continue to demand their repeal.Nadda, who also said that Bengal ranks 24th in the country when it comes to procurement price paid to farmers, announced the BJP will hold 40,000 meetings across Bengal before the assembly elections.Nadda also launched the door-to-door rice collection programme. He visited five homes and collected the rice in a saffron bag slung on his left shoulder.Nadda, who offered prayers at the temple associated with the 15th-century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, later had lunch at a farmer’s house.Nadda’s visit to Bengal comes as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government is planning to hold a special session of the assembly to pass a resolution against the three farm laws.Nadda said the enthusiasm he has noticed shows that people of West Bengal have made up their mind to welcome the BJP. He added chief minister Mamata Banerjee has now written to the Centre that she wants to implement the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi programme. “We have been asking her for a long time to do it.”Nadda accused the TMC leadership of corruption and misappropriating ration the Centre sent in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Smuggling of coal and sand is all that you hear about these days. The Calcutta high court ordered an audit into the expenses made towards relief [after cyclone Amphan]. But the government challenged it in the Supreme Court. Why? Why is Mamata Banerjee so worried?” TMC Lok Sabha leader Saugata Roy reacted to Nadda’s comments, saying the BJP chief is from Himachal Pradesh and questioned what does he know about Bengal. “Spreading misinformation will not help the BJP. The TMC will return to power with an absolute majority.” Nadda was scheduled to offer prayers at the Sarbamangala temple in Burdwan, lead a roadshow and visit the BJP district office to address the media and the party’s core committee members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bengal-nadda-defends-agri-laws-reaches-out-to-farmers-101610188108085.html

Khandate said there were 17 newborns, aged between a month and three months, admitted at the SNCU unit of the hospital when the fire broke out. A doctor and a nurse were on duty at the time of the incident. The nurse first noticed the smoke coming from the neonatal section and informed the hospital authorities. The fire brigade was called immediately, which rescued seven babies, who were then shifted to another ward, he added.The cause of the fire in the four-storey building is yet to be ascertained. However, preliminary investigations suggest that a short circuit could have caused the tragedy. It was said that electric warmers were being used at the neonatal unit at the hospital.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the several political leaders who expressed grief over the accident. "Heart-wrenching tragedy in Bhandara, Maharashtra, where we have lost precious young lives. My thoughts are with all the bereaved families. I hope the injured recover as early as possible," PM Modi tweeted.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also issued a statement demanding an investigation."The government should carry out a thorough inquiry into the incident and initiate action against those who are responsible for the death of 10 infants. It is a very painful accident," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-orders-probe-into-bhandara-hospital-fire-that-killed-10-infants-101610187085041.html

The monument earlier reopened in September months after it was shut in March following a lockdown imposed to curb the pandemic spread.The cancellation of the festival has come as a fresh setback to Agra’s tourism industry that has been facing massive losses due to the pandemic.“The concerns of the administration are understandable but the cancellation, for whatever reason, would send a negative message about tourism prospect in the city of Taj,” said Sandeep Arora, president, Agra Tourism Development Foundation.Rakesh Chauhan, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Agra, echoed Arora. “While all the trades are moving in full swing now, the cancellation of Taj Mahotsav would not be a welcome move. However, we understand the reasons leading to such decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-forces-taj-mahotsav-cancellation-for-the-first-time-since-1992-101610176617100.html

09-01-2021||India||Ready to protect humanity with 2 ‘Made in India’ Covid vaccines: PM Modi||India is ready with two “Made in India” coronavirus vaccines to protect humanity from Covid-19 even as the world is watching the roll-out of the world’s largest vaccination programme in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday. Addressing the virtual inaugural session of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention, Modi said India was continuing to play its role as the “world’s pharmacy” by getting essential medicines to those most in need around the world. “We are ready to protect humanity with two ‘Made in India’ corona vaccines,” he said. “The world is not only waiting for India’s vaccine, but everyone is watching how India runs the world’s largest vaccination programme.” Indian authorities recently cleared the Serum Institute’s Covishield, or the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, for restricted use in an emergency situation subject to regulatory conditions, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine was approved for restricted use in emergency situations in “clinical trial mode”. Amid the pandemic, India supplied medicines and medical equipment to some 150 countries, including materials that were provided as grants to several neighbours and developing nations. Several countries have also expressed an interest in acquiring vaccines from India. Modi said the lessons learned by India during the pandemic had become the inspiration for the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, and this movement for self-reliance is meant to help others as “Made in India” products and solutions will benefit the world. The world still remembers the role played by India to address the Y2K issue and now the role of the country’s pharmaceutical industry has shown that the whole world benefits when India enters any particular arena, he said. “If there is so much trust in India, the diaspora too has made a big contribution,” he said, adding that Indian-origin people had taken Indian culture and “lived it and inspired others”, including through their food and family and business values. “India has never imposed anything on the world, nor has it tried to do so or even though of doing so,” Modi said. As India moves forward with its self-reliance initiative, the diaspora will have to play an important role in making Brand India stronger. “If you use more Made in India products, the trust of others in them will increase,” he said. Atmanirbhar Bharat will also help take affordable and quality solutions to the world’s poorest, and the investments, remittances, expertise and networks of the diaspora can help drive this initiative, he added. At the same time, the government’s structural reforms and subsidy scheme for manufacturing have increased investment opportunities for the diaspora, he pointed out. Amid the pandemic, India repatriated lakhs of its nationals through the Vande Bharat Mission and took steps at the diplomatic level to protect the employment of Indians abroad, he said, adding that a database was also created of the skills of workers who returned from West Asia and other regions so that they can be connected to Indian and foreign employers. Modi said the past year was “one of many challenges for everyone”, but the way the Indian diaspora had rendered services and fulfilled its responsibilities was a matter of pride for India. “For social and political leadership across the world, the trust in Indian-origin people is becoming greater,” he said. He said many heads of states he had talked to had made specific mention of the services rendered by Indian doctors, paramedics and citizens services, while the help extended by gurdwaras, temples and organisations in difficult circumstances was also a matter of pride. The contributions of the diaspora to the PM Cares fund had helped strengthen health infrastructure in India, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-to-protect-humanity-with-2-made-in-india-covid-vaccines-pmmodi-101610187386774.html

It asked the government to come up with fool-proof methods by which it intended to control the spread of the infection.“They may keep in mind that such congregations during the month of Magh are very large, and if even one infected person sneaks into the city, he can create havoc,” the court said.The court directed the state government to place before it a definite date and intended programme of the Covid-19 vaccination in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcexpresses-dissatisfaction-over-up-s-covid-19-steps-for-prayagrag-s-magh-mela-101610187385109.html

Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh at Chilla and Ghazipur have remained closed for those coming from Noida and Ghaziabad, while the opposite carriageway remains open. For those coming into Delhi from Uttar Pradesh, the traffic police advised them to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders, which have remained mostly unaffected. The police have continued checking these border points for groups of protesting farmers who may try to sneak in, but it has only slowed down traffic there a little, not choked or blocked them entirely. For borders shared between Delhi and Haryana, the routes passing through Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Manyari and Saboli and Mangesh have continued to remain closed.Jhatikara border is open for light vehicles and pedestrians while only a single carriageway of the Jharoda border is open for traffic.

The Indian-origin president made the suggestions while delivering the keynote address as chief guest at the virtual Pravasi Bharatiya Divas Convention, the external affairs ministry’s flagship event to connect with overseas Indians. People of Indian-origin, mostly descendents of indentured workers taken from the Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the 19th century, constitute the largest ethnic group in Suriname and account for more than a quarter of the country’s population of almost 550,000. Santokhi, who began and ended his speech by speaking in a Bhojpuri dialect that is common in Suriname, proposed that the two countries should introduce the free movement of people without requiring visas. “Suriname is prepared to take a first step in doing so by ending visa permits for visitors from India to Suriname,” he said. He also reiterated a proposal he first made in 2017 to establish a special Indian diaspora committee to study opportunities for cooperation in areas such as information technology and science and to come up with a report with practical proposals that can benefit both countries. Such measures will benefit tourism and give impetus to business opportunities between the two sides. “The importance of the Indian diaspora can and must be one of mutual benefits. If we approach the opportunities in this way, we can achieve great things for our countries,” he said. The “Suriname diaspora is part of India’s soft power” and consequently, “India is also part of Suriname’s soft power”, Santokhi added. Calling for greater business ties between the two sides, Santokhi said Suriname would welcome Indian expertise to achieve food security, which he identified as one of the main global challenges, and to re-establish the country’s rice industry that once exported its products to the Punjab. Diaspora students and researchers should be able to tap into Indian expertise, while Suriname’s young population can be a great resource for IT consultancy and development, he said. “In this inter-connected world we all live in, we value international relationships based on respect and mutual benefits,” he added. Santokhi said Suriname and India have historical connections going back 148 years, which have shaped the lives of many migrants who travelled from India but maintained their cultural roots and heritage. “Like many of my countrymen, I am also the product of this history of migration,” he said. Suriname’s political leadership has been inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi to bring people together and to “do so peacefully and in the traditions of an open and democratic society”. He added: “I also feel pride in being of Indian heritage, a heritage and culture which was passed on by my parents and grandparents, who 148 years ago, started this adventurous journey from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and sailed from Kolkata in search of their dreams for a better life in Suriname,” he said. Suriname’s Hindustanis are part of every aspect of society and the country is a democracy governed by rule of law based on universal principles such as equality, non-discrimination, respect for basic human rights, free speech and freedom to worship any faith, Santokhi said. At the same time, the Indian-origin people maintained their heritage, culture and customs, and Suriname now has “vibrant Hindu and Muslim communities” that speak Bhojpuri, observe Diwali as a national holiday, cherish Bollywood and benefit from Indian IT, he said. “In short, India and Suriname are bonded on many levels – historically, religiously, linguistically and culturally,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suriname-president-santokhi-proposes-visa-free-travel-with-india-greater-cooperation-in-it-and-hitech-101610187323192.html

09-01-2021||India||PLA soldier strays across LAC, held near Pangong Tso||The Indian Army apprehended a Chinese soldier near the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh on Friday after he strayed across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), amid the ongoing border standoff between the two sides, officials familiar with the developments said on Saturday. This is the second time a Chinese soldier has been held by the Indian Army after straying into Indian territory since the border row erupted last May. “The People’s Liberation Army (PLA soldier) had transgressed across the LAC and was taken into custody by Indian troops deployed in this area (south of Pangong Tso). Troops from either side are deployed along the LAC since friction erupted last year due to unprecedented mobilisation and forward concentration by Chinese troops,” the army said in a statement. Heights on both banks of the lake have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries. The PLA soldier is being dealt with according to procedures, and circumstances under which he crossed the LAC are being investigated, the statement said. The soldier is likely to be returned after the completion of formalities involved in such cases, the officials said. In October 2020, the Indian Army had apprehended a Chinese soldier in the Demchok sector after he strayed across the LAC. The army identified the soldier as Corporal Wang Ya Long. It then said it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier. Corporal Wang was provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes. The soldier was returned to the Chinese side after the investigations and formalities were completed. While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers. The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-soldier-strays-across-lac-held-near-pangong-tso-101610187208810.html

To deal with the crisis, the South district education office has shortlisted 30 teachers to take additional classes in different schools till another arrangement is made.The crisis began with over 8,000 school teachers’ termination after March last year. Total 10,323 schools teachers were terminated following an order of the Tripura high court in 2014, due to faulty recruitment. The apex court upheld the HC order in 2017. Over 8,000 affected teachers were reappointed on an adhoc basis, the tenure for which expired on March 31 last year.According to officials from the district education office, there is a shortage of 87 teachers of different subjects in 67 higher secondary schools in the district.“We need teachers in English, Bengali, Economics, Political Science, History, Sanskrit, Biology and Chemistry. We have asked nearly 30 teachers to take classes in some schools for three days a week in addition to their normal duties. That means, they will take classes three days in their own schools and another three days in other schools. We have started the process since last month,” said South district education officer Lakshman Chandra Das.A memo was issued recently from his office asking some teachers to take additional classes in other schools. “Due to acute shortage of teaching staff at Abhoynagar H.S School, Belonia, West Bokafa H.S School, Santirbazar & Muhuripur H.S School, Santirbazar, the following allotment of duties are hereby made for the interest of students of the schools,” the memo signed by the district education officer said.However, no separate data on the crisis of teachers from seven other districts has been made available.Currently, the sacked teachers are holding a sit-in-demonstration since last December 7, demanding a permanent solution to their situation.The state has nearly 27,000 school teachers in 4,400 government run and government-aided schools. There are over 3,100 teachers in 160 secondary and senior secondary schools in the South district.The Tripura Teachers’ Recruitment Board started a recruitment drive last November to fill up 4,080 vacancies in teaching posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-schools-face-severe-shortage-after-termination-of-8-000-teachers-101610184669368.html

This is the second such incident reported since October last year.“The People’s Liberation Army (PLA soldier) had transgressed across the LAC and was taken into custody by Indian troops deployed in this area (south of Pangong Tso). Troops from either side are deployed along the LAC since friction erupted last year due to unprecedented mobilisation and forward concentration by Chinese troops,” the army said in a statement.Watch: Indian Army detains Chinese soldier after he crosses LAC in LadakhHeights on both banks of the lake have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries.The PLA soldier is being dealt with according to procedures and circumstances under which he crossed the LAC are being investigated, the statement said. The soldier is likely to be returned after the completion of formalities involved in such cases, the officials said.On October 19 last year, Corporal Wang Ya Long of the PLA was apprehended by the Indian Army in eastern Ladakh’s Demchok sector after he strayed across the contested LAC amid the prevailing border tensions with China in the sensitive region. He was returned to the PLA the next day at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point, where senior commanders from both armies have been holding military talks to reduce friction in the eastern Ladakh theatre.“The PLA soldier was apparently moving from one location to another on the Chinese side of the LAC when he lost his way. He was carrying a sleeping bag, a storage device, his military identity card and a mobile with a charger. He was released after a thorough interrogation and completion of the necessary formalities,” officials had said then.As the Ladakh sector remains tense, India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks whereas the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-soldier-strays-across-lac-held-on-southern-bank-of-pangong-tso-101610182605218.html

People should avoid travel. It is better for elderly to remain indoors," said Danish Ahmad, a city resident.J&K had experienced four days of heavy snowfall since Sunday, disrupting surface and air traffic and throwing life out of gear in the region.The administration came under flak for its slow response in clearing snow from the roads. The officials, for the first time in years, have also ordered rationing of gas and oil in the valley.Two flights at Srinagar airport were cancelled in the morning while others have been delayed."The flight operations have been put on hold owing to the fresh snowfall," said an airport official.After the Sunday-Wednesday snow spell, the airport had operated flights for locals and stranded tourists on Thursday.Similarly, work was going-on for the resumption of traffic on the Srinagar -Jammu national highway. The officials had announced on Friday that stranded vehicles between Udhampur and Banihal will be allowed towards Srinagar."The highway is closed again as there is fresh snowfall, " said an official manning the traffic control room.Cluster University of Srinagar postponed all examinations scheduled for Saturday, said an official of the varsity.Sonam Lotus forecasted that the present snow spell in Kashmir is likely to continue till the next few hours and thereafter decrease gradually."It will remain overcast to cloudy today. Thereafter, mainly dry weather is expected till 20th Jan," Lotus said.He said that the Saturday forecast for Ladakh was for sunny weather and the same is likely to continue for the next 2 weeks.The minimum temperatures plunged during the night again with the ski resort of Gulmarg in North Kashmir recording a low of minus 10°C.The mercury in summer capital Srinagar plunged to minus 4 degrees Celsius against minus 0.4 degrees Celsius on the previous night.The temperature dropped to minus 5.1 °C in Pahalgam and minus 2.8°C in Qazigund.The valley is in the middle of the 40-day intense winter period called ‘Chillai Kalan’ which started on December 21 with sub zero night temperatures across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-snowfall-puts-flights-on-hold-national-highway-traffic-stopped-101610180415666.html

If the economy mirrors the projections of the government’s leading statistical body, it would be India’s worst economic performance in at least 60 years.India’s official estimate, however, shows a much better performance than the predictions made by multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which have projected (-)9.6% and (-)10.3% respectively.Saturday’s tweet attack by Rahul Gandhi was part of his effort to keep the narrative against the government focused on the economic slowdown, jobs and other issues confronting the common people.In his continued attacks on the government, the Congress leader had previously slammed the government’s response to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.“The Modi government has betrayed the ‘annadata’ of the country for the benefit of their capitalist friends. The farmers have spoken through their agitation. It is the duty of all of us to raise the voice of the ‘annadata’ and support their demands,” he tweeted in Hindi.“Peaceful agitation is an integral part of democracy. The farmers’ movement is getting support from all over the country. You too should raise your voice in their support and strengthen the voice of farmers so that the anti-agriculture laws are repealed,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/too-much-vikas-rahul-gandhi-stings-govt-uses-gdp-employment-data-101610179038758.html
09-01-2021||India||Odisha Lokayukta orders probe to find if BJD MLA blew up flood embankment||Odisha Lokayukta has asked the vigilance department to probe whether a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA and other government officials conspired to blow up an irrigation embankment with dynamites that inundated 4,000 hectares of standing paddy crop in seven gram panchayats during the floods last year.On Friday evening, Lokayukta Ajit Singh ordered the director of vigilance department to probe the allegations that BJD MLA Pranab Balabantaray and other corrupt officials in Jajpur district, conspired to blow up the irrigation embankment road from NH-5 (Gokarneswar) to Budhalinga Majhipada Road in August last year, to suppress the irregularities and misappropriation of huge amount of money in the construction work.Following a complaint by activist Sarbeswar Behura that on August 28 last year, the irrigation embankment road built to prevent the waters of Kelua river from inundating the farmlands was damaged by dynamites, resulting in submergence of 4,000 hectares of standing paddy crop in 7 gram panchayats of Jajpur district, the Lokayukta asked the director of vigilance to conduct a preliminary inquiry on the following three references:1. Whether breaches occurred in the road embankment due to substandard construction work resulting into washing away of the substantial portion of road embankment?2. Whether breaches were created in the road embankment at the instance of Dharmasala BJD MLA and junior engineer Naren Jena to cover up corruption?3. Whether in the construction work of the road embankment, corrupt practice was resorted to by any public servant or persons other than a public servant?"A huge amount of Rs. 21.99 crore was recently spent by the works department on the development of road embankment. Therefore, normally, had the quality of construction work been proper, the breaches would not have occurred resulting into the washing away of a substantial portion of embankment. In other words, the embankment would have withstood the impact of flood water. There is also a possibility of man-made breaches for covering corruption as alleged in the complaint. We have already seen that a First Information Report in respect to creation of man-made breaches has been lodged by none other than deputy executive engineer of Jaraka irrigation division, who alleged that some miscreants have created man-made breaches unauthorisedly on the night of August 28 between 8 pm and 10 pm. To unravel the real cause of breaches in the road embankment, an inquiry is necessary," the Lokayukta noted in his order.Activist Behura, who had lodged the complaint, alleged that during the construction work of embankment road, after its transfer to the works department, the MLA in collusion with the junior engineer took a huge amount of money from the contractor. He alleged that the contractor, therefore, used sub-standard material in the construction work, and to cover this up, the MLA and the engineer hired miscreants to cause breaches in the embankment road by using dynamites, to give an impression that the embankment was washed away because of the strong current of flood water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-lokayukta-orders-probe-to-find-if-bjd-mla-blew-up-flood-embankment-101610177705450.html

Today's truth is that India is united and if democracy is most strong, vibrant and lively anywhere in the world, it is in India," he said.Talking about India's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, he said the country is among the nations with the lowest fatality rate and the highest recovery rate.Talking about the Covid vaccines rollout, Modi said India is ready with not one but two made-in-India coronavirus vaccines for the protection of humanity."Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world biggest vaccination programme," he said.Modi also said that during the pandemic, Indians showed their capabilities and the way the country stood together was unparalleled.He said India is using technology to defeat corruption and crores of rupees are being directly transferred to beneficiaries' bank accounts."Today we have been connected with the internet from various corners of the world but our minds are always connected with 'Maa Bharti'," he said."I have had a dialogue with several heads of states who told me how Indian diaspora has extended a helping hand in those countries and provided leadership in extending assistance even in these difficult times," Modi said."This was a matter of pride for me."He also lauded the Indian diaspora for providing assistance in the battle against coronavirus in India.Modi told the Indian diaspora that the country always stands with them and pointed out that over 45 lakh people were rescued under the government's Vande Bharat mission during the pandemic.Earlier, the keynote address at the 16th PBD Convention 2021 was delivered by chief guest Chandrikapersad Santokhi, the President of Suriname.The theme of 16th PBD Convention 2021 is "Contributing to Aatmanirbhar Bharat".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-watching-how-india-runs-world-s-biggest-covid-vaccination-drive-pm-modi-101610178030671.html

But they will be entitled to more autonomy as a special category Deemed University.A proposed off-campus centre is expected to achieve a teacher-student ratio of 1:20 initially, and 1:10 by the end of five years.“The faculty for this purpose shall include the regular faculty, adjunct faculty, overseas faculty, visiting faculty, contractual faculty, industry faculty and tenure track faculty or faculty as otherwise permitted by the Statutory Council concerned,” the guidelines said.It adds that at least 60 per cent of the appointed faculty members should be on permanent basis. The institute should also have enrolled a minimum of 500 students on its rolls under regular classroom mode with one third PG/research students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-institutions-of-eminence-can-set-up-campuses-in-foreign-countries-101610177639190.html

"Hate in India isn't acceptable. Let's hold them accountable just like in America," Srivatsa YB tweeted. "Sorry dude, I don't want Twitter to ban anyone — Congressi or BJP or anyone... But one certainly can't expect such statesmanship from a party that imposed Emergency," Tejasvi wrote taking a swipe at the Congress.Sorry dude, I don’t want Twitter to ban anyone - Congressi or BJP or anyone.#FoE is sacrosanct. It cannot be curtailed whimsically by pvt big tech companies without accountability. But one certainly can’t expect such statesmanship from a party that imposed Emergency. https://t.co/wPQ2vOD1HREarlier in the day, Tejasvi urged the government to review intermediaries guidelines, saying that the action on part of the micro-blogging platform is a wake-up call for democracies, "This must be wake up call for all who don't yet understand threat to our democracies by unregulated big tech companies. If they can do this to POTUS, they can do this to anyone," he tweeted."Intermediaries, as per their definition, can't interfere in content on Social Media platforms. But Rules thereunder say otherwise. This anomaly must be addressed immediately," Tejasvi tweeted.Twitter on Saturday permanently banned Donald Trump's account @realDonaldTrump, and then his @TeamTrump campaign account as it tweeted a statement of President Trump. Twitter also deleted new tweets from official account of @POTUS.The action evoked mixed response from Indian politicians as Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi, too, highlighted that the action does not exonerate the platform from enabling hate, fake news in different parts of the world.These platforms have been enablers of hate, fake news and continue to be so in different parts of the world where they operate. Now that Trump is out of power suspension coming from all these very platforms that powered him. Sowed hate to reap profits& now being holier than thou"The platform is provided by a tech company & they are bound to set their rules of engagement after adhering to guidelines set by countries. However, for them to have amplified a hateful narrative for years to suddenly ban does not give them the moral high ground they seek," she wrote."These platforms have been enablers of hate, fake news and continue to be so in different parts of the world where they operate. Now that Trump is out of power suspension coming from all these very platforms that powered him. Sowed hate to reap profits & now being holier than thou," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-twitter-to-ban-anyone-tejasvi-surya-after-permanent-suspension-of-trump-s-account-101610175362195.html

He had allegedly duped one of the MH employees of ₹4 lakh with a fake promise to provide his son a job in the Indian Army.During investigation, MI found that Raushan had managed to open a Defence Salary Package (DSP) account in the SBI Branch of Ramgarh Cantonment in Jharkhand to cheat his victims.When a MI team reached his village, Raushan’s parents informed their son served in the Indian Army. Locals said that he provided training to army aspirants in the area.Five fake army identity cards, two Aadhar cards, two PAN cards, a large number of forged documents, several pictures in army uniforms with army insignia and two fake rubber stamps were recovered from his possession. The accused has been handed over to Danapur police station of the state capital for further investigation.SHO of Danapur police station, Ajit Kumar Saha, told HT that during the investigation, it was found that Raushan was once an army aspirant who later turned into an imposter.Videos of him training village youths, aspiring for a job in the Indian Army, were found in his mobile apart from several pictures of Raushan dressed as personnel of army medical corps, Rajputana Rifles and others. He also managed to open a DSP account in New Delhi. A case has been lodged against him under sections 140 (impersonating a soldier), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (Forging document for gain of valuable security or money), 468 (Forging document for cheating) and 471(Fraudulent use of documents) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“During questioning, Raushan revealed that he is a former cook of sub area headquarters in Danapur. He was impersonating as an army jawan since 2019 to lure aspiring soldiers, especially during army recruitment rallies,” said the SHO.He confessed to have cheated more than 10 such aspirants and having received around ₹700,000 from them for falsely assuring them of selection.He used to receive money mostly in cash to avoid leaving any electronic proof.According to the senior police officers, he is being interrogated to find out if he had any links in the Indian Army. Meanwhile, MI officials have alerted the public not to get duped by touts and imposters promising jobs in the army. The only way to join the Indian Army is by registering online on www.joinindianArmy.gov.in, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imposter-trained-youth-for-jobs-in-indian-army-nabbed-after-mi-tipoff-101610175089390.html

This includes schemes for distributing food grains to the poor and vulnerable, provision of assistance and support to construction workers, and provision of special insurance for health workers fighting Covid-19.“It is expected that these measures will contribute to a more stable and sustainable socioeconomic development in India,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-japan-sign-pact-for-50-bn-yen-loan-to-support-poor-hit-by-covid19-101610166962658.html
09-01-2021||India||Nobody can interfere in peaceful life of two adults: Allahabad HC||The Allahabad high court has granted police protection to an interfaith couple, while asserting that nobody can interfere in the peaceful life of two adults residing together out of their own free will.Hearing the plea of a Muslim man and a woman who converted from Hinduism to Islam, Justice Saral Srivastava said, “The court has repeatedly held that where the two individuals having attained the age of majority, are living together, nobody is entitled to interfere in their peaceful life.”The 22-year-old woman and her 23-year-old husband said they were adults and furnished documents reflecting that they were born in 1998 and 1997, respectively. In the writ petitions, the woman said she decided to convert to Islam on her own will and later solemnised her marriage with the man. They sought protection from their family, and no interference in their married life.The observation holds significance in the backdrop of the recently passed Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020. The ordinance prescribes a jail term up to 10 years and fine up to ₹25,000 for conversion under marriage, fraud, coercion or enticement. The law came into force days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to fight against “love jihad”, a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.Several activists and legal experts argue that the law could be used to target Muslims and infringed on the fundamental rights to equality, freedom of religion, and life and personal liberty. However, on Thursday, the Uttar Pradesh government defended the ordinance in the Allahabad high court, asserting that community interest trumps an individual’s right to choose a life partner and the foremost duty of a secular state is to protect citizens from unlawful conversions. “When there is fear psychosis spread in the community at large and the community itself is endangered and succumbs to the pressure resulting in forceful conversion…it becomes necessary that the interest of the community as a whole requires protection and no microanalysis of individual interest can be looked into,” the government’s affidavit read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nobody-can-interfere-in-peaceful-life-of-two-adults-allahabad-hc-101610162638615.html
09-01-2021||India||Ghalib’s coronavirus||What if Mirza Ghalib were alive today? How would Delhi’s great shayar (poet) have coped with the pandemic, and the consequent khud alhaidgi (self-isolation in Urdu!)? What ghazals and verses would have come out of his kalam (pen)?We’ll never know.“But there are some couplets by him that we can relate to our life in these extraordinary times,” says Aqil Ahmad, the secretary of central Delhi’s Ghalib Academy. The modest, soft-spoken man has an encyclopaedic grasp of Ghalib’s oeuvre.In the BC (before coronavirus) era, his cosy office in the academy — which is a flower’s throw from Ghalib’s tomb — would be filled with poets and critics discussing (and gossiping) about poets and critics. These days, Mr Ahmad’s office lacks the chatty spark of earlier times but he still occasionally presides over the gathering of Ghalib aficionados. This evening, he is having milky “office chai” and zeera “biskuts” with poet Mateen Amrohi (who, as always, is dressed in a black sherwani) and poet Nasim Abbasi, the one with a most courteous voice imaginable. The three men, all in mask, helped this reporter find five Ghalib couplets in Urdu (Ghalib also wrote in Persian) dealing with the themes of isolation that is driving our daily life. Mr Ahmad provided the transliteration and translation.Rahiye ab aisi jaga, chal kar, jahan koi na hoHam safar koi na ho, aur ham zuban koi na ho.Let’s go now, and live somewhere where there’ll be no one,No one to travel with me, no one who would know my language.Be dar o diwar sa ik ghar banaya chahiyekoi hamsaya na ho, aur pasban koi na ho.I’ll make something like a house, with no doors or walls,There won’t be any neighbours, and no one to guard me.Padhiye, gar bimar, to koi na ho timardar,Aur, agar mar jaiye, to nawakhan koi na ho.If I fall ill, there’l be no one to look after me,And if I die, to mourn me there’ll be no one.Mai se gharaz nishat hai kis rusiyah koIk guna bekhudi mujhe din raat chahiye.Who, hapless, seeks happiness within the cup of wine?A delicious senselessness, day and night, is what I taste.Ne teer kaman men hai, na saiyad kameen men haiGoshe men qafas ke mujhe aaram bahut hai.The arrow is not in the bow, the hunter is out of the target,I am comfortable in the corner of the cage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghalibs-coronavirus-101610166582261.html

Two of the accused have been arrested and a search is on to nab the third, police said on Friday.The incident took place in a village under Hunterganj police station limits, officials said.The woman’s relatives and neighbours rushed her to a community health centre after hearing her cries for help, the officials said.“I had gone to an open land (bari) near my house at around 10 pm on Thursday when three men overpowered me and took turns to rape me. They also inserted a steel glass in my private parts before leaving. They threatened to kill my family members if I told anyone,” the woman told reporters.In her statement to the police, the woman alleged that the accused had earlier tried to forcibly enter her house. “In the process, they had injured my goat. When I demanded compensation, they said they would teach me a lesson,” she alleged.Chatra sub-divisional police officer Avinash Kumar said, “We have already arrested two of the accused named by the woman. A search is on for the third person who is yet to be identified.”“The condition of the woman is stable and the doctors at the health centre have kept her under observation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50yrold-gang-raped-brutalised-in-jharkhand-101610164519054.html
09-01-2021||India||India to chair 3 key UNSC committees||India on Friday took a tacit swipe at Pakistan for backing cross-border terrorism as it announced it would be chairing three key UN sanctions committees, including the Taliban sanctions committee, during 2021-22.TS Tirumurti, India’s envoy to the UN, said the country was asked to chair three important subsidiary bodies of the Security Council – the Taliban sanctions committee, the counter-terrorism committee and the Libya sanctions committee. The move follows India joining the Security Council as a non-permanent member for 2021-22.India will chair the Taliban sanctions committee – also called the 1988 sanctions committee as it was formed through resolution number 1988 in 2011 by splitting the 1267 sanctions regime on al-Qaeda – amid growing concern worldwide at alarming levels of violence in Afghanistan that has been blamed on the Taliban.“The Taliban sanctions committee...has always been a high priority for India, keeping in mind our strong interest and commitment to peace, security, development and progress of Afghanistan,” Tirumurti said in a video message.Without naming Pakistan, he added: “Our chairing this committee at this juncture will help keep the focus on the presence of terrorists and their sponsors threatening the peace process in Afghanistan. It has been our view that peace process and violence cannot go hand in hand.”After a recent visit to Pakistan by a Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, videos emerged of the group’s leaders visiting terror training camps on Pakistani soil and meeting injured fighters at a hospital in Karachi. One of the videos showed Baradar – the group’s main negotiator at peace talks in Doha – telling Taliban members that the group makes all decisions related to the negotiations after consulting its leadership and clerics’ council based in Pakistan.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India and Afghanistan are contiguous neighbours, and New Delhi, which has invested heavily in peace and development in the war-torn country, will support all efforts to usher in peace and stability there.“Our position on the peace process has also been articulated. The peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. As an important stakeholder, we look forward to working towards a peaceful, prosperous, sovereign, democratic and united Afghanistan,” he said.Referring to the counter-terrorism committee, which will be chaired by India in 2022, Tirumurti noted the panel was formed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and that India had led it during its last stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council during 2011-12.“The chairing of this committee has special resonance of India, which has not only been in the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, but has also been one of its biggest victims,” he said.The Libya sanctions committee, also known as the 1970 sanctions committee, is a “very important subsidiary body” of the Security Council that implements a sanctions regime, including a two-way arms embargo, assets freeze, travel ban and measures to prevent illicit export of petroleum, Tirumurti said.India will chair this committee at a “critical juncture, when there is international focus on Libya and on the peace process” in that country, he added.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said India’s chairing the Taliban sanctions committee will make a difference as it will have the ability to set the agenda.“One way we make a difference is agenda setting. Member states can only make representations and the country that is the chair sets the agenda. This allows you to discuss issues which may not have been discussed earlier. The chair can also take up unsolicited issues. That’s the single-most important aspect of being the chair – the members may disagree but the chair can make a point by bringing an issue to the table,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-chair-3-key-unsc-committees-101610165350136.html
09-01-2021||India||Teachers on Covid duty will be frontline workers for vaccine drive: Sisodia||Teachers in schools run by the Delhi government and the municipal corporations — who have been actively involved in Covid-19 duty — will also be included in the list of front line workers to be vaccinated in the first phase, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Friday.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said he raised the matter in a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday, after which it was unanimously decided that all personnel, irrespective of their departments, who have been part of the city administration’s Covid management team, will be given the vaccine shots on a priority basis under the category of front line workers.“The matter was discussed at length and it was unanimously decided that all personnel who were or have been engaged in Covid related works will be given the vaccine shot under the priority category. This is going to be across all departments,” said Sisodia.The DDMA is chaired by lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and has chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as its vice-chairperson.Earlier the government’s list of front line workers for vaccination only included police personnel, sanitation workers and civil defence volunteers.Apart from teachers, the DDMA’s decision means that select workers from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), and departments such as transport, power, and revenue, among others, will also be considered for vaccination, if the concerned official had performed any Covid duties in the past 11 months.As per rough estimates of the government, around 300,000 health care workers and 600,000 lakh front line workers are to be vaccinated in the first phase. However, the final list of front line workers is still being worked out by the administration.As for including teachers, their inclusion was discussed because school teachers were put on Covid-19 duty, sometimes even for 12 hours or more, as physical classes in schools across the city have been on hold since March last year owing to the pandemic. Hundreds of teachers were helping the government in food distribution during the migrant crisis and were also made in-charges of temporary shelter homes. Scores of other MCD and government teachers are also involved in the government’s door-to-door survey programme in detecting Covid-19 cases and now have been deployed for the upcoming vaccination campaign.“After the vaccine process begins, the government can consider reopening schools. It will be better if teachers are vaccinated. Reopening schools is important because they have been shut for more than 10 months now,” said an officer who was part of the DDMA meeting.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the government has identified 5.1 million people who will be the first to get the Covid-19 vaccine under the Central government’s “priority category”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teachers-on-covid-duty-will-be-frontline-workers-for-vaccine-drive-sisodia-101610165008413.html
09-01-2021||India||India ticks more boxes in vaccination drive checklist||The government on Friday put final touches to its Covid-19 vaccine roll-out plan as it held the biggest-yet drill to perfect immunisation logistics and last-mile delivery, issued guidelines for safe air delivery of vaccines across the country, and announced a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all chief ministers on inoculation strategy on Monday.Modi’s scheduled interaction will be the first such event after the country’s drug regulator last week approved two Covid-19 vaccines -- Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech – and is expected to spell out modalities of the vaccine delivery plan honed by officials, experts and health care workers for months now.The announcement came on a day the second vaccine dry run was carried out in 737 districts across 33 states and Union territories, and India’s aviation watchdog told airlines and airport authorities to ensure vaccines are packaged in dry ice and refrigerated material to maintain low temperatures ranging between -8° C to -70° C, essential for its transportation.“We are in the process of ensuring that in the next few days, also in the near future, we should be able to give this vaccine to our countrymen,” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan at a hospital in Chennai. When asked when the vaccination would start, he added, “You will get to know about it soon.”Government officials remained tight-lipped about the schedule for the jabs, but frenetic behind-the-scenes activity, especially at airports, underlined last-minute efforts to put in place foolproof vaccine distribution strategy.The civil aviation ministry met airlines executives and airport authorities to finalise logistics for transportation. “All arrangements have been made at airports for transportation, people are on standby and ready to carry the consignment as and when the orders are placed,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.At Pune airport, which will be responsible for transporting the Covishield vaccine from the SII’s godown in the city to other vaccine hubs across India, officials said they were ready to supply bulk cargo. “We are fully prepared to transport up to 500 tonne of cargo daily with the current number of flights operating. We have the equipment, manpower, aircraft and everything is ready,” said airport director Kuldeep Singh. The transportation capacity can be optimised to 1,714 tonne a day.Covishield, developed by Oxford University and British drugmaker AstraZeneca, is expected to be the lead vaccine in India’s immunisation programme with Covaxin as a back-up in case of an emergency.To be sure, a senior Union government official confirmed that a purchase order had not yet been signed between the government and SII, but indicated that a final settlement may be reached over the weekend. Singh said no vaccine cargo was sent to Pune airport from SII until Friday evening. “We are only awaiting the consignment to reach the airport,” he added.In Delhi, the vaccination dry run focussed on building confidence,resolving any lingering issues and warding off the possibility of any adverse events. At each trial site, 25 beneficiaries were called to go through the mock drill for two hours beginning 9am. “Since healthcare workers would be the first to get the vaccine, we have created a site in the employee health clinic in the hospital.Our nurses are already trained for vaccination and the whole process went smoothly,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Grappling with the second-highest number of infections in the world behind the United States, India has planned a mammoth exercise to immunise 1.3 billion people, beginning with 300 million frontline workers and those at highest risk, by July.With an eye on a smooth roll-out, the government has introduced CoWIN, a digital platform that is expected to be the backbone of the vaccine delivery management system.The app will be used to provide real-time information on vaccine stock, cold storage status and help coordinate the dates and venue for vaccination with recipients.The guidelines issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) state all scheduled operators currently authorised to carry dangerous goods may carry Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice, meeting the regulatory requirements.In December, the civil aviation ministry had directed all airlines and airport operators, including state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI), ground handling service providers, and airlines, to put in place standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the transportation of Covid-19 vaccines.“Carriage of Covid-19 vaccines from the manufacturing units to the place of administration gains significant importance especially in the light of the high expectations of the government(s), health care personnel and the general public. It is needless to say that amongst the various modes of transport, air transport is the most efficient option. Hence, it is imperative that air logistics provide a well-defined procedure that meets the global safety standards and requirements based on local conditions,” DGCA noted.DGCA said all operators need to establish the maximum quantity of dry ice that can be loaded in an aircraft. Vaccines packed in dry ice should preferably be transported in the lower-deck of the cargo compartments of planes.If vaccines are stored in the passenger area,the operators will have to ensure that only flight crew, and no passengers, are allowed.Occupants should be protected against a potential CO2 intoxication and an adequate number of CO2 detectors should be available in the cabin, the guidelines noted.The air conditioning, air supply and the distribution or ventilation system should use configurations recommended by the manufacturer, DGCA stated.The operators will have to ensure that shipments containing vaccines shall be accepted and handled by appropriately trained personnel only.Experts stressed on the importance of early preparedness and dry runs. “The more dry runs there are, the more the vaccinators and vaccine officers are confident in the processes,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor, Delhi’s Maulana Azad Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ticks-more-boxes-in-vaccination-drive-checklist-101610162192258.html
09-01-2021||India||Chicken prices crash at city’s wholesale markets||The wholesale prices of poultry has dropped by around ₹40 per kilo in two days amid fears of an outbreak of bird flu in Delhi-NCR, according to traders in the city’s wholesale poultry markets.However, the drop in poultry prices is yet to reflect in retail markets, even as traders across the city said the number of customers have dipped slightly on Friday in retail as well as wholesale markets.Cases of bird flu so far have been confirmed in at least six states — Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Kerala.The Delhi government had on Thursday launched a sample collection drive to check for bird flu.“Even though there has been no cases of bird flu in Delhi, residents are exercising caution in buying poultry. So, the wholesale rates of poultry has dropped in the market. Till Wednesday, the wholesale prices were about ₹100 per bird per kilo which has now dropped to ₹80 to ₹60 per bird per kilo depending upon quality,” said Tehseen Quraishi, a wholesale trader in Ghazipur Fish and Poultry market.Adil Ahmed, another trader at the wholesale market, said that they are taking all precautions and teams of Delhi government are also collecting samples from the market.“Fewer customers came to buy poultry today as compared to the last two days. Samples are being collected by the government to check and control spread of the flu,” he said.However, traders in the city’s retail markets said that the prices of poultry is the same, but customers are asking question before buying the bird.“The customers are probing if the poultry they are buying is healthy and fresh and if it might have been infected by the flu. Though the prices have not yet dropped, but the number of customers has dipped slightly as compared to the last 2-3 days. If cases of bird flu start being reported from the city, then the business will take a hit,” said Salim Quraishi, who has a poultry shop in Sukhdev Vihar area.Consumers said that there was no drop in retail prices of poultry but they were exercising caution.Madhuri Nath, a resident of South Delhi’s Moti Bagh said that the retail prices of chicken had not reduced till at least Friday morning.“We ordered a kilo of boneless chicken on Friday for ₹240. The place where we usually get our supply from had assured us of safety but now that the cases might be coming up in Delhi, we might stop buying poultry altogether,” said Nath.Another consumer, Nipun Tiwari, a resident of Meera Bagh, said that since the news of avian flu scare came out, they have not ordered poultry or chicken products.“We have completely stopped ordering poultry or eggs for the last 2-3 days. It might not be dangerous to humans but we do not want to take any chance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chicken-prices-crash-at-city-s-wholesale-markets-101610164199260.html
09-01-2021||India||SC urges Centre to decide on Rajoana’s plea by Jan 26||The Supreme Court on Friday urged the Centre to decide on the eight-year-old mercy plea filed by a death row convict in two weeks. The convict, Balwant Singh Rajoana, has been in jail for over 25 years after being convicted of triggering a bomb blast that killed then Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in August 1995.Rajoana approached the Supreme Court last year complaining about a delay on the part of the central government to process his mercy petition, which he filed on March 25, 2012 with the President. The Supreme Court on December 4 asked the Centre about the delay and was informed that the proposal for commutation of his sentence was yet to be processed.The ministry of home affairs said that since other co-accused involved in the crime with Rajoana had filed appeals which were pending before the apex court, a decision on Rajoana’s mercy petition was put on hold. Rajoana had not filed any appeal challenging his death sentence before the apex court.On Friday, additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj told a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the file had been processed by the home ministry. “We have processed the file from our end. It has been sent to the competent authority to take a decision.”The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told the law officer: “Give him (Rajoana) some relief before January 26. It is a good day to act. If possible, pass an order before January 25.” The bench has posted the matter for hearing on January 25.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Rajoana, said: “The delay of eight years in processing the mercy petition is fatal to death sentence. This is enough for commutation of death sentence to life as decided by the Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan case in 2014.”In that judgment given by a Constitution Bench, undue, inordinate delay in deciding mercy petitions had been held to be grounds to commute punishment of death row convicts.Rajoana was sentenced to death on July 27, 2007, when the trial court found him and his associate Jagtar Singh Hawara guilty of killing Beant Singh by triggering a bomb blast at the Punjab and Haryana Civil Secretariat on August 31, 1995. Later, on October 12, 2010, the Punjab and Haryana high court confirmed Rajoana’s death penalty.In his petition filed through advocate Rupesh Kumar, Rajoana informed the Court that on September 27, 2019, the Centre had written a letter to the Punjab chief secretary saying that Rajoana’s mercy plea was to be processed under Article 72 of the Constitution coinciding with the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism. When the direction was not heeded, Rajoana approached apex court to remind the Centre of its resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-urges-centre-to-decide-on-rajoana-s-plea-by-jan-26-101610164287739.html
09-01-2021||India||India pursues independent foreign policy: MEA||Against the backdrop of possible US sanctions on the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems, India on Friday said it has an independent foreign policy that guides defence acquisitions in line with national security interests.Recent reports have suggested the US could impose secondary sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The Russian side has said the deal for five S-400 systems is progressing according to schedule despite the threat of possible sanctions.“India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests,” he said in response to a question on the S-400 deal.Outgoing US envoy Kenneth Juster said this week that sanctions under CAATSA weren’t aimed against friends of the US, though India might soon need to make hard decisions regarding the acquisition of military hardware.India has sought to keep its options open on arms purchases and the country’s leadership has signalled its intent to continue with the acquisition of military hardware from Russia, which accounts for more than 60% of the weapons systems of the three services.Responding to another question on the US administration’s plans to modify the selection process for H-1B visas by giving priority to salary and skills instead of the current lottery, Srivastava said India is in communication with the American side to ensure “increased predictability” in the visa regime.Almost 70% of the 65,000 H-1B visas issued by the US each year go to Indian nationals.“We are engaged with the US government for increased predictability in the visa regime and to minimise inconvenience to Indian nationals in the US or those proposing to travel to the US for bonafide reasons, including the movement of Indian professionals,” Srivastava said.India has also noted the US government’s recent proclamations extending by three months the suspension of entry of certain immigrants and non-immigrants, he said. “People-to-people relations are a vital part of the partnership between India and the US. There is recognition in the US of the fact that Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth of the US economy and helped the US retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pursues-independent-foreign-policy-mea-101610164104281.html
09-01-2021||India||Decide vigilance clearance for All India Services officers within 3 months: CVC||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked all the Cadre controlling authorities of three All India Services - Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS) - to accord vigilance clearance to officers, against whom any complaint is pending, in case the government of the state, where they are posted, doesn’t respond within three months.The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) is the cadre controlling authority for IAS; ministry of home affairs (MHA) for the IPS while the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) is the controlling authority for the IFoS.In an order issued on Thursday, reviewed by HT, the CVC has said that the guidelines issued by the Centre in 2007 pertaining to vigilance clearance are not being followed by the cadre controlling authorities “due to which, long pending complaints are shown against the officers names while seeking vigilance clearance for the officer from the CVC”.It has said that “in some cases, officers are not even aware that a complaint is pending against them”.The apex vigilance body added that cadre controlling authorities must strictly adhere to these guidelines before approaching it for vigilance clearance.The vigilance clearance is sought for AIS (All India Services) officers at the time of their empanelment, deputation, appointments to sensitive posts and assignments to training programmes to ascertain if any officer has a complaint pending against him or her for possession of disproportionate assets, moral turpitude, corruption, or violation of AIS conduct rules at the place of current posting.The complaints against officers are often referred to the states, where they are posted, for their views.According to the 2007 guidelines, in cases where complaints have been referred to the state, and no substantive response has been received from within three months from the date on which the reference was made, the Cadre controlling authority (DoPT, MHA and MoEF) may provide a copy of the complaint to the concerned officer to seek his comments. “If the comments are found to be prima facie satisfactory by the competent authority, vigilance clearance shall be accorded,” the guidelines add.The guidelines clearly assert, that in case, the comments are not received in a complaint against an officer within three months, it will be presumed that there is nothing adverse against the officer.Vigilance clearance cannot be withheld against AIS officers unless the officer is under suspension; or a charge sheet has been filed against him/her; officer is involved in a trap/raid case on charges of corruption; disciplinary proceedings have been concluded through a charge sheet by concerned department; or sanction of prosecution has been granted against the officer under the Prevention of Corruption Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decide-vigilance-clearance-for-all-india-services-officers-within-3-months-cvc-101610162956180.html

When the woman sought to raise an alarm, the accused allegedly pushed her off the terrace, officials said.The woman has suffered severe injuries and is undergoing treatment at Deendayal Upadhyay Government Hospital in Moradabad, said Dilari circle officer Anoop Singh.The woman’s family members, who rushed her to a hospital, have alleged that the police only included the charges of outraging modesty, trespass and causing hurt in the First Information Report lodged on the day of the incident.Police included the rape charge after the intervention of Moradabad senior superintendent of police Prabhakar Choudhury, the survivor’s family has alleged.The SSP said the victim recorded her statement before a magistrate on January 5, in which she accused her neighbour of raping her. Accordingly, the rape charge was added in the FIR, the accused arrested and sent to jail under judicial custody, Choudhury added.Denying the allegations of the woman’s family that the police did not add the rape charge, Singh said the rape charge was added after the victim made her statement under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code.The woman has been shifted to Deendayal Upadhyay Government Hospital in Moradabad where she has been medically examined, he said. She is out of danger now, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moradabad-teen-out-of-danger-police-frame-rape-charges-after-row-101610163634431.html
09-01-2021||India||Badaun rape-murder: Priest sent to 10-day judicial custody||A local court on Friday remanded the key accused in the Badaun gang rape and murder case in judicial custody till January 18. The 53-year-old accused, who was in hiding for four days, was arrested late on Thursday.“The priest (main accused) has been sent to judicial custody till January 18.

09-01-2021||India||India's agencies increasingly depend on tech intel||India’s intelligence agencies and the police have, over the years, started depending largely on “technical intelligence” rather than “human intelligence” although the latter has a crucial role to play in the country’s internal security, according to data from the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC) accessed by HT.In fact, in places like Jammu and Kashmir that are affected by terrorism, 70% to 80% of intelligence inputs are generated through technical intelligence, or TECHINT, which includes telephone records, emails, satellite images, social media posts and other technology-related information.Similarly, over 90% of intelligence gathered and shared everyday by agencies for the rest of India is collected electronically. It is only in the areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE) that Indian agencies mostly depend on human intelligence, or HUMINT, the data suggests.MAC is a national intelligence-sharing fusion centre under the Intelligence Bureau (IB) where states and central agencies and police forces coordinate to share, store, collate and analyse inputs on terrorism, on a daily basis, under four heads – J&K, Northeast, LWE and Rest of India.It was created in December 2001 in the aftermath of the Kargil conflict, but was strengthened in December 2008, following the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The MAC data suggests that even though the platform is being actively used for intelligence sharing since 2009, when only 3,106 inputs were generated, compared to 29,914 inputs shared in 2020 until November, there is more reliance on TECHINT.On average, about 150 intelligence inputs are shared everyday by the agencies on various terrorist- and insurgent-related activities. Since 2009, 375,000 intelligence inputs have been disseminated on the platform.The MAC data reveals that out of 8,800-odd inputs shared on terrorism in J&K in 2019, 7,713 were TECHINT; only 1,079 were generated through human resources. In 2020, too, the number was almost similar for J&K.On insurgency in the Northeast, 3,905 inputs shared in 2019 fell in the TECHINT category and 2,116 were based on HUMINT. In 2020, this number was 2,934 and 1,724, respectively.Intelligence collected technically for the Rest of India in 2019 made up of 7,443 inputs while only 542 inputs were generated through a human intelligence network. Similarly, in 2020, most of the intelligence in the Rest of India was collected technically; it comprised 6,944 TECHINT inputs and just 176 HUMINT inputs. The 2020 data is until Novembe-end.Technical inputs shared across the country in all the regions made up 57% of the total, much higher than human intelligence.The National Technical Research Organisation was set up in 2004 as a premier TECHINT agency, and the Intelligence Bureau, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the National Investigation Agency (NIA), Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) and several other agencies have invested lot of resources in gathering information technically.“There are two primary reasons why there is less human intelligence gathering now. One , police officers find it easy to collect data electronically and they don’t want to invest in human sources, which is a time-consuming exercise,” said LN Rao, a former deputy commissioner of the Special Cell, who also led the MAC in Delhi Police, for several years. “ Secondly, over the years, it has also been noticed that human sources can mislead you or double-cross you. HUMINT works completely on trust. If you don’t reward them, they may lose interest”.Sameer Patil,a fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said: “With TECHINT, the information gathered is quick and accurate. With HUMINT, there are problems related to reliability of the sources. If an agency picks up a conversation between two suspects, they know exactly and it’s better than what human source can tell you. Sometimes, the informer can give wrong information if he/she is denied compensation.”He added: “There has not been a substantial effort from the agencies to increase the quality of HUMINT because its important too”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-agencies-increasingly-depend-on-tech-intel-101610160966455.html
09-01-2021||India||79 of 86 booked under new law are Muslims||The Uttar Pradesh government has told the Allahabad high court that its contentious new anti-conversion ordinance didn’t target any particular religion and was equally applicable to all forms of forced conversion, not just interfaith marriages. But a scrutiny of the statistics submitted by the Yogi Adityanath government in court presents an intriguing picture.A total of 86 persons were booked in 16 first information reports (FIRs) since the Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, was notified on November 28 last year. Fifty-four people were arrested. Out of the 86 people booked, 79 are Muslims. All these 79 have been accused of similar offences — allegedly enticing a woman and forcing her to convert to Islam.These statistics are part of the state government’s affidavit presented before a high court bench led by chief justice Govind Mathur on Thursday, in response to a batch of public interest litigations (PILs) that claimed the law violated several constitutional rights.In 16 FIRs adduced by the state government before the high court, two cases involved minor girls. In the other FIRs, adult women were alleged to have been influenced or pressurised for conversion.The accused in two FIRs were non-Muslims, and seven persons were named in total in the cases. The allegations against them relate to coercion for converting women to Christianity. The cases spanned 14 of the state’s 75 districts. The families of some of the 86 arrested alleged that they were picked up on trumped-up charges. The UP Police and the government, however, say the charges are genuine.Guresha Ahmad, the sister of Owais Ahmad, who was the first person arrested under the new law on November 28 in Bareilly, denied that her 21-year-old brother was guilty of coercing a local Hindu woman to convert to Islam. “My brother and the girl studied together. The girl later fled on her own,” said Guresha. She further alleged that the woman told police that she was being harassed by her family members. Owais, who remains in jail, was arrested on a complaint by the woman’s father.Rajesh Kumar Pandey, DIG, Bareilly Range, said, “Owais Ahmed was arrested following the FIR against him and was sent to prison on judicial custody. The case is under investigating by a team if local police.”In Bijnor, a 17-year-old boy was arrested on December 17 for allegedly forcing a teenager to convert for marriage. But the accused’s family denied the charges. “The girl’s family said they did not want any action in the case and she denied any attempt of conversion,” said the accused’s brother.SHO of Dhampur police station Arun Kumar Tyagi, however, said the charges levelled against the accused were based on the statement of the girl and she recorded the same statement in front of a magistrate under section 164 of CrPc. He said that the accused introduced himself to the girl as a Hindu and tried to persuade her for marriage .The government’s affidavit in the high court showed that in one case, 26 people, including five women, were booked in Etah district for allegedly luring a 21-year-old woman and forcibly converting her religion. According to the FIR, the alleged incident took place on November 17 and 18 – more than a week before the law came into force. The police, however, opted to invoke the criminal provisions of the ordinance since the FIR was registered later. Out of 26 persons, 14 have been arrested so far, read the affidavit.The document listed two similar instances from Mau and Sitapur.In Mau, 16 people were arraigned as accused under one FIR whereas in Sitapur, 14 were booked in one FIR. In both cases, the accusations pertain to beguiling adult woman for conversion. Eight people were arrested in Mau and 13 in Sitapur. The alleged incident in Sitapur is dated November 23, when the ordinance was not in force.The UP ordinance prescribes a jail term up to 10 years and fine up to ₹25,000 for conversion under marriage, fraud, coercion or enticement.The law came into force days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to fight against “love jihad”, a term used by some radical groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/79-of-86-booked-under-new-law-are-muslims-101610162090746.html

09-01-2021||India||Centre sounds alert as bird flu cases spread to 6 states||As a Bhopal-based laboratory confirmed that 437,000 poultry birds in Haryana died because of bird flu, the Centre on Friday asked the six states where deaths because of the disease have been confirmed to increase their vigil and act to curb the outbreak.The Centre has confirmed bird flu in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana, the government said in a statement.“So far, the disease has been confirmed from six states. It is learnt that culling operations have been completed in both the affected districts of Kerala. The disinfection process is underway,” the statement read.Following the confirmation of bird flu, Haryana is set to start the biggest culling of birds in any state. Officials said 166,000 birds would be killed in the next few days. Culling of birds is to take place within 1 km of Kheri and Ghanauli villages from where samples tested positive for bird flu, they said.Two of the three samples sent by the Haryana animal husbandry department from poultry farms in Panchkula’s Barwala belt to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) laboratory in Bhopal tested positive for avian influenza on Friday.“As per the report received, it has been confirmed that birds of two poultry farms were infected with avian influenza (H5N8). Though this bird flu strain is less pathogenic, the state government has issued a notification for the affected poultry farms of Panchkula as a precautionary measure,” Haryana’s animal husbandry and dairying minister JP Dalal said on Friday.Tests done on three batches of samples sent to a Jalandhar lab from Barwala were inconclusive, following which the samples were sent to the Bhopal lab.More than 437,000 poultry birds have died in Panchkula’s Barwala and Raipur Rani areas, considered to be Asia’s second largest poultry belt, over the past 26 days. On Friday, the central team visited the community health centre in both areas.Arrangements have been made at the community health centre in Raipur Rani, and isolation wards set up, while Tamiflu tablets have been procured to check human-to-human transmission of the influenza, said Dr Saroj Aggarwal, deputy civil surgeon, Panchkula. “We are ready to deal with any situation.”The Haryana government on Friday declared an area within a radius of 1 km from the two poultry farms where poultry birds have been tested for the flu as an “infected zone” and the area within a radius of up to 10 km as a “surveillance zone”.The state government has restricted the movement of poultry goods from these areas. At least 166,000 poultry birds of five poultry farms, which fall within a 1-km radius of the two infected farms, will be culled and the state government will give ₹90 per bird as compensation to the owners. To prevent the spread, check posts have been set up in the infected areas, officials said.Concerns of the spread of flu were also reported from Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, where bird deaths were reported. Samples from all these states have been sent to the central laboratory in Bhopal.In the states where bird flu has been confirmed, its spread is increasing. In Rajasthan, deaths of birds, mostly crows, because of bird flu were reported from 30 of 33 districts. On Wednesday, deaths were reported from 12 districts. In Madhya Pradesh, over 800 birds died in 20 of 52 districts, an increase of 12 in the past two days.In Maharashtra, suspected flu deaths were reported from three more districts, taking the number of affected districts to eight. Close to 350 birds have died so far. The preliminary results of samples tested in Pune were negative, but final confirmation will come from the Bhopal lab.“Any confirmation of bird flu is to be done only by NIHSAD,” said Anoop Kumar, principal secretary at the state animal husbandry department.Bird flu is under control in Kerala, another major hot spot, where about 28,000 birds have died and another 70,000 been culled, mostly in Alapzuha and Kottayam, said Kerala animal husbandry minister K Raju.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sounds-alert-as-bird-flu-cases-spread-to-6-states-101610161637857.html

The opposition parties have already politicised the issue and raised doubts about some vaccines (Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin). We will see to it that these doubts are cleared,” said a party functionary.The details of the outreach programme, including the schedule for leaders, will be drawn up soon.“Whether senior leaders including ministers will take the shot has not been firmed up so far. The protocol for administering the vaccine--for those in the high-risk category-- will be followed. Some leaders such as (spokesperson) RP Singh have volunteered to be part of the third-phase trials of Covaxin,” said the second functionary.The BJP’s awareness campaign assumes significance in the wake of Opposition leaders questioning the vaccine efficacy. On Friday, RJD leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav said, Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take the lead and take the first shot of Covid-19 vaccine, following which others will also get it.Earlier, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav stoked a controversy by saying he would not take the ‘BJP vaccine’, and that the ‘BJP (members) should get vaccinated first’. Some Congress leaders have also raised questions over the approval process for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine, alleging the due process of trials and making the data public had not been followed.Responding to these allegations, BJP chief J P Nadda had tweeted that these were ‘wild theories’ to ridicule India’s achievements.“Time and again, we have seen, whenever India achieves something commendable - that will further public good - the Congress comes up with wild theories to oppose and ridicule the accomplishments. The more they oppose, the more they are exposed. Latest example is the Covid vaccine,” Nadda tweeted last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-to-drive-awareness-campaign-to-clear-doubts-over-indigenous-covid-vaccines-101610160170833.html

The bird deaths have been reported from Udhampur, Kathua and Rajouri districts since Thursday. The administration has imposed a ban on import of live birds and unprocessed poultry meat till January 14.Assam: Though no case has been reported yet, the Assam government has imposed an indefinite ban on the entry of poultry products from outside the Northeastern region as a precautionary measure following avian flu outbreak in some states.Karnataka: The government on Friday said there was no case of bird flu yet though utmost caution and alertness is being maintained as its neighbouring Kerala has already reported bird flu outbreak.Madhya Pradesh: Nearly 450 chickens were culled in Madhya Pradesh's Indore city between Thursday and Friday. The Madhya Pradesh government has already ordered the closure of poultry shops in Neemuch and Indore districts for a week after bird flu infection was found in some chickens.Haryana: Over 1.60 lakh birds of five poultry farms in Haryana's Panchkula district are set to be culled as some poultry samples there have tested positive for the avian flu.Rajasthan: Fresh cases of birds death were reported in parts of Rajasthan, taking the tally to 2,166.Himachal Pradesh: So far, 3,410 migratory birds have died due to bird flu in Pong Dam area of Kangra district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-delhi-sends-samples-to-bhopal-for-confirmation-states-ban-meat-import-101610159517861.html
09-01-2021||India||Babri Masjid demolition case: Ayodhya residents challenge acquittal of accused||A criminal revision petition was filed with the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Friday, challenging the special CBI court’s September 30, 2020 order in the Babri Masjid demolition case, which acquitted all the 32 accused, including senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Kalyan Singh.Haji Mehboob and Haji Saiyyad Akhlaq Ahmad, both natives of Ayodhya, filed the revision petition on behalf of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). Both were litigants in the Babri mosque demolition case.“We decided to challenge the special court’s judgment after the CBI did not move the high court against the acquittal,” Mehboob said.Mehboob and Ahmad have presented themselves as witnesses in the case and also as aggrieved persons in the riots that followed the Babri mosque demolition on December 6, 1992.The case is likely to come up for hearing next week.The special CBI court had acquitted all 32 persons accused of conspiring to demolish the 16th century Babri mosque on December 6, 1992 that sparked a deadly cycle of riots and communal violence across India, leaving hundreds dead.The verdict by judge Surendra Kumar Yadav ended a 28-year-long legal fight, and brought relief to senior BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, but raised serious questions about the investigation into the high-profile case.The 2300-page judgment ruled out any criminal conspiracy behind the razing of the disputed structure and found it to be a “spontaneous act”.“The incident was not pre-planned,” the judge had said in the verdict, and added that “the leaders present there actually tried to control and pacify the mob... anti-social elements brought the structure down.”The judgment largely focused on the lack of credible evidence provided by the CBI, the probe agency.Yadav said in his judgment that the CBI could not produce any conclusive evidence against any accused and refused to accept newspaper reports, documents and video cassettes as evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babri-masjid-demolition-case-ayodhya-residents-challenge-acquittal-of-accused-101610157730433.html

Omar Abdullah raises question||National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday questioned why India is still at the stage of conducting vaccine dry runs while restricted, emergency-use approval has already been given to two vaccines — Serum Institute of India's Covishield, developed by Oxford University and Astrazeneca and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, developed in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology, Pune."Why are we still doing mock drills? The vaccines were given emergency approval more than 4 days ago. Many other countries started administering the first doses within hours of granting emergency approval. What’s the hold up now?" he tweeted on Friday when all states and union territories conducted the second dry run successfully.The second mock drill was conducted on Friday in 736 districts across 33 states and union territories. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has said that vaccine shots will be sent to states and UTs shortly.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on Friday, issued guidelines to all aircraft operators who plan to transport Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice to various parts of the country.If vaccines packed in dry ice is being transported in the passenger cabin of an aircraft, then the flight crew should be properly trained on the hazards and risks of its transportation, the aviation regulator noted.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of all states on Monday to discuss the Covid-19 situation and the vaccination roll-out in the country, the PMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-are-we-still-doing-vaccine-mock-drills-omar-abdullah-raises-question-101610156387741.html
09-01-2021||India||Is there deferred distress in rural labour markets?||The Indian economy suffered an annual contraction of 23.9% during the April-June quarter of the current fiscal year. This was largely due to a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown that started on March 25 to prevent a rise in Covid-19 infections. Among the biggest manifestations of the lockdown was a large reverse migration of workers from the cities to the countryside. This generated fears of a glut in rural markets and hence a rise in unemployment and crash in rural wages, which had already been declining.India does not have official high-frequency data on rural employment. While the annual Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS) are an improvement over the earlier practice of five-yearly Employment-Unemployment Surveys (EUS), quarterly PLFS data is only available for urban areas. Even these surveys do not give information on wages and size of the labour force. The latter matters because, absolute number of jobs, for a given unemployment rate, could increase or decrease with the size of the labour force. To be sure, private estimates such as those from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI) have been talking about continuing job losses in the economy.An HT analysis of the latest available rural wage data (until September) , which is compiled by the Labour Bureau, suggests a growing, although deferred, stress in rural labour markets.Real rural wages grew during the lockdown but have started falling againInflation-adjusted rural wages had been falling on an annual basis from October 2019 to March 2020. There is no data on rural wages for the month of April, perhaps because of the near total lockdown. However, rural wage growth jumped into positive territory in May, June and July. This trend has reversed itself in the months of August and September, when real wage growth turned negative again. An occupation-wise breakup of rural wages shows that the non-agricultural wages are facing a bigger squeeze than agricultural wages. The former started falling from August itself, while the latter only fell in September. Interestingly, agricultural wages had been contracting in the months of May and June while non-agricultural wages had risen on an annual basis. Among non-agricultural occupations, handicraft workers suffered the biggest fall in wages in August and September, which suggests that this could be a result of weak demand from urban markets. To be sure, wages for all non-agricultural occupations, except beedi making, had entered contraction zone by September 2020.Going forward, the base effect will have to be filtered inRural wage data for October will be available next month. It remains to be seen whether there is a recovery or the trend of contraction only became stronger. Any conclusion on the trend in wages will have to take into account the base effect because of an annual contraction during the October 2019 to March 2020 period. For example, even if average rural wages grew 1% in October 2020, they still would be lower than the October 2018 levels. The rate of contraction in rural wages increased from October to December 2019. This means that 2020 wages will have to grow at a higher rate to maintain even 2018 levels.High inflation is putting a squeeze on rural incomesMonthly inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has been above the upper limit of the RBI’s tolerance band of 6% for eight months in a row. CPI rural has gained 16 basis points between April and September. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Quickening inflation is a major reason for the growing squeeze on rural wages. Nominal growth in rural wages during August and September 2020 was higher than what it was a year ago. Yet, wages contracted in real terms due to higher inflation in 2020. With retail inflation having peaked in October 2020, and expected (according to a Reuters poll of economists) to fall sharply to 5.3% in December from its November value of 6.9%, there should be some easing of pressure on real incomes in rural areas. To be sure, the data also suggests a growing weakness in rural labour markets. Even nominal wages have declined month-on-month for two successive months in August and September. This has not happened in successive months ever since it declined for two successive months in December 2013 and January 2014. The last time nominal rural wages declined month-on-month was in December 2018.Different trends across statesState-wise, real rural wages in five of eighteen states for which data is available -- Punjab, Haryana, Kerala, Assam and Tripura – were the lowest in September 2020 in the past five years. In Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh the wages in September 2020 were the lowest in the last two years, while in Uttar Pradesh, the wages were the lowest since October 2016. The three states that have seen the biggest fall in their wage rates (inflation adjusted) since June – the month after which wages started declining nationally month-on-month are Madhya Pradesh (21.26%), Himachal Pradesh (10.33%), and Assam (8.24%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-there-deferred-distress-in-rural-labour-markets-101610147281642.html
09-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath’s office faces sealing for violating rules||Authorities were due to resume the process for sealing a building in Chennai on Friday as the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) has been using for its activities even as it was meant to run a lungi unit. They had taken police protection to seal the building on Wednesday but the operation was suspended after TNTJ protested saying it was not served any notice.TNTJ, an Islamic organisation founded in 2004, said they have been paying Rs4 lakh rent annually for 12 years to the government-appointed custodian of the property.The Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI), which is empowered to appropriate properties of Pakistani nationals in India, took over the building after its owner, Tuba Khaleeli, settled in Pakistan in the 1960s.Also Read: Wilson murder case: NIA arrests accused man from Chennai airportI Ansari, the group’s state secretary, said TNTJ’s former general sectary R Rehamatullah runs a wholesale lungi business from the building. “...social welfare activities of TNTJ have also been on-going for 12 years. All the rental bills are in his name and we have been ready to purchase this after the 2017 amendment (to the Enemy Property Act, 1968). So how can they suddenly come to seal the building with no notice or prior information? We are readying our legal recourse.”A CEPI official said issuing notices is not part of their procedures. “They [TNTJ] asked for two days... we agreed and that will serve as the notice period. Following that we will seal the building because they have violated the rules.”The Centre in January last year formed a panel to monitor the sale of enemy properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-thowheed-jamath-s-office-faces-sealing-for-violating-rules-101610140450813.html
09-01-2021||India||SC seeks Centre’s reply on arming forest guards over brutal assaults by poachers||Concerned over rising cases of violence against forest rangers by poachers and encroachers, the Supreme Court on Friday termed the situation “serious” and asked the Centre to spell out within four weeks measures such as arming them with weapons and providing them helmets and bulletproof vests to protect both the forests and their own lives.What acted as a trigger for the Court to pass the direction was an application filed by environmental activist Kishore Rithe highlighting brutal assaults against forest guards and officers in the recent past.“There is an alarming rise in frequency and ferocity of brutal assaults on forest officials in the last six to eight months in various states.” Rithe stated in an application moved through his non-government organisation, Nature Conservation Society, in a pending case.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said: “We are of the view that the situation is serious...It is difficult to imagine how any law can be enforced by forest staff who are unarmed against poachers who are likely to be heavily armed…We don’t know what steps are being taken by the states where poaching is rampant to protect forest staff.”Senior advocate Shyam Divan who appeared for Rithe, highlighted three incidents in Madhya Pradesh and one incident each in Rajasthan and Maharashtra where forest personnel on patrolling duty were attacked by poachers or timber mafia with axes, hammers and other weapons.Divan pointed out that whenever a case is filed against poachers/encroachers, the latter either resort to such attacks or file criminal cases against forest staff under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as a counterblast. “India accounts for 31% of mortal attacks against forest rangers or officials across the world, which is quite high,” Divan said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, promised to work out a solution after consulting state governments. The CJI shared his personal experience of having once visited a forest reserve in Maharashtra where the guards were armed with sticks and walked through the forest wearing slippers, CJI Bobde remarked. In the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, forest guards were armed, he recalled.“We do not understand this unequal playing field where some states have armed forest guards while many don’t. Each forest officer has a responsibility equal to a policeman in a city,” observed the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The court-appointed amicus curiae (friend of the court) ADN Rao, assisting the bench in forest and environmental matters, told the bench that the problem was also about under-utilization of funds allocated to states.The bench said, “We will see how this money can be utilized for purchasing bullet-proof vests, purchase of arms for officers above a suitable rank, and helmets in addition to the regular things supplied to forest staff.”The Court directed the solicitor general to sit with the amicus curiae and Divan and make a joint submission on what additional measures can be adopted for protection of forests and the lives of forest staff. The court posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.In the meantime, Divan requested the court for a stay on all criminal proceedings initiated against forest staff at the behest of encroachers and sought an action taken report (ATR) from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan where forest staff were brutally attacked last year.The bench stayed the criminal cases as requested by Divan and directed the home secretaries of the three states to submit a report by the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-on-arming-forest-guards-over-brutal-assaults-by-poachers-101610139960876.html
09-01-2021||India||HC stays de-notification of elephant reserve in Uttarakhand||Uttarakhand’s high court on Friday stayed approval given by the state wildlife advisory board for de-notification of the Shivalik elephant reserve to make way for the expansion of the Dehradun airport. The court sought replies from the state government, the Centre, state biodiversity Board and the state wildlife board on the matter.A division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Lok Pal Singh issued these directions at the hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dehradun-based activist Reenu Paul.Abhijit Negi, counsel for the petitioner, said the PIL pointed out that the Supreme Court, “in a recent decision delivered by a three-judge bench led by the Chief Justice of India on October 14, 2020 had passed several guidelines for elephant conservation and the decision of the Uttarakhand state wildlife board was in the teeth of the said decision of the apex court.”Negi said citing provisions of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, the petitioner argued that “it was not open to the state wildlife board to de-notify the Shivalik elephant reserve in such a summery manner without assessing the ecological catastrophe that it can push the state and the entire region into”.The elephant reserve is spread over 5,405 square kilometres in eights districts of Uttarakhand.When the decision was taken on November 24, Uttarakhand’s forest minister Harak Singh Rawat the state wildlife board had approved the de-notification of the Shivalik elephant reserve because “there is no law to define an elephant reserve.”“In the late 90s and early 2000s, the state government had sent a proposal to the Centre seeking a clarification regarding the said area, after which it was notified as an elephant reserve in 2002. But as per the norms of the Central government, there is no law or Act yet under which the legal status of an elephant reserve is defined,” Rawat said.In September last year, the state government had written to the union environment ministry for prior approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 87.0815 hectares of forest land for expansion of Dehradun’s Jolly Grant Airport.This land falls within the Shivalik elephant reserve. Officials estimate that about 10,000 trees will be cut for the expansion.In October, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) had written to the state government, saying the state government “may explore alternatives for the proposal such as acquiring area lying north of the existing runway.”“...the entire proposed forest area for diversion falls within the Shivalik elephant reserve and elephant corridors within its 1 km radius. Moreover, the notified Kansaro-Barkot elephant corridor is located within a 5 km radius. The state government should consider avoiding these sensitive areas and explore alternative lands,” the ministry wrote.In November, responding to MoEFCC’s letter, the state government said alternative land will not serve the purpose because the existing runway needs to be expanded. With alternative land, a completely new airport will have to be built, it argued.Uttarakhand is home to over 2,000 elephants, according to an elephant census released in June last year. There are 2,026 elephants in the state currently, their number having increased from 1,559 in 2012.“This decision by the high court is a happy decision as elephant corridors need to be protected. Even a few decades ago, elephants used to move from Rajaji landscape till Corbett using these corridors but over time, these corridors have been encroached upon. Now, the authorities should focus on studying the behaviour and psyche of elephants,” said Ajay Singh Rawat, an Uttarakhand-based environmentalist,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-de-notification-of-elephant-reserve-in-uttarakhand-101610141188064.html
09-01-2021||India||Covid-19 :Bharat Biotech seeks nod for nasal vaccine trials||Bharat Biotech International Limited, which recently received the national drugs regulator’s emergency use approval for its injectable Coronavirus disease vaccine, has also moved an application to conduct Phase 1 clinical trials on its intranasal Covid-19 vaccine candidate.An official in the government with knowledge of the matter said the company had sought approval to start Phase 1 trials. A decision ion the application will be taken by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s subject expert committee.The company is likely to begin the trials around February or March, according to news agency PTI.In September last year, Bharat Biotech had inked a licensing agreement with Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis for a novel chimp- adenovirus, single dose intranasal vaccine for Covid-19. Bharat Biotech owns the rights to distribute the vaccine in all markets except the US, Japan and Europe.“…We are proud to collaborate on this innovative vaccine. We envision that we will scale this vaccine to 1 billion doses, translating to 1 billion individuals receiving a single-dose regimen. An intranasal vaccine will not only be simple to administer but reduce the use of medical consumables such as needles, syringes, etc., significantly impacting the overall cost of a vaccination drive,” the company had said in a statement.The company had also said that the intranasal vaccine candidate had shown unprecedented levels of protection in mice studies; the technology and data having been published in the prestigious scientific journal Cell and in an editorial in Nature.The logic behind taking an intranasal route is that both influenza and Covid-19 follow the same pattern of infection-- nose and mouth route into the lungs, which is why having mucosal immunity is important and the vaccine will also use the same nasal (drop) route.“The ideal vaccine in a pandemic should have an easy delivery mechanism that can reach easily to the villagers; even an anganwadi worker should be able to give it to the villagers. Look at the polio vaccine, it’s a great success because of the oral drop; it reached the last mile because of easy delivery of the vaccine. Similarly, nasal drop will work better. Also, the safety of the platform has been established in humans already,” Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech, had said in an earlier interview to HT.The company has vast experience in developing pandemic vaccines that includes H1N1, Zika, Chikungunya, and now the Covid-19 vaccine.“Our experience in viral vaccines, manufacturing capabilities, and distribution continue to be our strong suit in ensuring safe, efficacious, and affordable vaccines. It is prudent for Bharat to be involved in diverse but tenable projects to provide a much-needed vaccine against Covid-19 reaches all citizens of the world,” Ella added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-bharat-biotech-seeks-nod-for-nasal-vaccine-trials-101610140569328.html
09-01-2021||India||In constant touch with China on LAC row: MEA||India on Friday said it was maintaining communications with China for complete disengagement at friction points in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) against the backdrop of a stalemate in efforts aimed at ensuring de-escalation.At a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on December 18, the two sides reviewed developments on the LAC and agreed to hold another meeting between senior military commanders at an early date. However, the commanders are yet to meet, reflecting the differences between the two sides.“As you are aware, the latest round of WMCC was held on December 18. The two sides have agreed to hold the next round of senior commanders meeting and are in constant communication through diplomatic and military channels in this regard,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing on Friday.“In the meantime, both sides have maintained communication at the ground level to avoid any misunderstandings and misjudgements even as discussions continue for achieving complete disengagement in all friction areas in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements to restore peace and tranquillity,” he said, without giving details.The two sides had earlier acknowledged that talks between the military commanders had contributed to stability on the ground. The last two meetings between the military commanders were held on October 12 and November 6.Tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in along the LAC in sub-zero conditions after diplomatic and military talks failed to take forward disengagement at friction points in Ladakh sector. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said bilateral ties were “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of border agreements, and that the deployment of thousands of soldiers on the LAC had pushed relations into their most difficult phase ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-constant-touch-with-china-on-lac-row-mea-101610139577437.html
09-01-2021||India||Budget session may have 5-hr shifts, Question Hour to return||When President Ram Nath Kovind addresses a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament in Central Hall on January 29, it will likely be a packed house, but with social distancing and other stringent health protocols in place to ward off the threat of the coronavirus disease.A large number of lawmakers will be sitting in the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha chambers to watch Kovind’s first speech to Parliament since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has taken 150,000 Indian lives so far, including that of a Union minister and three MPs.In 2020, two sessions were cut short, and the Winter session was scrapped entirely due to the pandemic.The upcoming Budget session, the first this year, will emulate the health and safety protocols used in the Monsoon session. The schedule, however, may be extended. In the last session, both houses were scheduled to work in shifts of four hours each. “This time, both Houses may be allotted at least five hours as the workload will be much more,” a senior Rajya Sabha official, who asked not to be named, told HT.The longer hours are necessitated by the Budget session’s heavy-duty schedule, which includes a debate on the President’s speech, the presentation and passage of the general Budget, separate discussions on the functioning of at least ten ministries, clearing the Finance Bill, and other items on the legislative agenda.“We have made comprehensive preparations for the Budget session and it will be duly conducted,” Lok Saha Speaker Om Birla said at a function in Dehradun, on Thursday.When asked if Question Hour would a part of the schedule -- it was left out of the Monsoon session, leading to a war of words between the government and the Opposition -- he confirmed that it would be.Officials involved in the planning of the Budget Session said on condition of anonymity that the “new normal” in Parliament’s seating arrangement, which involves MPs of one House being spread over both Houses, is likely to remain in place because everyone, including Prime Minister Modi, health ministry officials, and health experts , are repeatedly emphasising the need to continue wearing masks and maintaining social distance.“The government has not told us to lower the guard against the pandemic. which means that we have to continue to take all possible safety precautions. including social distancing,” an official involved in the planning .Giant TV screens in different corners of the chambers, plexiglass sheets in front of members’ seats, a blanket ban on the entry of visitors, hourly sanitisation, MPs sitting in chambers as well as galleries — these were some of the unique features of the last Monsoon session that will be replicated this time.When asked if members of Parliament would be vaccinated against the coronavirus, Birla: “Our scientists and doctors have worked hard. Now, the government will decide how the vaccines would be given. The guidelines given by the Centre regarding the vaccine administration will be followed.”India’s drug regulator has given emergency use authorisation to two vaccines, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Vice president M. Venkaiah Naidu, chairman of the Rajya Sabha, is also deeply involved in the planning for the session. He has been given regular reports on the preparations being made and inputs have been sought from him for putting in place a foolproof system.Over the past few days, informal interactions have taken place between Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha officials over the preparations of the session.The Union Budget will be presented on February 1, and a host of bills are set to be cleared even as the Opposition is gearing up to protest against three contentious farm laws aimed at opening up agricultural trade has to massive agitation from farmers, particularly from Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-may-have-5-hr-shifts-question-hour-to-return-101610139036427.html
09-01-2021||India||Swaminathan says MSP better than loan waiver||Agricultural scientist Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan, known as the father of India’s Green Revolution, has said the Union government should fix minimum support prices (MSPs) for farm produce by using a broader and more comprehensive measure of cultivation costs than the one being currently used.Swaminathan first recommended that MSPs – which act as a floor price to avoid distress sales – should be “at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production” in the fifth report of the National Commission on Farmers set up under his chairmanship.“When we recommended 50% over costs, we meant complete costs called C2, which includes all assumed costs. In fact, that is what farmers are also demanding,” Swaminathan told HT in October. He did not, however, comment on the ongoing farm agitation against three contentious new laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy.The protesting farmers, apart from a repeal of the laws, have also demanded a law guaranteeing MSPs calculated using the C2 yardstick. The farmers will hold the next round of negotiations with the Centre on Friday.The C2 formula of calculating cost of cultivation includes the imputed cost of capital and the rent on the land to give farmers 50% returns, rather than a narrower measure that takes into account the all paid-out costs incurred by a farmer and the value of family labour (A2+FL ).How cost of production is calculated matters. Average MSPs fixed for winter-sown crops show that if C2 costs are used as a benchmark, returns for most crops are lower than 50%. However, when A2+FL is used, returns are higher than 50% in crops such as paddy and wheat.The Union government says it has implemented the Swaminathan commission recommendation by setting MSPs such that they offer 50% returns over costs of cultivation, a decision first announced in the 2018-19 budget.However, the government uses the narrower A2+FL measure to calculate MSPs.“Our demand is that MSPs should be based on C2 costs and the government should make it compulsory for all traders to pay MSP rates to farmers,” said Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader.Stressing that MSPs should include the broadest measure of a farmer’s costs including rental value of land, Swaminathan said: “Many states announce loan waivers. Instead of spending so much on loan waivers, the government should use the money to give 50% profits based on C2 costs.”It has been argued, however, that the Swaminathan report plainly states that “MSP should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production” without specifying which cost of production is to be used.Swaminathan’s report also states that the net take-home income of farmers should be comparable to those of civil servants.The Swaminathan Commission, set up in November 2004, has initially submitted four reports in December 2004, August 2005, December 2005 and April 2006, followed by a fifth and final report in October 2006.“The recommendation of 50% profits over cost needs to be read along with other sections of Swaminathan’s report including Annexure 2.2 which clearly delineates how C2 was not getting covered by MSP in most states’,” said Arun Kavi of Farmers’ Rights Forum, an advocacy group.On September 28, 2017, Swaminathan tweeted that MSPs should be calculated to cover C2+50%, in addition to being accompanied by procurement, storage and distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swaminathan-says-msp-better-than-loan-waiver/story-2qopTgacvZ8VQmXRHS8gLJ.html
