30-01-2021||India||'BJP, AIADMK will contest together in Tamil Nadu': Nadda||BJP national president JP Nadda formally announced on Saturday night that the alliance with the ruling AIADMK will continue for the assembly elections slated for April-May. The announcement came during his rally in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai district. "The BJP has decided in the coming times it will contest with the AIADMK and other like-minded parties in the elections," said Nadda, clad in traditional Tamil attire.The AIADMK had been the first to make the move by announcing that their alliance formed ahead of the 2019 parliamentary elections will continue as early as November when Union home minister Amit Shah was in Chennai to inaugurate infrastructure projects.The party had also announced chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami as its candidate for the top post. Since then, there was uneasiness between the two partners as the BJP did not reciprocate initially. As tension mounted, the state leaders maintained that as a national party, it was the norm for their leadership in Delhi to make the announcements. It was expected to be made by Nadda who is on his second visit to the state this month. Earlier, on Pongal day, he addressed the 51st anniversary of Thuglak magazine currently being edited by S Gurumurthy.Also read: Agitation continues to gain momentum, as more farmers head towards DelhiParty president JP Nadda who arrived in the temple town late Friday night visited the famous Meenakshi Amman temple accompanied by his wife on Saturday morning. He also conducted a series of meetings with the state party’s core committee, social media volunteers and newly joined members before addressing the public on Saturday evening. The BJP’s poll plank has been to consolidate Hindu votes by attacking the opposition’s MK Stalin-led DMK. The BJP carried out a ‘vetrivel yatra’ (victorious spear march) which has subsequently become its electioneering slogan which they say is to protect Hindu interests in the state.Nadda highlighted central schemes that have benefited the state and reiterated that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a supporter of Tamil language having quoted Tamil poet-saint Thiruvalluvar on several national and international platforms. “When he was, elected not only was the future of India safe but the destiny of Tamil Nadu also changed in its development,” said Nadda. He added that the state received justice comparing funds allotted to it during the UPA regime and the current Modi government. Last week, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Modi-led BJP, stating that Tamil Nadu was in danger as they disrespected the southern state, its language and culture.Meanwhile, AIADMK top leadership was also in Madurai on Saturday as Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam inaugurated a temple with life-size bronze statues of their late stalwarts - MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa. The temple is located in a sprawling 12-acre plot in Thirumangalam and was constructed for ₹50-lakh. The bronze statues weigh 400-kilograms each. Speaking after the unveiling, Palaniswami revered the late leaders and rallied the crowd to work towards winning the upcoming assembly elections slated for April-May. Even while the BJP swept the parliamentary polls across India in 2014 and 2019, it was trounced in Tamil Nadu. The DMK won 38/39 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 drubbing the AIADMK-BJP combine.The AIADMK is aiming for a consecutive third term after winning back-to-back polls under Jayalalithaa’s leadership before she passed away while in office in December 2016. With Jayalalithaa's close aide and expelled leader VK Sasikala set to return to Chennai, Palaniswami-led AIADMK has been firm that she won't be taken back into the party and is appropriating the MGR-Jayalalithaa legacy in a series of actions. Besides campaigning on their legacy, the AIADMK is hopeful based on their performance in tackling Covid-19, its welfare schemes and reservation measures.Other allies of the AIADMK-led NDA alliance, such as the PMK and the DMDK, have also been posturing. The PMK has demanded that the AIADMK carves a 20 per cent reservation for their community and vote bank - the Vanniyars - under the existing Most Backward Caste quota. The DMDK has asked the AIADMK to allot them 41 seats as they did in 2011 and have also welcomed Sasikala into politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-and-aiadmk-will-contest-together-in-tamil-nadu-nadda-101612030456278.html

30-01-2021||India||Shah welcomes TMC rebels in Delhi; Bengal politics enters 'chartered plane era'||Less than 24 hours after cancelling his two-day trip to Bengal because of the IED blast outside the Israeli embassy in Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday evening welcomed former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Rajib Banerjee and a group of rebels into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at his Delhi residence.Those who joined the BJP alongside Banerjee are Vaishali Dalmiya, MLA from Bally in Howrah who was expelled by the TMC recently; Prabir Ghosal, MLA from Uttarpara in Hooghly district; Rathin Chakraborty, former mayor of Howrah town; Partha Sarathi Chatterjee, former MLA from Ranaghat in Nadia district and actor Rudranil Ghosh, who recently started speaking against the TMC. Banerjee, who was Bengal’s forest minister, resigned from the Domjur assembly seat in Howrah on Friday.Instead of offering them the BJP flag, Shah welcomed the TMC leaders with the party’s saffron scarves.Tweeting his photograph with the TMC leaders, Shah wrote, "Former TMC leaders Mr. Rajib Banerjee, Ms. Baishali Dalmiya, Mr. Prabir Ghoshal, Mr. Rathin Chakraborti and Mr. Rudranil Ghosh joined BJP today in New Delhi. I am sure their induction will further strengthen BJP’s fight for Sonar Bangla."Amar Sonar Bangla, or my golden Bengal, was a song Rabindranath Tagore composed in 1905 during the partition of the Bengal province by Lord Curzon.Also read: BJP, AIADMK will continue alliance for Tamil Nadu assembly elections, says NaddaWhile the exodus was expected, the high point of the day was the chartered flight that Shah arranged to ferry the rebel TMC leaders to the capital and send them back at night so that they can attend the rally that he was supposed to physically address in Howrah on Sunday afternoon. It was announced that Shah will virtually address the rally.Never before in Bengal was a chartered plane hired by a party to carry defectors, political observers said. The incident left its mark, with Banerjee and his co-passengers repeating before the media how they felt “extremely honoured” by Shah’s gesture. The small plane took off from Kolkata airport at 4.10 pm. The flight became a topic of discussion on social media in Bengal, with images of the rebels posing in front of the plane getting shared by the thousands with comments.Only Ghosh, the actor, missed the special ride but he managed to reach Delhi on a commercial flight.“It is a day of great honour for us. The home minister called us here as he had to postpone his trip. He took the initiative and sent a chartered plane. Bengal has suffered for years by fighting with the Centre. The state cannot have all-round development without the Centre’s help and participation. I told the home minister that Bengal should be offered a special package if we win the polls. He assured me that Bengal is his priority,” Banerjee said while leaving Shah’s home.The cover photo of Banerjee’s Facebook page was changed by 9 pm, with a message from the Bengal chief minister replaced by a shade of saffron and a new slogan, “with the people.”The BJP announced that since Shah cannot leave Delhi, Union minister Smriti Irani will address the rally in Howrah on Sunday where many people are supposed to join the BJP.Also read: Agitation continues to gain momentum, as more farmers head towards Delhi“Several district office-bearers of the TMC and some prominent actors will join us on Sunday. Wait and watch,” said Banerjee who is scheduled to deliver his first address as a BJP leader.“This is BJP. Since Amit Shah Ji could not visit Bengal and induct us he sent a chartered flight for us. I want to contest from Bally and work for the people,” said Dalmiya.A businesswoman and daughter of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, she joined politics in 2016. So did Ghosal, a senior journalist. Ghosh, a known face on screen, used to be a CPI(M) supporter during the Left era and switched over to the TMC after Mamata Banerjee came to power.Political analyst and columnist Suvashis Maitra said the chartered plane marked the beginning of a new era in state politics.“Bengal was always known as a state where exorbitant expenditure in electoral politics never made news even when the trend of keeping defectors in exotic resorts before floor tests had become a regular feature in several states. The plane changed that,” said Maitra.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and national vice-president Mukul Roy accompanied the rebels to Delhi.Senior TMC leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee said, “It is not a matter of honour if someone leaves the TMC for no definite ideology. Our party is huge. We do not stop anyone from leaving.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-welcomes-tmc-rebels-in-delhi-bengal-politics-enters-chartered-plane-era-101612028389802.html

It also asked Court to direct provide its users with an opt-out option while using its services, to allow users to opt-out of sharing their data with Facebook for marketing and advertising purpose.Earlier this month WhatsApp had introduced its privacy policy mandating its users to accept its terms and conditions, failing which the accounts and services would be terminated after February 08, 2021, for the respective user.After facing criticism over the privacy policy, WhatApp took to micro-blogging site Twitter clarifying that "no one will have their account suspended or deleted on February 8 and we will be moving back our business plans until after May."Earlier Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) also filed a plea in the top court challenging the new WhatsApp policy stating that the Centre has failed to discharge its constitutional duty and responsibility by protecting the privacy rights of citizens forcing the petitioner to approach the top court.It had sought a direction to WhatsApp and Facebook to allow the government to carry out 'Technical Audits' of their data centres, where the data of Indian Users are stored, so as the retrieve and delete such data of Indian Users.It had said that in 2016, Germany, the United Kingdom and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook which was also asked to delete all the data relating to Whatsapp users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-moved-in-supreme-court-seeking-stay-on-whatsapp-privacy-policy-updates-101612028107912.html

On November 29, it mauled a 19-year-old girl Pasula Nirmala to death at the Mannewada hamlet of Penchikalpet block.“Yes, the same man-eater is back in the Asifabad forests again. Last time, it had escaped all the traps we had laid to capture it and went deep into the Maharashtra forests. After nearly two months, it has appeared again,” district forest officer S Santaram said.He said the department authorities have alerted the tribals in all the hamlets close to the forests and asked them not to venture into the forests for grazing cattle or to fetch forest produce.“We have laid traps once again and are working out other methods to capture it as per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). Since it has already tasted human flesh, it will definitely pose a danger to human habitations,” Santaram said.The forest officers have already been campaigning extensively in the tribal villages to create awareness among villagers on do’s and don’ts they need to follow to prevent incidents of wild animal attacks.“We have asked them to move in groups when they go inside the forests for harvesting of crops or other agriculture operations. One or two of them should keep a watch on the movement of animals and sound an alert by drum beating or blowing trumpets when they spot wild animals,” the official said.The forest officials suggested that the tribals constitute a village protection committee comprising local sarpanch and forest beat officer, which will monitor the movement of tigers and inform the higher officials immediately. All the tribals venturing into forests should inform the protection committee about their movement, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maneater-which-killed-2-tribals-in-telangana-s-kumaram-bheem-resurfaces-101612027462518.html

Reports said more and more farmers from various states of the country have now come to Delhi's borders to join the movement. By February 2, a record number of people will join the protests at the Delhi borders including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, claimed various farmer leaders as per a PTI report."People from several areas area are heading towards Delhi borders to join the agitation. Our 'jatha' (group) of at least 700-800 tractors will leave for the Tikri border protest site on Sunday," Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said according to PTI. BKU (Rajewal) leader Balbir Singh Rajewal also said that people are reaching the protest sites in large numbers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. "Possibly by February 2, there will again a record gathering of people at the protest sites," claimed Rajewal while insisting that it would be completely peaceful.Also Read | ‘BJP leaders’: AAP on ‘locals’ who pelted stones on farmers at Singhu borderAs Singhu and Ghazipur borders turned into a fortress amid escalating tension, Rajewal urged people to not get provoked by any misinformation otherwise it would harm the ongoing movement. He appealed to the people joining the agitation at the Delhi border to keep the protest peaceful.Meanwhile, people who were not able to join the agitation in Delhi observed a hunger strike in Punjab, the PTI also reported. Protesting farmers also burnt effigies of Union ministers at 400 places in 14 districts, including Sangrur and Mohali, to mark their disapproval of the farm legislation. To express solidarity with protesting farmers, panchayats of some villages in Bathinda, Ludhiana and Sangrur in Punjab even passed resolutions, asking villagers to send one person from each family to the protest sites, PTI reported citing farmer leaders.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than two months now against the new farm laws. They are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers but so far it failed to bring any resolution to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agitation-continues-to-gain-momentum-as-more-farmers-head-towards-delhi-101612027411953.html

I myself visited there and sent several hundred water tankers, but the Delhi police, at the behest of BJP, are not letting the tankers reach farmers.""The Delhi police are also blocking food provisions, machines to clean toilets, and doctors that the Delhi government has provided from reaching farmers," he added.On being asked about the attack on Alipur SHO, he said, "They are all BJP workers. Have they told you they let that attacker off the hook? If you want, I can provide pictures of some BJP workers present at the attack site."The minister critisised the Haryana government over suspension of telecom services, and use of tear gar and water cannon on farmers."Both the JJP and Khattar government are oppressing the farmers. They say they are with farmers but they are doing the opposite. The JJP is ordering the tear gas and water cannon attacks on farmers," he said.He criticised Captain Amarinder Singh over his 'Pakistani elements' remark saying that Captain sahab is trying to give a new angle to every issue. One the one hand, he is making pretense of supporting farmers, and on the other, humiliating them.He said the attacks in the name of farmers are all orchestrated by the BJP.On Tuesday, during the tractor rally, a group of farmers deviated from the assigned route, broke through barriers, clashed with security personnel in several parts of Delhi. They also vandalised property and even entered the Red Fort, where they hoisted their flags.Over 25 FIRs have been registered in connection with the January 26 violence.

Especially these last days, we raised the level of alert due to some threats," he added, without giving further details."We are not surprised."Indian media reports said investigators had found an envelope with a letter addressed to the Israeli ambassador in the street.The Indian Express newspaper reported that the letter described the low-intensity explosion as a "trailer" and made references to "Iranian martyrs" Qasem Soleimani and Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.Soleimani, considered Iran's most powerful military commander, was killed in a US drone strike in January 2020.Fakhrizadeh, one of the country's top nuclear scientists, was killed in November -- an assassination for which Iran blamed Israel.In 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran for a bomb attack on an Israeli diplomatic car in Delhi that injured at least three people.Asked whether there was an Iranian link this time, Malka said: "Those non-state actors that are striving for destablization in the region and the world don't like what is happening between Israel and India, that are striving for stability and peace."It might be a threat for them."The device exploded as India and Israel marked the 29th anniversary of their diplomatic relations, and Malka said the timing was part of the investigation.India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar spoke to his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi after the incident."We take this very seriously," Jaishankar said. "No effort will be spared to find the culprits."The national security advisors of both countries have also held discussions.Since establishing relations, India and Israel have become close and India is now one of the biggest buyers of Israeli weapons and defence equipment.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Israel in 2017, and Netanyahu made a return visit a year later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-embassy-in-delhi-on-high-alert-before-bomb-blast-ambassador-101612026727862.html
30-01-2021||India||A year after first Covid-19 case, Kerala continues to grapple with pandemic||A year after the country’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Thrissur on Jan 30 last Kerala is still grappling with pandemic situation with high active caseload and test positivity rate (TPR), health ministry statistics show. As fever still runs high it exposes tall claims of the state government and leaves many questions on its pandemic management.On Saturday, the state reported another high of 6,282 new Covid-19 cases with a positivity rate of 10.51 per cent while the active caseload stands at 71,469. According to the latest statistics, at least 48 per cent of the country’s new cases (13,082) are from the southern state. Among 10 worst-affected districts, seven are from Kerala. As the situation remained grim, the state government, which basked in old glory, turned defensive.“We take criticism positively. But some people are criticising us just for the sake of criticism. They now find fault with all our measures. But we can say the state’s mortality rate (below 0.5 per cent) is still the lowest in the country,” said state health minister KK Shailaja adding the government was doing everything possible to contain the spread of the virus.Despite chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s claim last week, that daily tests will be increased to one lakh, on Saturday 59,759 samples were tested and more than half were antigen tests.Also read: 5 rebel Trinamool leaders meet Amit Shah, join BJPEarlier, experts had warned the state to shed its obsession with low-accuracy and cheap antigen tests and opt for more RT-PCR tests. Messing up of data, fatigue among health workers and system and over-confidence after the arrival of vaccine aggravated the situation and the state will have to do enough homework to contain the spread, they said. The state also turned its back on its scientific community ignoring scholastic and clinical research during the outbreak “but it was interested more in running commentaries and PR exercise,” they said.“Controlling the pandemic is not a political exercise. The government should have roped in enough public health experts and epidemiologists. But they were given a short shrift,” said Dr S S Lal, a US-returned public health expert.“Kerala is by no means a success story but I won’t call it a failure too. Real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the middle-east. There were tell-tale signs to community spread but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread,” said G Pramod Kumar, former senior advisor to the United National Development Programme.Let’s see how things unfolded in the state from day one. “I was speechless when I heard my daughter was positive. When she returned home from Wuhan (epicentre in China), where she was pursuing her medical studies, we were really relieved. But it was short-lived,” said the father of the 21-year-old girl who was the country's first Covid-19 patient.“My wife and I insisted we should meet her and enough prodding was required. First time we both wore heavy PPE kits in our life and met our daughter. When I recollect the meeting, it leaves enough shivers down my spine,” he said. Soon after this, the entire family were moved to an institutional quarantine centre.Two days later, two other China-returned students, who came along with her, tested positive. Both turned negative after two weeks but the first victim had to spend 28 days in the hospital to turn negative and another two weeks under mandatory observation.For almost two months, the state managed the contagion well and the pandemic was restricted to China-returnees. But in March, things took a dramatic turn after a family returned from Italy hid their travel history and interacted with many in Pathanamthitta. The state, for the first time, heard a new word “super spreader”. At least 22 of family members and neighbours were infected but all of them were nursed back to their life.Also read: Black Lives Matter - All you need to know about Nobel Peace Prize nomineeThe countrywide lockdown helped the state to manage things well and it put severe restrictions on even people coming from other states. Next two months (May-June) the state was on the verge of flattening the curve and many, including the international media, lauded its pandemic control measures.But things slowly shifted after the lockdown was lifted and its large population from the Gulf countries started returning to the state, still it managed its numbers well.After Onam festival in September last year, cases started swelling again. Many, including Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, blamed the state for lowering its guard that resulted in the second wave. The situation aggravated after local body elections in December, the wave continues.But chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan put up a brave face saying the state did whatever it can and there was no flaw on its part.“Ups and downs are nature of the pandemic.

Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-laws-will-break-the-backbone-of-agri-sector-arundhati-roy-101612024893499.html

30-01-2021||India||Parathas, pickle and buttermilk: Rakesh Tikait's tears draw food in form of love||Villagers brought water in clay pots and home-made food for Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday in a show of support for the ongoing stir against the new farm laws, even as local authorities sent tankers of drinking water and mobile toilets at the protest site.Tikait urged the government to restore internet services, which have been banned by the Centre at protest sites on Delhi's borders Saturday.A little boy from a Ghaziabad village reached the protest with a tiffin filled with homemade 'parathas' and pickle along with water. Some villagers from western Uttar Pradesh including places like Muzaffarnagar, Greater Noida, and Meerut also reached Ghazipur border with water and buttermilk in clay pots to feed the protestors.Water and power supply at the protest site was disrupted by the local administration two days ago following an ultimatum to protestors to vacate the spot by Thursday night, prompting Tikait to say he would drink water only when farmers bring it from their villages but continue the stir.Overwhelmed by emotion, tears welled up the eyes of Tikait, who had proclaimed he would rather commit suicide than end the protest for farmers."A conspiracy is being planned by the BJP to weaken the agitation of farmers," Tikait claimed, a day after a BKU member filed a complaint at Kashambi police station here against two BJP MLAs for allegedly orchestrating violence at the protest site.A senior police official confirmed to PTI that the complaint was made against Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar and Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma but FIR has not been lodged.Tikait also urged the Centre to restore internet services at protest sites so that farmers could put forth their views and demands on social media.Besides sending water tankers, the Ghaziabad civic bodies have also re-stationed mobile toilets at the protest site on Saturday, as support for the farmers' protest swelled with more villagers pouring in at the Delhi- Meerut highway in Ghazipur on the border with Uttar Pradesh.   The Bharatiya Kisan Union-led protest against the Centre's new farm laws here looked like it was going slim on Thursday but more protestors have joined the stir, following a mahapanchayat of farmers on Saturday in Muzaffarnagar, while supporters also joined in from Haryana and Rajasthan districts."The movement was and is strong," BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI.Khatana, who is at the demonstration site with BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, said there has been continuous support for the "peaceful protest" against the farmers' demand for removal of the new agri laws."This is not a political protest. Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between," he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said, "Farmers are coming in to show solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd."On Friday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parathas-pickle-and-buttermilk-rakesh-tikait-s-tears-draw-food-in-form-of-love-101612023935508.html

30-01-2021||India||ED arrests Joint MD of rice export firm KRBL in AgustaWestland scam||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested Anoop Kumar Gupta -- businessman and joint managing director of one of the largest rice exporting firms of the country – KRBL Ltd, known for its flagship brand India Gate basmati rice, in connection with its money laundering probe into the ₹3,727 crore AgustaWestland scam, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.Gupta was produced before the court of Special CBI Judge Arvind Kumar at Rouse Avenue Courts on Saturday.ED’s Special Public Prosecutor N K Matta, while seeking Gupta’s 14 days custody, informed the court that the accused has been giving evasive replies and hasn’t been cooperating with the agency. The court sent him to five days custody of the Enforcement Directorate.Matta further said that the accused is “required to be confronted with number of documents and persons to ascertain the money trail and determine the role of various accused persons in the commission of the offence of money laundering and to unearth how the kickbacks were routed and laundered.”The anti-money laundering agency said that approximately Euro 70 million proceeds of crime were laundered through two channels for payment of kickbacks to various political persons, bureaucrats, Air Force officials and others to influence the contract for supply of 12 VVIP helicopters in favour of Anglo-Italian firm – AgustaWestland.Explaining Gupta’s role, Matta informed the court – “It is submitted that M/s IDS Information Technology and Engineering Sarl, Tunisia have received proceeds of crime to the tune of Euro 24.37 million from AgustaWestland and out of this about Euro 12.4 million were further transferred to M/s Interstellar Technologies Ltd, Mauritius, and proceeds of crime were further transferred to various companies including M/s Rawasi Al Khaleej General Trading LLC Dubai, a company formed through KRBL’s Dubai arm - KRBL DMCC.”Gupta was one of the directors of KRBL DMCC and M/s Rawasi Al Khaleej General Trading (RAKGT) LLC Dubai was used to route proceeds of crime in the VVIP chopper scam, Matta said.“In 2009, the entire stake (49% shareholding) of KRBL DMCC held in RAKGT was transferred in the name of Anurag Poddar but in fact even after March 31, 2009, RAKGT is under control of KRBL Ltd through Gupta and parts of proceeds received in RAKGT were transferred to KRBL Ltd,” ED informed the court.The ED has received some documents on December 17, 2020 which shows that Gupta was controlling the financial transactions of the company.Gupta’s counsel Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa said – “The arrest is malafide. According to ED’s own case, the entire stake of KRBL held in RAKGT was sold to one Anurag Poddar in 2009 and the alleged bribe has come after that. So, how can he be held liable for something he is not part of? He has no link to the money. Also, Mr Gupta has always provided all the documents whenever asked for, he has completely cooperated every time that he has been called by ED. Then why take him in custody?”An email sent to KRBL remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-arrests-joint-md-of-rice-export-firm-krbl-in-agustawestland-scam-101612018266577.html

According to a person aware of the details, though LJP’s Chirag Paswan was invited for the meeting, he later stayed away citing ill-health.The NDA has lost two of its oldest allies, the Shiva Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-facts-to-counter-misgivings-on-farm-laws-pm-modi-101612018840111.html

30-01-2021||India||Rakesh Tikait is the cynosure of many eyes – not just farmers||His tears exercised an emotive pull even he may not have envisaged, helping turn the tide for a movement that seemed to have lost both sheen and momentum after the violence on Republic Day. It was but a moment in time and Rakesh Tikait was the man in it.He was once a Delhi Police constable, tried his hand at electoral politics and been a farmer leader for years. But Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait has broken out of the confines of western Uttar Pradesh to find a space in the national spotlight as arguably the most powerful farm leader of the day.The two-month farmer movement against the Centre’s three farm laws was till now dominated by protesters from the fields of Punjab and Haryana who set up camp at the Singhu and Tikri border points into the city. Now, the focus has shifted to Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where farmers are gathering in thousands to boost the fight that seemed to have been weakening only two days ago.A day after the Republic Day violence in Delhi, when a section of farmers taking part in the tractor parade broke through barriers, clashed with police and stormed the Red Fort for a few hours, the farmer game it seemed to be over. Morale plummeted and many farmers returned home. On Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration issued an “ultimatum” to the protesters occupying a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway to vacate as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.And then came the Tikait moment. As security presence at the site escalated and fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, an emotional Tikait broke down while talking to reporters.“The protest won’t be called off. Farmers are being met with injustice,” he said and even threatened to end his life for the cause.It soon emerged that the 51-year-old who was leading BKU supporters at the Ghazipur border since November 28, was no ordinary man at all. His call for continuing the protest against the government struck a deep emotional chord. Videos of his emotional outburst were circulated across multiple platforms.It led to his brother Naresh Tikait calling a ‘mahapanchayat’ at their home town in Muzaffarnagar on Friday where tens of thousands of farmers gathered to back the movement.The crowd at Ghazipur border that had reduced to 500 on Thursday night grew manifold over the next 12 hours, running into well over 5,000 in next 24 hours. The farmer movement was not just revived but further energised.Tikait, who has been part of a delegation talking with the Centre over the ongoing protest, is also one of the accused in the January 26 violence in Delhi that saw one farmer dying when his tractor overturned and hundreds of people, including police personnel, being injured.He has denied the allegations of conspiracy and demanded a judicial probe into the violence, blaming infiltrators in the tractors’ parade of the unrest. To be named as an accused by the Delhi Police is perhaps strange for Tikait, who served as a head constable in the force but quit in 1992-93 when he had to deal with a farmers’ agitation led by his father, the legendary Mahendra Singh Tikait.Born on June 4, 1969 in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait joined BKU after quitting the Delhi Police and gained prominence as a farm leader after the death of his father to cancer in May 2011.Mahendra Tikait, who was hailed as “messiah” of farmers, had inherited the ‘Chaudhary’ title of the regional Baliyan khap (a social and administrative system in parts of north India) at the age of eight from his father. Going by the tradition of the khap, the title passed on to his elder son and Rakesh Tikait’s elder brother Naresh.But Rakesh Tikait, a BA graduate from the Meerut University, was designated national spokesperson of the BKU. He has two younger brothers -- Surendra, who works as a manager in a sugar mill, and Narendra, engaged in agriculture.The father of three – two daughters and a son -- has been at loggerheads with various governments on a range of farmers’ issues, including loan waivers, minimum support price (MSP), power tariff and land acquisition in states such as UP, Haryana Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh.He also tried his hand at elections but lost both times.In 2007, he contested the UP Assembly polls from Khatauli constituency in Muzaffarnagar as an independent candidate. In 2014, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Amroha district on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket.It’s an affluent family.Ahead of the 2014 polls, Tikait had declared assets worth ₹4.25 crore, including ₹10 lakh cash, and liabilities of ₹10.95 lakh with land worth over ₹3 crore forming the biggest chunk of his assets.He also declared three criminal cases against him in the election affidavit. These cases were lodged in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, and Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh.The vocal farmer leader had to spend nights behind the bars for defying public servant’s orders during several of the protests that he has led in the past decade.Having dug in his heels along with his supporters at the Ghazipur border amid a deadlock with the Centre over the new farm laws, Tikait on Saturday was once again teary eyed.But this time overwhelmed by emotion as villagers, including children, reached the protest site carrying water, homemade food and buttermilk, after he announced he would drink water only when farmers will bring it since the local administration had barred water tankers at the protest site.Rakesh Tikait is now the cynosure of many eyes – and it’s not just farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-is-the-cynosure-of-many-eyes-not-just-farmers-101612017260597.html
30-01-2021||India||Delhi Police, families of injured personnel stage protest against Jan 26 attack||Delhi Police Mahasangh and family members of the police personnel injured in violence during farmers' tractor rally on January 26, staged a demonstration at Shaheedi Park on Saturday in protest against the attack.They were also accompanied by the retired as well as current Delhi Police officers at the protest."I was deployed at the gate of the Red Fort. We were bringing out the crowd that had entered and hoisted the flag, after which we were suddenly attacked. They had sticks and swords with them. I received injuries on my head and legs," said Head Constable Ashok Kumar.Head Constable Sunita, posted at PS Model Town, was also injured during the attack that took place on January 26. "I was deployed at Mukarba Chowk. Deputy Commissioner of Police and Assistant Commissioner of Police were also there. They spoke to protesters asking them to go to approved route. But they turned aggressive, broke barricades, attacked us and vandalised vehicles," she told ANI.Even though the farmer unions have distanced themselves from the attacks and called it a conspiracy, the Delhi Police held them responsible for it.The police on Friday served notices to 12 farmer leaders to join the investigation into the violence during the tractor rally on Republic Day. Among those who were served the notices include Buta Singh Burjgill, Darshan Pal Singh, Rakesh Tikait, Shamsher Pandher and Satnam Pannu.On January 26, during the tractor march by farmers to protest against the three farm laws, protestors violated the agreement about the route to be taken and entered central Delhi after forcibly removing barricades. Several policemen were injured in the violence and vehicles were damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-families-of-injured-personnel-stage-protest-against-jan-26-attack-101612014175384.html

The victim was allegedly hacked with sickles. He died on the spot.TMC’s Suti assembly area chairman Emani Biswas said, “Saddam was an active worker of our party. On Friday, we organised a rally at Kashimnagar demanding withdrawal of the farm laws. Saddam was returning home around 9 pm. The Congress workers blocked his path and started abusing the TMC. Saddam was attacked when he protested. We have requested the police to arrest the culprits.”The Congress dismissed the allegation.The party’s Suti-2 community block unit president Alfazuddin Biswas said, “It is a baseless allegation. The victim and the accused both belong to the TMC. The accused was a polling booth unit president of the TMC till a few days ago. I have heard that Saddam was killed during a dispute over the ownership of a mobile phone. Let the police probe the matter impartially and unearth the truth.”Superintendent of Police of Jangipur, Y Raghuvamshi, said, “We have lodged a murder case on the basis of a written complaint but the accused are on the run.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-accuses-congress-of-murdering-party-worker-in-bengal-village-101612013345840.html
30-01-2021||India||PM Modi should talk to farmers directly, says Congress' Ashok Gehlot||The Centre can still correct its "ill-measures" against the farmers, who have been protesting against the three central farm laws, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi must talk to them, senior Congress leader and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot suggested on Saturday."There is still a chance for the government to correct its ill measures. I believe the Prime Minister must take cognizance and talk to the farmers himself. The government should reverse the decision (regarding the farm laws)," Gehlot said, reported news agency ANI. Suggesting a rollback to PM Modi-led government, Gehlot said, "There is nothing wrong with changing decisions. It happens in a democracy. People will welcome it."Gehlot criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for not carrying out a judicial inquiry into the incident of violence on Republic Day in the national capital. "We condemn the violence on Republic Day by some anti-social elements. Why did judicial inquiry not happen? There should be a fair probe into the incident."Gehlot also backed the farmers' movement and said that they were protesting peacefully for 65 days. Blaming the BJP for sparking clashes at Delhi's Singhu border, where alleged local residents protested against farmers occupying the space on Friday, Gehlot said, "The clashes happened on the behest of the BJP. They (BJP) are pushing villagers to clash with farmers. This is not good."Three days after the clashes that broke out on Republic Day in the national capital, opposition parties are training guns at the government and the ruling party at the Centre, accusing them of discrediting the farmers' movement. Earlier in the day, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that the violence that took place during the tractor parade on January 26 was scripted by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to "defame and discredit" the farmers' movement.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj called BJP leaders the "greatest anti-nationals" and demanded that cases of sedition must be filed against them and probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). "Police and BJP together scripted the violence of January 26 and the days after. This script was prepared by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to defame and discredit the farmers' movement," the AAP leader claimed.The BJP has not responded to the allegations so far.Protests had erupted in parts of Delhi and on its surrounding borders after the tractor rally called by the agitating farmers took a violent turn on India's 72nd Republic Day on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-talk-to-farmers-directly-says-congress-ashok-gehlot-101612009528590.html

Long separation from their respective families, due to families staying in their respective home towns further compounds the problem."Even if some personnel are keeping their families at stations where they are posted, invariably separation still occurs due to the nature of duties, which involve frequent movements, deployment among others," the statement in the MoU said.It adds that housing satisfaction in the force too is "not of the desired levels"."The disappearance of the joint family system and nuclear families becoming the norm has further reduced the availability of alternate support systems."Whereas, families of CRPF have similar lifestyle aspirations to those of civilians, the nature of unpredictable duties of CRPF and deployment are a stumbling block," it said.This breakdown in the family support system, the MoU said, has got manifested, to an extent, in the rising number of suicides and fratricides.Shukla, as per the spokesperson, assured the force that the IIM team will strive to furnish meaningful recommendations after thorough research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iim-lucknow-to-study-effect-of-stress-and-strain-on-crpf-jawans-find-solutions-for-work-life-balance-101612010087436.html

The complaint was lodged by Naaz Patel, an activist and the founder of an NGO called Avesta Foundation. She filed the complaint in December last year at the Mumbai police station.Patel claims that the current logo resembles an image of a naked human which is "offensive in nature for women." Patel also threatened the e-commerce company with appropriate action in case it fails to implement the suggested changes."A complainant (woman) had approached the cybercrime police station in the matter. We called a meeting with Myntra following the complaint, they (Myntra) came and agreed to change the logo. They have sent an email as well on the same," Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police with the cybercrime department, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Avesta Foundation thanked Myntra for addressing the concerns "and respecting the sentiments of millions of women". It also thanked people for their support. "Congratulations to our founder. She did it what apparently seemed impossible. Thank you everyone for your support. We're overwhelmed by the response. Kudos to @myntra for addressing the concerns and respecting the sentiments of millions of women," the foundation tweeted.Meanwhile, many social media users agreed with the activist, some said that the complaint seems to be whimsical.The Flipkart-owned online shopping portal said that it will change the logo in the next one month, according to a PTI report. The new logo is yet to be unveiled by Myntra and as per reports, it has already started the process of replacing the old logo on all platforms including website and app.Myntra was founded in 2007 and was acquired by Flipkart in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/myntra-to-change-its-logo-here-is-why-101612013462113.html
30-01-2021||India||Future group's Biyani says Amazon creating confusion, playing dog in the manger||Future Group promoter Kishore Biyani has alleged that Amazon is "playing the dog in the manger" and trying to create a confusion about the group's ₹24,713-crore deal with Reliance Industries.Seeking to assuage concerns of employees amid the ongoing tussle with e-commerce giant Amazon, Biyani said the organisation is on firm legal footing and that has been vindicated by the regulatory approvals received for the deal from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), market regulator SEBI and the bourses. The development comes days after Amazon petitioned the Delhi High Court to block the Future Group from selling retail assets to Reliance Industries and sought detention of Biyani and family members.In a letter addressed to the Future Group employees, Biyani alleged that Amazon is running a concerted and coordinated media campaign and leaking misleading information.Biyani said the Future Group was the target of a new form of attack and that a "corporate battle" is being fought for supremacy over Indian customers 70 years after India became a republic and also alleged that immense resources are being deployed on influencing Indian society’s mindset and belief systems."...Amazon is playing the dog in the manger, going all out to create a ruckus...For reasons we never believed earlier but quite evident today, this battle is about ownership of the Indian customer at any cost," he said in his letter written on Friday. Meanwhile, Amazon did not respond to emailed query on the matter.Biyani said he has received numerous letters, phone calls and messages from employees expressing their support, anxiety and queries on the various legal steps being taken by Amazon.He justified the decision to sell retail, wholesale and some other businesses of Future Group to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's RIL, saying he was left with no other option but to enter in a “constructive deal” with Reliance Group in the wake of the financial crisis in the retail sector on account of the pandemic.Biyani said Amazon's policy of “vexatious litigation and harassment” was akin to Greek conquerer Alexander's ruthless ambition to scorch the earth.He further said that Amazon had relentlessly attacked Future Retail, the board of directors, lenders, promoters, and that those efforts had been unsparing of his close family members, including his father, uncle and children. "After all, they (Amazon) are inspired to name their product as Alexa... History tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India. With you on our side and our relentless service to the Indian consumers, we will serve the best interests of our country and will continue to protect our fundamental right to survive, and to serve the Indian consumer," Biyani said.The Future Group founder noted that the deal between Future Coupons and Amazon in August 2019 was to build a coupons and gifting business, create an e-commerce distribution for brands and whenever FDI in retail is permitted, they could participate. "FDI is not permitted in multi-brand retail, and as is the global policy trend, the government would like home-grown retailers to scale up," he added.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.Amazon had dragged the Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.After this, the Future Group filed a plea with the Delhi High Court. On December 21, a single-member bench rejected the plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide over the deal.The court had also made several observations indicating that Amazon's attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements Amazon has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be violative of the FEMA FDI rules. Since then, Amazon has also filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking detention of Future Group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block the Future-Reliance deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/future-group-s-biyani-says-amazon-creating-confusion-playing-dog-in-the-manger-101612012437379.html
30-01-2021||India||Not surprised at 'evil attack' as we were on higher alert for few weeks: Israeli envoy||A day after a blast outside its Embassy here, Israel's ambassador to India Ron Malka said there are enough reasons to believe it was a terrorist attack but they are not surprised at the event as the alert level had been increased for past few weeks following intelligence inputs.In an interview with PTI, he also said the investigations will look into all possible angles, including whether there are any links to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats here while events around the world are also being examined to find any related operations or activities at any destination."These attacks by those seeking destablisation in the (West Asia) region cannot stop us or scare us. Our peace efforts will continue uninterrupted," he said when asked whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel's peace efforts with various Arab countries.He said Israeli authorities and the embassy are providing all assistance and every information Indian authorities probing the attack.Also Read: 45,000 mobile phones were active around Israeli Embassy at time of blastA low-intensity improvised explosive device(IED) went off near the Israeli Embassy in the heart of Delhi on Friday evening but no one was injured.Some cars were damaged in the blast that occurred about 150 metres away from the Embassy in Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in the very high-security Lutyens' bungalow zone.An envelope addressed to the Israeli Embassy and containing a note, purportedly linking the blast to Iran, was also found at the site of the blast.Initial investigations revealed that the IED was planted in a flower pot on the median near Jindal House on A P J Abdul Kalam road outside the Israeli embassy.Also Read: Blast near Israel Embassy: Police team finds most CCTVs 'non-functional' at siteThe blast took place when President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were present a few kilometres away at the Beating Retreat ceremony.Besides, it coincided with the day when India and Israel marked the completion of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations.Asked whether Israeli agencies will join the probe, Malka said a kind of cooperation and collaboration is taking place, but the probe is mostly being done by Indian authorities as it happened on Indian soil."But of course, whatever assistance we can provide, whatever we can share, we will do that," he said.On the envelope recovered from the site hinting at a possible Iranian link, Malka said, "You need to understand that the investigation is still in early stages, so it is not appropriate to talk about anything that might harm the investigation."He said it won't be fair for him to talk about any specific detail regarding the investigation or other inputs relating to the probe."But what I can tell you is that we are collecting all the information and putting all pieces of evidence together and building the puzzle. Eventually, I think we will understand it all and the picture will be clear and we will get to know who is behind this evil attack," the Israeli envoy said.On whether the embassy has provided its own CCTV footage to the probe team, Malka said, "We are collecting any evidence, any piece of information that can be useful. Whether there are eyewitnesses, CCTV as you mentioned, whatever we can gather, any piece of information, we are collecting everything that can shed more light on what happened. We are making all the efforts."Official police sources said investigators probing the blast have not come across "anything concrete" yet as most of the CCTV cameras near the site of the explosion were "non-functional" at the time of the incident.An investigation team of Delhi Police's Special Cell had earlier in the day visited the site to collect more evidence, sources said, adding that it managed to get access to footage from some of the CCTV cameras in the area.One CCTV footage showed a vehicle moving suspiciously near the embassy just before the explosion.Asked about reports about an entity called 'Jaish ul Hind' claiming responsibility and whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel's peace efforts with various Arab countries in recent months, Malka said, "Our assumption as of now is that we have enough reasons to believe that this was a terrorist attack targetted at Israeli Embassy in New Delhi."He said all possible angles on who could be behind the attack are open."For example, you have to take into consideration that yesterday, exactly when this evil attack was conducted, we celebrated the 29th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations with India. It has been 29 fruitful and rewarding years of collaboration," he said.The Israeli envoy said the attack happened on the day when they were celebrating the rapidly growing relations with India."Is it a coincidence or is it not? Who knows that, but of course this is an option being probed. Also, we are examining events and incidents around the world at some destinations whether there was some kind of operations elsewhere also targetted at Israel. All of that is being looked into," he said.Malka said that there was "a high alert for a few weeks" and therefore they are not surprised.Diplomats and Israeli representatives around the world are targets of our enemies. So we always have our precautions and take necessary steps based on our own guidelines and the security procedures that we follow. This time we had increased the level of alert, so we were very much prepared and secure and protected," he added.On whether there could be any link to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats in Delhi, he said that line of investigation is also being examined to ascertain whether there is any pattern, any connection or any dots are there to be connected."Yes, I am sure this (angle) is also being investigated. But as I said this is still an early stage of investigation and therefore we need to be careful and we will keep all the options open until we know for sure that we can cancel any option or we can focus more on one of them. But it is still too early for that," he said.In February 2012, a motorcycle rider had attached an explosive device to the back door of the diplomat's car from behind. One embassy staff member, a local employee and two passers-by had got injured in that attack.At almost the same time, a bomb was also found beneath an Israeli diplomat's car in Georgia and was defused.Asked whether Israel will continue with its peace efforts with the Arab world despite such attacks, he said, "Surely, we will. The history shows that this kind of events not only fails to stop us, they strengthen us and we will be growing more rapidly.""We will continue thriving and forging new ties and advancing peace and stability in the region. So of course, all our achievements are for more stability, more collaboration, more friendships. We are not afraid of those who want destabilisation."We understand that our enemies want destabilisation but they are not going to stop us or scare us. We are going to continue, as we have done till now," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-surprised-at-evil-attack-as-we-were-on-higher-alert-for-few-weeks-israeli-envoy-101612010996405.html
30-01-2021||India||SII seeks trial nod for Novavax Covid-19 shot: Efficacy, advantage, availability||The Serum Institute of India (SII) has applied to India’s drugs controller to conduct a small domestic trial of Novavax Inc's Covid-19 vaccine, which was found to be 89.3% effective in a UK trial. SII's chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla has said his company is hopeful of launching Covovax by June this year.US biotech firm Novavax said on Thursday that NVX-CoV2373, its two-shot Covid-19 vaccine, showed an overall efficacy of 89.3% in a major Phase 3 clinical trial in Britain and was highly effective against a variant first identified there. However, other results have shown it offered significantly less protection against a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus first identified in South Africa.Also read | Serum Institute applies for bridging trial approval for Novavax Covid vaccineNovavax said it began working on new vaccines against emerging strains in early January and expects to select ideal candidates in the coming days, then begin clinical testing in the second quarter of the year. "NVX-CoV2373 has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis. We look forward to continuing to work with our partners, collaborators, investigators and regulators around the world to make the vaccine available as quickly as possible," Stanley Erck, the company's president and CEO, has said.Here's what you need to know about the Novavax vaccine:1. The vaccine was one of six candidates backed by a US government project formerly known as Operation Warp Speed, which has provided the company $1.75 billion. It's also being tested in a trial in the US and Mexico, which has recruited 16,000 of 30,000 participants.2. The Novavax shot injects the same molecules directly into the body to evoke an immune response. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines deliver the genetic instructions to make a protein of the virus to human cells.3. The trial in the UK involved 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, including 27% who were over the age of 65. The first interim analysis was based on 62 cases, of which 56 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus six cases among people who received NVX-CoV2373.4. NVX-CoV2373 contains a full-length, prefusion spike protein made using Novavax's recombinant nanoparticle technology and the company's proprietary saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant. The purified protein is encoded by the genetic sequence of the Sars-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and is produced in insect cells.5. It can neither cause Covid-19 nor can it replicate, is stable at 2 degrees Celsius to 8 degrees Celsius (refrigerated) and is shipped in a ready-to-use liquid formulation that permits distribution using existing vaccine supply chain channels.Also read | In boost for India, Novavax finds vaccine 89% effective6. The company's preliminary analysis indicated the variant first identified in Britain, B.1.1.7, was detected in more than 50% of the confirmed cases.7. Efficacy by strain was calculated at 95.6% against the original Covid strain, and 85.6% against B.1.1.7. But the efficacy was much lower in a smaller, mid-stage trial conducted in South Africa.8. This study enrolled just over 4,400 patients from September to mid-January, during which time the B.1.351 variant, which contains critical mutations along with the virus' spike protein, was spreading rapidly through the country.9. In this trial the overall efficacy was 49.4% but the figure rose to 60% among the 94% of trial participants who were HIV-negative.10. Novavax has a deal with Pune-based SII for the manufacture of at least a billion doses of its vaccine for low- and middle-income countries and India.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-seeks-trial-nod-for-novavax-covid-19-shot-efficacy-advantage-availability-101612010826218.html

30-01-2021||India||Govt to introduce bill for banning cryptocurrencies. Here's what you need to know||The Union government is reportedly going to table a bill in the Budget Session of Parliament banning all private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in India and which will also deal with the creation of a legislative framework for an official digital currency. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also exploring the option of issuing a digital version of the rupee, which could serve as the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), a booklet on payment systems has said.Here's what you need to know about cryptocurrencies and the government's move to regulate it:What are cryptocurrencies?Cryptocurrencies are also known as convertible virtual currency, which can be exchanged for fiat currencies. However, not all virtual currency can be exchanged for conventional money and so not all virtual currency is convertible. Cryptocurrencies are not backed or regulated by central banks, like conventional currencies are. Anybody on the internet can mine or create and trade in them. In the United States dealing in cryptocurrencies invites taxation however, this is not the scenario everywhere else in the world. Unlike regular currency, cryptos have no physical entity and only exist online.Bitcoin is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, it has a convertible value, which has been witnessing record highs the past few months. It came into existence following the 2009 housing market crash. All bitcoin transactions are maintained in an open-source ledger that anyone can get access to. Bitcoins are convertible into US dollars.Bitcoin saw a flurry of activity recently and a mild endorsement by Elon Musk has attracted the attention of Indian investors. WazirX, BuyUCoin, CoinSwitch Kuber are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the country.Why is the government bringing a bill to ban cryptocurrencies?The Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which is scheduled to be tabled at the upcoming Union Budget session, aims “to create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency” and “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India” a Lok Sabha bulletin released on Friday said. Adding that “It allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,".In the January 25 booklet, RBI had said that the government is wary of cryptocurrency and the risk that comes with their operation, but the option of digitizing the current fiat currency is being explored. “In India, the regulators and governments have been sceptical about these currencies and are apprehensive about the associated risks. Nevertheless, RBI is exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and, in case there is, how to operationalize it," said RBI.Cryptocurrencies are decentralised payment systems, ie they are not backed or regulated by any central banks like conventional fiat currencies are. This creates a point of worry and contention for central banks like RBI. RBI joins the chorus of the European Central Bank, which too has issued similar warnings and cautions against cryptocurrencies.RBI had previously attempted to ban cryptocurrencies in 2018, but the order was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2020. Another similar bill proposing a 10-year imprisonment for any individual found to be dealing with cryptocurrencies was drafted in 2019.What is Central Bank Digital Currency?Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) like the one RBI aims to create are just fiat or conventional currencies in their digital form. The “technology” that the new bill seeks to protect is the blockchain technology that backs the operation of cryptocurrencies. CBDC is designed to act as a digital version of a country’s fiat currency and is backed by a suitable amount of monetary reserves like gold or foreign currency reserves.

30-01-2021||India||SC Collegium withdraws approval for appointment of judge behind recent controversial POCSO rulings||The Supreme Court Collegium is understood to have withdrawn its approval to a proposal for the appointment of an additional judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice P V Ganediwala, as a permanent judge of the court following her two controversial verdicts in sexual assault cases.The decision was taken after the judge faced flak for her interpretation of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, a source said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala recently acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year-old girl's breast because he did not make skin-to-skin contact and days earlier, ruled that holding the hands of a five-year-old girl and unzipping the trousers do not amount to "sexual assault" under the POCSO Act.On January 27, the Supreme Court stayed the Bombay High Court order acquitting the man after Attorney General K K Venugopal said the order would set a dangerous precedent.The collegium headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, at a meeting held on January 20, had okayed the proposal for making Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge.In two other judgments this month, Justice Ganediwala acquitted two men accused of raping minor girls after noting that the testimonies of the victims did not inspire confidence to fix criminal liability on the accused."No doubt the testimony of the prosecutrix (victim) is sufficient for conviction of the accused. However, the same ought to inspire confidence of this court. It ought to be of sterling quality," she said in one of the judgments.Justice Pushpa Virendra Ganediwala was born on March 3, 1969 at Paratwada in Maharashtra's Amravati district.She was a panel advocate for various banks and insurance companies and was also an honorary lecturer in various colleges of Amravati and gave lectures to the MBA and LLM students of the Amravati University.She was directly appointed as a district judge in 2007 and was elevated as an additional judge of the Bombay High Court on February 13, 2019.Besides the CJI, justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman are part of the three-member collegium, which takes decisions with regard to high court judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-collegium-withdraws-approval-for-appointment-of-judge-behind-recent-controversial-pocso-rulings-101612001468262.html

Many of them held hands but many others chose to simply stand with a safe distance from each other in view of the physical distancing norms in force because of Covid-19.The RJD leader bristled when asked about Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's remark suggesting that the opposition seemed to have taken a leaf out of his book.Also read| Centre stands by offer made to farmers: PM Modi at all party meetWhen approached by journalists with questions about the "manav shrinkhla", Kumar had replied with a broad grin "we had organised human chains in 2017 in support of prohibition and against dowry and child marriage the following year. Last year, a human chain held to spread awareness about climate change in addition to the issues we had previously raised broke all records"."It is nice that others are also drawing inspiration. Everybody has the right to hold such programmes," he had said with a smirk.Yadav responded with distaste "it is a petty remark. Is he the first person to have ever held a human chain? He should instead make his stand clear on the new farm laws".RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha, who stood nearby, said, "The human chains sponsored by the chief minister depended upon the bureaucracy for its success. Officials concerned were given targets of turnouts to achieve. What is happening here today is spontaneous."Notably, the RJD had taken part in the 2017 human chain while it shared power with Kumar. Its jailed supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was then out on bail, had famously stood at Gandhi Maidan to demonstrate his support for liquor ban.Also read| Internet suspended till Jan 31 at border areas in Delhi amid farmers' protestJha, who is a member of the Rajya Sabha, also described the Centre's talks with agitating farmers as "a monologue, instead of a dialogue, a reason why Delhi's borders at Singhu and Ghazipur have been on fire".Prominent among those who took part in the human chain at the state capital were CPI(ML) secretary general Dipankar Bhattacharya and Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma.The human chain was also formed in districts. In Nawada, local Congress MLA Neetu Singh was among those who participated in the demonstration. In Begusarai, Congress, RJD and Left workers stood in front of the district headquarters and other places.No untoward incident was reported from anywhere so far though the officials said the human chain was held without permission.Leaders of the ruling NDA in the state came out with statements claiming that the human chain was a "flop".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grand-alliance-in-bihar-forms-human-chains-against-new-farm-laws-101612003959058.html

30-01-2021||India||Odisha asks districts to speed up Covid 19 vaccination drive as numbers slide||The Odisha government has asked all district collectors and municipal commissioners to ensure 100% Covid vaccination of all healthcare workers by February 10 deadline, even as the rate of vaccination in the state dropped to the lowest ever figure of 71% on Friday.On Friday, Odisha could vaccinate 11,142 healthcare workers out of the targeted 15,701, achieving 71% of its daily goal, while the state government continued to claim that it was No1 in achieving vaccination targets among all states. Lakshadweep, with more than 80% of its vaccination target achieved, was the all-India topper."Clear message should be given that those who do not turn up for vaccination when called on the designated date will forgo the opportunity to get a free vaccine from the government. The 1st dose of vaccination for all healthcare workers will close on 10th February. In this matter, it is of great concern that in some districts, the percentage coverage of health workers vaccinated in the past week is poor," state health secretary PK Mohapatra wrote in a letter.The state government plans to start giving the second dose of vaccine to healthcare workers from February 15, exactly 28 days after the first jab.Till Friday, 60.53% of the total 350,726 healthcare workers in Odisha were vaccinated. The drive went poorly in 9 districts, including Khurda and Cuttack. The coverage in Deogarh was lowest at 42%, followed by Khurda- 61% & Jajpur- 62%.Last week, the state exceeded its daily target for a couple of days till some sort of complacency set in. Despite the glitches in the Co-Win app, officials overcame the problems by sending Google sheets to districts for uploading the vaccination statistics, which was then uploaded on the Co-Win app at Bhubaneswar, where the internet connectivity is a lot better. The state government also sent SMS to individual beneficiaries and conducted vaccination every day, except Sunday.Even in big hospitals, such as AIIMS Bhubaneswar, the vaccination coverage has been very low. Only 1,426 healthcare workers, merely 35% of the target, had got the jab there. While more than 79% of the targeted security staff and 67% of the targeted IT staff had been vaccinated, only 57% faculty members had received the shot, with several senior faculty members yet to take the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-districts-to-speed-up-covid-19-vaccination-drive-as-numbers-slide-101612004024982.html
30-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM unveils temple for AIADMK leaders Jayalalithaa, MGR||Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy, O Paneerselvam, on Saturday inaugurated a temple with life-size bronze statues of ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) late stalwarts MG Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa in Madurai district amid a large gathering of the party workers. The two performed traditional rituals and pujas.The temple has been built on a 12-acre plot in Thirumangalam and has cost ₹50-lakh. The bronze statues weigh 400-kg each.Speaking after the unveiling, Palaniswami asked the workers to work towards winning the assembly elections slated for April-May.“Among the leaders in India, it is the two of them who lived for the people and not for themselves,” Palaniswami said. “Even after their deaths, they continue to live in the hearts of people like Gods. Their schemes to uplift the poor and marginalised can never be forgotten. They didn’t have children, those gathered here are their children. And our only goal is to continue their (MGR-Jayalalithaa) governance.”The party hopes to get a third term after winning back-to-back polls under Jayalalithaa’s leadership. She passed away in office in December 2016. MGR in 1972 formed the ADMK (later AIADMK). He was the chief minister until his death in 1987.The unveiling comes as Jayalalithaa's aide and expelled leader V K Sasikala is set to return to Chennai following her release from prison after serving a term in a disproportionate assets case.The Palaniswami-led AIADMK has said she will not be re-inducted into the party.Earlier this week, the government also inaugurated an 80-crore memorial for Jayalalithaa at her burial place on the Marina beach in Chennai. A day later, they opened her residence Veda Nilayam in Chennai as a memorial and later unveiled a nine-foot statue of Jayalalithaa at the city's Lady Willingdon College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cm-unveils-temple-for-aiadmk-leaders-jayalalithaa-mgr-101612001209234.html

Gandhi was referring to the FIR filed by Gurugram Police against seven people, including Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, for allegedly “misreporting” and “spreading disharmony” during the clashes between the police and the protesting farmers on Republic Day. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint by a resident of Jharasa district in Haryana who accused the Tharoor, Sardesai and five other journalists of spreading "false and misleading information.""The practice by the BJP government to threaten journalists and public representatives through FIRs is dangerous. Respect for democracy is not the will of the government but its responsibility. The atmosphere of fear is like poison for democracy," Gandhi tweeted. "The BJP government has destroyed the dignity of democracy by lodging the FIR to intimidate senior journalists and public representatives," she said in another tweet.Police have filed the case under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The complaint was registered at the Cyber police station of Gurugram. Earlier, Noida Police had also registered an FIR on the same set of people and on similar allegations.Tens of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are protesting against the new farm laws at several Delhi borders. The protests derailed on January 26 when farmers who were carrying out tractor rallies barged inside the Red Fort and hoisted their own flag at its ramparts. During the rally, agitating farmers also broke barricades and vandalised public property as they clashed with the police. One farmer was killed and nearly 400 police personnel were injured during the violence.They are agitating against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/atmosphere-of-fear-is-like-poison-for-democracy-priyanka-gandhi-on-fir-against-7-including-tharoor-journalists-101612003179849.html
30-01-2021||India||From 1 to 1,69,824: Where India stands on Covid-19 map a year after||On this day a year ago, India detected its first case of Covid-19, when a 20-year-old student from Thrissur, Kerala returned home from Wuhan. A year later, India has 1,69,824 active Covid-19 cases, which is a much better situation than what was a few months ago. With a recovery rate of 96.96%, and two vaccines already rolled out, India is better prepared to take on Covid-19 today.Here are a few takeaways/milestones of India's one-year journey:Lockdown and unlockAfter the first case was detected on January 30, Indian went into a national lockdown on March 25, which also led to an unprecedented migrant crisis. Indian economy was also hit hard with economic operations coming to a halt. The finance ministry released several stimulus packages catering to all sections of people. Like several stages of lockdowns, there was a stagewise unlocking starting from June.Kerala still struggling with an increasing caseloadGround Zero Kerala has been one of the most worst-hit states. The state currently has 72,239 active cases, the highest in the country, and logged 6,268 new infections on Friday, pushing the total tally to 9,17,630. Kerala had managed to rein in the virus last year when much of the country was struggling with it. But with international traffic, festivals, the spread of the infection could not be contained much. The death toll as of today stands at 3,704, which the state government claims is significantly lower given its high infection rate.Dharavi ModelDharavi, Asia’s largest slum, where people are cooped into close living quarters with shared toilet facilities was a huge cause of worry for the Maharashtra government. Experts and government alike feared that Dharavi, where social distancing was next to impossible, would explode with Covid-19 cases, which happened but the tables were turned by rigorous testing, detection, isolation, and treatment. On Friday, Dharavi reported six new cases, after reporting zero new cases for two days straight. The continent's largest slum currently has a total of 3,917 cases, while the number of active cases stands at 16.2 wave, 2 vaccinesAmid unlocking, several Indian states, including Kerala, Delhi, reported a second wave of Covid-19. In September, India witnessed the worst situation as daily cases ranged between 75,000 and 90,000. The highest single-day spike was 96,551 fresh cases in 24 hours.In October, the situation bettered and in December, both Bharat Biotech and Pune's Serum Institute of India applied for emergency use of their vaccines.In the meantime, new strains of Coronavirus started cropping up in the UK, South Africa, and other parts of the world.In January, both the vaccine makers were given a go-ahead for emergency use and India started the largest vaccination drive on January 16 — before the first year anniversary of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-1-to-1-69-824-where-india-stands-on-covid-19-map-a-year-after-101612002520729.html

The state has so far taken action against 113 officials over graft charges and inefficiency.Deputy director of mines, Madan Mohan Biswal, who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore mining scam in 2009, has been handed out compulsory retirement while mining officer Ramesh Chandra Mahalik was asked to retire over similar charges said the release.Joint labour commissioner Sarat Choudhary and divisional labour commissioner Namita Dash have been handed out compulsory retirement on grounds of gross inefficiency, it stated.Assistant conservator of forest, Laxman Pradhan, range officer Bharat Kumar Ghadei, Bolangir, Muribahal range officer Prashant Nayak and Rayagada district labour officer, Pradip Bhoi have been given compulsory retirement over corruption charges against them.In September 2019, the Naveen Patnaik government had issued a circular saying service records of state government employees, aged 50 years or more, will be reviewed and a premature retirement order will be handed out to those found lacking in integrity.Since then dozens of government employees have been handed out premature retirement. In December last year, the government recommended the name of Abhay Pathak, senior officer of the Indian Forest Service for compulsory retirement after disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore, the highest ever in Odisha, was found in his possession.All the departments have been asked to get a committee to review performance and service record of group A, B, C and D employees every 3 months, to identify staff that needs to be retired prematurely.Employees, who complete 30 years of qualifying service or attain 50 or 55 years of age, would come under the purview of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-more-odisha-officials-given-compulsory-retirement-for-corruption-inefficiency-101612002046754.html

He said smaller parties must get more time to speak in Parliament and that they must prevail on the parties with more representatives to not disrupt the functioning.A second person privy to the meeting said most of the floor leaders agreed that Parliament must be allowed to function and the issues related to the farm agitation can be taken up during the discussions on President Ram Nath Kovind's address and during the discussion on the budget.A day before the customary meeting, the Prime Minister had hoped that lawmakers from across all political parties will contribute to making the Budget Session effective in order to deliver to the aspirations of the people.This comes amid the opposition onslaught over three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year and the boycott of President Kovind's speech on Friday.The first part of the Budget Session is scheduled to continue till February 15 while the second part of the session will be held from March 8 to April 8.

(But) strict surveillance (is) to be kept on persons who tested positive at the airport and kept in home quarantine,” said the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-mandatory-institutional-quarantine-for-fliers-from-uk-delhi-govt-101612000865900.html

BJP workers pelted stones on farmers who were protesting peacefully for the last 60 days,” the party said on its official Twitter handle, sharing photos of two of the “locals” with Union home minister Amit Shah and Lok Sabha MP Manoj Tiwari, respectively.They were not locals, they were BJP leaders.BJP workers pelted stones on farmers who were protesting peacefully for last 60 days. pic.twitter.com/WTwK418TJjOn Friday, several people, claiming to be “locals,” had pelted stones at the farmers protesting against the three farm laws passed by the BJP-ruled Centre last September. The police had to resort to tear gas shelling to restore order, and a policeman was seriously injured after one of the farmers lunged at him with a sword. More than 40 people have been arrested, including the farmer who injured the police official, the Station House Officer (SHO) of a local police station.Opposition parties, including the AAP and the Congress, have also accused the BJP of being behind the violence during Tuesday’s “kisan tractor parade”. Actor Deep Sidhu, one of several protesters present at the historic Red Fort when a Sikh religious flag was hoisted there, has been accused of being a BJP “mole.” This came after pictures surfaced on social media of Sidhu with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP MP Sunny Deol, who is himself an actor. Deol has already distanced himself from Sidhu.Also Read | Tractor rally violence: Sunny Deol distances himself from Deep SidhuAfter Friday’s incident, many of the farmers who had left the borders, including those who had come only for the tractor parade and those who left due to the Republic Day violence, have started to return to Delhi.

Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri borders have been the epicentres of the anti-farm laws’ protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-aap-on-locals-who-pelted-stones-on-farmers-at-singhu-border-101611998153091.html

On being asked whether he has plans to join the protest being spearheaded by his union, he said after attending a mahapanchayat at Baghpat, he will head to Delhi.There is a Panchayat in Baghpat tomorrow, we will head to Delhi after attending it: Naresh Tikait, President, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) when asked if he will go to the ongoing farmers' agitation at the borders of Delhi#FarmLaws pic.twitter.com/0jlRv5QN6cOn Friday, Naresh Tikait called a mahapanchayat at Muzaffarnagar which saw massive participation of farmers. The panchayat has decided to throw its weight behind the protest.After Ghaziabad administration asked the protesters at Ghazipur site to vacate the place, Naresh Tikait initially decided to yield to the pressure. On Thursday evening, he announced that the Ghazipur site will be vacated. His brother and union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, however, held the fort and said he will commit suicide but not vacate the protest site. His emotional video apparently mobilised a number of farmers who set out for the Ghazipur site.Though the difference of opinion between the two brothers came across as a discord, Nareh Tikait later said that his brother's tears will not go in vain.Uttar Pradesh Police, however, has said that there was additional security at the site on Thursday to keep an eye on outsiders entering the protest site to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-head-to-delhi-naresh-tikait-may-join-brother-rakesh-tikait-in-protest-101611994981278.html
30-01-2021||India||Centre stands by offer made to farmers: PM Modi at all party meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired an all party meeting ahead of Monday’s budget session where he said government stands by the offer made to the farmers by agriculture minister Naresh Tomar at the last meeting between the government and farmer representatives.Even as the government has offered to put the new laws in abeyance for 18 months, a section of protesting farmers and opposition parties are adamant on the laws being repealed. Speaking at the meeting, the PM said discussions in Parliament will be a way out of the current logjam, even as a clutch of opposition parties demanded more discussions on the new farm laws.Parliamentary affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi told media persons that the Prime Minister, at the meeting, said that whatever was discussed between the Agriculture minister and the farm leaders at the 11th meeting still stands good. “Agriculture minister Tomar had said that the government is open for discussions; he also said that I (Tomar) am a phone call away and I am ready for discussions and this still stands good,”Joshi said.Joshi also said the government is ready for discussions on a range of issues that the opposition wants. He said discussion will be taken up in the second half of the budget session.As per people aware of the meeting, the Prime Minister also noted that disruptions in Parliament affect the smaller parties the most. He said smaller parties must get more time to speak in Parliament and that they must prevail on the parties with more representatives to not disrupt the functioning.A second person privy to the meeting said most of the floor leaders agreed that Parliament must be allowed to function and the issues related to the farm agitation can be taken up during the discussions on the President’s address and during the discussion on the budget.BJD’s Pinaki Misra who was present for the meeting said, Odisha chief minister and BJD president, Naveen Patnaik, has specifically requested the Union government to have the women's reservation bill passed in this budget session.He said the BJD gave 7 out of 21 MP tickets to women in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the only political party to have done so.According to a person aware of the details, the YSR Congress and the TRS, too, backed Odisha CM’s demand for the passage of women's reservation bill in the forthcoming session. The bill was earlier passed in Rajya Sabha in 2010.On Friday, the Prime Minister had expressed hope that MPs from across political parties will contribute to make the budget session effective in meeting the aspirations of the people. The opposition parties, which boycotted the President‘s address on Friday, are likely to attack the government on a raft of issues, including the ongoing farmers’ agitation for repealing the contentious farm laws, escalation of tensions between India and China along the line of actual control and the government’s response to the corona pandemic and its impact on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-stands-by-offer-made-to-farmers-pm-modi-at-all-party-meet-101611997421719.html
30-01-2021||India||Expanding children, parent, relative definition will leave no scope for ambiguity: Parliament panel||Expanding the definition of children, parent and relative in a draft bill will leave no scope for any legal ambiguity, a parliamentary standing committee report said.The bill aims to expand the definition of children to include son-in-law, daughter-in-law, biological or adoptive or step son and daughter, minors through legal guardian, parent to include father-in-law, mother-in-law and grandparents, whether or not a senior citizen and relatives to include minor through legal guardian.The standing committee evaluated the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019."The committee deem it to be a significant measure as maintenance may now be claimed from all admissible relatives/legal heirs of parents and senior citizens. Further, the above change in the definition of 'children' has also been concomitantly reflected in the definition of 'parent' in the Amendment Bill," it said.They also noted that with the revised definition of 'relative' in the Bill, wherein minors have been included in the category of 'relative', senior citizens would now be able to claim maintenance from minors, too, through their legal guardians."The Committee further note that the definition of 'welfare' in the Amendment Bill has been expanded to include provision for food, clothing, housing, safety and security, medical attendance, healthcare, treatment, recreation and other amenities necessary for physical and mental well being of parents and senior citizens which has given welfare oriented impetus to it in actual sense," it said."Overall the Committee opine that the modified definitions in the Amendment Bill will impart a practical, holistic and broader orientation to the MWPSC Act, 2007, thus leaving no scope for any legal ambiguity," it said.The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry told the committee that the expansion of the existing definition will enable parents/senior citizens to claim maintenance allowance from all admissible relatives.The bill also proposes removal of a ceiling of ₹10,000 as maximum maintenance amount to be awarded to parents/senior citizens which the government told the standing committee will ensure that it is fixed according to the needs of parent and senior citizens and capability of children or legal heirs to pay the maintenance allowance based on their earnings."This will help parent/senior citizens to lead a life of dignity which is commensurate with their normal standard of living," the ministry told the standing committee.The committee is happy that the government has finally acknowledged that maintenance includes more than a mere sum of money. The concept of maintenance has been rendered complete and holistic now, by the above amendment, the report said.Another noteworthy aspect of the amendment is that the tribunal may now take into consideration the standard of living and earning of the parent/senior citizens or of the children or relative, while determining the maintenance, it said.The committee also welcomed the substitution of another important subsection pertaining to the publicity of the maintenance order. It is convinced that the pasting of this order on the notice board of the tribunal and its availability on the website of the department concerned will encourage other harassed parents/senior citizens to seek legal redress of their grievances."Fearing social disgrace, it could also act as a deterrent for children and relatives to properly attend to the needs of the older persons in their respective families," it said.The draft bill also includes the appointment of nodal police officers for senior citizens at every police station and district-level special police unit with a helpline for senior citizens.The committee view it as a landmark change to ensure that senior citizens can easily approach the police in abuse/abandonment cases, provided this clause is implemented by all states promptly. They feel that the police should be the first point of contact for grievance redressal in such cases, much before the courts or tribunals come into picture, the report said.It suggested that provisions for training and sensitisation of the nodal officers and special police unit should also be made in the rules to be framed after the enactment of this bill.The said amendment bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in December 2019 and was referred to the standing committee on social justice and empowerment for examination and report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expanding-children-parent-relative-definition-will-leave-no-scope-for-ambiguity-parliament-panel-101611997024305.html

Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between," he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said, "Farmers are coming in to show solidaRity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd."On Saturday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-digs-its-heels-in-at-ghazipur-border-more-supporters-pouring-in-101611996610054.html

We will send the proposal by next week," the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-mulling-plan-for-incentives-for-gram-panchayats-in-gadchiroli-101611995080005.html
30-01-2021||India||Israeli ambassador says blast may be connected to 2012 attack on diplomats||Israeli ambassador Ron Malka on Saturday said that there might be a connection between Friday's blast near the Israeli Embassy and the 2012 attack targeting the country's diplomats in Delhi.Speaking to ANI, Malka said that an investigation is underway and New Delhi has given its assurances and offered all support, protection or assistance."In 2012, there was a terror attack on Israeli diplomats in Delhi not far from the Embassy. It might be connected, there might be a pattern. We are investigating and this is one of the options," he said.A low-intensity explosion took place near the Israel Embassy on Friday. No injuries have been reported in the incident so far. Windscreens of several cars parked in the vicinity of the Embassy on Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road were found damaged.On February 13, 2012, an Israeli embassy car exploded when a magnetic bomb stuck to it went off in a high-security area in New Delhi, injuring a wife of an Israeli defence envoy to New Delhi.On the same day, a bomb was also planted under an Israeli diplomatic car in the Georgian capital Tbilisi but it failed to detonate.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu then accused Iran of being behind both the incidents in 2012 - allegations denied by Tehran.Malka suspected that Friday's blast outside the Israeli Embassy could be a "terror attack"."As of now, our strong assumption is that it is a terror attack that targeted the Israeli Embassy. Fortunately, nobody was hurt," the envoy said.The explosion took place not far from Vijay Chowk, where several VVIPS including Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were in attendance during the 'Beating Retreat' ceremony.Asserting that Israel has "full trust" in the Indian authorities, Malka said that there is a full collaboration between Indian and Israeli authorities.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has assured the Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi of "fullest protection" to their diplomats."EAM (S Jaishnakar) called our Minister of Foreign Affairs (Gabi Ashkenazi) and Foreign Secretory Harsh Vardhan Shringla called our DG in Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NSA Ajit Doval called our NSA Meir Ben-Shabbat. There is full collaboration. They gave their assurances and offered all support, protection or assistance that we need," he said.Investigators have recovered an envelope with text written on it related to Israel Embassy officials from the blast site, according to sources."The envelope has a text related to an Israel embassy official. It is a case for investigating officers to see whether or not it has any link with the case. But, it has been recovered from the blast site," a senior government official told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israeli-ambassador-says-blast-may-be-connected-to-2012-attack-on-diplomats-101611995684534.html
30-01-2021||India||Internet suspended till Jan 31 at border areas in Delhi amid farmers' protest||The Centre on Saturday placed a temporary suspension on internet services in Singhu, Ghazipur, and Tikri and their adjoining areas till 11pm, January 31, to "maintain public safety and averting public emergency".This is the second such suspension taking place in a week, the first suspension being imposed on January 26, soon after the tractor march of the farmers deviated from its routes and entered the Capital, leading to mayhem at ITO and the Red Fort. Internet services were suspended in several areas in Punjab and Haryana as well."If the administration is thinking that by suspending internet services they will be able to stop the movement, they are grossly mistaken. The more they want to muzzle farmers' voices, the larger the protest will go," Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said.गाजीपुर बॉर्डर पर इंटरनेट बंद कर दिया है सरकार ने , उन्हें लगता है कि इससे आंदोलन को वो कमजोर कर देंगे तो ये उनका वहम है । किसानों की आवाज़ को कुचलने के वो जितना प्रयास करेंगे ये आंदोलन उतना बड़ा होता जाएगा।On Friday, tempers rose at Singhu border, which is the main site of the farmers' protest since November, as clashes broke out between farmers and a group of people who came to oust the farmers. The two groups engaged in stone-pelting while Delhi Police had to fire multiple rounds of teas gas shells. During the clash, Delhi Police SHO Pradeep Paliwal was attacked.‘Restore internet or face more protests’: Farm union to governmentThe group of people claimed themselves to be locals, though AAP said they were BJP goons. Tikri border too witnessed unrest on Friday as a group of about 50 persons tried to get near the spot where farmers are protesting. But the situation was soon brought under control.After Friday's clash at Singhu, the Delhi Police said they have arrested 44 people, including the man who attacked the SHO with a sword.On Republic Day, the internet disruption affected many parts of Delhi and the services were only restored the next day. Protesters at the border points, however, complained that internet services were not fully restored to them after Republic Day.The Ghazipur protest site remained peaceful, though the crowd swelled there as several farmers joined the site after Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait's emotional appeal went viral. On Saturday morning, slow internet was reported from Ghazipur as well, before the MHA ordered temporary suspension.The tractor march taken out by farmers on Republic Day became a flashpoint in a so-far peaceful protest as a group of protesters entered the Capital, clashed with Police at ITO, marched to the Red Fort and put up Nishan Sahib on top it. The incident put farmers leaders under fire though they alleged BJP conspiracy to derail their "peaceful" movement.In the aftermath of the Republic Day incident, the Uttar Pradesh Police removed a group of protesters from Baghpat. A similar move was apprehended at the Ghazipur protest site as the Ghaziabad district administration asked the protesters to vacate the area. However, the protesters have not yielded and more protesters joined in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-suspended-till-january-31-at-border-areas-amid-farmers-protest-101611995435268.html

It can link to any database and users can feed the information they need to analyse.“You can connect to that data source and prepare that dashboard which will present the information in a more coherent manner,” said an official. “It also has a social media handler [and] can do predictive analysis. The features available are similar to other business intelligence tools.”The official said the service could also be used to analyse tabular data. “We are enhancing its features further. It can even do a data word map to track what information appears most often.”The price for using the service will vary, starting at a basic cost of ₹21 lakh. Even the government will have to pay for it, the official said.The software will also be able to analyse the feedback provided to the government for various schemes. It eliminates the need to write a single line of code for the users, officials said.“Say you want to analyse how many people have applied for particular service, or which community is applying for which services, or how many services require Aadhar, all of this can be done under five minutes,” said a second official.The patterns can help discern the rise and fall when it comes to government services and help higher level management make more informed choices.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Tejas is a business analytics tool allowing the government organisations to maximise the potential of data for the use of policy making and improving effectiveness of government programs and citizen service delivery. "PSUs [Public Sector Undertakings] and other organisations can use this tool for data analytics,” he said at its launch on Thursday.Two other services, the work from home portal and e-auction platform, were also launched on Thursday to celebrate 25 years of NIC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nic-develops-data-analytics-platform-to-help-users-take-better-policy-decisions-101611994587848.html

Kalicharan Vipta has since been struggling to get it cancelled and secretary of the local gram panchayat punished for issuing it.“They told me that on papers, I died in 1958 … I am alive. They have declared me dead. I want justice,” said Vipta as he showed the certificate.Vipta, a resident of Budhaar village in Koriya district, can barely walk and hear but he has been visiting revenue offices of his tehsil to get the certificate cancelled.“This is the saddest thing, I witnessed at this age. I appeal the Chhattisgarh government to help me.”In his letter to the district Collector, Vipta said the certificate was issued without any investigation.Vipta’s grandson, Lakshman Yadav, said his grandfather had filed an application for division of family land about six months ago in the local tehsil office.Kalicharan's lawyer, Arvind Kushwaha, said he has submitted an application demanding that the person who issued the certificate should be summoned with all related documents.“The death certificate was issued by panchayat secretary. The certificate issued is fake, and we hope that the court will take appropriate action against the concerned officials,” said Kushwaha.Collector SN Rathore said action will be taken after an investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nephew-declares-man-dead-to-encroach-upon-his-land-101611994201472.html

He cited the negative impact on the economy because of the Covid-19 pandemic and added the states should be allowed additional borrowing in the next financial year too.In a letter, Gehlot said the economic activities have resumed after the end of the nationwide lockdown imposed in March to check the pandemic, but they are far from reaching the normal levels. He added as such the payment of GST compensation to the states up to June 2022 be extended by five years.Gehlot said Rajasthan availed additional borrowing to the tune of 2% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in the current financial year. He added a similar provision of 2% additional borrowing should be allowed in the next financial year as well to enable the state government to take care of the liabilities.Gehlot said the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy would cause continued stunted growth. He added, as a result, the expected growth in GSDP would not be achieved and also the revenue streams would not reach desired levels.The Centre, which on Monday released the 13th instalment of ₹6,000 crore to the states to meet GST compensation shortfall, allowed a special borrowing window in October 2020 to meet the estimated shortfall of ₹1.10 lakh crore in revenue due to the GST implementation in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-writes-to-modi-seek-gst-compensation-to-states-for-five-more-years-101611993956392.html

30-01-2021||India||29 years of India-Israel relations: Some key points||A minor explosion outside the Israeli embassy in Delhi on Friday sent a scare across the country’s security establishment. The blast, incidentally, took place on a day diplomatic ties between India and Israel completed 29 years. The two countries share very close ties and have agreements in several fields, including defence, science, technology etc.Here’s a look at some key points on India-Israel ties:1. Though India officially recognised Israel in 1950, the two countries established full diplomatic ties only on January 29, 1992. As of December 2020, India is among 164 United Nations (UN) member states to have diplomatic ties with Israel.2. India has its embassy in the second-largest Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Israel, meanwhile, has its embassy in India in Delhi. It also has consulates in Mumbai and Bengaluru.3. Jerusalem, which Israel considers as its capital, is also considered by Palestine as its capital city. This is why most countries have their embassies in Israel in the city of Tel Aviv. The United States recognised Jerusalem in December 2017, and shifted its embassy there in May 2018.4. In 1997, Ezer Weizman became the first President of Israel to visit India. In 2000, then home minister Lal Krishna Advani became the first Indian minister to visit Israel. The same year, Jaswant Singh became the first foreign minister of India to visit the country. Ariel Sharon became the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit India in 2003.5. The current Prime Ministers of the two countries, Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu, have visited the other’s country in recent years. While Modi visited Israel in July 2017, Netanyahu arrived in India next January; Modi broke protocol to personally receive him at the airport. Netanyahu, too, had personally received Modi in 2017.6. During his visit to Israel, Modi met Moshe Holtzberg, one of the youngest survivors of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Now grown up, Moshe lost his parents in the attacks, and was rescued by his nanny, Sandra Samuel.7. Moshe, who turned 14 last November, came to Mumbai in 2018, accompanying Netanyahu on the trip. During Modi’s visit to Israel, the first by an Indian PM, the boy had expressed his wish to visit Mumbai.8. India is the largest buyer of military equipment from Israel, which, in turn, is the second-largest defence supplier to India, after Russia. India is also the tenth-largest trade partner of Israel, and the third-largest from Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-years-of-india-israel-relations-some-key-points-101611989248491.html
30-01-2021||India||Year after first Covid-19 case, Kerala continues to grapple with pandemic||A year after the country’s first Covid-19 case was detected in Thrissur on Jan 30 last year, Kerala continues to be in the throes of the pandemic, registering record highest active cases and test positivity rate (TPR). As on Friday, the state’s active case load is 72, 238 with a TPR of 10.66. Not just that, at least 44% of the country’s all new cases are from the southern state.Kerala’s first Covid-19 positive case, also the first in the country, was a 21-year- old female medical student, who tested positive four days after her return from disease epicentre of Wuhan in China. The girl’s father, a small-time businessman in Thrissur, told HT he was shattered at that moment.“My wife and I insisted on meeting her and enough prodding was required (for it to be allowed). For the first time in our lives, we both wore heavy PPE kits and met our daughter. When I recollect the meeting, it sends shivers down my spine,” he said.Soon after, the entire family was shifted to an institutional quarantine centre.Two days later, two other students, who had returned from China with the girl, also tested positive. Both turned negative after two weeks but the first patient had to spend 28 days in the hospital to turn negative and then another two weeks under mandatory observation.“I have talked about it enough. I don’t want to explain it all over again,” she refused to talk about the gruelling days.For almost two months after the outbreak, Kerala managed to restrict the spread of the disease. But in March, things took a dramatic turn after an Italy-returned family hid their travel history and interacted with many in Pathanamthitta.The state saw its first super spreader case which infected at least 22 others in the family and among the neighbours, including over 90-years old great grandparents. However, all of them were nursed back to life.During the countrywide lockdown between the end of March and the first week of May, the state managed things well. In the next two months (May-June), Kerala was on the verge of flattening the Covid curve and many, including the international media, lauded its pandemic control measures.But things took a turn for the worse when a large number of residents started returning to the state from the Gulf countries in special flights organised by the Central government.After the Onam festival in the first week of September, cases again started to swell in the state. Many, including Union health minister Harsh Vardan, blamed the state for lowering its guard resulting in the second wave of infection. Situation aggravated in November again and it has yet not been contained fully.“Kerala is by no means a success story, but I won’t call it a failure too. In the state, real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the middle-east. There were tell-tale signs of community spread taking place but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread of the epidemic,” said G Pramod Kumar, a former senior advisor to the united national development programme.Experts like him blame the situation on the “over-confidence” of the state and its over-dependence on the rapid antigen tests, which they claim led to the rise in infections and the high positivity rate. They even allege that the state was not willing to admit that it was an epidemic hub and flaunted old records to try and paint a rosy picture.However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan put up a brave face saying the state did whatever it could and there was no flaw in the government's planning or execution.“Ups and downs are the nature of the pandemic. Even some of the developed countries are still struggling with the second and the third phase of the pandemic. Look at the case of Scandinavian countries,” he said, adding that the situation will improve by next month.He added that clamping another lockdown was not feasible and the state will have to learn to live with the pandemic, at least for some more time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/year-after-first-covid-19-case-kerala-continues-to-grapple-with-pandemic-101611988686772.html

30-01-2021||India||India observes Martyrs' Day today: All you need to know||Martyrs' Day is observed every year on January 30 to mark the death anniversary of the father of the nation Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. In 1948, Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse at one of his prayer meets. Godse, a nationalist, killed Gandhi by shooting at him three times from a close range.Gandhi was conferred the title of 'Mahatma' posthumously around 1915. While some claim Rabindranath Tagore used this title for him, others say residents of Gurukul Kangri first called him by the name. The Sanskrit word Mahatma means a great soul.Here is all you need to know about Gandhi and Martyrs' Day:- Gandhi was a lawyer in South Africa before an incident of racism that he faced made him shift back to India and become a social activist and a politician. He is remembered for his contribution to India's struggle for freedom from the British and his policy of truth and non-violence. - He spearheaded the civil disobedience movement against the British. The Salt Satyagraha was a big part of the movement as part of which Gandhi led a large group of people from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, a coastal village in Gujarat, to produce salt from seawater. It was a protest against the salt tax imposed by the British government in India.- Hindu fundamentalists accused Gandhi of being the reason for India's partition. In Godse's statement following his death sentence on November 8, 1949, he said that he was unhappy about Gandhi’s support for the Muslim community and blamed him for the partition of India and formation of Pakistan. - “I do say that my shots were fired at the person whose policy and action had brought rack and ruin and destruction to millions of Hindus,” Godse said. “I bear no ill will towards anyone individually, but I do say that I had no respect for the present government owing to their policy, which was unfairly favourable towards the Muslims. But at the same time I could clearly see that the policy was entirely due to the presence of Gandhi,” he added.- Godse and co-conspirator Narayan Apte were hanged for the murder of the father of the nation on November 15, 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-observes-martyrs-day-today-all-you-need-to-know-101611981113988.html

The party is continuing to reach out to community leaders and Khap (clan) elders,” said one of the leaders, a senior party functionary.On Thursday night, facing an ultimatum from Uttar Pradesh police to vacate the area, and the prospect of no power and water (the local administration cut of supplies of both to the campsite) farmer leader Rakesh Tikait broke down while appealing to farmers from western UP to join the protest; this resulted in a huge mobilisation of farmers at the Ghazipur border that continued through Friday.On Friday, opposition parties such as the Congress, the Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Indian National Lok Dal extended support to the farmers who are demanding a repeal of the farm laws.While the BJP has so far managed to quell voices of dissent in Haryana, where it runs a coalition government with the Jannayak Janta Party that counts Jats as its primary vote base, party leaders said it does not want a repeat of the violence that erupted in 2016 following the agitation by Jats seeking the benefits reserved for OBC communities.“Despite the 2016 Jat agitation, the party managed to increase its vote share in Haryana, but recent events have the potential to cause problems,” said a second leader.Since the beginning of the farmers’ agitation, over half a dozen JJP MLAs, a few independent legislators, and BJP leaders from the region have expressed concern over the handling of the crisis. In Rajasthan, the the BJP’s ally, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party leader and Nagaur MP, Hanuman Beniwal, parted ways with the party over the farm agitation.“The events that unfolded last night are avoidable. It does not augur well for the party to have the farm agitation take the form of communal politics,” added the second leader.Former national general secretary of the BJP and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Jain said the agitation is politically motivated.But experts said that doesn’t solve the party’s problem.Political commentator Manisha Priyam said the coming together of Sikhs and Jats is a message that the politics of identity is not enough.“The BJP government will have to address economic insecurities. The farm crisis shows that there is a fear among the landed, dominant castes (such as the Jats) that their land will go,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wary-after-jats-answer-protest-call-in-up-haryana-101611959795627.html
30-01-2021||India||Govt making it an issue of bloated ego, says RLD president Ajit Singh||Former Union minister Ajit Singh, who is the president of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and a prominent leader among Jats and farmers in western Uttar Pradesh, spoke to Brajendra K Parashar on the farmers’ agitation against the three agriculture laws, and the situation that arose after the violent protests in New Delhi on January 26, and the UP Police’s attempts to make the farmers vacate the protest site in Ghazipur. Edited excerpts:How do you see the agitation by farm unions on Delhi’s borders against the three agriculture laws?The country’s farmers have risen against the Modi government. They are convinced that the intention behind the three agriculture laws is not to promote their interests but to benefit corporates, and rightly so. The agitation is not confined to just Delhi’s borders. Similar agitations are being organised in many other states including Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.What is wrong with the three laws, and do you think there is no need for reforms in agriculture marketing?There is always scope for reforms in any sector. I can also understand that every government has the prerogative to make new laws or make suitable changes in the existing ones... But it is always advisable to do so after due discussions with stakeholders, especially when a legislation has the potential to affect life and livelihood of the masses. Was there any justification for bringing the ordinances to impose laws on farmers? The Modi government also scuttled the traditional legislative process by not sending the Bills to the Select Committee for discussions. The way the ordinances were promulgated and later converted into the laws with same hurry created doubts in the minds of farmers. The outcome is for everyone to see.What is the way out now?The government must immediately withdraw all the three hurriedly enacted laws, respecting the general sentiments of farmers, and initiate a fresh process to bring new laws, if needed at all, after due consultation with farmers... The government is unnecessarily making the three laws an issue of a bloated ego.Can you justify the violence by a group farmers and hoisting of another flag at the Red Fort in Delhi?Nobody can justify this act, and we all condemn it. But the question is why did the police allow the protesters to enter Red Fort... There are allegations that he was a BJP man. Otherwise, there was no arson, no loot or shoot-out during the agitation.FIRs have been lodged against several farmer leaders and authorities are also believed to have given them ultimatum to end the stir.The authorities are acting in a dictatorial manner. They should have probed the charges before registering cases under the draconian provisions. UP Police are now harassing farmers who took their tractors to the rally. Do they think all this will scare farmers? Farmers are determined to continue their agitation and our party is lending full support to their peaceful protests.What message would you like to give to farmers?My only message to farmers is remain united, stay on course, and run the agitation peacefully. Victory will be yours because you are on the right path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-making-it-an-issue-of-bloated-ego-says-rld-president-ajit-singh-101611959049598.html
30-01-2021||India||One person from each house to reach Delhi: Haryana khap leaders||Major khap (clan) panchayats in Haryana on Friday decided to send at least one person from each family to farmer protests on Delhi’s borders and socially boycott leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Dushyant Chautala’s Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) , khap leaders said. Haryana is governed by a BJP-JJP coalition.The move came even as the Haryana government suspended mobile Internet in Rewari, Ambala, Jind, Bhiwani, Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Hisar, Rohtak, and Sirsa till Saturday evening, one of the most extensive internet blackouts in the state. The move is aimed at restricting communication between farm groups and preventing mobilisation. But the damage had already been done.One of the state’s most influential khaps, Kandela, held meetings at Kandela village on Friday. Likewise, the Dadan and Barh khaps hold their meetings at Uchana and Julana in Jind respectively. The Phogat khap met in Dadri, the Sarv khap in Rohtak , and the Sarv Sheoran khap at Kharkari village in Bhiwani.Balwant Nambardar, head of the Phogat Khap, said, “We have socially boycotted Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharambir Singh and former Dadri MLA Rajdeep Phogat, who is a chairman in the BJP-JJP government. We will not call these leaders in our social functions.Om Prakash Hooda, president of Hooda Khap, said his clan has unanimously decided to restrict the entry of ruling party leaders and government officials in villages under their control until the three farm laws are repealed.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states have been protesting at Delhi’s borders demanding the rollback of the three contentious farm laws passed in September last year.The farmers say they fear corporate farming will affect their earnings. However, the government continues to claim that the new laws would increase incomes of farmers and introduce a level-playing field.The khaps also decide to send reinforcements to the state’s borders with Delhi where farmers have been camping since November. The Sarv Panchayat khap held a meeting and said thousands of farmers from Haryana would soon reach Delhi’s borders. “The (Phogat) khap has decided to send at least one person from each family to Delhi’s border,” Nambardar added.“Hundreds of our tractors will head towards Ghazipur border tomorrow (Saturday) from Sampla here after visiting the statue of farm leader Chhotu Ram. We will ensure supply of milk and other items daily,” Hooda of Hooda khap said. On Friday, protesters blocked the Chandigarh- Jind highway; other protestors reached toll plazas in Rohtak, Dadri, Bhiwani, Jind, Hisar and other parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-person-from-each-house-to-reach-delhi-haryana-khap-leaders-101611956451909.html

A base (Shakti) of Shivling has also been found during digging at the site.“We think the temple was built on Panchayatana model like the Brahmeshwara and Chitrakarini temples which are of the 10th century origin. Another side of the wall is being dug out and it will require 10 more days to completely bring out the structures,” said Arun Mallick, superintendent of ASI's Bhubaneswar circle.Mallick said many ancient structures around the vicinity of Lingaraj temple are believed to have been damaged during the demolition drive carried out by the Odisha government for renovation of the old town area under Ekamra Kshetra Project.“Bhubaneswar is said to be city of more than 1000 temples. We believe many structures have been demolished during the current demolition exercise. We tried to reason with them about not carrying out indiscriminate demolition. But the state government did not take note of our protests,” he said.Among the heritage structures demolished around the Lingaraj temple are the 11th century Ganesh temple called Budha Ganesh on the northern side of Lingaraj complex. It has been listed as a protected monument years ago and is one of the smallest Ganesh temples of Bhubaneswar.The oldest structure in Bhubaneswar is Baitala temple, that is believed to have been built during 8th century by the Bhaumakara kings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asi-unearths-10th-century-temple-during-excavation-in-bhubaneswar-101611949719133.html

She had stated that they were in love and under pressure from her parents she had urged him to elope from their respective homes. They got married and consummate their marriage. The man was facing trial for offences under Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code, 1806, Section 6 of the POCSO Act and Section 9 of the Prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, 2006.Child-rights activists have been advocating for the legislation to be altered so the focus doesn’t deviate from serious cases and it doesn't criminalise consensual sexuality or romantic teenage relationships. "A majority of the POCSO cases booked in Tamil Nadu are cases related to romantic relationship and elopement," says Vidya Reddy, founder of Tulir, an organisation working on prevention and healing of child sexual abuse in India. "It prevents focus from the real POCSO cases." Activists says that several cases that are filed are of children between 16-18 years of age.Also read: Tikri simmers after ‘locals’ demand farmers’ evictionThe Madras High Court in its order also called for legislative changes observing that “an adolescent boy who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life... The legislature has to keep pace with the changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and more particularly in a stringent law such as the POCSO Act.”While the court made legal references to orders in similar cases and of Supreme Court’s observations on quashing non-compoundable offences, it also drew on neurobiological studies, biosocial approach, behavioural sciences and first love.But the court maintained that this would apply differently in each case, adding that the “Court is not turning a blind eye to cases where the victim or survivor may, under the effect of trauma that they have undergone, tend to reconcile, blaming themselves or convincing themselves that the element of consent was in fact present. Nor is this Court scientifically justifying the genuineness or predicament of the accused in every case where it appears that the accused and victim child have been in a romantic relationship. That will depend on the facts and circumstances of each and every case.”Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch in 2018 wrote to the Ministry of Women and Child Development that POCSO which was framed to protect children shouldn't punish them. "It's been hard to come to a consensus on this legalisation," said M Andrew Sesuraj, convenor of the organisation."While in principle it is good to revisit the age of consent and protect boys from being punished for sexual acts that aren't criminal, our fear is that the changes shouldn't be misused once again in serious cases of rape and victims compromising. We haven't yet found a way to do this," Sesuraj stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pocso-wasn-t-for-adolescents-teenagers-in-romantic-relationships-madras-hc-101611945974059.html
30-01-2021||India||Tikait’s appeal triggers show of strength in Muzaffarnagar||Tens of thousands of farmers poured into the Government Inter College (GIC) grounds in western Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar town on Friday, a show of strength after government crackdown on protests against three agriculture laws forced farm leader Rakesh Tikait to issue an emotional appeal for support.Farmers said they left their villages in the middle of the night after calls for mobilisation given from temples, mosques and panchayats. Viral videos of Tikait breaking down late in the face of police ultimatum on Thursday and vowing to not vacate Ghazipur protest site, on the eastern fringe of Delhi, cemented their conviction.“The ongoing movement is a battle for the honour of farmers and, if it ends, it will damage our very existence,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait after the seven-hour meeting, calling on farmers to strengthen the movement at Delhi’s borders.Naresh Tikait said that defeating Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Ajit Singh in the 2019 Lok Sabha election by supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was a mistake. “We will not commit this mistake again...,” he added, with Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary next to him.Jayant lashed out at central and state governments. Holding a pot of water from the Ganga, Jayant asked the crowd to swear that anyone who didn’t support the farmers stir would be socially boycotted. He then dropped a fistful of salt in the pot, a local oath-taking tradition, to seal the promise. “It is a matter of life and death for farmers, but do not worry. All have to stay together, united in this -- this is Chaudhary sahab’s (Ajit Singh’s) message,” he said.The mobilisation began late night on Thursday. The Ghaziabad administration had given him an ultimatum to vacate the site, as part of a wider crackdown on the two-month-old protests in the aftermath of violence in Delhi on Republic Day.“Tears of the son of Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait and my younger brother Rakesh Tikait will not go waste,” Naresh Tikait tweeted soon after, referring to their father, a legendary farm leader who held Delhi hostage in 1988 over demands such as free power and water for cultivators.By morning, farmers from Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Saharanpur, Meerut, Baghpat, Bijnor and other districts of western UP had taken tractors, cars, scooters and trucks to come to the GIC grounds, which can hold up to 100,000 people.When the mahapanchayat began, the venue was packed with people, many of whom were defiant in front of the heavy police presence. “Thousands of people arrived for the mahapanchayat and it was self-driven,” said Anuj Baliyan, a resident of Soram village. “I have not seen such a self-driven and motivated crowed in my life. Roads of Muzaffarnagar were jammed with tractors and the entire ground was packed with people,” he added.Emotions ran high at the meeting as people recalled Rakesh Tikait’s vow to not touch water until the farm laws were rescinded by the government.Vice president of BKU (Bhanu) Chaudhary Diwakar Singh said he defied his leader Bhànu Pratap’s decision to withdraw from the movement. “Rakesh Tikait’s tears have turned it into a complete farmers’ movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tikaits-appeal-triggers-show-of-strength-in-muzaffarnagar-101611945317515.html
30-01-2021||India||Cop to farm leader: Tracing Tikait’s journey||Rakesh Tikait, to whom the Delhi Police issued a notice asking him to explain why legal action should not be taken against him for breaching the agreement with police regarding the tractor rally on January 26, is himself a former Delhi Police constable.And the ongoing farmers’ protest, specifically a tearful speech he delivered when all seemed lost, could well mark his ascension as his father’s son. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson is a prominent name in the farmers’ movement and belongs to the well-known Tikait family of Sisauli village in Muzaffarnagar district of western Uttar Pradesh.His father Mahendra Singh Tikait, one of the tallest farmer leaders of the country and president of the BKU is still remembered as the man who brought Delhi to a halt for 7 days in October 1988 at the boat club. Over 5 lakh farmers joined the movement.Tikait, who, along with his supporters, has been camping on the Ghazipur border between Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, was asked to vacate the site on Thursday. The administration shut off power and water at the farmer encampment. Then came Tikait’s speech, and tractors from Haryana started rolling towards Ghazipur. Farmers in Uttar Pradesh organised a Mahapanchayat on Friday to discuss the issue and expressed their support for Tikait.His elder brother Naresh Tikait is the current BKU chief.Born in Sisauli village on June 4, 1969, Tikait went to DAV School of Sisauli and thereafter joined Kisan Inter College in Lalukheri of Muzaffarnagar district.He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree from Meerut University.He briefly served the Delhi police as a constable and resigned during the 1993 farmers’ protest spearheaded by his father.The then government pressured him to convince his father to end the movement, but he refused to give in and opted to resign and join the protest.Tikait was elected national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union in 1997.He contested the assembly elections from the Khatauli constituency of Muzaffarnagar in 2007 and lost.He then joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal ( RLD) of Ajit Singh in March 2014 and contested the Lok Sabha election from Amroha constituency against the advice of farmer leaders of the area. He received only 9,539 votes (0.62 percent) of the total votes polled and lost again.He belongs to the Baliyan khap (clan). In keeping with the khap’s tradition, his elder brother Naresh Tikait was appointed head of the khap and chief of BKU after the death of their father Mahendra Singh Tikait on May 15, 2011.The title “Tikait” was given to the head of Baliyan khap by King Harshvardhan, the Jat ruler of Thanesar in the 7th century and the tradition is still in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-to-farm-leader-tracing-tikait-s-journey-101611945318063.html
30-01-2021||India||Mutation worry grows for vaccines||A particular mutation of the Sars-Cov-2 virus is established to lower the efficacy for vaccines, the results announced by Novavax on Thursday and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) on Friday showed, reinforcing concerns that the inoculations may need to be updated to fight these new variants.The results also appear to reinforce the notion that vaccines that elicit higher immunogenicity – measured as antibody titers -- could be leading to higher efficacy. These insights are crucial as countries strike deals and prioritise different vaccines, particularly as they race to stay ahead of the coronavirus’s evolution.The mutation particularly worrying experts is known as E484 and occurs in the spike protein, the component of the virus used to enter target cells. It has been found in two widely spreading variants – the B.1.351 in South Africa and P.1 in Brazil.Novavax, which said its dose was 96% effective in preventing disease with the older variant, said the efficacy dropped to 60% in a small trial in South Africa where B.1.351 accounted for most infections. In the case of the J&J-Janssen dose too, the efficacy rate was 57% (for the SA strain) compared to 72% in the US, where infections were with the older variant.“Novavax initiated development of new constructs against the emerging strains in early January and expects to select ideal candidates for a booster and/or combination bivalent vaccine for the new strains in the coming days. The company plans to initiate clinical testing of these new vaccines in the second quarter of this year,” the company said in a statement, confirming that it had started work on updating the dose.On January 25, Moderna became the first to begin work to account for the new mutation, after reporting that it had seen a drop in immunogenicity in lab tests when the South African variant was used.“We now know that there is some loss in vaccine efficacy, down to around the 50%-60% level,” said John P Moore, leading virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine over email.“But that’s not zero, and a year ago we would have settled for a 50%-60 % effective vaccine,” he added.“The low efficacy of the Novavax vaccine candidate against the B.1.351 is concerning. However, the data is also reassuring in many ways. First, the vaccine itself worked very well against the ’old’ Sars-CoV-2 variants and the B.1.1.7 (UK) variant… And, vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 seemed markedly reduced, but still present. This was against symptomatic disease in general. It is very likely, that the efficacy against severe disease is much higher,” said Florian Krammer, professor of microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, in a series of tweets on Friday.The results by J&J and Novavax also showed that vaccines that led to significantly higher volumes of antibody when compared to people who recovered appear to be showing higher efficacy rates. For instance, the three vaccines that reported manifolds more antibody titre levels – Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax (see box) – had efficacy rates in the mid 90s.In comparison, the single-dose J&J-Janssen vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – both of which showed antibody levels comparable to a natural infection – had lower efficacy rates. Experts have said that while higher efficacy rates are better, those with lower ones will still be able to protect from severe disease or death.Speaking in the context of J&J’s lower apparent efficacy, Moore said: “Look, a year ago, we are all hoping for efficacy in the 60-70% range. The mRNA and now Novavax data have spoiled us, as we now ‘expect’ 90-95%… Lesser efficacy will still be useful.”But, he added, “there are going to be complications — what will the public want/expect/use? Will there be controversies there? And infected vaccine recipients may be a problem area for generating resistant variants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sarscov2-virus-mutation-worry-grows-for-vaccines-101611945257489.html
30-01-2021||India||In boost for India, Novavax finds vaccine 89% effective||Two more developers of coronavirus vaccines announced on Friday that their doses were effective in preventing Covid-19, adding to the world’s arsenal to fight the pandemic with at least one of them – Novavax – likely to be widely available in India by the summer if all goes to plan.Novavax said its two-shot vaccine showed an overall efficacy rate of 89%, with a high of 96% against the dominant global variant of the virus. The efficacy dipped to 86% in the case of the B.1.1.7 variant first seen in the UK, and further to 60% in the case of the B.1.351 variant spreading in South Africa.The other company to announce efficacy results was Johnson & Johnson (J&J) which said its vaccine – developed in partnership with Janssen -- showed an aggregate efficacy rate of 66% when given as a single dose. It too reported a drop in efficacy rate – to 57% -- when dealing with the South African variant.Novavax has a deal with Pune’s Serum Institute of India (SII) for the manufacture of at least a billion doses of its vaccine for low- and middle-income countries and India. Hours after the efficacy results were announced, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters that his company has applied for permission to conduct a trial in India.“We have already applied to the drug controller’s office for the bridging trial, a few days ago… So they should also give that approval soon now,” the news agency quoted him as saying. SII, which produces the largest volumes of vaccines every year, is also making a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which it has supplied in millions to India, where it is the most widely used dose.Poonawalla told Reuters earlier this month that his company would manufacture “upwards of 40-50 million doses per month” of the Novavax vaccine from around April, which raises hopes that India could have access to large quantities of a third vaccine by the summer.In addition to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is marketed as Covishield in India by SII, the country is using Covaxin developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. This vaccine has not yet reached the trial endpoint to determine efficacy rate.On a conference call, Novavax representatives noted that this was interim data and that they expect it will be two to three months before they are ready to apply for authorisation with regulators. The UK trial, which enrolled 16,000 people aged 18 to 84, is expected to be used to apply for use in Britain, the European Union and other countries. The bridging trial in India will likely help SII bolster its application, similar to the approach it took with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.“With today’s results from our UK Phase 3 and South Africa Phase 2b clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials involving over 20,000 participants… NVX-CoV2373 is the first vaccine to demonstrate not only high clinical efficacy against Covid but also significant clinical efficacy against both the rapidly emerging UK and South Africa variants,” said Stanley C Erck, president and chief executive officer, Novavax, according to a company statement.Experts said though the efficacy shown by J&J-Janssen’s single dose vaccine is lower, it is still good news. “Look, a year ago, we are all hoping for efficacy in the 60-70% range. The mRNA and now Novavax data have spoiled us, as we now “expect” 90-95%… Lesser efficacy will still be useful, but there are going to be complications — what will the public want/expect/use? Will there be controversies there? And infected vaccine recipients may be a problem area for generating resistant variants,” said John Moore leading virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine in an e-mail .A single-shot dose will be easier in terms of mass inoculations and help prevent severe disease and death. J&J is also testing a two-dose vaccine. “I think the two dose version will do better... It will be interesting to see whether they go to FDA for approval of one dose or want for the two dose data,” added Moore.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-boost-for-india-novavax-finds-vaccine-89-effective-101611945197463.html
