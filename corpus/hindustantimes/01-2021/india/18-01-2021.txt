We are just seeking some clarifications regarding certain information we have,” one of the officers said.About three dozen people including farm leaders, Sikh activities, journalists and even those belonging to entertainment industry in Punjab have been summoned by the NIA as witnesses.Certain farm leaders including Baldev Singh Sirsa have refused to join the NIA investigations after Samyukt Kisan Morcha decided that no farmer who has received the NIA notice will appear before it.The agency is particularly looking into the funding of SFJ and other Khalistani groups for organising protests both in India as well as abroad outside Indian missions.In its summons sent to these three dozen people, seen by HT, NIA has said that they need to attend the examination as “it appears they are acquainted with the circumstances of this case”.As first reported by HT on December 23 last year, NIA had filed a case on December 15 to investigate funding of Khalistani terrorist groups organising on ground campaigns and demonstrations, as well as role of some Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) in it. The agency had named as accused US-based Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, UK- based Paramjit Singh Pamma and Canada resident Hardeep Singh Nijjar who, under the banner of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), are allegedly collecting funds for these protests.Jasveer Singh, a journalist with UK based channel - KTV - said - “I have been covering the farmers’ protests for two months but I was surprised to receive summons from the agency. I couldn’t go today but I will join the NIA examination on the next date as I have nothing to hide”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-probe-against-khalistanis-nia-examines-people-linked-to-farmers-protests-101610993717689.html
18-01-2021||India||Cold wave claims lives of two nomad children in Kashmir||The death of two minor children aged 10 and 6 of a nomad family in a Kulgam forest one after another in the past two days apparently due to intense cold has triggered a wave of anger and gloom in Kashmir valley.The family of Zubair Ahmad alias Zair Khan from Reasi in Jammu district, had been living up in a ramshackle shed covered with tarpaulin and polythene in a forest area of Devsar in Kulgam district amid an intense cold wave in Kashmir valley.Locals and officials said that Ahmad's 10-year-old son Sahil Zubair, who was suffering from fever for the past few days, died on Saturday.“We are poor people and are living in this shed. This cold killed my son and now my young daughter is also very ill,” sobbing Mumtaz mother of the children told a local journalist on video on Sunday.The couple’s 6-year-old daughter Shazia Jan was rushed to a health facility but could not survive and died on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.“The two were not brought to any hospital of the district,” said chief medical officer of Kulgam, Dr Fazil Kochak.“The two children have died – one on Saturday and another on Sunday night,” said Rashid Ahmad, Tehsildar Devsar who had gone to the family to give a few blankets and a bag of ration earlier on Saturday.He again returned with additional deputy commissioner Showkat Ahmad Rather on Monday after the girl’s death."They had not informed us of the boy's illness," the tehsildar said.“After the snowfall on January 3, the in-charge of a nearby school had announced that the building is open for the affected. We had given them the option but they did not listen saying that they wanted to take care of their animals. Even today they were asked to shift into the school but they refused. Now they shifted to a few rooms of a nearby house,” said Rashid Ahmad.CPI (M) leader and former MLA of Kulgam, M Y Tarigami blamed the deaths on the 'failure' of the administration.“This tragic incident speaks volumes about the failure of administration in protecting the marginalized sections of society. We must strive and struggle collectively for ensuring justice to our people,” he said in a tweet.Kashmir received very heavy snowfall particularly in Kulgam district between January 3 and 8 blocking the roads in most of the districts. After the snowfall, the valley is reeling under very intense cold with night temperatures plunging to record sub-zero levels. Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, recorded a minimum temperature of -8.4 degrees Celsius on January 14, which broke the record of last 25 years.Ahmad’s family, along with three other families, are nomads and normally would move from Jammu to Kashmir in summers along with their flock of animals and then return when winter sets in here. Officials said that this year they had decided to stay put and Ahmad perhaps wanted to work as a labourer.Officials said that Ahmad had three children from his second wife of which only one survives now. They said his children from first wife are older and one of them is married. Ahmad’s daughter-in-law is pregnant and living with them.Additional deputy commissioner Kulgam Showkat Ahmad Rather said the family has been taken to a hospital put under the supervision of medical superintendent Kulgam hospital.“They are saying the children died due to cold but we had asked them to shift into a school beforehand during snowfall but they did not listen. The family is poor and appears very pale. We have now shifted them all including the pregnant daughter-in-law of Ahmad to the hospital for observation,” Rather said.He said that the school in which they were earlier asked to shift was just 30 metres away from their tent in the forest. “They said they wanted to live with the local population where they have shifted now in a house. This is an unfortunate incident. Even an adult may die of cold in these circumstances,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-claims-lives-of-two-nomad-children-in-kashmir-101610990907203.html

The tenth round of meeting with farmers' unions was scheduled for Tuesday. News agencies ANI and PTI cited officials of the Union agriculture ministry as saying that the talks have been postponed to Wednesday.The farmers have been protesting since November last year to demand the scrapping of farm laws saying they will hurt their livelihoods. A team of 41 representatives of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has been participating in negotiations with the Centre, which has been represented by Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash.Also read | SC panel on farm laws to begin work on January 19Farmers want the farm laws, which were approved by Parliament in September, repealed but the government has rejected their demand. Nine rounds of talks so far have failed to break the deadlock.Earlier in the day, Union agriculture minister Tomar had hoped that protesting farmers' unions will discuss alternatives other than the repeal of the new farm laws in the tenth round of talks as he appealed them not to go ahead with their tractor rally on Republic Day in Delhi.Also read | Will hold peaceful R-Day parade in Delhi: farm unions"We had nine rounds of talks so far. I have always said that farmers' unions should discuss the provisions of the laws. The government is discussing and wants to discuss with an open heart if they point out any problem with provisions of the laws," he said, according to PTI. "I want to appeal to farmers that January 26 is our Republic Day and the country has got independence after much sacrifice. Ensuring that the dignity of the Republic day is not affected is the responsibility of farmers also. I hope they will reconsider their decision," he had said.The minister also said that the central government is fully committed to farmers. The Modi government has rolled out several agri-schemes in the last six years to improve farmers' plight and make farming profitable.Protesting union leaders have said farmers have a constitutional right to take out their tractor rally peacefully and asserted that thousands of people will participate in the proposed event on January 26.The three laws in question, which have been stayed by the Supreme court, are -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-postpones-10th-round-of-talks-with-farmers-leaders-to-jan-20-reports-101610990259933.html

As a result, uploading information on it was time consuming and tedious.“The portal is crashing intermittently, leading to delay in vaccination of our health workers. It happened on the inaugural day of vaccination last Saturday and today as well,” said Dr Vidyapati Chaudhary, principal of the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH).“We are not getting the names of beneficiaries on time. As a result, we are unable to contact them telephonically. Some beneficiaries have complained that they did not receive any intimation about their vaccination. Sometimes, mid-way through the exercise, names of beneficiaries also disappear from the portal,” added Dr Chaudhary.Officials said they had flagged the Co-WIN portal issue with the central government which was handling it.Given the technical glitches in the portal, many hospital administrators suggested to the state health department on Monday to allow them to prepare the beneficiary list manually from the names of health care workers already enrolled for vaccination on the portal. The state said it would seek a formal nod from the Centre before giving a go-ahead.At present, vaccination officers have to adhere to the list of beneficiaries generated by the government through the Co-WIN portal, a day prior to their vaccination. However, this list was being generated late and with difficulty, officials said.Meanwhile, the AIIMS-Patna prepared a manual list of beneficiaries, as per availability of health care workers, and achieved 100% target for the second day on Monday as well.“We have taken a clearance from the state authorities to prepare a manual list of beneficiaries from among our health care workers who had enrolled for vaccination on the portal,” said Dr CM Singh, superintendent, AIIMS-Patna.“The idea is to vaccinate maximum people in the shortest possible time. Preparing a manual list, depending on availability of health care workers, helps save time and resources,” said Dr Snajeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna.Patna, which has 16 session centres or vaccination centres , also witnessed a 6.5% drop in vaccination on Monday as compared to Saturday when 775 out of 1,422 (54.5%) personnel listed on Monday turned up for inoculation.Against 100 beneficiaries listed at each vaccination centre, only 78 turned up at PMCH, 28 at Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), 76 at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), 40 at Guru Gobind Singh Hospital, 24 at Barh sub-divisional hospital (SDH), 39 at Danapur SDH, 10 at Masaurhi SDH, 39 at Bakhtiyarpur primary health centre (PHC), 15 at Bihta PHC, 26 at Dhanarua PHC, 30 at Fatuha community health centre, 30 at Maner PHC, 30 at Phulwarishari PHC, 38 at Paras Hospital, 62 at Ruben Hospital and 87 at BIG Hospital.Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh had asked Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh to sensitise health care workers where vaccination percentage was poor.Efforts to reach executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, also the state nodal officer for vaccination, proved futile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glitches-in-co-win-portal-leads-to-drop-in-covid-vaccination-percentage-in-bihar-101610989366012.html

Participating in a people's gram sabha meeting held by his party in Kummanur village in the district, he said the scheme would be fast tracked and also extended to several other villages in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts if the DMK came to power in the assembly elections, due in a few months. Stalin claimed the DMK government had completed 80 per cent of the work on the Hogenakkal integrated drinking water project. "I went to Japan to get funds for the project. But when the AIADMK came to power, it thwarted the plan. We will complete the project when the DMK comes to power," he said. The Leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu assembly claimed the AIADMK government had not implemented any scheme for Dharmapuri district. "The prices of groceries, which were under check during the DMK regime, have now gone up. In four months time, the DMK will form the government in Tamil Nadu with the support of the people," he asserted. Stalin, whose party is aiming to come back to power after being in the opposition for the last ten years, has been touring the state and addressing the people's grama sabha meetings, as a prelude to the campaign for assembly elections, likely in April-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-accuses-aiadmk-govt-of-putting-on-hold-projects-brought-during-dmk-rule-101610987744128.html

They were both admitted in hospitals.“In all 14 people developed AEFI. Two of them had to be shifted to hospitals. They are undergoing treatment. The AEFI rate is just around 1 in 1000 which is normal for any vaccination drive,” said a top official of the state health department.According to state health department officials at least 14,110 people received the vaccine on Monday across 207 centres in the state. On the first day of the drive on January 16, at least 15,707 were given the vaccines.“There was some communication gap. The Co-WIN app had developed glitches and was not working smoothly. Many of the selected beneficiaries, who were supposed to receive the vaccine, didn’t turn up as they didn’t receive the SMS. The authorities had to call them individually and inform them,” said a senior official of the state health department.The vaccines would be administered every Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-people-develop-aefi-on-second-day-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-in-bengal-101610987735846.html

18-01-2021||India||Two Manipur journalists held for article, released after admitting to oversight||Two journalists of a local news portal who were detained under sedition charges for carrying an article in their website on Sunday, were released on Monday after they admitted that oversight led to its publishing, police said.Dhiren Sadokpam, editor-in-chief of the Frontier Manipur, an online news portal and its executive editor A Dhananjoy Sharma also known as Paojel Chaoba, were charged under IPC sections 120B (Criminal Conspiracy), 505 (b) (causing alarm to induce offence against the state) and 34 (common intention) along with UAPA’s Section 39 (supporting terror organisation).According to the police, an article titled ‘Revolutionary journey in a mess’ by one M Joy Luwang was carried in the online news portal on January 8, 2021.The Police claimed that the article openly endorsed revolutionary ideologies and activities, and expressed shock and dismay at the deteriorating character of the armed revolutionaries in Manipur in the last decade.The police had filed a First Information Report (FIR) against the author and two journalists.The article is an attempt to bring hatred, contempt and feeling of enmity against the Rule of Law and the government which is likely to cause fear or alarm to the public inducting them to commit an offence against the state, posing serious threats of internal security issues, the police said in the FIR registered at Singjamei Police Station in Imphal West District.When contacted on phone, Imphal West District superintendent of police (SP) K Meghachandra claimed the journalists apologised and said that there was no bad intention in carrying the article (in the website). “Even though the serious charges were dropped, the case is still alive and the investigation is going on,” the SP said.Ahead of his release, Paojel Chaoba in a letter of undertaking to the SP said that the article’s source was “unverified” and uploaded the article on the website as an “oversight.”Earlier in the day, a joint team of All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union and Editors Guild Manipur met chief minister N Biren Singh, a former editor who once headed the scribes’ body in the state and urged him to release the two journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-manipur-journalists-held-for-article-released-after-admitting-to-oversight-101610983718145.html

In a letter to chief minister's private secretary, VK Pandian, last month, he offered to donate his three-room newly constructed house in Balitutha village of coastal Jagatsinghpur district to Odisha police so that a police station can be constructed."We don't have a police station in the radius of 12 kilometres on one side (Kujang PS) and on the other side (Ersama PS) at a distance of 14 kilometres. Balitutha is well connected to Cuttack-Paradeep Highway by a black-topped road. Though there are two nationalised banks, a private bank, a telephone exchange, a primary health centre, a high school, an ME School and a primary school at this place, there is no police station nearby. This place is a gateway to Posco/Jindal site. I, along with a number of people of my area met the DGP, Odisha in November 2013 who promised to do the needful, but nothing has borne fruit so far," Mishra wrote in his letter.Though as per norms, there has to be at least one police station in each block, Odisha currently has 627 police stations, double the number of its blocks. Jagatsinghpur district has 14 regular police stations including 11 territorial police stations. With the Ministry of Home Affairs offering financial assistance for the modernisation of police infrastructure, the number of police stations have gone up in the state. On December 30, chief minister Naveen Patnaik inaugurated 6 new police stations.Also read: Tandav makers say sorry after a torrent of criticism over web seriesMishra said he wanted to donate the house which he had constructed four years ago as he does not need for it. "I and my wife, a retired professor of Ramadevi University are settled in Cuttack town. My son is pursuing his Ph D in mechanical engineering in the US while two daughters are busy in their studies and career. As no one is staying in that house which I constructed after spending ₹10.5 lakh, I don't want it to go waste. No one in my family need any money from that house. I want to donate the house for a police station so that law and order situation can be better managed in 11 gram panchayats of my area," he said.Mishra said the current value of the house would be over ₹20 lakh.Jagatsinghpur SP R Prakash said opening a police station depends on its feasibility as well as crime profile of the area. "We have to do crime analysis of the area over the last 3 years. Besides, in this case, the nearest police stations are not very far. But we can think of opening an outpost or beat house in the village for patrolling purposes if my superiors permit it. If we get the permission for opening a beat house or an outpost, re-distribution of staff can be done," said the SP.Last year, a lawyer in Jagatsinghpur had made the district collector the nominee of ₹14 lakh fixed deposit that he kept in two bank accounts. Civil lawyer Basudeb of Jagatsinghpur district in July last year made the district collector of Jagatsinghpur as the nominee in two fixed deposits held by him and his wife. While one deposit was worth ₹2 lakh, another contained ₹12 lakh. The lawyer wanted the money to be used for the underprivileged and the downtrodden people of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retired-odisha-professor-seeks-to-donate-house-for-construction-of-police-station-101610984842904.html

18-01-2021||India||India, Japan sign agreement to give skilled Indian workers access to Japanese job market||India and Japan on Monday signed an agreement to boost the mobility of skilled Indian workers in 14 fields, including nursing, industrial machinery, shipbuilding, aviation, agriculture and the food services industry.The two countries have stepped up trade and economic cooperation across areas, ranging from the steel industry and investments to creating alternative and more resilient supply chains, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and Japan’s ambassador Satoshi Suzuki signed the memorandum of cooperation (MoC) on a framework for partnership for specified skilled workers (SSWs), whereby Indian workers in 14 categories who meet skill requirements and pass Japanese language tests will be eligible for employment on a contractual basis.Also read: ‘Appalling’ - World leaders react to Alexei Navalny’s arrest in RussiaThe two sides will set up a joint working group of officials to work out operational details and smooth implementation of the programme.“Japan would grant these workers the status of ‘specified skilled worker’. It is also expected that Indian skilled workers who go to Japan under this MoC will acquire new skills while working in Japan,” the external affairs ministry said.More than 38,000 Indians currently live in Japan. In recent years, the composition of the Indian community has changed with the arrival of more professionals, including in IT, engineering, management, finance, and scientific research.Foreign Secretary @harshvshringla signed the Specified Skilled Workers Agreement with Ambassador Suzuki @EOJinIndia today. pic.twitter.com/Zx5qTUWi6PSpeaking at the signing ceremony, Shringla said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has attached “high priority” to the quick operationalisation of the agreement. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, during his tenure as the chief cabinet secretary, was one of the main movers of the SSW programme to address the needs of Japan’s skilled labour market, he added.Suzuki said the agreement will open the door for talented and skilled Indians to get jobs in Japan. “I'm confident it takes our friendship further with more Indian people coming to Japan,” he said on Twitter.The 14 fields covered by the agreement include nursing care, material processing, industrial machinery manufacturing, electric and electronic information, construction, shipbuilding and ship-related industries, aviation, agriculture, fisheries, food and beverage manufacturing, food services industry, lodging, automobile maintenance and building cleaning.Shringla noted the agreement is in line with other steps taken by India and Japan to bolster cooperation in skills development. In 2016, the two sides signed the "Manufacturing Skill Transfer Promotion Programme” agreement for training 30,000 people over 10 years with Japanese-style manufacturing skills through the Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing (JIM) and Japanese Endowed Courses (JECs) in Indian colleges.A total of 13 JIMs and five JECs are already operational.In 2017, the two countries signed the “Technical Intern Training Programme” agreement to allow Indian youth to avail of internships in Japan in manufacturing, healthcare, construction, textiles and agriculture.Japan’s trade with India was worth $17.63 billion in 2018-19.

18-01-2021||India||Tandav makers say sorry after a torrent of criticism over web series||Filmmaker Ali Abbas Zafar on Monday offered an unconditional apology for portions of the web series ‘Tandav’ that may have hurt sentiments after multiple police complaints were filed against the filmmaker and officials of Amazon Prime, the over-the-top platform that released the web series last week.The information and broadcasting ministry had also sought an explanation from Amazon Prime officials on allegations that the web-series had hurt religious sentiments.“The cast and crew did not have any intention to offend the sentiments of any individual, caste, community, race, religion or religious belief or insult or outrage any institution, political party or a person, living or dead. The cast and crew of Tandav take cognizance of the concerns expressed by the people and unconditionally apologise if it has unintentionally hurt anybody’s sentiments,” a statement put out by Ali Abbas Zafar on his Twitter handle said.Tandav row: All you need to know about controversies surrounding Saif's showThe apology is seen as an effort to cap the controversy around the web series that provoked a torrent of criticism from a section of political parties. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders were among the most vocal, but leaders of some other parties also spoke out against Amazon’s political thriller that premiered on the streaming platform on Friday.Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, for one, tweeted her support to the demand that the filmmakers remove scenes that hurt sentiments. In a tweet, Mayawati said there were protests against some scenes that hurt religious and ethnic sentiments in the web series and it would be appropriate to remove whatever is objectionable so that the atmosphere of peace, harmony and mutual brotherhood in the country is not spoilt.Tandav over Tandav: Why Amazon’s political drama ignited a firestormCongress leader Milind Deora said he didn’t believe in censorship but there was a need to regulate content on OTT platforms.“Though I oppose political censorship, to create a level-playing field, OTT must be subject to the same regulation as TV broadcasters. Several countries are considering or already have similar rules. Keep GoI (Government of India) away by self-regulating through an OTT industry association?” he tweeted.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra has ordered officials to initiate legal action against the makers of the web series and Amazon Prime officials. “The series is a conspiracy to justify the act of ‘Tukde Tukde’ gang and malign the image of the Hindu religion. I have ordered an inquiry to take legal action against the makers of the series,” Mishra told reporters in Bhopal.BJP lawmaker from Maharashtra, Ram Kadam lodged a complaint against the platform and asked I&B minister Prakash Javadekar for a mechanism to regulate content on the OTT platforms.Maharashtra MP Manoj Kotak also shot off a letter to Javadekar, demanding some sort of censorship for programmes telecast on OTT platforms that “are full of sex, violence, drugs, abuse, hate and vulgarity and sometimes they hurt the sentiments of Hindus and religious sentiments.”A letter written by Amit Malviya the head of the BJP‘s IT cell in September last year to Amazon was also shared on social media. In his letter, Malviya had alleged political bias in the content shown on the platform.“I understand that creative liberties and artistic freedom are important when it comes to expressions across mediums but there is a discernible trend in the kind of content that is being pushed on Amazon prime while one would like to think of it as creative pursuits but a considered view from source to believe that it may have more to do with professionals in charge of commissioning the content on the platform,” the BJP leader had said, before going on to accuse Amazon Prime Video’s Aparna Purohit of bias against the ruling party at the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-makers-say-sorry-after-a-torrent-of-criticism-over-web-series-101610981012320.html
18-01-2021||India||SC panel on farm laws to begin work on January 19||A committee appointed by the Supreme Court to scrutinise three agricultural laws that have prompted farmers to stage a months-long protest will meet on January 19 for its first round of internal consultations, a member of the panel said.On January 12, after two days of deliberation, the Supreme Court had suspended the pro-reforms farm laws approved by Parliament in September. Judges dealing with the case also appointed a four-man committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws.The court had named economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi as well as farm activists Bhupinder Singh Mann and Anil Ghanwat to the panel. A day later, Mann opted out of the committee, citing the “interests of farmers”.Ghanwat, a member of the now three-member panel, told HT on Monday that the committee will start deliberations on January 19, which will include framing of issues before the committee.According to the Supreme Court’s instructions, the committee had to meet within 10 days of its constitution and submit a report to the apex court in two months.Also read: Violence at BJP roadshow led by Dilip Ghosh, Suvendu Adhikari in Kolkata“In our first meeting, we will take note of our terms of reference and chalk out processes we will follow,” Ghanwat said. He said it was up to the Supreme Court to appoint a member in place of Mann, who has recused himself but the committee’s work would continue.Ghanwat leads the Shetkari Sangathan, a farm organisation from Maharashtra that advocates pro-technology and pro-reform agricultural policies.According to Ghanwat, the committee will examine the three farm laws and draw up a list of stakeholders for consultations, including farm unions, representatives of agribusinesses, scholars, scientists and even the government.“Our basic terms of reference are to look into the laws and consult stakeholders with the objective of addressing grievances of farmers,” Ghanwat said.The laws in question are the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading protests against the laws, has however said its members would not appear before the committee.“We have said this before and reiterate that our demand is a complete repeal of the laws and we will only talk to the government,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm leader.Farm unions on strike have also said all members of the court-appointed committee had previously publicly praised the laws that farmers want scrapped.The farm unions are on a strike since November to demand the scrapping of three pro-reform farm laws they say will hurt their livelihoods, setting off a key political challenge to the Modi government.A team of 41 representatives of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has been participating in negotiations with the Union government, represented by Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash.Farmers want the three farm laws repealed but the government has rejected the demand. Nine rounds of talks so far have failed to break the deadlock.Ordering the committee to scrutinise the laws, the court had said, "This committee will be for us. All of you people who are expected to solve the issue will go before this committee. It will not pass an order or punish you, it will only submit a report to us.”The government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming.Tens of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi’s border points say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-on-farm-laws-to-begin-work-on-january-19-101610981401084.html

He, however, clarified that it will not take place on Tuesday.Kumar, who reached the JD (U) office in the evening, is learnt to have discussed the cabinet expansion with senior party leaders.At the party office, he clarified that expansion will take place soon. “Talks are still on. Once it is over, it will be expanded,” said Kumar.Earlier on Sunday evening, BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad met the CM for close to 40 minutes. Sources said that cabinet expansion was at the top agenda of the meeting.Sources in the NDA said that the BJP has finally given its nod to the expansion and the same has been communicated to Nitish Kumar, who had said earlier that the BJP was still to hand over the list of probable candidates.NDA sources said that a maximum of 21 or 22 ministers can now be inducted in the cabinet. It is still unclear whether the expanded cabinet will have equal numbers of ministers from both the BJP and the JD (U) despite the latter being the junior partner in the ruling coalition in Bihar with 43 MLAs as compared to the BJP’s 74.Sources in BJP and JD (U) hinted that top leaders had “almost agreed on a 50:50 cabinet berth sharing formula on the lines of seat-sharing before 2020 Assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha polls”.A BJP leader who did not wish to be named said, “Following RJD’s bid to create political instability, the BJP is showing magnanimity in the sharing of cabinet berths with the JD (U).”A total of 14 ministers were sworn in the new cabinet apart from the Chief Minister in November last, five from the JD (U) and seven from the BJP plus two from smaller allies, HAM (S) and VIP.With BJP emphasis on new faces and youths, several names are doing the round. Among the young BJP leaders whose names are being discussed in political circles include those of Samrat Chaudhary, Nitish Mishra, Nitin Naveen and Sanjeev Chaurasia.There is also speculation that former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain may also be made a minister.The appointment of senior BJP leaders Nandkishore Yadav, Prem Kumar, Vinod Narayan Jha, and Ramnarayan Mandal to various posts in the Vidhan Sabha committees has led political observers to believe that Nitish Kumar's cabinet will have more youngsters from the BJP's side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-says-cabinet-to-be-expanded-soon-101610980049401.html

"There is no question of giving even an inch of land from Karnataka to Maharashtra. He should give up issuing statements just for political reasons," Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa told reporters on Monday."I am pained at Maharashtra Chief Ministers remarks that can disturb the prevailing harmonious atmosphere.I expect Shri Uddhav Thackeray, as a true Indian, to show his commitment and respect to the principles of federalism in letter and spirit," Yediyurappa said in a tweet.Thackeray said on Sunday his government is committed towards incorporating into the state the areas of Karnataka where Marathi-speaking people are in majority.This will be the "true tribute" to martyrs of the cause, the Chief Ministers Office (CMO) said in a tweet.Maharashtra claims Belagavi (earlier called as Belgaum) and some other areas, part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency but currently in Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, a regional organisation fighting for the merger of Belagavi and some other border areas with Maharashtra, observes January 17 as the 'martyrs day' for those who laid down their lives for the cause in 1956."Bringing Karnataka-occupied Marathi-speaking and cultural areas in Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who accepted martyrdom in the boundary battle.We are united and committed towards it.Respects to the martyrs with this promise," the CMO tweeted.Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belagavi, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending that the majority of population in these areas is Marathi-speaking.On Monday, pro-Kannada organisations held demonstrations and burnt Thackeray's effigy in parts of the State.A few pro-Marathi activists led by local units of Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti had organised the 'Martyrs Day' in Belagavi on Sunday.They demanded merger of Belagavi, Karwar, Nippani, Bidar and Bhalki with Maharashtra.Thackeray's statement came on a day when Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Yediyurappa along with his cabinet colleagues and BJP legislators were present in Belagavi bordering Maharashtra to commemorate the victory of BJP backed village panchayat members in the recent elections.Yediyurappa added on Monday that the Marathi people have been living in harmony with Kannadigas in Karnataka.Likewise, Kannadigas living in the border districts of Maharashtra are living in harmony with the Marathi people there.The Karnataka Chief Minister condemned Thackerays comments saying it can disrupt the peace and harmony among people.Hitting out at Thackeray, former Chief Minister and Congress leader Siddaramaiah tweeted, "Belagavi is an integral part of Karnataka.Don't try to instigate us by bringing up the issue which is already resolved."Cautioning Thackeray not to politicise the issue which is already decided, Siddaramaiah reminded him that he is not just a Shiv Sena activist but also a responsible Chief Minister of a state.Lashing out at Thackeray, JDS leader and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy said, "Looking at his tweets, it appears like a statement issued by a terrorist." In his tweets, Kumaraswamy likened Thackeray's statement with Chinese expansionism."Uddhav Thackeray's irresponsible statement that 'Karnataka occupied territories will be annexed to Maharashtra' sounds like Chinese expansionism.Such an expansionism will jeopardise the harmony among states formed on the linguistic ground," Kumaraswamy said in statement.Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and several others condemned Thackeray's statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-political-leaders-blast-thackeray-protests-erupt-over-his-statement-on-border-issue-101610974814591.html

Minister Aroop Biswas rushed to the spot as local people staged a roadblock in protest against the violence.“Several women were injured by the brickbats thrown by BJP workers. Property of a local mosque was damaged. They also ransacked a TMC office.

Adhikari and Ghosh travelled in a decorated mini truck while the BJP workers walked alongside. The BJP workers jumped across the road divider and chased the men who allegedly pelted stones at the roadshow.“This sort of violence is not surprising. Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee cannot stop the BJP with violence,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.The violence which lasted about 10 minutes also took the police by surprise.

None of the leaders were, however, affected by the violenceThe TMC claimed the violence was a diversionary tactic adopted by the BJP.“The violence was orchestrated by the BJP since Mamata Banerjee announced in the afternoon that she will contest from the Nandigram seat in East Midnapore district from where Adhikari was elected. This was a diversionary strategy by the BJP. TMC flags can be purchased from the market. I can buy BJP flags too,” said minister and TMC spokesperson Tapas Roy.While addressing people at the end of the roadshow, a belligerent Adhikari said, “I congratulate BJP Yuva Morcha (youth front) workers for giving a befitting reply to the attackers.

The verdict has brought hope to millions of pensioners who have waited for a long time for a pension in accordance with their salary.Here’s everything you need to know about the review petition filed by EPFO:1. The three-member bench considering the review petition is headed by Justice UU Lalit.2. Earlier, both Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court had pronounced their verdicts in the favour of the pensioners. But full pension was denied as the appeal of the ministry of labour and employment and EPFO's review plea were pending.3. The Supreme Court of India had upheld Kerala High Court's verdict on a monthly pension from the Employees’ Pension Scheme on April 1, 2019. After this, the ministry of labour filed an appeal against the high court verdict despite the review petition filed by EPFO. The bench headed by the then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi ordered to hear both petitions in the open court on July 12, 2019. But no further action was taken in this matter.4. The parliamentary standing committee also sought an explanation regarding the matter last October.5. Senior officials of the labour ministry have given some suggestions in this regard to the cabinet committee with regards to continuing EPFO and making structural changes.6. If the top court upholds its decision further, the structure of EPFO may change significantly as the Supreme Court review is about the PF accounts of the EPFO subscribers.7. EPFO has over 2.3 million pensioners, who receive a pension of ₹1,000 every month. Their contribution to PF is however less than a quarter of it.8. Currently, the maximum limit for EPFO pension has been fixed. On availing 'defined contribution', the members of EPF will be given benefit as per their contribution means their benefits will be directly proportional to the contribution.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-consider-review-plea-in-epf-pension-case-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-101610975072037.html
18-01-2021||India||Cong led opposition stages walkout from Kerala assembly||The Congress-led Opposition staged a walkout from the Kerala assembly on Monday after Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan denied permission to move an adjournment motion to discuss the alleged threatening of a poll officer by an MLA during the recent local body polls. Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA N A Nellikkunnu moved the motion, seeking discussion on the alleged threat to the officer by Uduma MLA K Kunhiraman on December 14. The opposition walked out after the Speaker refused permission, saying the incident occurred a month ago and was under the consideration of the State Election Commission. Nellikkunnu and other opposition members returned later and raised the matter as the first submission in the Assembly. On January 9, the SEC sought a report from the Kasaragod district collector on a polling officer's complaint that the CPI(M) legislator from the district had threatened him during the local body polls held in December. K M Sreekumar, Professor, Agricultural Entomology, Kerala Agricultural University at nearby Peelicode, was on election duty as the presiding officer at the polling station. He had complained that Uduma MLA K Kunhiraman had threatened him for verifying credentials of voters. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in his reply, said the officer had not yet filed a police complaint against the MLA. "However, based on newspaper reports, we have asked the Kasaragod district Crime Branch DySP to look into the matter and submit a report. It's based on the news reports alone," he said. Vijayan also said it was not the duty of the presiding officer to verify the voter ID cards. "In this matter, the presiding officer was examining the ID cards of the voters, which was actually the duty of the polling officers appointed to the booth. The MLA, who reached there to vote, reported this matter to the district collector, who later asked the presiding officer to perform his duties," Vijayan said. He said in Kasaragod alone, 113 cases were registered in connection with the local body polls, 38 of which were filed by workers of Left parties and 37 by the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). Vijayan also said action would be taken against the culprits in all these cases without any political bias. Sreekumar, a leftist and also president of the Peelicode unit of the Teacher's Organisation of KAU, had accused the MLA of silencing him when he raised a dispute over bogus voting during the third phase of the local body polls on December 14. "Let the first polling officer verify and you keep mum.If you don't listen to what we say,your legs will be chopped off, the complaint, quoting the MLA threatening remarks, had said. Sreekumar had in a Facebook post alleged there were only CPI-M agents at the booth, facilitating unquestioned bogus voting. Senior Election Commission officials had said the polling officer was supposed to report incidents of bogus voting or threats, to police and Returning Officer concerned on the same day or the next day itself. The voting, which was held in three phases,was completed on December 14. the results were declared on December 16 and the Left parties secured a comfortable win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-led-opposition-stages-walkout-from-kerala-assembly-101610974708091.html
18-01-2021||India||Satellite imagery shows Chinese village in disputed region of Arunachal Pradesh||India on Monday responded cautiously to a report that China has built a village in a disputed region of Arunachal Pradesh by saying that it closely monitors all developments affecting national security and acts to safeguard territorial integrity.The external affairs ministry said the Indian government has stepped up the construction of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges, in response to China’s “construction work along the border areas”.China built a new village, consisting of 101 homes, in Arunachal Pradesh, about 4.5 km “within Indian territory of the de facto border”, NDTV reported while citing satellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US-based imaging company.The village is located on the banks of Tsari Chu river in Upper Subansiri district, an area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This was the same area where five people were detained by Chinese troops last September.Comparing two satellite images provided by Planet Labs, NDTV reported the village had been built sometime in the past 15 months. The first image, from August 26, 2019, did not show any construction activity, while the second, from November 1, 2020, depicted the village with dozens of rows of small and medium-sized structures and roads.The external affairs ministry did not address the issue of the particular village referred to in the report but said: “Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India's security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”The ministry said in a statement that India had “seen recent reports on China undertaking construction work along the border areas”. It added, “China has undertaken such infrastructure construction activity in the past several years. In response, our government too has stepped up border infrastructure including the construction of roads, bridges etc, which has provided much needed connectivity to the local population along the border.”The government is committed to creating infrastructure along border areas to improve the livelihood of citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh, the statement said.People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the existence of the village but pointed out that control over the Upper Subansiri region has been fluid for decades.China claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh as south Tibet and there are wide divergences in the perception of the border in this area. “The Chinese side doesn’t respect the McMahon Line in Arunachal Pradesh and constructs structures in areas claimed by it,” said one of the people cited above.The Indian side too has bolstered the construction of infrastructure in Arunachal Pradesh and there have been instances of local commanders holding meetings to discuss structures falling in disputed areas, the people said.Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security analyst for Force Analysis, said the village in question in Arunachal Pradesh appeared to be part of China’s recent construction activity to bolster its territorial claims all along the LAC.Tack said the village appeared to be several kilometres “inside the Indian claim” and noted that China has had a “small presence” in this area in the form of a military outpost since about 2000. “So, the Chinese presence is not necessarily new, but what is new is the building of a village to settle people in the area,” he said.“China has been preparing infrastructure on its own side for a long time but now the infrastructure is being created in disputed regions in Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Bhutan. It would appear China is applying such infrastructure to strengthen its territorial claims,” Tack said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-imagery-shows-chinese-village-in-disputed-region-of-arunachal-pradesh-101610973003146.html

18-01-2021||India||Results of Maharashtra gram panchayat polls in favour of MVA: Deputy CM Ajit Pawar||Results of Gram Panchayat elections in Maharashtra on Monday are good and in favour of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said.Speaking to reporters here, Pawar said the overall (political) picture in Maharashtra seems to be changing post the results of Legislative Council elections held last year.Of the six Legislative Council seats for which elections were held in December last year, the BJP won only one while the rest constituencies were bagged by candidates of the ruling MVA.Polling for elections to over 14,000 gram panchayats, out of the total 27,920 gram panchayats in Maharashtra, was held in 34 of the total 36 districts on January 15."As per inputs, the results of Gram Panchayat elections are good and are in favour of the MVA. Party workers of the Congress, Sena and NCP have clinched the victory. In most of these places, the Congress, NCP and Sena retained seats in their respective strongholds. I congratulate all these members for this success," Pawar said.Though the village panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, panels are fielded by political parties or local leaders.Pawar reiterated that the MVA government was running on the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) under the leadership of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.When asked about the Sena's demand for renaming Aurangabad city as Sambhajinagar and opposition by the Congress, Pawar said that any difference of opinions among the three constituents will be ironed out by their leaders."There may be a difference of opinion but we (MVA partners) have come together on the CMP. The MVA government has been running on the basis of the CMP under CM Thackeray since the last one year and will continue to run in future as well," he said.Pawar also criticised the Central government over the ongoing agitation by farmers on borders of Delhi for the repeal of three agri laws."The Centre should understand that farmers are agitating for long. Several rounds of discussions (between farmers and the government) have failed. The Centre is not taking any concrete steps which shows that it doesn't have any interest in resolving the issues of farmers, which amounts to insulting farmers," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/results-of-maharashtra-gram-panchayat-polls-in-favour-of-mva-ajit-pawar-101610971805682.html

She will be a part of the Indian Air Force's (IAF's) tableau that will showcase mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30 fighter plane. She is currently posted at an airbase in Rajasthan where she flies the MiG-21 Bison fighter plane.Kanth is also one of the first women fighter pilots in the IAF. She, along with Avani Chaturvedi and Mohana Singh, was inducted into the IAF as the first women fighter pilots in 2016. Ten women have been commissioned as fighter pilots after an experimental scheme for their induction into the IAF’s combat stream was introduced in 2015, a watershed in the air force’s history.Also read | Reaching for the sky: Meet India’s women fighter pilotsKanth, who belongs to Darbhanga in Bihar, was born and brought up in the Refinery Township, Begusarai, where her father worked as an engineer in IOCL. She did her schooling from Barauni Refinery DAV Public School and completed her bachelor of engineering in medical electronics from BMS College of Engineering in Bengaluru.She loves playing badminton, volleyball and adventure sports and is also interested in photography, cooking, swimming and travelling. After clearing Stage I training, she got the opportunity to opt for the fighter stream. Kanth had said after her induction in the IAF, while recalling her first experience of the spin solo on fighter aircraft Kiran, that as she entered the aircraft into a spin and recovered it all by herself at 20,000 feet, doubt started creeping into her mind as to what if the aircraft didn’t recover.“I told myself that if I don’t do it now, I will always be afraid of it. I spun the aircraft and to my surprise, the spin was more vicious or so it seemed. But the fighter pilot in me took over and I told myself come what may I will recover. And the aircraft recovered from spin and so did my confidence,” she had said.Also read | IAF women pilots set to fly Sukhoi-30 this monthThis year, Rafale fighter jet will also take part in the Republic Day parade for the first time.

A few days ago, Uttarakhand BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat formed a five-member committee under the leadership of Rajya Sabha member Naresh Bansal for preparing a road map for the 2022 elections. The committee will give recommendations on the issues to be taken up during campaigning and mass outreach. The five-member committee has, apart from Bansal, state BJP general secretaries Ajaey Kumar, Kuldeep Kumar, Suresh Bhatt and minister Dhan Singh Rawat. Meanwhile, the Congress is yet to bridge the rift caused by former chief minister and party national general secretary Harish Rawat asking the leadership to announce the CM face of the party for 2022 elections and remove him from the collective leadership. Rawat’s statement a few days ago has made the state leadership, including party state president Pritam Singh and leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh, uneasy as their differences are an open secret.Political experts say such differences would hurt the party’s preparations for the assembly elections. SMA Kazmi, Dehradun-based political expert who has been keeping an eye on the state’s political scenario since its formation in 2000, said, “BJP has always been miles ahead of Congress when it comes to poll preparations. Now with fresh infighting, things don’t seem to look up for the Congress for the coming elections either.”“The Congress can’t compete with BJP in terms of resources, organisational structure, planning and discipline. On top of that, their high command is very weak in comparison to that of BJP’s,” he said. “Since 2002 when ND Tiwari was the state’s first CM in the Congress government, Harish Rawat has been going in a different direction. It continued in Vijay Bahuguna’s time. Till this factionalism ends, the Congress will fail to capitalise on the current public sentiment against CM Trivendra Singh Rawat,” he said. The Congress, however, said that the party would fight unitedly in the 2022 assembly elections. “Our state in-charge Devendra Yadav has said we will be fighting under a collective leadership in the 2022 assembly polls. We are fully prepared for the elections in which the public will bring us back to power against the BJP which has done nothing in its tenure so far,” said state unit chief Pritam Singh. However, BJP state unit vice-president Devendra Bhasin said, “Congress should first put its house in order before dreaming of winning the elections. People of the state know what our government has done for them in terms of development. They are supporting us tremendously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-assembly-polls-a-yr-away-bjp-starts-prep-cong-faces-infighting-101610970133287.html
18-01-2021||India||Tandav over Tandav: About Hinduphobia, hurt sentiments, FIRs and OTT censorship||For the average OTT buff, the Amazon Prime Video political drama starring Saif Ali Khan, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub and Dimple Kapadia is pacy enough for a weekend binge. For cinema connoisseurs and critics, the series is at best mediocre and clichéd and at worst a poorly researched, hammy and forgettable show. And then there are people like the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) Kapil Mishra who have sent a legal notice to the makers of Tandav for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Hindus and Dalits and are demanding a ban on the web series.Tandav is not just limited to Kapil Mishra though. An FIR naming Amazon Prime’s India head of original content Aparna Purohit, apart from the show’s director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra, and others have also been filed in Uttar Pradesh for hurting religious sentiments. BJP leader Ram Kadam too claims to have filed a complaint at Mumbai's Ghatkopar police station against Tandav. The ministry of information and broadcasting has now purportedly summoned Amazon Prime video officials over the swiftly escalating tandav.Of course, the melee is never complete without Twitterati throwing in its lot with one side or the other. The social media platform has been flooded with messages citing similar sentiments of Hinduphobic content, anti-Hindu propaganda, disrespecting Dalits and more.Also read | Tandav row: Govt summons Amazon Prime executivesAt the heart of all the displeasure is one particular scene in the first episode of the series where actor Zeeshan Ayyub has played a stage performer appearing as Lord Shiva and is heard saying, "Azaadi, what the...?" In the same scene, the narrator on stage tells Lord Shiva that he needs to do something to improve his popularity on social media as opposed to Lord Ram. On this, Zeeshan Ayub asks whether he should come up with a new display picture. Naysayers are calling this an attempt to 'mock' and 'target' the Hindu gods.Also read | Police personnel seen stationed outside Saif's home amid Tandav rowThe controversy once again raises the age-old debate about freedom of expression versus moral policing and censorship. Frankly, without the social media chatter, the controversial Lord Shiva scene could have been a blink-and-you-miss-it moment in the web series. After all, as Hindus, we are only too used to seeing our deities dramatised and even depicted in a humorous light (Ramlila, anyone?). In fact, for decades, there seemed nothing wrong in showing our gods doing funny stuff. Hindu gods and goddesses were humanised, tolerant, friendly and approachable for that reason alone.Not anymore. Because of late, the yardstick has become Islam or Christianity. The common refrain is that this web series would have not dared to depict the Prophet in a similar vein. Is the sentiment factually correct? Yes. But is applying the Islam yardstick on Hinduism correct? Probably not, because unlike an organised religion, Hinduism is more a way of life, kept alive through generations by word-of-mouth, mythical stories and often humorous anecdotes.Also read | 'Tandav is a work of fiction, it's a piece of entertainment first': Sunil GroverBut the bigger fear due to repeated controversies involving OTT platforms revolves around possible censorship of streaming content and what form it will take. In November last year, a gazette notification brought digital audio-visual content on these platforms under the ambit of the information and broadcasting ministry. There are reports that the ministry could opt for self-regulation as the guiding principle. But the fine print is still a secret.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit 2020, Star & Disney India chairman Uday Shankar said that what mattered was the form and substance of the regulatory lens. “Do we want to be over-prescriptive or do we want to let creativity and imagination to have a role?" he had asked.Shankar added that Indian consumers are far more mature than most regulators think and do not need filters applied to everything they watch.Because watching a political drama like Tandav (however hackneyed) is perhaps a much meatier option than the banal and bad 1990s throwback Coolie No 1 streaming on these platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-over-tandav-why-amazon-s-political-drama-ignited-a-firestorm-101610969431649.html

18-01-2021||India||Shahnawaz Hussain, Mukesh Sahni set to become Bihar MLCs unopposed||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national spokesman and former Union minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni on Monday filed their nominations for bye-elections for the Bihar legislative council.Hussain is set to be elected to fill up the vacancy caused by former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi in the legislative council after his election to Rajya Sabha in December last year. Sahni, who was sworn in as the minister of animal husbandry department in the Nitish Kumar cabinet, is set to be elected to replace Vinod Narayan Jha who had won the assembly election.Both the leaders are set to be elected unopposed as no other person filed nomination against them in view of the obvious majority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state legislature. Monday was the last date of nomination. As the election will be held separately, those having a majority in the lower house would have the convincing advantage in case of voting.Officials of the state legislature said that Hussain, who was first elected to Lok Sabha in 1999 and became a minister in the Union cabinet, would serve as the MLC for a period of almost three and a half years (till May 6, 2024). Sahni, who shed his initial reluctance to become the MLC for a truncated tenure on Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention, would replace Jha in the council and thereby remain as a member of the upper house for one and half years (till July 21, 2022).Chief minister Nitish Kumar, his deputies Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi, RS member Sushil Kumar Modi, state BJP chief Sanjay Jaisawal, MLC and BJP national media in-charge Sanjay Mayukh were present at the Patna divisional office during the filing of nominations of the two leaders.Kumar congratulated both the leaders on their nominations and said that all four constituents of NDA had been working in close cooperation and would remain so in future. The CM, however, parried a reply to the journalists’ query about the much-awaited cabinet expansion.Usually, nominations for the legislative council elections are filed before the secretary of the legislative assembly, who also serves as the returning officer of the election.However, the Patna divisional commissioner was notified as the returning officer by the Election Commission of India (ECI), as the current assembly secretary Bateshwar Nath Pandey is scheduled to retire within six months.Hussain, who was re-elected to Lok Sabha twice from Bhagalpur, is believed to have been picked by the BJP to offer a formidable face in state politics after Modi was elected to the Rajya Sabha. Many senior BJP leaders said that Hussain might be inducted as a minister in Nitish Kumar’s cabinet which is expected to be expanded later this month. There is no minister from Muslim community, who constitute a sizable chunk of electors in the state.“I am a soldier of the party and willing to serve in any position the party deems fit for me,” Husain told reporters.But many opposition leaders, including Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra took a swipe at the BJP for “downgrading” Hussain’s status by nominating him for the Bihar legislative council.VIP leaders said that Sahni agreed to become the MLC for a residual term after Union minister Shah asked him to file the nomination and avoid offering fodder to the opposition.The VIP chief has been assured another berth in the council from the governor’s quota. Twelve seats in the upper house have been lying vacant for the past several months for want of recommendations from the state government.Officials of the state legislature said that both Hussain and Sahni would be declared elected unopposed on January 21, the last date for withdrawal of nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shahnawaz-hussain-mukesh-sahni-set-to-become-bihar-mlcs-unopposed-101610968940167.html

Despite failing vision and aching knees, the 103-year-old Negi exercised his franchise at the Kalpa polling booth, where he was welcomed by the district administration, who laid a red carpet for the retired school teacher.Here’s everything you need to know about Shyam Saran Singh, country’s first voter:1. Born on July 1, 1917, in Kalpa, Himachal Pradesh, Negi cast his first vote on October 25, 1951, in the first elections held in the country since the end of the British rule in 1947. Negi first voted at Chini (now called Kalpa) which is in Kinnaur, 235km northeast of the state capital of Shimla.2. Negi has voted in every general election since then and is believed to be India's oldest voter.3. Negi lived in oblivion for 45 years till the Election Commission tracked him in July 2007 when Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Manisha Nanda, first learnt about him from the photo electoral roll. M Sudha Devi, a 2003 batch IAS officer then posted as Kinnaur deputy commissioner, went to meet Negi, who was amongst the reputed village men in Kalpa. Negi told Devi that he was the first voter of Independent India and had never missed casting a vote in his entire life.4. In 2010, the then chief election commissioner of India, Navin Chawla, visited Negi's village to honour him as part of the Election Commission's diamond jubilee celebrations.5. Google India produced a public service announcement in 2014 in which Negi talked about his participation in Independent India's first election and reminded viewers of the importance of voting. The video got more views than others launched under the same campaign featuring Bollywood actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Diya Mirza and Arjun Rampal and cricketer Virender Sehwag.6. Negi was the brand ambassador of the Election Commission of India for the 2014 general election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-voter-ex-school-teacher-shyam-saran-negi-has-never-missed-an-election-101610965923188.html

The body of one child has been recovered while other child is still missing, police said on Monday. The man, who started living with the woman and her two children after her husband died two years ago, told police that he thought of the children, aged 6 and 7, as “obstacles” between him and the woman, police said. Superintendent of police, Haridwar (rural), SK Singh said, “The incident took place on Saturday evening in Haridwar district. The police were informed late in the evening that the two children were missing, following which it started searching for them.” Also Read: Uttarakhand BJP forms 5-member panel to prepare for 2022 assembly polls“The search yielded no results. An informer told police that the two children were last seen with the accused heading towards a culvert over a canal. Till then, the accused was pretending to search for the two children along with the police to mislead all. When the police nabbed and questioned him, he broke down and narrated the whole incident,” said Singh. The senior police officer said, “On Saturday around 4pm, when he was alone with the children in the house, he took them out on the pretext of visiting the canal. He pushed them into the canal and came back. Later in the evening, when the woman returned, she saw her children missing and panicked. It was then the villagers informed the police.” The man was arrested on Saturday night after he confessed to the crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-man-arrested-for-drowning-two-children-in-a-canal-101610965992642.html
18-01-2021||India||SC tells Delhi Police to decide on farmers’ Jan 26 tractor rally||Entry of farmers into Delhi is a law and order problem and any decision in this regard should be taken by the Delhi Police, said the Supreme Court on Monday. The statement was made by a three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde while hearing an application filed by Delhi Police to direct farmers not to disrupt the Republic Day celebrations in the Capital on January 26.The matter will now be heard on January 20 when the bench dealing with petitions against the farmer protests will be available. This bench, which last assembled on January 12, comprisesCJI Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. On that day, the court had stayed the implementation of the three farm laws under challenge and formed a four-member expert committee to study the concerns raised by the farmer unions and submit its recommendations to the court in eight weeks. Also read | Decoding fine print of Supreme Court order on farm lawsBefore adjourning the case, CJI said, “The question of entry (of farmers) into Delhi is a law and order problem. You (Delhi Police) are free to invoke your powers. We have told you earlier too that we cannot be the first authority to determine this. You have enough power under the Police Act to determine who should or should not be allowed entry, what terms and conditions are to be enforced and what should be the numbers.”Attorney General KK Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared in the matter for Centre. Venugopal asked the court to make that clarification in its order. He said this was necessary as the matter is being considered by the top court even as lakhs of persons gathered at Capital’s borders as part of the farmer protests want to enter Delhi. There is also the concern of a pro-Khalistani organisation allegedly trying to fund the farmer protests. On the earlier occasion on January 12, AG supported this averment raised by the Indian Kisan Union in its application before the court. It claimed that an organisation by the name of Sikhs for Justice, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement, is financing the agitation. The Delhi Police in its application further stated that no tractor rally by farmers should be allowed as such a form of protest will malign the nation globally. “The intervention by this court has been grossly misunderstood. We have not taken charge of the entire issue except one. Should the Supreme Court tell police that you have enough powers under Police Act,” said the bench on Monday. SG Mehta told the court that when the matter is taken up on Wednesday, the Centre would make detailed arguments on the dignity attached to the constitutional ceremony of Republic Day parade. In its application, the Delhi Police informed the court of the possibility of a tractor march by certain farmer unions in Delhi. The bench wished to know whether the farmer unions were also being represented in the case. One of the unions, Bhartiya Kisan Union- Lokshakti, informed the bench that it had filed response to the application of Delhi Police and wished to be given permission to hold protest at Ramlila Maidan in the Capital. Another farmer union represented by senior advocate Dushyant Dave was also present during the hearing. The bench will hear both the sides on Wednesday and could even decide on filling up vacancy created by the recusal by one of the members of the four-member Committee. Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, BKU, and All India Kisan Coordination Committee) refused to be part of the court-appointed committee ,leaving just three members on the panel -- Pramod Kumar Joshi, agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, president, Shetkari Sanghatana. BKU- Lokshakti in its response before the court demanded the removal of the remaining three members as well alleging their open bias in favour of the laws as made out by their opinions in public domain. It said, “The principle of natural justice is going to get violated by forming these persons as members of the committee...how they will hear all the farmers on equal parameters when they have already supported these three farm laws.” Instead, the farmer union requested for appointment of a former Supreme Court judge along with farm leaders of protesting farmer unions. The three laws in question, presently stayed by the top court, are -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. While staying the three legislations, the court said that this extraordinary step was being taken to encourage farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-tells-delhi-police-to-decide-on-farmers-jan-26-tractor-rally-101610965522518.html
18-01-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Cracks in unions as key leader charts own agenda||A platform of farm unions leading the ongoing agitation against a set of agricultural laws is staring at a split, with a prominent leader spelling out a separate agenda for the protests that includes talking to key political parties. Other unions say they want to keep the protests apolitical. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of nearly 400 farm organisations leading the protests, on Monday said efforts by Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni to organise an all-party meeting on the farm laws were not “authorised”and this didn’t figure in its official agenda. Also Read: ‘Farmers won’t be scared’: Bhupesh Baghel on BJP ‘maligning’ farm laws stirThe farm unions are on a strike since November to demand the scrapping of three pro-reform farm laws they say will hurt their livelihoods, setting off a key political challenge to the Modi government. A team of 41 representatives of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has been participating in negotiations with the Union government, represented by Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash. Chaduni has been a part of this team. Farmers want three farm laws approved by Parliament in September repealed but the government has rejected the demand. Nine rounds of talks so far have failed to break the deadlock. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha disassociates itself from the activities of Gurnam Singh Chaduni. His decision for an all-party meeting was never approved or authorised. It is his personal activity,” Hannan Mollah, a key member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s “general body” said. Mollah said all protest activities and agenda related to the movement against farm laws could only be executed after being unanimously passed by the working committee of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. Chaduni told HT that he would make his stand clear before the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, declining to elaborate, referring this reporter to his spokesperson. Chaduni’s spokesperson Sandeep Topra said Chaduni had not violated any protocol of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “If political parties reach out and come to Chaduni for a meeting, how can he say no? He hasn’t shared any stage with political parties.” According to Mollah, farm unions had unanimously decided to keep their agitation “apolitical” and therefore Chaduni’s move was “not acceptable”. On January 17, Chaduni, who is an influential farm leader in Haryana and Punjab, had met leaders of the opposition parties, including the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal in Delhi in an attempt to forge a larger political alliance against the farm laws. “The Samyukt Kisan Morcha is not associated with the ‘all-party meeting’ taken up by Mr Chaduni with political parties,” the farm unions’ platform said in a statement on Monday.The statement also said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha would “inquire” into matter and say what further steps it would take in three days. The government has pushed three agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming. Tens of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi’s border points say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cracks-in-farm-unions-as-key-leader-charts-own-agenda-101610963472637.html

18-01-2021||India||Most airline passengers complained of non-refunds during lockdown: DGCA||While Indians have gradually resumed air travel, a sizeable number of travellers is still struggling to get a refund for their booked air tickets during lockdown. According to a Directorate of General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) report, 61.4% passengers in December complained of issues surrounding refunds. These complaints were largely against national carrier Air India followed by SpiceJet and TruJet. This is despite the Supreme Court’s order to refund all passengers who booked tickets during the lockdown period last year. Jay Bhatia, vice-president of Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), said, “Air India is refunding the monies through travel agents, but the progress is very slow. Presently immediate refunds are getting processed on our global distribution system (GDS) only below the value of our weekly sales. As regards to SpiceJet, refunds for groups and series of agents is being processed slowly and we are confident that the same shall be settled by the end of this month. Our members had major concerns with GoAir but the airline has assured it would refund all monies by January-end.”Air India, on January 7, 2021, opened automated refunds of air tickets for 24 hours. The airline had specified that it opened the refunded tickets covered under the Supreme Court judgement through travelport and amadeus (computer reservation systems for tourism industry).

The number of passengers, however, fell 43.7% from December 2019.DGCA, in its affidavit to the Supreme Court in September 2020, had stated that tickets booked for domestic and international carriers between March 25 and May 3 will be fully refunded within 15 days. DGCA’s affidavit also stated that “If on account of financial distress, if the airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected. This credit shell shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket.” DGCA affidavit also stated that passengers will be able to use the credit shell up to March 31, 2021 and change the flight sector. This means that a passenger booked on a Mumbai- Indore flight can change his/ her sector and fly to any other destination till March 2021.All this was highlighted after an order was issued by the Supreme Court on June 13, 2020 asking private airlines and the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) to find a way to refund the airfare of passengers whose flights were cancelled during the lockdown. It was then that meetings were held with all the stakeholders in July and it was decided that tickets booked directly by passengers during lockdown would be fully refunded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-airline-passengers-complained-of-non-refunds-during-lockdown-dgca-101610958253081.html

Both the parties are offshoots of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests that rocked the state in December 2019 and claimed five lives. While AJP was launched by student organisations All Assam Students Union and Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, RD was formed by Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, a farmers’ body led by activist Akhil Gogoi who is in jail since December 2019 for his role in the anti-CAA protests. On Sunday, RD officially sent a letter to AJP seeking an alliance to form a regional front against BJP and other national parties like the Congress. “We have sent an official letter to AJP for an alliance. The letter has been received by AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi. We urge them to give the matter topmost priority so that we can meet and discuss issues soon,” RD’s working president Bhasco De Saikia told journalists. He expressed confidence that RD chief Akhil Gogoi would soon be released from jail to lead the party’s poll campaign. Gogoi is likely to contest from the Sivasagar and Teok assembly seats. “We have already indicated that there would be an alliance among regional parties, including ours and RD, even if there’s no official letter. We will soon have talks and take the process forward,” AJP president Gogoi told journalists on Sunday. He stated that AJP would have to alliance with opposition Congress and appealed to all regional parties without any communal agenda to join forces and defeat the ruling BJP. Meanwhile, BJP is likely to continue its alliance with Asom Gana Parishad and have a new tie-up with United Peoples’ Party Liberal, which is leading the ruling coalition in Bodoland Territorial Council. On the other hand, the Congress, which lost two of its sitting MLAs to BJP last month, is yet to formalise its alliance with All India United Democratic Front or finalise seat-sharing arrangements with any regional outfit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regional-parties-ajp-raijor-dal-inch-closer-to-alliance-for-assam-assembly-polls-101610958251968.html

But from today, we will observe National Road Safety Month. Seventy per cent of deaths are in the age group of 18-45 years," Gadkari said in his address.There is a need to save lives in India where 415 people are dying every day due to road accidents, he added.Gadkari said that last year, the Indian government had participated in a conference in Sweden, where a vision was conceptualised - to have zero road fatalities in India by 2030."We had promised to reduce such fatalities by 50 per cent. Tamil Nadu has done it, with a success rate of 53 per cent. If we wait till 2030, 6-7 lakh more people will die. So, we've made a commitment that before 2025, road accidents and deaths due to it will be brought down by 50 per cent with help of people's participation," Gadkari said.The minister also called for cooperation among government departments, NGOs and other organisations to ensure awareness about road safety is spread.He also gave details about his ministry has increased the target of per day construction of roads. "We have achieved the target of constructing 30 kilometres of road, I believe that by the end of March, perhaps we will achieve the target of constructing 40 kilometres of road per day," the Union minister said."World Bank and ADB (Asian Development Bank) approved two projects worth ₹7000 crore each. We'll receive approval from finance ministry soon. So, we'll spend ₹14,000 crore to improve black spots - death traps - on roads," Gadkari added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister VK Singh and chief executive officer (CEO) of Niti Aayog Amitabh Kant were also present on the occasion.The commemoration of Road Safety Month marks the road transport and highways ministry's commitment for making roads safer for all the road users, according to a government statement.The road transport and highways ministry said that the event is organised throughout the country to create awareness among general public and specially amongst the youth to improve safety on roads.Various activities like display of banners, walkathons, road signage and pamphlets will be carried out and used to increase awareness about road safety.Different departments of state governments like transport, police, PWD, health, education, municipal bodies, as well as vehicle manufacturers and dealers, doctors, PSUs, corporate and various NGOs would be participating in events during the month, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-save-lives-in-india-gadkari-inaugurates-road-safety-month-101610957794715.html
18-01-2021||India||Bengali actor’s 2015 tweet hurt my religious sentiments: BJP leader||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former governor of Tripura and Meghalaya Tathagata Roy has filed a complaint against Bengali actor Saayoni Ghosh accusing her of hurting his religious sentiments. “I am a regular user of the social media Twitter. Today I found on this media that one Saayoni Ghosh, address unknown, believed to be an actress in Bengali Tv serials, has posted a picture of a woman putting a condom on a Shivalinga,” Roy wrote in his police complaint. The complaint was lodged with the Rabindra Sarobar police station in Kolkata on January 16. He also uploaded the complaint letter on social media on the same day. “The enclosed picture has seriously insulted my religious beliefs. This is an offence under Section 295A of the India Penal Code among other laws,” he wrote in the complaint. Also Read: Schools in Bengal will reopen at appropriate time: Partha ChatterjeeGhosh later deleted it saying that the “obnoxious tweet” from 2015 was uploaded without her knowledge. She tweeted: “I had previously mentioned that this obnoxious tweet from 2015 was uploaded without my knowledge. And the moment I was made aware of that I criticised it and deleted it immediately after informing the public. I never had any intention to hurt the sentiment of my religion.” A senior officer of the police station said that they were looking into the complaint. “The tweet dates back to 2015. The complaint could have been lodged in 2015 had it hurt religious sentiments. But the reason behind lodging the complaint now is clear and simple. The BJP won’t tolerate if anyone raises his or her voice against the party and will brand the person as anti-National or anti-Hindu,” said Kaushik Sen, an actor and director. Ghosh, in a recent discussion on a vernacular media channel, had said that “Jai Shri Ram” should not be used to taunt anybody or frighten anybody. She had said that it was Lord Ram’s name and should be pronounced and said with love.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengali-actor-s-2015-tweet-hurt-my-religious-sentiments-bjp-leader-101610957113719.html
18-01-2021||India||After Saudi Arabia, UAE could seek early repayment of loan to Pakistan||Months after Saudi Arabia had sought the early repayment of a $3 billion loan, Pakistan is facing the possibility of a similar move by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at a time when the country is grappling with economic difficulties. Saudi Arabia had provided Pakistan a $6.2 billion financial support package in 2018 shortly after Imran Khan became the prime minister – a $3 billion loan and a $3.2 billion deferred oil financing facility. Following a sharp downturn in bilateral ties after Pakistan sought to form an alternative Muslim coalition with Turkey and Malaysia, Saudi Arabia initially withdrew the arrangement for deferred payments for oil purchases and then asked Pakistan last year to repay the loan. As Pakistan prepares to pay the third and final tranche of $1 billion for the Saudi loan, the country is now facing the possibility that the UAE too could seek the early repayment of a $3 billion financial support package announced in December 2018. Also read | Biden has already calmed the Middle EastThe UAE hasn’t indicated whether it will extend a $1 billion loan – part of the $3 billion package – that will become payable on January 24, The Express Tribune newspaper reported, citing sources in Pakistan’s finance minister. The loan can be extended for a year. “In case [the UAE] does not withdraw the facility, the loan would be considered extended for one more year,” a senior unnamed official of Pakistan’s finance ministry said. The ministry didn’t comment on the matter, saying it was a “bilateral confidential matter”. However, the Tribune reported that the Pakistan government is “apprehensive that after Saudi Arabia’s decision to withdraw its bailout package, the UAE might also follow suit”. The UAE had also announced a $3 billion facility for deferred oil payments for Pakistan but later withdrew the facility. As its economic woes mount, Pakistan has turned to its “iron brother” ally, China, for financial support. Pakistan has so far taken three loans from China to repay the $3-billion loan from the Saudi, the Tribune reported. “Beijing gave $1 billion soft loan and two separate financing lines of $1.5 billion and $500 million to pay back the Saudi debt,” the newspaper reported. Khan had travelled to Saudi Arabia twice soon after becoming the premier to secure the financial support package, which allowed his government to negotiate a bailout with the International Monetary Fund. Khan’s government has failed in its efforts to get the suspended $6 billion IMF programme restored. It still has to fulfil key conditions set by IMF, such as introducing a mini-budget and hiking electricity tariffs. According to reports, Pakistan’s central bank’s foreign exchange reserves of $13.4 billion remain fragile, as these largely consist of loans. Short-term loans taken from commercial banks amounted to $4.6 billion as of last November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-saudi-arabia-uae-could-seek-early-repayment-of-loan-to-pakistan-101610957111854.html
18-01-2021||India||Employee union at GM Motors opposes closure of Telgaon plant, moves court||The employee union at American automobile major General Motors’ Indian plant has moved the Bombay High Court questioning the application filed by the company with the Maharashtra labour department for closure of their plant at Talegaon in Pune district that it has sold to Great Wall Motors (GMW), China's biggest SUV and pick-up manufacturer.It alleged that after January 2020, employees of the company were forced and coerced to accept a voluntary retirement scheme, which the union claimed was not fair and equitable. Total 1,587 employees work at the plant.The petitioner union has opposed the November 20, 2020 closure application on several grounds, and has sought a direction to the Maharashtra government to decide it before expiry of the 60-day period, after which deemed permission for closure will be granted in favour of the company.In the petition, filed through advocate Rahul Kamerkar, the union has said that sometimes in January 2020 reports started emerging that General Motors was being sold to the Chinese auto giant. Thereafter, the petition said the company put up a notice informing its employees that its "legal entity" was being sold to GMW, without clarifying as to what the term "legal entity" meant.“The application for closure is infructuous as the establishment sought to be closed has already been sold," states the petition."On the other hand, the company says that only the Talegaon plant has been sold. If this is the case then the application for closure is clearly unjust and not in public interest as it is being made only to throw the workers on the streets after first selling the establishment where they are working," it adds.The union has further contended that there were no such financial exigencies in the recent past as would justify a closure and alleged that the company wants to sell the land, plant and machinery to GWM for a hefty profit. It also alleged that GWM was not willing to take responsibility for the workers, they are now trying to get rid of them.It added that the government has given General Motors various concessions and subsidies in acquisition of this land, plant and machinery and it was neither in public interest nor in the interest of workers that the company should be allowed to throw the workers into the streets only to facilitate the sale of the land, plant and machinery.Advocate Kamerkar said the petition is likely to come up for hearing before a bench comprising justice Kamalkishor Tated and justice Riyaz Chagla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/employee-union-at-gm-motors-opposes-closure-of-telgaon-plant-moves-court-101610956724858.html

18-01-2021||India||Ambani, Adani caught in crossfire over farm laws in India||Two of India’s richest men have landed in an unlikely controversy over farming laws, becoming targets of protesters who allege the tycoons have benefited from their close links to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.For weeks, tens of thousands of farmers have camped outside the nation’s capital, demanding the withdrawal of recently passed legislation they say, without evidence, was designed to allow billionaires such as Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani to enter farming. The tycoons say they have no such interest. More than 1,500 phone towers of Ambani’s wireless carrier were vandalized last month and some farmers called for a boycott of their businesses.The fight between the government and the farmers has revived the debate on what Modi’s critics call cozy nexus between the magnates and the popular leader -- accusations they all have denied. The protests, one of Modi’s toughest political challenges yet, follow an eventful 2020 when the combined fortunes of Ambani and Adani swelled by almost $41 billion, even as millions of Indians lost their jobs to the pandemic that pummeled the $2.9 trillion economy.“Everyone loves to hate the rich in times of economic stress,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, a director at investment management firm IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “People are venting out their anger at social disparity. It is indeed a new business risk to these large conglomerates. But all the noise will settle when the economy starts growing.”Highlighting the disparity, an Oxfam report in January 2020 said India’s richest 1% hold over four times the wealth of 953 million people who make up the poorest 70% of the country’s population. The wealth of the nation’s top nine billionaires is equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 50% of the population, according to the non-profit body that works against inequality.‘Suit-Boot’The new farm legislation, passed in September, will allow private companies to buy produce directly from farmers, moving from the decades-old system of state-run wholesale buyers and markets that guaranteed a minimum support price. India’s top court last week barred the implementation of the law until the court decides on the matter.Farmers, mostly from the northern state of Punjab, fear that the removal of state support will make them vulnerable to market-driven price fluctuations despite government assurances that a safety net of minimum support prices will continue. About 800 million of the country’s over 1.3 billion people depend directly or indirectly on agriculture, giving the group political clout.Modi, who won a second consecutive five-year term in 2019 with an even bigger majority, has tweeted several times to allay concerns, saying the new laws will cut out middlemen, make farmers more prosperous and India self-reliant.Still, Modi risks letting this political headache snowball into a serious threat. After calling his administration years back as a “suit-boot ki sarkar” -- meaning a government that favors the business elite over the poor -- opposition parties are seizing the opportunity to hit out at him.Responding to the accusations, Ambani’s $174 billion conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. issued a statement earlier this month saying it has never done any contract farming or acquired farm land for that purpose, and has no plans to do so. It also vowed to ensure its suppliers will pay government-mandated minimum prices to farmers. The Adani Group clarified in a statement last month that it does not buy food grains from farmers or influence prices.Spokespersons for the Reliance and Adani groups did not respond to emails seeking comment on protesters’ allegations or on India’s wealth disparity. Representatives for the Modi administration and the Prime Minister’s Office in New Delhi didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.Both Adani and Ambani hail from the western Indian state of Gujarat, just like Modi, who served as the state’s chief for over a decade. Both the tycoons have repeatedly aligned their business strategies to Modi’s nation-building initiatives.About two decades ago, Adani cemented his ties to Modi by publicly backing him when a crisis threatened to end the rising politician’s career. Modi was under attack by rivals and businessmen who accused him of failing to prevent bloody sectarian riots in his home state in 2002. Adani created a rival regional industry lobby and helped kick off a biannual global investment summit in Gujarat in 2003 that boosted Modi’s pro-business credentials.Like South Korea’s famed chaebol, Indian conglomerates have been at the forefront of India’s economic growth, especially since a currency crisis forced the government in 1991 to review decades of Soviet-style planning. The modest reforms kicked off three decades ago started allowing private investment in sectors that were mostly controlled by the government. With strained state finances, the capital-starved economy has looked more and more to these tycoons for investments and jobs.‘Gilded Age’Ambani spent most of 2020 raising $27 billion in equity investments -- a record for India -- for his technology and retail businesses from investors including Google and Facebook Inc. He has spelled out an ambitious plan to build these units into a powerful local e-commerce rival to Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. The Adani group, which started off as a commodities trader in 1988, has grown rapidly to become India’s top private-sector port operator and power generator.“India’s position is similar to America’s Gilded Age, with Ambani and Adani like the modern day Rockefellers and Vanderbilts in the second half of the 19th century,” said James Crabtree, author of The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India’s New Gilded Age.During the so-called Gilded Age, the U.S. saw rapid growth and industrialization, helmed mostly by a clutch of powerful business families. But this also led to worsening inequality that sparked labor unrest and railroad strikes. The U.S. government eventually stepped in.Right Model?To be fair, many East Asian nations have followed this developmental path of relying on their “favorite tycoons for nation-building,” Crabtree said, but they were mostly autocratic regimes. “The questions for India are: is this the right model, and can India even pull it off?”The farmers who are protesting are worried by the scale of the ambitions the two tycoons have. They are pressing for the laws to be withdrawn and demanding a guaranteed minimum support price for their produce.“Farmers think these two big corporate houses have links with the power center of India and they have become symbols of crony capitalism,” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the Krantikari Kisan Union from Punjab.Separately, Adani’s bid for an airport lease is facing opposition after the local government in the southern state of Kerala challenged it legally. A state minister said last year that Adani winning the bid was “an act of brazen cronyism.”In an Indian court, the Adani group rejected the allegations and said it won the bid through a competitive process. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Kerala’s appeal soon, after a lower court ruled in Adani’s favor.As a result of the protests, many retail stores of Reliance have remained shut for months in Punjab, causing millions of dollars in losses. Appealing to the Punjab government last month, Reliance sought protection for its infrastructure and workers, according to a letter seen by Bloomberg News, the contents of which were confirmed by a company spokesman. The conglomerate has also approached a court for remedy.“As long as the gap in income and opportunity is not significantly narrowed via state policy, we can expect those at the top of the pyramid inviting the ire of the growing base of unfair and unequal India,” said Nikita Sud, who teaches international development at the University of Oxford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambani-adani-caught-in-crossfire-over-farm-laws-in-india-101610955813506.html

18-01-2021||India||Drugs case: Maharashtra cabinet minister's son-in-law Sameer Khan sent to 14-day judicial custody||A magistrate court in Mumbai sent Sameer Khan, the son-in-law of Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik to judicial custody for 14 days in connection with a drugs case, news agency ANI reported on Monday.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested Khan on January 13 in the drugs case in which several high-profile personalities, including actors, have been named. His NCB remand is ending today.The prosecutor had said that NCB had found evidence from Khan regarding some chats indicating that he was planning to mix CBD oil and other chemicals with marijuana. He also said that there were multiple transactions amounting more than ₹20,000 by Khan. "Khan was involved in the commercial activity of drugs so we have invoked 27A of the NDPS Act (Punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) act against him," NCB prosecutor said as per ANI.Malik is the cabinet minister under the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra. He is also a spokesperson and Mumbai president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which is a part of the government. Following Khan's arrest, Malik on January 14 had tweeted: "Nobody is above the law and it should be applied without any discrimination. Law will take its due course and justice will prevail. I respect and have immense faith in our judiciary."Meanwhile, the NCB also detained a foreign national from a five-star hotel in Mumbai. As per the NCB, the man swallowed a powder-like substance which is suspected to be cocaine. This input was given to the investigating agency by UK national Karan Sajnani, who was arrested on Saturday after 200 kilograms of cannabis and other drugs were seized from his possession.Sajnani was arrested along with Rahila Furniturewala, ex-manager of a Bollywood actress, and her sister Shaista Furniturewala. Recently, Mumbai's renowned 'Muchhad Paanwala' was also arrested in connection with the drug case. Arjun Rampal and his sister Komal were also interrogated by the NCB in Mumbai, regarding the same case.Rampal was questioned by the NCB on November 13, after raids were conducted at his residence on November 9. His girlfriend Gabriella Demetriades was later questioned for six hours on the same day.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drugs-case-maharashtra-cabinet-minister-s-son-in-law-sameer-khan-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-101610954597307.html
18-01-2021||India||Goa government to form panel to identify new land for IIT||The Goa government will form a committee to identify alternative land to set up the IIT campus this time to ensure that the fiasco of villager protests over an identified land does not repeat itself, chief minister Pramod Sawant has said. “We have not decided where to shift it yet. The government may form a four to five member committee consisting of educationists, IIT officials and others for verification. We do not want such a problem again,” Sawant told reporters on the sidelines of a function in Margao in South Goa. “The IIT should have a base in Goa. The government is serious about it. The committee will examine location options and the government will take a final decision then,” he added. Late last week, following sustained protests that only gathered in size with neighbouring villages pitching in to support the villagers of Melaulim who were protesting against the IIT for the past six months, Sawant relented and said IIT would be shifted elsewhere ‘respecting the views of the people.’ The decision capped more than six months of protests, largely by Malaulim villagers who had refused to concede land in their village and had set up a blockade at the entrance to the site refusing to allow government surveyors to demarcate the land.There were violent clashes in early January between villagers and Goa Police, resulting in injuries on both sides. In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 10 lakh sq. mts land in Melaulim village in North Goa, for setting up of IIT. IIT Goa has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College since 2014.Two other sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were also scrapped in the face of protests from local residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-government-to-form-panel-to-identify-new-land-for-iit-101610955191571.html
18-01-2021||India||Shiv Sena seeks action against Arnab over leaked WhatsApp chat||Shiv Sena attacked the Centre over the leaked WhatsApp chat of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, saying it’s a breach of country’s internal security and demanded action against the TV journalist.The purported WhatsApp conversation between Goswami and then Broadcast Audience Research Council chief executive Partho Dasgupta show that the former was apparently privy to the Modi government’s plan to launch an air strike on Pakistan’s Balakot in retaliation against the Pulwama terror attack, three days before the Indian Air Force bombed the terrorist camp on February 26, 2019. Claiming the chats are a threat to national security, Sena leader and party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “I think this is a threat to country’s internal security. Sometimes, such military secrets are not known to top officials. If a jawan is found to possess any such secrets or documents, he is court-martialled.

Union home minister Amit Shah, Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat, chief minister Vijay Rupani and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri were also present on the occasion.PM Modi said that this marks the commencement of infrastructure worth ₹17,000 crore. “Ahmedabad and Surat are receiving very important gifts today. Metro will further strengthen the connectivity in what are two major business centres of the country,” the Prime Minister said. The rapid expansion of metro network in India in recent years shows the gulf between the work done by our government and the previous ones, he further said.Highlighting the work done by his government, PM Modi said that work is currently underway in 27 cities across the country on more than 1,000 km of metro network. “Before 2014, only 225 km of metro line were operational while over 450 km became operational in the last six years,” he said.Talking about Surat, PM Modi said while it is the eighth-largest city in the country by population, it is also the fourth most-rapidly developing city in the world. Surat is also the second cleanest city in India, he remarked, adding that the city is a great example of “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat,” and that a “Mini-India” has come up in the city.On state capital Gandhinagar, he said it has undergone a major “image change” in recent years, going from a city known for government services to one which now has a significant presence of youth. As an example, the prime minister mentioned names of various universities in the city. PM Modi also cited various projects to highlight how Gujarat has progressed, and also made a mention of the world’s largest drive vaccination drive against Covid-19, which began in India on Saturday.PM Modi named PRAGATI as a project that doesn’t get the recognition it deserves, mentioning how he himself interacts with various stakeholders through the platform.Ahmedabad Metro’s Phase-II is 28.25 km long, with two corridors. While Corridor-1 is 22.8 km long and connects Motera Stadium and Mahatma Mandir, Corridor-2 is 5.4 km long and connects Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) and Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City.Meanwhile, Surat Metro Project is 40.35 km long and comprises two corridors as well.

The facilities were provided by the principal secretary of the animal husbandry department through the PMMSY scheme.”Spread over 20 hectares, the farm was set up 36 years ago with support from the European Economic Committee. It started with a single hatchery which has now been upgraded to three hatcheries that supply millions of eyed ova and seeds to beneficiaries, including private fish farmers.Bazaz said that Kashmir has two types of fisheries, warm and cold water. “For trout culture, the temperature shouldn’t exceed 20 degrees Celsius. Brown trouts are in abundance in the upper reaches,” he says.Kashmir is also known as an anglers’ paradise—tourists, particularly foreigners, head for high-altitude water bodies as brown trout is found in high-altitude lakes and streams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500k-trout-ova-dispatched-from-kashmir-to-3-other-states-for-rearing-101610950691659.html

18-01-2021||India||Supreme Court hearing on farmers’ tractor rally on R-Day today||The Supreme Court will be taking up an application filed by the Delhi Police to stop farmer unions from causing any disruption to the Republic Day celebrations in the Capital on Monday. The application will be heard by a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran. The court had issued a notice on the application on January 12, the day when the three farm laws under challenge were stayed and a committee of four experts, formed to hear the concerns of the farmer unions along with the government’s response. The committee was asked to submit its recommendations in eight weeks. Also Read: Farm stir, leadership crisis in Punjab unit pose twin challenges for BJPThe committee initially comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bharatiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana). However, two days after the Supreme Court order last week, Mann refused to be part of the committee and withdrew from the proceedings, which are to begin from January 22. An affidavit filed by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Lokshakti demanding the removal of the remaining three members as well will be considered by the court on Monday too. During the earlier hearing, the court had asked the Centre to verify if pro-Khalistani groups were present at the protest being held by farmer unions at Delhi’s borders. This allegation was made by Indian Kisan Union in an application moved before the top court. This union claimed that an organisation by name “Sikhs for Justice”, which is banned for the anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. The bench had asked Attorney General KK Venugopal if this was true. Venugopal supported this averment but sought permission of the court to file an affidavit based on inputs received from Intelligence Bureau. Other petitions demanding the protesting farmers to vacate the border roads and continue at designated protest sites in the Capital instead are also listed before the court. With news reports claiming that certain farmer unions will be taking out a tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day, the Centre will be pressing for a stay against any such move. The Delhi Police, in its application seeking injunction against the farmers’ proposed tractor rally, told the court that the right to protest can never include maligning the nation globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-rule-on-plea-for-stay-on-farmers-tractor-rally-today-101610944870516.html

Our experts were working on it. Till late on Sunday night, they were facing difficulty in session allocation, listing of beneficiaries and sending of SMS through the software,” said a top official of the state health department. Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) app, a mobile application, was developed to monitor the progress of the nationwide vaccination program launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. On the first day, the vaccination drive had hit a hurdle after the app slowed down because of glitches.Also Read: Co-WIN: Everything to know about the app behind India’s Covid-19 vaccine programme “As SMSes were not going we had to call up the people who were to receive the vaccine individually, and ask them to report on time. The data about beneficiaries had to be entered manually on paper as the app was not opening. Sometimes we could not log in and sometimes the app was too slow even after logging in,” said an official of Canning sub-divisional hospital in South 24 Parganas. More than 20,600 healthcare workers are likely to be vaccinated on the second day of the drive on Monday across 207 centres. “Officials have been asked to focus on two districts - Diamond Harbour and Nadia - as they had registered less than 50% turnout on the first day,” said a senior official. According to the West Bengal government, at least 15,707 people were vaccinated on the first day against a target of 20,700 people. The union health ministry in its tweet had however claimed that only 9,730 people were vaccinated in the state. The state had challenged the centre’s claim. Out of the 15,707 persons who received the vaccine, 14 persons had developed Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI). The condition of one nurse had turned serious, and she was later said to be stable. Meanwhile, a war of words broke out between the ruling Trinamool Congerss and the Bharatiya Janata Party after at least two legislators of the TMC received the vaccine on the first day along with health workers.While chief minister Mamata Banerjee had requested the centre to send adequate supply of vaccines and said that the state was ready to bear the cost, the BJP said that the vaccines fell short because TMC leaders were taking it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-co-win-hurdle-continues-to-plague-covid-vaccination-drive-101610942830457.html

18-01-2021||India||Adverse events post Covid-19 immunisation: Here’s all you need to know||India on Saturday launched world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive. Close to 250,000 healthcare workers were immunised on day one, of which 447 suffered adverse event following immunisation (AEFI). Three needed hospitalisation. While it is being investigated in detail what caused the adverse reaction, here is a look at what World Health Organisation (WHO) defines as AEFI, and all other the terms associated with it.*Vaccine: A biological preparation that elicits immunity to a particular disease. In addition to the antigen, it can contain multiple components, such as adjuvants, preservatives, and stabilisers, each of which may have specific safety implications.*Immunisation: Immunisation is the process whereby a person is made immune or resistant to an infection, typically by the administration of a vaccine. Vaccines stimulate the body’s own immune system to protect the person against subsequent infection.Also read: 10 Indian states with the highest Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries*Adverse event following immunisation (AEFI): Any untoward medical event that follows immunisation and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease.*Non-serious AEFI: An event that is not serious and does not pose a potential risk to the health of the recipient. Non-serious AEFIs should also be carefully monitored because they may signal a potentially larger problem with the vaccine or vaccination or have an impact on the vaccination acceptability, in general.*Serious AEFI: An event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Any medical event that requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above may also be considered as serious.*Severe vaccine reaction: Vaccine reactions can be mild, moderate or severe.

18-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Key meeting likely today on future course of efforts||India could see more efforts to vaccinate its population against the coronavirus disease as the government plans on holding a meeting with representatives of pharmaceutical industries and other stakeholders on Monday, news agency ANI reported.The government officials are likely to hold a meeting with representatives of pharmaceutical industries along with other stakeholders to discuss the subsequent course of vaccination drive in the country, the report added.More than 2.24 lakh people have been vaccinated against the disease till now, which has infected more than 10.5 million people in the country and claimed at least 150,000 lives.The government has kept a tab on the ongoing inoculation drive with all states and union territories to review progress, identify bottlenecks and planned corrective actions, the ministry said.Plans drawn up by India’s health ministry outline steps to vaccinate 300 million people in the first stage.In the initial round, 30 million health care and frontline workers - such as the police and defense forces - will be administered the injections. The second phase is targeted at about 270 million people above the age of 50 and those at particular risk to Covid. The process will draw on existing networks used to vaccinate tens of millions of babies each year against diseases such as polio.The Union health ministry official said that the Centre has advised states to keep vaccination sessions four days in a week to avoid disruption of routine health services.While all states participated in the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday, only six states did so on Sunday. In all, 17,072 more health care workers were vaccinated on Sunday at 553 sites.The six that conducted vaccinations on Sunday are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur and Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-key-meeting-likely-today-on-future-course-of-efforts-101610929332154.html

18-01-2021||India||Farm stir, leadership crisis in Punjab unit pose twin challenges for BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab is facing the twin challenges of having to counter the opposition’s allegations that the new agricultural laws are anti-farmer and seek to benefit corporate entities and to ensure that the strife-ridden state unit works cohesively.A section of farmers in Punjab and Haryana are protesting the farm laws. They are seeking a repeal of the three farm laws which they allege will hurt their incomes, erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of agribusinesses.According to functionaries aware of the details, the friction within the Punjab unit of the BJP has increased with many members seeking an overhaul that would include a new leadership. In January last year, Ashwani Sharma, a former legislator from Pathankot, was appointed president of state unit.One senior state functionary who was in Delhi recently to meet party chief JP Nadda said the state unit has been “leaderless and faceless”. “For long the party has played second fiddle to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The alliance did not allow the BJP to expand its footprint in the rural areas. Even when the party cadre wanted to break the alliance with the SAD, the central leadership did not respond. Now there is a leadership crisis and this has been conveyed to the top,” said the functionary, requesting anonymity.SAD walked out of the NDA over the passage of the farm laws in September.The person quoted above blamed the friction and groups within the state unit for allowing the farm agitation to drag on. “Initially two senior leaders, Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjit Singh Grewal, were deputed to have meetings with the farmers to end the deadlock. A meeting scheduled almost two months ago between the agitating farm leaders and the union agriculture minister was cancelled at the last minute because of differences in state unit. This when Jyani was made chair of a five-member committee to talk to farmers,” the first functionary said. While Jyani could not be reached for a comment, Grewal declined to speak, but said the meetings aimed at apprising the central leaders of the situation on the ground.A second functionary said the party’s expansion and consolidation in the state appears difficult in the absence of a “Sikh face” and leaders who have clout within the state’s scheduled caste population. “There is a need to have leaders in the forefront who have ties with the SC community. Other opposition parties have been wooing the SCs,” the second person said.A third Delhi-based functionary said, “The field is now open to the extreme left and its impact will be seen particularly in Taran Taran, Amritsar in the Sangrur-Barnala belt...”Professor Pramod Kumar, director of Chandigarh-based Institute for Development and Communication, said, “The party needs to clarify what is its vision, ideology, its economic and political agenda for the state. Bringing a face alone cannot absolve the party of its lack of agenda or vision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-leadership-crisis-in-punjab-unit-pose-twin-challenges-for-bjp-101610925847388.html
18-01-2021||India||Has Goa become moral compass for the world?||The Government of Goa has done the sensible thing by withdrawing plans to set up an IIT Goa in the cashew growing Melauli village, at the Western Ghats.And the local people have done well by protesting and bringing attention to their life-style choices. Both deserve congratulations, although one waits to see what happens to the IIT project.These events are not just local governance-they are the Indian parables for our climate-change stricken era, the moral compass of our tired times.The year 2020 was not only marked by Covid-19. It was also the hottest year recorded, according to NASA. It is climate change that is at play-swifter and harsher than we collectively realized.In this context, Goa’s collective decision not to build the Indian Institute of Technology bears a profound lesson for the world.If you’ve been following the discussions, one of the constant refrains is of the villagers wanting to tend their land, their cashew plantations.They don’t want potentially well-paying jobs working at IIT, they don’t want to leave agriculture. They want to nurture the land. They want to continue belonging to the land, the water, the forests. They are asking to live a low carbon footprint.Globally, we have much to learn from the people of Melauli-morally and economically, if we want to fight climate change with any success.Profession apart, by protecting the world’s biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats, they could prevent extinctions, potential floods and the full impact of freak weather events. We are all beneficiaries. Let’s give them a high five.(The writer is Founder and Director, Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-goa-become-moral-compass-for-the-world-101610925349197.html
18-01-2021||India||Centre planning scheme to push for production, export of drones||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), in a first-of-its-kind policy, plans to offer a major boost to the manufacturing and export of drones and robots, putting on the table production-linked incentives (PLIs), people familiar with the matter said.India ranks low globally when it comes to production of drones and robots, and the country’s drone regulatory policy is still a work in progress. The policy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) falls under the purview of the ministry of civil aviation, and will spell out who can fly a drone, in which places and with what kind of payload. The scheme to push production of robotics and drones will be rolled out with PLIs on the lines of those offered to mobile handset makers, the people cited in the first instance said.The government in October cleared 16 proposals by domestic and international companies entailing investment of Rs.11,000 crore under the PLI scheme to manufacture mobile phones worth Rs.10.5 lakh crore over the next five years. “The mobile phone PLI aims to create approximately $8 billion production per players, with overall $150 million incentives given out over five years,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “Similarly, for drones and robotics, the tally will be at least $2 billion production per player.” The person mentioned above added that the market for drones and robotics was still an emerging one and the scheme will help India capture a foothold in the global market.The PLIs for drones and robots will be the fourth set of incentives offered by MeitY, which rolled out similar schemes for manufacturers of laptops and tablets, and other electronic components such as wearables and headphones.A second person familiar with the matter said demand for robotics and drones is potentially huge, with companies such as Amazon Inc. investing heavily in UAVs. “All delivery services will have to reorient themselves to accommodate the new technology,” the second person said. According to experts, while India has capabilities in Artificial Intelligence (AI ) and robotics, it hasn’t been able to leverage the manufacturing sector to scale up productions.On a global scale, India is low in the robotics and AI sector, which has both civilian and military applications, said Umakanth Soni, chief executive officer of AI and Robotics Technologies Park. “It is great that MeitY is looking at doing this.” India has vast potential as a producer of drones, said Chirag Sharma of HubbleFly, a local drone manufacturer. “The industry has not seen scale in terms of a consumption point of view, incentives would be needed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-planning-scheme-to-push-for-production-export-of-drones-101610924660481.html

18-01-2021||India||Govt asks SC to accept panel’s majority view on wider road for Char Dham highway project||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has urged the Supreme Court to accept the majority view of the high-powered committee (HPC), which has favoured a 10-metre road width for the Rs.12,000-crore Char Dham highway project.In its affidavit, the ministry has pointed out that 21 out of 26 members of the court-appointed HPC have been in favour of the wider road to ease movement of military forces along the Indo-China border areas, and to ensure better amenities for local communities.The MoRTH, expressing its acceptance of the majority view, has also agreed that HPC should monitor the Char Dham road project, aimed at improving connectivity to the Hindu pilgrimage sites of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.The affidavit has been filed before a bench, headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman, which will take up the MoRTH’s plea on Monday. The top court had in September 2020 ordered that the road width on the entire Char Dham route cannot be more than 5.5 m in view of MoRTH’s own circular in 2018.Subsequently, MoRTH as well as the ministry of defence (MoD) sought a modification of this order, citing security concerns amid tensions along the Indo-China border.While these circulars restricted the widening of roads in hilly and mountainous terrains based on the number of vehicles plying every day, the MoD emphasised that aspects relating to movement of troops and artillery were overlooked.Subsequently, the bench referred this issue to the HPC for making suitable recommendations to the court. The HPC submitted its report in two parts – the majority repot and minority report, dated December 31, 2020.Meanwhile, by a fresh circular on December 15, 2020, MoRTH also amended its previous circular and increased the road width in hilly and mountainous terrains along the Indo-China border to 10 m.In its report to the SC, the high-powered committee presented a divided opinion with the majority in favour of the wider roads on the Char Dham route, considering the strategic requirement and snow removal needs. The majority report also took into account the state government’s focus on reversing the migration in border areas by providing ample livelihood opportunities and ease of transportation, and said that the latest MoRTH circular on wider roads should be accepted.The majority report added it is not “feasible” to revisit the entire project where work is already completed and reduce the road width from 10 m to 5.5 m, underlining that it was “impractical” to reclaim the already tarred road because it will not be possible to grow trees on the excavated parts.“Road width may be kept as approved for Char Dham with flexibility as per site conditions, considering the prior, during and post vulnerability of the terrain in the design, instead of restricting the road width,” stated the majority report, adding landslides may have no direct connection with road cutting and constructions.The minority group comprised high-powered committee chairman Ravi Chopra, who is a noted environmentalist, and two other members, however, expressed their dissent and maintained that the road width should be restricted to 5.5 m.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-sc-to-accept-panel-s-majority-view-on-wider-road-for-char-dham-highway-project-101610923752203.html
18-01-2021||India||Dense fog engulfs parts of north India, mercury dips||States in the Himalayan foothills stretching from Punjab to Meghalaya recorded dense fog on Sunday, with reduced visibility over the entire region till midday.This also led to several places in northwest India and the Indo-Gangetic Plains recording very low day temperatures as fog cover blocked the warmth from the sun.Delhi recorded a ‘cold day’, with the Safdarjung station recording 15.3 degrees C, 5 degrees C below normal; Palam recorded 14.3 degrees C, 5.5 degrees C below normal and Lodhi road 14.4 degrees C, 5.4 degrees C below normal.“This is the peak fog episode this year as per satellite images. On Saturday, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Delhi, Varanasi, Gaya all airports had recorded zero visibility for some time. Today (Sunday), it was slightly better but still dense. This vast layer of low cloud formation is very specific to the Indo-Gangetic region but this year its occurrence is delayed. The worst fog episodes have been recorded in El Nino years. La Nina years are associated with clear skies and cold nights but this year too we are seeing such a major fog episode,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said: “This January has been cold. We recorded 1.1 degrees C on January 1. Normally minimum temperatures dip to around 3-4 degrees C. There is a layer of uplifted fog stretching across the Himalayan foothills. This is mainly because of high relative humidity, slow winds and cold air.”M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, said: “We predicted dense fog. Whenever an intense western disturbance passes, there is a lot of moisture in the air and the air is also cool. (A WD caused widespread snowfall in the hills and rain in the plains on January 6 and 7). These conditions are favourable for fog formation and also for development of ‘cold day’ to ‘severe cold day’ conditions. Today, there was dense fog in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.”Another western disturbance is likely to bring widespread snowfall to the western Himalayan region on January 22 following which minimum and maximum temperatures will drop once again over northwest India, according to forecasts.Dense to very dense fog was recorded on Sunday over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and parts of Uttarakhand, Delhi and north Rajasthan. ‘Cold day’ to ‘severe cold day’ conditions occurred at most places over Punjab and Haryana and at isolated places over UP. The lowest minimum temperature over the plains of northwest India was 1.4 degrees C recorded at Pilani in Rajasthan.The current spell of dense to very dense fog across the Indo-Gangetic plains is likely to reduce during the next 2-3 days, with likely occurrence of dense to very dense fog in some pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, Bihar, Sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Odisha, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the same period.‘Cold day’ to ‘severe cold day’ conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi during the next 24 hours and ‘cold day’ conditions in isolated pockets over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal during the next two days, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin.Currently, easterly winds are prevailing at lower levels over the plains of north India. This is likely to cause gradual rise in minimum temperatures by 2-4 degrees C over most parts of northwest India during the next 48 hours. Thereafter a reversal of wind direction is likely to westerly/northwesterly from January 20. This is likely to cause gradual fall in minimum temperatures by 2-4 degrees C during subsequent 2-3 days (January 20 to 22) over the same region, the bulletin added.According to IMD, a cold day or a severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters — a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees C and maximum temperature of 4.5 degrees C or 6.4 degrees C below normal, respectively. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees C in the plains.IMD in its seasonal outlook for winter had said nights and early mornings are likely to be chilly, recording below normal minimum temperatures over most parts of north, northwest, central and some parts of east India while day temperatures are likely to be above normal over the same regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dense-fog-engulfs-parts-of-north-india-mercury-dips-101610923108547.html

Yadav was awarded life imprisonment.“Yadav completed the jail term of 14 years and the state government was going to give him benefit of remission on January 26, 2021 (Republic Day) but before his release, the MP high court’s, Gwalior bench declared him innocent on January 15,” said Atul Gupta, the lawyer of Balveer Singh Yadav.A bench of the court comprising judges Anand Pathak and Vishal Mishra, in its judgment delivered on Friday,ruled: “Regretfully appellant’s 14 years which otherwise he could have served the nation as army personnel cannot be returned back, but certainly he can be given solace by removing stigma of an accused from him; therefore this court proceeded to conclude its findings on merits.”“It is concluded that prosecution wasn’t able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and there are material contradictions, omissions and discrepancies {that} crept into the case of {the} prosecution. It is the duty of prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and here eyewitness account, dying declaration, evidence nowhere [were] sufficient to conclude that Balveer committed offence. In the absence of motive, rely on the evidence of last seen conviction cannot be maintained. On such doubtful pretext, appellant couldn’t have been convicted. Appellant is directed to be released,” read the order.Balveer Singh said: “I was made accused just because I was seen with Surendra Yadav before his death. I am happy that stigma of being a murderer has been removed but I lost my job, pride and important 14 years.”“My trust on judiciary has increased but I will request the central government and judiciary to fix the time limit for a judgment of any case because it was very tough for me to take punishment for a crime which I never committed,” Singh added.(With inputs from Mahesh Shivhare from Gwalior)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-jail-for-14-yrs-ex-army-man-acquitted-of-murder-charge-101610922706219.html
18-01-2021||India||India assures Nepal on vaccines, supply schedule likely next week||The Narendra Modi government has given ironclad assurances to Nepal that it will be among the first countries to receive a pair of Covid-19 vaccines being manufactured in India, the supply schedule for which will be announced this week. The assurance was conveyed to Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali during his visit to New Delhi for the Joint Commission Meeting with external affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.While the political detractors of Nepal Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli had portrayed Gyawali’s visit as a damp squib, fact is that interlocutors of the Nepalese foreign minister in New Delhi were impressed by the professionalism and sobriety with which he approached the bilateral relationship with India.Gyawali could not meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the Indian PM was totally involved in the launch of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, according to top government officials. It was only due to the PM’s prior commitments that Gyawali was received by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is number two in the Modi government.It is understood that India will be taking care of emergency requirements of its friends by supplying vaccines for restricted use to priority countries in the neighbourhood like Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and the Maldives apart from Nepal with the supply schedule being worked out now.According to government interlocutors, Gyawali briefed Jaishankar about the preparedness of Nepal to receive the vaccines being manufactured in India. Nepal’s drug regulator approved emergency use of the Covishield vaccine being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India during the foreign minister’s visit to India.The two countries are now on the way of discussing training of medical modules, who will vaccinate Nepalese front-line workers during the restricted use period. Nepal has a total of 267,056 Covid-19 cases with as many as 1,954 people losing their lives to the pandemic, which originated in China at the end of 2019.During Gyawali’s visit, the two sides agreed to gradually open the air and land route connectivity, which had been hit by the pandemic. The two countries also agreed to expedite the field location survey related to the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line. While India and Nepal decided to deepen defence cooperation through closer military-to-military links, Rajnath Singh also offered to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training and capacity building to the Oli government.“There were no acrimonious notes during Gyawali’s visit, with the visitor taking a very responsible view of the bilateral relationship,” said an officials present in the bilateral meetings, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-assures-nepal-on-vaccines-supply-schedule-likely-next-week-101610921970881.html
18-01-2021||India||Decoding fine print of Supreme Court order on farm laws||“We are not experts on agriculture or economics,” emphasised Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde in the prelude to the Supreme Court’s order to constitute a committee on the three farm laws after staying the legislation.Nor are they expected to be.For instance, judges of the court cannot be expected to be experts in matters of faith, the scriptures, history, or archaeology. Its judges are not expected to be well versed with the vedas and the Puranas or the Hadith and the Quran. Yet, the court has had no compunctions in adjudicating the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute or the triple talaq case.Which is exactly how it should be.And which is why it is baffling why the highest court in the land took the position that interpreting and deciding on three connected laws on agriculture and agricultural markets were issues beyond its expertise or experience. But that isn’t the only issue with the court’s approach to the farm laws case.Less than 10 days ago, another three-judge bench in the top court delivered an over 600-page judgment while validating the Centre’s decision on redevelopment of the iconic Central Vista in the national capital. This judgment dealt elaborately with how the review of a policy decision by the government entails a limited enquiry. “Second guessing by the court or substitution of judicial opinion on what would constitute a better policy is strictly excluded from the purview of this enquiry,” held this bench, underscoring the inherent dangers of subjective opinion by “three gentlemen or five gentlemen sitting as a Court.”Again, on January 7, another three-judge bench said: “A decision of a public authority which is entrusted with a public duty is amenable to judicial review. But it is quite another hypothesis to postulate that the decision-making authority should be taken over by the court. The latter is impermissible.”Which is, again, exactly how it should be.So, the interim order by the CJI-led bench in staying the farm laws is clearly a departure from the principles enunciated in the Central Vista verdict and another order by the coordinate benches of three judges each, both delivered within the past fortnight. Even if one were to discount the settled legal principle of “presumption of constitutionality” of a law, as laid down in a body of judicial precedents starting in the 1970s, the stay order fails to show any level of consistency in decision-making to foster judicial credibility.Notably, CJI Bobde was completely mindful of the thumb rule of “presumption of constitutionality” when his bench took up petitions regarding other controversial legislations such as the EWS Quota law and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA. Justice Bobde headed the benches, which refused to stay implementation of these laws.On January 9, 2020, dealing with a petition relating to the CAA, Justice Bobde had remarked: “There is a presumption of constitutionality of law. Our job is to examine the validity of a law.” A year on, the action of the first bench in the SC on the farm laws case seems a departure from the established principles of separation of power and dictum of judicial precedents. While staying the farm laws, the CJI-bench cited how the court earlier stayed the Maratha reservation. But Justice Bobde had himself chosen not to stay the EWS reservation law in similar circumstances. And the stay order in Maratha reservation had adduced reasons why the state legislation was being suspended – on questions of legislative competence and breach of 50% quota ceiling as laid down by the SC in Indra Sawhney (Mandal) judgment — unlike the stay order on the farm laws, which gave no reasons at all.The court’s action has, thus, given rise to a strange situation where a stay order has been passed without examining the spectrum of legal and constitutional questions involved and specifying the reasons why the laws are prima facie unconstitutional or against the public interest. It obscures established judicial procedures and the rule of precedent. At the same time, it elucidates a reluctance to specify the normative basis on which the court’s actions are based.Instead, a never-heard-before “hurt” maxim has apparently moved the court, as it notes that staying the farm laws “may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”Bereft of legal reasoning, this order may well have dragged the Supreme Court into the political thicket where the top court has embarked on managing the administrative exigencies stemming from the farm laws — it now has a committee to assist it in this job — instead of a genuine hearing on the substantive matter at hand.Its choice of strategy is indicative of judicial adhocism and the principle of deference, which was once a feature of the executive. On the latter, apart from the challenge to the farm laws, there are several other legislations which are awaiting a ruling by the SC. Let alone deciding the validity of some substantial laws, the government’s notification on demonetisation (in 2016) is yet to be ruled on by the court, after having been referred to a constitution bench in 2017, thereby rendering exercise an academic one. And on the former, the court’s decision is indicative of an attempt to provide ad hoc solutions, not based on any discernible principles of rule of law or rule of precedents. In this case, this has taken the form of deferring to the wisdom of a committee (whose members the court itself selected).This is antithetical to enforcement of consistent patterns of normative standards and settled judicial principles.The reluctance on the part of the Supreme Court to perform its foremost role of the final arbiter of law and deliver its decision when it really matters is writ large. Its action in this case has already provoked a barrage of criticism. Lack of consistency and equitableness, coupled with reluctance to perform its role as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution and the law, may undermine the credibility of the Supreme Court.Only if the Supreme Court rises to the occasion; only if cases are treated alike; only if judicial ad hocism is shunned; only if the rule of law dominates, will its word remain truly supreme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-fine-print-of-sc-order-on-farm-laws-101610921193440.html

18-01-2021||India||Two Rohingya men arrested for living in Delhi ‘illegally’||Spokespersons of the Delhi Police said they have arrested two Rohingya men who had allegedly been living illegally in west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar for over two months.Senior officers said the two allegedly entered India from Myanmar without any legal permits or documentation in November last year.In a similar action last week, on January 11, six persons, also suspected to be Rohingyas, were detained outside Anand Vihar railway station in east Delhi. The six, who included three children, were handed over to the immigration bureau and sent to a detention centre in Delhi.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena, on Friday, said that based on local information, two men, Hamid Hussain (23) and Nabi Hussain (22), were arrested from Hastsal village in Uttam Nagar. A case was registered against them under the Foreigners Act, Meena said.Nabi and Hamid allegedly told the police that both of them are permanent residents of Myanmar and they had entered India illegally on November 1 last year, through the Bangladesh border. “Both of them belong to the Myanmar’s Buthidaung region. They were both found living in Delhi without any legal passport or visa and were therefore arrested,” Meena said.In the earlier detention on January 11, a police team in east Delhi detained six Rohingyas — two boys aged 10 and 14, a 15-year-old girl, a 60-year-old man, a woman, 50 and a 31-year-old man.An investigation revealed that they had arrived in Delhi by train from Tripura. They allegedly told the police during questioning that they had crossed into India illegally, with the help of some of their contacts at the border.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said all six were detained and handed over to the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer. “They were sent to a detention centre in Lampur, Delhi as the matter is under investigation,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-rohingya-men-arrested-for-living-in-delhi-illegally-101610916425786.html
18-01-2021||India||Protesting farmers say won’t take vaccine till farm laws are junked||Samyukt Kisan Morcha – an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ bodies protesting at Delhi’s borders– on Sunday announced a tractor parade on Outer Ring Road on January 26, a day before the Supreme Court hearing on seeking injunction against the proposed march.“This will be a peaceful parade. No disruption will be caused to official Republic Day celebrations or provocative speeches will be made. The national flag will be placed on all tractors,” farmer leaders said during the press conference.Farmer leaders said they will urge the Haryana and Delhi Police to cooperate. “There will be no threat to any national heritage sites, or to any other site. The vehicles in the parade will consist of tableaus and floats that will reflect the agricultural reality of different states in addition to showcasing historical regional and other movements. No political party flags will be allowed,” said farmer leader Darshan Pal.Meanwhile, a day after India kicked off its vaccination drive against Covid , farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders maintained that they would not leave the capital to go to their home states to get vaccinated before the three contentious farm laws were repealed.Though the first round of vaccines have been reserved for health care personnel followed by front line workers, the elderly – considered to be at risk – will be next in line to get the vaccines administered. This is crucial as a sizable number of farmers protesting at the national capital’s borders are above 50 years of age. On Sunday, Chamkaur Singh, 63 and his friend Dabinder Singh, 61, from Moga district of Punjab, were among the several at the protest site who said they will not return to their villages to get vaccinated unless the three new contentious farm laws were repealed.“We have heard many doctors say that Covid-19 existed earlier as well and affected people with less immunity. There are thousands of poor people living on the streets here, who have no means to wash their hands or wear masks. How are they managing? We believe the lockdown was just a ploy of the government to get the [farm] laws passed without any resistance,” said Chamkaur Singh, who hails from Dhudike village in Moga district, and is a member of Kirti Kisaan Union.Dabinder added, “We will get vaccinated only if we have the disease. Not otherwise.”Several others in the crowd added that they did not trust the government’s claims on the fatality rate of Covid-19 disease. Balpreet Singh, 28, a farmer from Marur village in Firozpur, said, “We have been here since day one and it has been impossible to maintain physical distancing. Yet, we are yet to encounter any Covid-19 cases in our group of 100-200 people. The fear of the disease is more fatal than the disease itself.” “What will we do with the vaccine if we lose our lands and homes eventually due to the farm laws? This fight will continue and we are now looking forward to the tractor march on Republic Day,” he said.However, not all protesters were against taking the Covid shots. Kuldeep Kaur, 68, a farmer from Chamkaur Sahib in Rupnagar district, said, “Though we don’t have Covid-19 cases in our village, I will get vaccinated when I return to Punjab and the vaccine is made available to us. I will not get vaccinated here though.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-take-vaccine-till-farm-laws-are-junked-protesters-101610915953485.html
18-01-2021||India||Will hold peaceful R-Day parade in Delhi: farm unions||New Delhi Tens of thousands of farmers protesting against the three new agricultural laws will take out a Kisan Republic Day parade (farmers’ Republic Day parade) in a “disciplined and peaceful” way in the national Capital on January 26, the unions said on Sunday.The farm unions representing tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national capital, demanding that the government scrap three laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws are aimed at freeing agricultural markets from government restrictions, which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions spearheading the ongoing farmers’ agitation, said farmers all over the country would also take out similar parades in state capitals and district headquarters. The unions said their tractor parade would cover a 60-km stretch and pass through New Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, covering areas such as Peeragarhi, Janakpuri and Munirka.They added that their march would commence only after the official military parade on Rajpath ends, so that official celebrations to mark the Republic Day are not disrupted.“Farmers on hundreds of tractors decorated beautifully, along with tableau, will take out an eye-catching parade,” said Darshan Pal, a senior farm leader.The Union government had earlier asked the Supreme Court to not allow the farmers’ procession, citing security concerns, but the court had said farmers had the right to protest peacefully.“This is not a preparation for any attack. Nor are we going to go to Rajpath or Red Fort. We will be disciplined and peaceful. We will maintain honour and dignity that the occasion deserves,” senior farm leader Yogendra Yadav said.Yadav also said that the farmers’ tractors during the parade would only display the national flag with appropriate respect and flags of farm unions.“The decision to hold a peaceful tractor rally with national flag on Outer Ring Road is a befitting reply to those accusing farmers of being anti-national, alleging that the rally would disrupt Republic Day parade,” said Sudhir Panwar, a farm leader and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission.The ninth round of discussions between the Union government and farm unions protesting three agricultural laws failed to make any progress on Friday, but both sides agreed to meet again on January 19 despite the stalemate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-peaceful-r-day-parade-in-delhi-farm-unions-101610912245250.html
18-01-2021||India||Boris Johnson invites PM Modi to UK for June G7 summit||The UK has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the G7 Summit, which British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will use to ask global leaders to seize the opportunity to rebuild the world after the Covid-19 pandemic to make the future fairer, greener and more prosperous.The summit will be held in Cornwall during June 11-13, and the UK will use its G7 presidency to “unite leading democracies to help the world build back better from the coronavirus and create a greener, more prosperous future”, said a statement by the British high commission.Besides India, Australia and South Korea have also been invited as guest countries to the first in-person G7 Summit in almost two years.As the “pharmacy of the world, India already supplies more than 50% of the world’s vaccines, and the UK and India have worked closely together throughout the pandemic. Our prime ministers speak regularly and Prime Minister Johnson has said he will visit India ahead of the G7”, the statement said.Prime ministers and presidents from the world’s leading democracies will come together in the UK to address shared challenges, from beating the coronavirus and tackling climate change to ensuring that people everywhere can benefit from open trade, technological change and scientific discovery.The G7 — made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US — is the only forum where the world’s most influential and open societies and advanced economies are brought together for close-knit discussions. The heads of government of the member states, as well as the representatives of the European Union, meet at the annual G7 Summit.The UK invited the leaders of India, Australia and South Korea to attend as guest countries to “deepen the expertise and experience around the table”, the statement said.The invitation to three countries is also a “testament to the UK’s commitment to ensuring multilateral institutions better reflect today’s world”, it said.The UK was the first P5 member to support a permanent UN Security Council seat for India and the first G7 member to invite India to a G7 Summit in 2005. As current president of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and G20 president in 2023, “India will play a key role driving in multilateral cooperation helping to build back better around the world”, the statement said.Johnson plans to use the G7 Summit to intensify cooperation between the world’s democratic and technologically advanced nations. Between them, the 10 leaders represent more than 60% of the people living in democracies around the world.The UK will also host several meetings throughout the year between government ministers from the G7, both virtually and in different locations across Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boris-johnson-invites-pm-modi-to-uk-for-june-g7-summit-101610911437157.html
18-01-2021||India||India inoculates 220k individuals over two days of Covid-19 vaccination drive||Six states carried out roughly 17,000 more coronavirus vaccinations on Sunday, the Union health ministry said, pegging the figure of total immunisations at 224,301 since the process began on Saturday morning.According to officials, among the 207,229 who got doses on the first day, three people — or .0014% — had significant side effects. Of these three, two were hospitalised overnight and discharged the following day while one remained admitted as of late Sunday.“None of the three had any serious adverse reactions post immunisation.They largely had fever, headache, nausea, etc. Only three people of all having experienced adverse reactions needed to be hospitalised, of which two have already been discharged,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, while updating on the Covid-19 vaccination drive that began in the country on Saturday.Overall, a total of 447 adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were reported and most were mild side effects such as headache, nausea and low-grade fever.The three who had significant side effects were each vaccinated at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, the Northern Railways Hospital in the Capital and AIIMS, Rishikesh. The recipient in the Rishikesh facility was yet to be discharged.According to separate officials at each of these facilities, who asked not to be named, AIIMS Delhi used Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin while the other two facilities used Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. Across the country, a large majority of the vaccinations done on Saturday were using the Covishield vaccine since that has one of the highest volumes of ready stock.“There is a set protocol to deal with adverse events post immunisation that will be followed across the centres conducting vaccination sessions. Protocols are also in place for systemic investigation and causality assessment of serious AEFIs, which doesn’t end at hospitalising the recipient, rather it needs to be established whether the reaction happened due to vaccination or something else,” said Agnani.According to the ministry, a majority of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) are minor in nature: pain, mild swelling at injection site, mild fever, body ache, nausea, giddiness, and mild allergic reactions such as rashes, etc.In Delhi, the state health minister said a large number of health workers who had been registered and identified for immunisations on the first day did not turn up, and that the administration will make efforts to encourage them to get their shots.“We will hold counselling sessions to create awareness so that apprehensions of the health workers could be allayed.They will also be called on phones to seek their confirmation and also to encourage them to come forward for taking the vaccines,” a senior Delhi government official said, while asking not to be named.On Saturday, only 53% of the 8,117 registered health workers scheduled for immunisations turned up.“Some people decided not to turn up at the last moment. The vaccination programme is completely voluntary. We cannot ask anyone to compulsorily take the shot even if the person has registered for it,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain earlier in the day, while adding that those that miss their appointments will be given a second chance.The Union health ministry official said that the Centre has advised states to keep vaccination sessions four days in a week to avoid disruption of routine health services.While all states participated in the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday, only six states did so on Sunday. In all, 17,072 more health care workers were vaccinated on Sunday at 553 sites.The six that conducted vaccinations on Sunday are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur and Tamil Nadu.States across the country have already disclosed their weekly schedules and on days there are holidays or routine immunisation drive planned, Covid-19 vaccines will not be administered.Andhra Pradesh has opted for vaccinations six days a week because it has a robust system of a separate cadre for conducting routine immunisation, the Union health ministry official said. Some states have also gone for fewer than four days for coronavirus vaccinations.“States that have decided to conduct vaccination session twice in a week is mainly because they have a small cohort of people to be vaccinated and those involved in vaccination activity, such as Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh,” said Agnani.The country pulled off the highest number of Covid-19 vaccinations on day one in the world, the official added.“It is higher than USA, the UK and France on day one. The Centre has held meetings with the states and Union territories today to review the progress made, and identify bottlenecks to plan corrective measures,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-vaccinates-224-301-individuals-over-two-days-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101610909794711.html
18-01-2021||India||Congress, Left to complete seat-sharing arrangement in Bengal by January end||The Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and other Left parties in West Bengal will complete their seat sharing arrangement for the coming assembly polls by the end of January.The announcement was made on Sunday afternoon by Bengal Congress president and the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Left Front chairman Biman Bose after a meeting of the alliance partners.Bengal has 294 assembly seats. The Election Commission of India is likely to announce the schedule of the elections in February and the polls may be held in phases in March and April.Though Chowdhury and Bose did not say how they propose to divide the 294 seats among the Congress and the coalition of 16 Left parties, leaders who attended the meeting said Chowdhury has requested for 110 seats since the Congress managed to retain two Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and also increased its vote share in some pockets.“Seat sharing is an evolving process. We will hold more meetings in the coming days. Our target is to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and also end the autocratic rule of the Trinamool Congress (TMC). The Congress and the Left parties will work as friends to achieve this,” Chowdhury told the media.Asked about statements by some senior TMC leaders, such as Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy, that the Congress and Left parties should support the ruling party to stop the BJP onslaught, Biman Bose said, “It is the TMC that brought the BJP to Bengal. They are saying these now to confuse people, to create a smokescreen.”“Though we know that the BJP is the nation’s biggest enemy, in view of the situation in Bengal we have to put up a well-organised electoral struggle against both the parties,” said Bose.The Congress and the Left Front partners contested as allies in the 2016 assembly polls but couldn’t stop the TMC from coming to power with 211 seats. Since the Congress benefitted more from the alliance and wrested 44 seats against the Left’s 32, the tie-up did not last.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left contested as opponents but it was the BJP that turned heads by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats, thanks to a huge swing in Left votes in favour of the saffron camp. Seen in terms of assembly segments, the BJP is ahead of the others in 122 assembly seats in 2021 while the TMC is ahead in 163.Union home minister Amit Shah has announced that his party will win more than 200 seats in the coming polls.In terms of vote share in the 2019 polls, the TMC got 43.69 % against 40.64 % secured by the BJP. The CPI(M)’s vote share came down to 6.34 % while the Congress got 5.67%. In terms of loss in votes share, the Left suffered more than the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-left-to-complete-seat-sharing-arrangement-in-bengal-by-january-end-101610910377448.html
18-01-2021||India||Delhi lab technician helps woman deliver baby in train near Mathura||A physically challenged lab technician from Delhi helped a pregnant woman deliver a baby boy in the Madhya Pradesh Samparik Kranti express train on Saturday night, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said.The lab technician took instruction from a doctor on a video call and helped the woman deliver the baby, much like a scene from the Aamir Khan blockbuster movie ‘3 Idiots’. At Mathura, the RPF escorted the mother and child to the district hospital in the town.“I had boarded the train to go to Sagar in MP but as the train from Delhi crossed Faridabad, a woman began crying in pain. Co-passengers came to know that the woman who was travelling with her brother to Damoh, was pregnant with due date for delivery on January 20 but her labour pains had started in the moving train,” said Sunil Prajapati, the lab technician at Northern Railway Divisional Hospital in Delhi.“I called my superior in the hospital, Dr Suparna Sen who gave me instruction on video call. I followed the instructions carefully and the woman delivered a healthy baby boy,” Prajapati said.He said they alerted railway authorities as the train had no stoppage at Mathura.“But it stopped at the main line where RPF personnel reached with a stretcher and the woman and her baby were then admitted to the district hospital of Mathura,” he said.“A woman constable from RPF, Jyoti Yadav escorted the woman to Mathura hospital and got her admitted,” said CB Prasad, the inspector in-charge of RPF, Mathura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-lab-technician-helps-woman-deliver-baby-in-train-near-mathura-101610909181428.html
18-01-2021||India||Opposition seeks probe into Arnab Goswami's chats with former BARC chief||Opposition politicians on Sunday demanded a probe of purported WhatsApp chats of Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, and Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the TV audience measurement agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), in which the former makes remarks that his critics say show he may have had advance knowledge of the Indian Air Force strike on a terrorist camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.The latest salvo against Goswami came from Congress party MP Manish Tewari, who said a joint parliamentary committee should take up the issue as the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remained silent.“If what sections of Media is reporting is correct then it points towards a direct linkage between Balakot air strikes and 2019 General elections. Was National Security milked for electoral purposes ? Needs a JPC investigation,” Tewari wrote on Twitter.The chats form part of Mumbai police’s 3,600-page supplementary charge sheet in a recent scandal over alleged manipulation of TV ratings.The over 500-page transcript of WhatsApp conversations between Goswami and Dasgupta sparked allegations of collusion and alleged access the TV news anchor had to classified information.Three days before the February 26, 2019 IAF strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot, in reprisal for the February 14, 2019, Pulwama terrorist attack that left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers dead, Goswami allegedly said in one of the chats that “something big will happen”, indicating he knew about the military action before it took place.Even Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra raised the issue. “Nation Needs to Know: Transcript of WhatsApp chats shows clearly Government gave prior information about both Balakot strikes & abolishing Article 370 to TV anchor,” she tweeted. “What is going on? Am I the only one who thinks ModiShah owe us answers?”There is a growing clamour among Congress leaders to take up the issue. Party leaders, on condition of anonymity, told Hindustan Times that the issue had been discussed by Congress Lok Sabha MPs. Leaders familiar with the matter said the issue was raised by Congress Lok Sabha MP Karti Chidambaram.“The party must demand answers from the BJP,” a party leader said on the condition of anonymity. “This is not the time to soft-pedal the issue.”Congress functionaries say they are studying the documents closely and will respond to the issue later.Senior party leader such as Jairam Ramesh, Jitendra Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Karti Chidambaram posted public comments on the issue on Saturday.“Does the @BJP4India have any comments on the #ArnabGate chat details, or is it too trivial to merit a response?,” Karti wrote on Twitter.“Arnab’s chats dated 23.02.2019 refer to sharing of Intel reaction along the Pak border. It means someone very senior in Govt is leaking highly confidential info which may endanger the lives of our soldiers & so that mercenary considerations can add to TRPs {television rating points},” Singhvi said.Ramesh added that BARC was aiding “weapons of mass disinformation”.“Since 1967 BARC has stood for Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Thanks to Arnab Goswami another self-styled BARC —Broadcast Audience Research Council -- is in news now. The first BARC built a strong & scientific India. The other BARC is aiding & abetting weapons of mass disinformation,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-seeks-probe-into-arnab-goswami-s-chats-with-former-barc-chief-101610908453079.html
18-01-2021||India||Govt rules out repeal of farm laws, says ready for tweaks||Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar on Sunday ruled out a repeal of three contentious agricultural laws, noting that the Supreme Court had already put them in abeyance, but reiterated his offer to discuss the laws clause by clause and bring amendments to address the grievances of protesting farmers.“If the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of laws, then I think the question of repealing ends. We expect farmers to discuss the laws clause by clause on January 19 and give us options about what amendments can be brought in the laws other than repealing,” the farm minister told news agency ANI in an interview.Tomar said the government was ready to introduce amendments in the laws and expected farmers to discuss the laws clause by clause.“The farmer unions are not budging from their stance, they are constantly asking to repeal the laws. When the government enacts the law, it is for the whole country. Most of the farmers, scholars, scientists, and people working in the agriculture sector agree with these laws,” Tomar said.On January 12, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three farm laws and set up a committee to address the farmers’ grievances.Farmers’ unions leading the protests have however refused to take part in consultations by the proposed committee. They have said their demand is a complete repeal of the laws.The SC-appointed committee has been directed to hold a dialogue with farmers and submit its report on the farm laws within two months from the date of its first sitting.The minister said the government had even sent a written proposal to the farmers “in which we agreed to address their apprehensions regarding mandis, traders’ registration and other things”.Tens of thousands of farmers have been protesting for over a month against the three farm laws that open up agricultural markets in the country.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Farmers say the laws would erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.On a visit to Bagalkote in Karnataka, meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said doubling farmers’ incomes was the biggest priority of the Narenda Modi government and that the three central farm laws would ensure a manifold increase in their earnings.Since coming to power, the Modi government had increased the budget for the farm sector and also the minimum support price (MSP) for various crops, he said. “I want to say that if there is any big priority of the Narendra Modi government it is to double the farmers income,” he said at an event in Kerakalmatti village.In a speech after laying the foundation stone of farmer-friendly projects initiated by the MRN Group, headed by newly inducted Karnataka minister Murugesh R Nirani, Shah listed various programmes initiated by the central government for the welfare of farmers.Shah also said no one had the courage to revoke Article 370, which conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir, and Article 35A, which empowered the J&K legislature to define “permanent residents” of the state and provide special rights and privileges to them, in 70 years.“You made Modi the Prime Minister and on August 5, 2019, he ended Article 370 and Article 35A from Kashmir and connected it with India permanently. Today, elections have also happened there peacefully without shedding even a drop of blood and Kashmir has become ours permanently,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-rules-out-repeal-farm-laws-says-ready-for-tweaks-101610906645487.html
18-01-2021||India||Eligible people likely to get option to sign up for jabs on Aarogya Setu||The Centre may allow self-registration by the elderly and those with comorbidities on the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) platform for faster and easier enrolment of people to receive a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.An Aadhaar-based enrolment process is likely to be rolled out for the elderly and those with comorbidities on the CoWIN platform, which is set to be integrated with the widely used Aarogya Setu app.According to documents accessed by HT, the CoWIN platform will allow the public to access its limited features—only those required for enrolment and vaccination and not the complex back-end operations—on the Aarogya Setu app. The app—the single window interface for health-related updates related to Covid-19 —has been downloaded by more than 170 million users. This would now be used in the world’s largest vaccination programme.“There is no need to download any new app for vaccination purposes. This module will be activated soon, once the vaccination of frontline health workers is completed. Along with this a feedback module through Rapid Assessment System (RAS) developed by MeitY is also being integrated,” says an internal government note.MeitY is short for the ministry of electronics and information technology.The government had so far conducted door-to-door surveys for contact tracing and rigorously tracked Covid-19 patients for months last year in its battle against the pandemic. Aarogya Setu and hospital data provided ready-made information on the age or comorbidities of millions of Indians.The self-registration process, experts maintain, is to ensure foolproof identification of deserving candidates for receiving the vaccine.The other and more complicated functions of CoWIN is to digitally integrate various steps, right from the time the vaccine is out from the factory and till it is administered to a recipient. It will monitor the movement of each dose of vaccine at the appropriate temperature.For the registration of beneficiaries, a unique health ID will be generated for each individual. “Those who don’t have Aadhaar or can’t do Aadhaar authentication with OTP will be verified through mobile numbers and taking photographs,” said the note.A guideline to the states adds that the CoWIN portal (cowin.gov.in) might also be used for self-registration of the general public. The platform will also be used for creation of state and district level admins, and the database of vaccinators and supervisors, and for management of material relevant to Covid-19 vaccination and its allocation.,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-may-be-allowed-to-self-register-for-a-vaccine-101610906284692.html
18-01-2021||India||India delivers 1st batch of heavy cranes to bolster operations at Chabahar port||India has delivered a consignment of heavy equipment, including cranes, for further development of Iran’s Chabahar port, signalling New Delhi’s commitment to the strategic connectivity project that can provide access to markets in Central Asia.The consignment included two mobile harbour cranes of 140 tonnes, which were acquired from the Italian firm Italgru S.r.l. under a deal for a total of six cranes, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.“The first shipment of strategic loading and unloading equipment worth $8.5 million has arrived in Chabahar port to mark the activation of the contract between the Ports and Maritime Organization (PMO) and the Indian side,” said Behrouz Aghaei, director-general of the ports and maritime department of Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province.Aghaei told Tehran Times that the heavy equipment will be installed at Shahid Beheshti terminal at Chabahar port, which is operated by India.Also read: Facebook, Twitter representatives to appear before IT parliamentary panelHindustan Times had first reported last month that the cranes were set to be delivered in January, months after India cancelled a $30-million contract with Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries for heavy cranes because of delays by the Chinese company in supplying the equipment ordered in 2017.In May 2016, India Ports Global and Iran’s Aria Banader Iranian Port and Marine Services Company signed a deal to equip and operate the Shahid Behesti terminal, with a capital investment of $85.21 million and annual revenue expenditure of $22.95 million, on a 10-year lease.Despite the Chabahar port being granted a waiver from US sanctions on Iran, India has faced problems in acquiring heavy equipment from foreign countries, mainly because of the reluctance of foreign banks to open letters of credit (LoCs) for a project within Iran.A special process was adopted to acquire the cranes from Italy that sidestepped the sanctions issue, the people cited above said. The cranes were shipped to India before being transported to Chabahar, they added.Aghaei said the Indian side will operate Shahid Beheshti terminal under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract and this was the first time such a deal is being implemented in an Iranian port with 100 per cent foreign investment.Also read: In inaugural address, Joe Biden will appeal to national unityGrain suckers, gate cranes and gantry cranes were installed at Shahid Beheshti terminal last year, but the lack of heavy cranes has hampered the loading and unloading of cargo from ships.“India is the only foreign country that is currently participating in a major development project in Iran despite the US sanctions,” Tehran Times noted. The project is the “anchor for the expansion of economic relations” between the two sides, it added.The Iranian side has requested the Indian government for railway equipment, including locomotives, signalling gear and equipment for railway stations, to bolster operations on the Chabahar-Zahedan and Khaf-Herat railway lines to give a further boost to Chabahar port. Iran has suggested this equipment can be provided by India under a $150 line of credit proposed some years ago.India, Iran and Uzbekistan held their first trilateral meeting focused on Chabahar port in December 14 and this body is expected to meet every three months to push the joint use of the trade and transit facility on the Gulf of Oman. Afghanistan will be invited to the next meeting of this body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-delivers-1st-batch-of-heavy-cranes-to-bolster-operations-at-chabahar-port-101610905094555.html

The right to protest can never include maligning the nation globally,” the Delhi Police said in its application.On Saturday, one of the protesting farmers’ unions Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Lokshakti had filed its response to the application and raised the demand for removing the three members of the Committee constituted by the Court. This Committee, constituted by the Court on January 12 initially had four members. This Committee was tasked with the responsibility of hearing the concerns of farmer unions over the three farm laws as well as that of the Centre and submit its recommendations to the Court in eight weeks.The members were Bhupinder Singh Mann (National President, BKU and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (Agricultural Economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati, Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana. The Committee was to hold its first sitting by January 22.Two days later, Mann refused to join the committee in solidarity with the protesting farmers leaving just three members. The response by BKU-Lokshakti referred to news clippings where the remaining three members had openly supported the farm laws and criticized protesting farmers of being misled by political parties.Also read: What the farm stir can learn from Gandhi“When all committee members appointed by the Supreme Court are already in favour of these three farm laws and already support the laws made and passed by the Central government without enough discussion with farmers, then how can they make fair report without any bias before the Court,” the BKU-Lokshakti said in its response filed through advocate AP Singh.The union further requested the Court to “remove all three members from the committee” and appoint persons who would prepare the report on basis of “mutual harmony” and who can “think about the interest of farmers with impartiality, trust and goodwill.” It requested the Court to appoint independent, impartial persons such as former Supreme Court judge and include within the Committee the President of BKU-Lokshakti among other farmers’ organization leaders participating in the protests.A bench of CJI SA Bobde, and Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran is expected to consider this affidavit as well on Monday.The Centre was also expected to file an affidavit on the concern expressed by the Court on the last occasion where an allegation was leveled by a farmer union in support of the laws that the protest by farmers had presence of pro-Khalistani persons.Indian Kisan Union had moved an application in the Court claiming that an organization by name “Sikhs for Justice”, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. The bench had asked Attorney General KK Venugopal if this was true. Venugopal supported this averment but sought permission of the Court to file an affidavit based on inputs received from Intelligence Bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-of-delhi-police-to-stay-tractor-rally-by-farmers-on-republic-day-101610894821294.html
