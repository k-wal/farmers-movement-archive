The French-made jets were part of the latest batch of Rafales to join the Indian Air Force (IAF).UAE’s move reflected the growing defence ties between the two sides. Last month, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane became the first head of one of the three services to visit Saudi Arabia and the UAE.Modi and the crown prince, who is also deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces, discussed the impact of the pandemic in the region and expressed satisfaction that cooperation between the two countries hadn’t halted during the crisis.“They agreed to continue close consultations and cooperation to further strengthen the India-UAE partnership in the post-Covid-19 world. In this context, they discussed the opportunities for further diversifying trade and investment links,” the external affairs ministry said.Modi expressed his special appreciation for the personal attention and care that the crown prince has “always shown for the well-being of the expatriate Indian community”.“The two leaders shared their confidence that the Covid-19 crisis would soon be overcome, and looked forward to meeting in person in the near future,” the ministry said.The UAE is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. Experts believe the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE could open up new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India, which has close relations with both countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-abu-dhabi-crown-prince-discuss-ways-to-boost-post-covid-19-partnership-101611857401145.html

Addressing mediapersons, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that while the situation in the state was serious, the government was taking steps to contain the surge. On Thursday, the state reported 5,771 fresh cases, with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 9.87%, and 19 deaths. The active case load in the state is 72,392. In the last one week, almost 45% of the fresh cases in the country have been reported from Kerala. The state’s test positivity rate is five times the national average.“After 10 pm, [only] people with urgency will be allowed to travel. We have deployed 25,000 police officials for surveillance and activated grassroots health machinery,” the CM said while announcing the new “Back to Basics” programme to contain the pandemic. The CM said that a complete lockdown was not feasible at this juncture.The daily test rate will be hiked to 100,000 and at least 75% tests will be conducted by the RT-PCR method, the CM said. Experts earlier questioned the state’s dependence on the rapid antigen tests. Of the 9,459,222 tests conducted in the state, about 66% were rapid antigen tests, data from the state health ministry shows.“After last month’s local body elections people lowered their guard. Slackness gripped all sectors. And after the arrival of the vaccine many thought remedy is around,” Vijayan said. A study conducted by the community medicine department of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College showed that 54% people were infected in their own houses, the CM said. “It clearly showed home quarantine facilities did not work properly and many who came from outside transmitted the disease to their families.”A genome study is being conducted to find the reason for the surge, Vijayan said.He also denied any laxity on the part of the government, citing the example of European countries which are still struggling with second and third spell of pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-announces-new-covid-19-restrictions-as-cases-surge-101611857531925.html
28-01-2021||India||AIMIM MLAs' meeting with Nitish Kumar sparks speculations of defection||A meeting of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar with all the five MLAs of Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and by the lone LJP MLA Raj Kumar Singh on Thursday has sparked speculations about possibility of their joining the JD (U).The meeting with AIMIM MLAs, which took place in presence of water resources minister Vijay Kumar Chowdhary, lasted more than 30 minutes.“It was a normal courtesy call. They came with the problem of Seemanchal. Nothing more transpired other than the development issues of the Seemanchal,” said Vijay Chowdhary, while denying rumors of their joining the party.AIMIM MLA from Jokihat and late Md Taslimuddin’s son, Shahnawaz Alam, also ruled out changing sides.“There is no plan to change sides. We handed over a letter underlining the development initiatives needed for the region. No political discussion took place,” he said.The AIMIM, which contested polls in alliance with the BSP and Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP, won on five assembly seats, mostly in the Seemanchal region.The lone LJP MLA from Matihani MLA Raj Kumar Singh also met chief minister Kumar “for development works,” on Thursday.A few days back, Singh had visited to state education minister Ashok Choudhary’s home during a book launch event, raising many eyebrows.Singh had won the seat by defeating JD (U) MLA Narendra Kumar Singh by a slender margin of less than 100 votes.“It was purely a visit to discuss development related works in my region. He is the CM of the state and we need to take up things with him. It was an unofficial visit, and no political meaning should be construed out of it,” Singh told a channel.A JD (U) party official, however, said that the ground has been prepared for their defection to JD (U) and “this is one reason why cabinet expansion is getting delayed. Development issues are just an alibi.”JD (U) sources said that if Singh joins Nitish Kumar's party, it would be a big setback for Chirag Paswan’s LJP, which not only contested the assembly polls independently but harmed the prospects of the JD (U) on many seats.Only recently, the lone BSP MLA Jama Khan has joined the JD (U).The JD (U) has 43 members in the present as against 74 of alliance partner BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-mlas-meeting-with-nitish-kumar-sparks-speculations-of-defection-101611856689967.html
28-01-2021||India||Two arrested at Guwahati airport for violating Covid-19 protocol||The police in Guwahati have arrested two people at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on Thursday evening for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols.According to the police, personnel on Covid-19 duty at the airport had lodged an FIR against 12 people who forcibly came out of the airport without taking the necessary tests. All of them had arrived on a flight from Delhi.The two arrested people have been identified as Dinesh Das and Jayanta Gogoi. It is reported that Das, a resident of Palasbari near Guwahati, is a peasant activist and was returning to Assam after taking part in the protests by farmers in Delhi on January 26.“The passengers violated Covid-19 protocol and prevented personnel on duty at the airport from carrying out their job. We have no idea if these passengers had taken part in the farmers’ protests. They have been arrested for not following Covid-19 safety measures,” Nabaneet Mahanta, DCP (West Guwahati), said.A case under Sections 353, 188, 270, 269, 294 of the Indian Penal Code and 51(B) of the Disaster Management Act for assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging duty, malignant act likely to spread infection etc. has been lodged at the Azara police station.Efforts are underway to arrest the 10 others named in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-at-guwahati-airport-for-violating-covid-19-protocol-101611856936043.html
28-01-2021||India||Jaishankar lists 8 principles to repair ties with China, stresses mutual respect||External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday outlined eight principles to help repair strained relations with China, saying the two countries were at a crossroads as last year’s events in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) had “profoundly disturbed” their ties.Jaishankar said three so-called “mutuals” – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests – are determining factors for the bilateral relationship and cannot be brushed aside as the two countries try to resolve the nine-month long standoff on the LAC.During his virtual keynote address at the All India Conference of China Studies, Jaishankar reiterated concerns he has raised in recent months – the sudden massing of Chinese troops on the LAC last year and Beijing’s failure to provide a credible explanation for the change in its stance – and presented a possible roadmap for tackling the stalemate in efforts aimed at disengagement and de-escalation.“Respecting the three mutuals and observing those eight principles...will surely help us make the right decisions,” he said.“Any expectation that [the three mutuals] can be brushed aside and that life can carry on undisturbed despite the situation at the border, that is simply not realistic,” he added.Despite differences on the border, those areas remained peaceful and the last loss of life before the clash at Galwan Valley in 2020 was in 1975, he pointed out.“That is why the events in eastern Ladakh last year have so profoundly disturbed the relationship because they not only signalled a disregard for commitments about minimising troop levels but also showed a willingness to breach peace and tranquillity,” he said.Jaishankar summed up the eight principles to handle ties with China as:• Existing agreements must be adhered to in entirety.• The LAC must be strictly observed and respected, and any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo is completely unacceptable.• Peace and tranquillity in border areas is the basis for development of relations in other domains. If they are disturbed, so will the rest of the relationship.• While both nations are committed to a multi-polar world, there should be recognition that a multi-polar Asia is one of its essential constituents.• Each state will have its own interests, concerns and priorities, but sensitivity to them cannot be one-sided as relationships between major states are reciprocal in nature.• As rising powers, each will have their own set of aspirations and their pursuit too cannot be ignored.• There will always be divergences and differences but their management is essential to bilateral ties.• Civilisational states like India and China must always take the long view.Jaishankar said he didn’t have a definitive answer to the question of where bilateral ties were headed as the “events of 2020 have actually put our relationship under exceptional stress”.He also listed other issues that bedevilled ties in recent years – the issuing of stapled visas, China’s reluctance to deal with some Indian military commands and its opposition to India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, denial of market access, blocking of UN listing of Pakistani terrorists involved in attacks on India, and the violation of Indian sovereignty by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the harsh winter along the LAC in Ladakh sector after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failed to lead to a breakthrough in disengagement. A clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Naku La in Sikkim sector on January 20, which resulted in injuries on both sides, has added to concerns about possible expansion of the dragging standoff.Jaishankar spoke of “painstaking and arduous” efforts to rebuild ties after the 1962 border war, saying the two sides had exchanged ambassadors only in 1976, and the first prime ministerial visit to China since 1954 had happened in 1988. “The quality of our ties in many ways was impacted both by the border conflict and the lost decades thereafter,” he said.Over the past three decades, China became one of India’s largest trading partners and a “complex but practical” set of agreements focused on the management of border areas while both sides conducted negotiations on the boundary dispute, he said.“The advancement of ties in this period was clearly predicated on ensuring that peace and tranquillity was not disturbed and that the LAC was both observed and respected by both sides,” he added.Jaishankar said the agreements explicitly stated the two countries would refrain from massing troops on the border.“But at the same time, there was also increasing construction of border infrastructure, especially on the Chinese side. Since 2014, there may have been more efforts by India to reduce this very considerable gap, including greater budget commitments and a better road-building record,” he said. “Nevertheless, the infrastructure differential remains significant and as we saw last year, consequential.”Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said a lot will now depend on China’s response to the proposals made by Jaishankar and how they are received in Beijing.“There is a lot of talk globally on decoupling from the Chinese economy, diversifying supply chains and how the Belt and Road Initiative leads to debt diplomacy but the world is finding it difficult to change China’s behaviour. A lot will depend on critical mobilisation by India’s partners to change China’s behaviour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-lists-8-principles-to-repair-ties-with-china-stresses-mutual-respect-101611855097140.html
28-01-2021||India||Issuance of lookout notices against farmer leaders 'absolutely wrong': Punjab CM||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the Delhi Police issuing lookout notices against farmer leaders over the tractor rally violence is "absolutely wrong".He also said treating the farmers as "flight risk" was not only “illogical but condemnable"."Where will they flee?" asked the chief minister, adding that most of them are small farmers with small land holdings and not some "big corporate raiders" who had fled over the past few years after "looting" the country of billions of rupees."You failed to stop these bigwigs but are now targeting these small farmers fighting for their survival," he said and appealed to the Centre to immediately direct the Delhi Police to withdraw the lookout notices.The Delhi Police has issued lookout notices against farmer leaders who have been named in an FIR filed in connection with the violence that broke out during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.A lookout notice is issued to prevent an accused from leaving the country.In a statement here, the chief minister also questioned the Delhi Police's decision to name farmer leaders in the FIRs in connection with the violence without any evidence against them."How can you blame all the farmer leaders for the mischief done by a breakaway group or the handiwork of some anti-social elements, who instigated the violence at the Red Fort and other parts of the national capital,” he asked.He reiterated his demand that the Delhi Police not use the violence as an “excuse to harass” farmer leaders in order to “weaken” the agitation of the farmers.Singh said that all the prominent leaders named in the FIRs had already distanced themselves from the lawlessness of January 26.Not a single one of them had reportedly been found so far to have made any inflammatory speeches or seen indulging in any provocative acts, he said. If the police have any evidence of the involvement of any of these leaders, they should make it public, the chief minister added.Amarinder urged the Centre to ensure a free and fair probe into the incidents of January 26 so that the real culprits could be identified and stern action initiated against them.Victimisation of farmer leaders was neither justified nor honourable, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issuance-of-lookout-notices-against-farmer-leaders-absolutely-wrong-punjab-cm-101611855551372.html
28-01-2021||India||Farmer leaders at Singhu take out 'Sadbhavna' rally to reinforce unity||Farmer union leaders took out a "Sadbhavna rally" from the Singhu border on Thursday to reinforce a sense of unity among the protestors, two days after their tractor parade turned violent, leaving 394 security personnel injured and one agitator dead.Several farmer union leaders, including Balbir Singh Rajewal, Daljeet Singh Dallewal, Darshan Pal and Gurnam Singh Chaduni, who led the rally said the march was organised "to counter the forces trying to divide the protesting farmers along religious lines and as per states" and to show that they respect the tricolour.Several tractors and two-wheelers with the national flag took part in the 16 km-long rally which started from the stage at the Singhu protest site and went up to the beginning of the Kundli-Manesar Palwal highway."This rally was a response to the government's allegations that the farmers insulted the national flag on Republic Day. Farmers from both Punjab and Haryana participated in the rally which displayed immense unity between the two states."We wanted to take out this rally to show that the farmers respect the national flag more than anyone else. And this country belongs to the farmers, because it is functioning essentially because of its farmers and the labourers," said Avtar Singh Mehma of the Krantikari Kisan Union (Punjab).He added that all the participating vehicles in the rally did not have their farmer union flags, but just the tricolour.Throughout the course of the rally, participating farmers chanted slogans of farmer unity and Punjab-Haryana brotherhood.Jagmohan Singh, the general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union Ekta (Dakaunda) said the rally was organised "to counter the forces trying to divide the protesting farmers along religious lines and as per states"."Historically Punjabis and Haryanvis have always protected the honour of the tricolour, and now this government is making cases against us for disrespecting the national flag. We will never let the government malign the farmers' struggle, and all of us will fight as a unified force," Jagmohan Singh said."Patriotism is not exercised just by a particular group of people… it is the families of farmers that give Indian army its soldiers. Farmers are equally patriotic if not more, he added.The rally comes two days after the tractor rally parade on Republic Day, which resulted in clashes between the farmers and police in different parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-leaders-at-singhu-take-out-sadbhavna-rally-to-reinforce-unity-101611855125166.html

28-01-2021||India||Gita Gopinath cautions against tightening of policy support amid pandemic||The International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath on Thursday said it would be damaging for India to start tightening policy support in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic and also stressed on reducing wasteful expenditures in the upcoming Budget.Delivering NCAER's '9th CD Deshmukh Lecture' virtually, Gopinath said there is scope for the Indian government to provide more direct support to people."It would be damaging (for India) to start tightening of policy support in the midst of the pandemic," the chief economist of the Washington-based global financial institution said.        Noting that India's debt-to-GDP ratio has gone up to 85 per cent, Gopinath said the country's banking sector is vulnerable due to rise in bad loans during the pandemic.         According to RBI's Financial Stability Report, gross NPA of banks may rise to 13.5 per cent by September 2021 from 7.5 per cent a year ago."There is lots of wasteful expenditure done in the Budget," she said, adding that steps need to be taken for a more effective Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection and more credible disinvestment plan.        The Union Budget for 2021-22, the eighth Budget of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2021.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting her third full-time Budget.       The Budget for FY22 will come in the backdrop of an economic contraction of 7.7 per cent, the first time in the history of independent India.India is doing an ambitious vaccination drive, Gopinath said, adding MNREGA will be useful this year also as the pandemic has hit women more than men.        She also pointed out that India has relied heavily on indirect support measures, including loans, equity and credit guarantees during the pandemic."So, there is scope for India to provide more direct support to Indians," she opined.        The government's ₹29.87 lakh crore stimulus package, spread over five announcements, included ₹12.71 lakh crore of liquidity boosting measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).       Gopinath further said the collapse of the global economy in 2020 due to Covid-19 pandemic was much more severe than the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).       "Many countries provided income support during the lockdown, so people were able to spend when the lockdown was removed," she added.Noting that the global goods trade has come back more quickly than expected, she said,"Now, we have to explore how to bring back jobs."The IMF had on Tuesday projected an impressive 11.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, making the country the only major economy to register double-digit growth this year amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gita-gopinath-cautions-against-tightening-of-policy-support-amid-pandemic-101611852736660.html
28-01-2021||India||Bengal CM Mamata meets Hindi-speaking people, urges them to elect TMC||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday directly appealed to people from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states to vote for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls due in March-April.“I have always accepted people who speak Hindi, Punjabi and other languages as our brothers. Have any of you ever faced any problem in Bengal? I never differentiated between languages and regional backgrounds. Support us and we will take care of you as always,” Banerjee said at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata while addressing members of communities who speak Hindi or other regional languages. They were invited to the TMC office for the first time. Senior leaders, including TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee, were present.Banerjee’s move was described as significant by party leaders since she has branded the BJP’s central leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minster Amit Shah, both of whom hail from Gujarat, as “outsiders”.On Thursday, Banerjee accused the BJP of creating a divide between Bengalis and non-Bengalis. “First they tried to split Hindus and Muslims. Now they are creating a divide between Bengalis and non-Bengalis. We have always believed in humanity and not divisions,” she said.Bengal has a sizeable number of Bihari voters who are mainly based in Kolkata and the districts of North 24 Parganas and West Burdwan. People from Punjab and Gujarat have also been living in Bengal for centuries. Bengal sends out millions of migrant workers while many Bengali families have permanently settled in other states.Last year, Banerjee announced that a Hindi language university will be set up by the TMC government. She has also revamped the party’s Hindi cell that was set up by Barrackpore Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh before he joined the BJP in 2019 and retained the seat.Last year, Banerjee also announced two state holidays during Chhath Puja, a popular religious festival in Bihar and the Hindi heartland. “Has anybody else done that? Nobody asked for it. I did it on my own. I am setting up the Hindi university so that you can study in Hindi. If I can study in Bengali, why can’t you study in your language? I have given recognition to all regional languages,” she said on Thursday.Without taking names, Banerjee said that while she manages to speak and read Hindi, some BJP leaders speak the language by reading Gujarati script from teleprompter machines. Banerjee read out a few lines in Hindi and talked of her love for thekua, litti, puri and similar snacks popular in Bihar and other states.“Virender Ji, the man who drives my car and the man in charge of my security speak Hindi and make the best littis. Have faith in Didi (as Banerjee is popularly called). This time around, we will win more votes. We will give a befitting reply to those who insult farmers. I want you to give me more votes than Bengali-speaking people,” said Banerjee, referring to the farmers’ agitation and the violence in Delhi several times in her speech.“Who are they to teach me Hindi? I will hold their ears and teach them Hindi,” said Banerjee who described herself as a “street fighter.” She even read out a Hindi sentence in front of the audience that applauded intermittently.Former minister Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP on December 19, held a massive roadshow at Arambagh in Hooghly district on Thursday afternoon.Reacting to Banerjee’s bid to reach out to Hindi-speaking voters he said, “She is free to address anyone. Ask her why she calls Hindi-speaking people outsiders. The BJP does not do that.”“People from all regions are my family. I made Rajiva Sinha, a Bihari, our chief secretary. Virendra, our director general of police, is from Haryana. We have so many officers from Bihar. They are doing good work. If i live with you all the time why should there be divisions during the election? You divide yourself in groups and campaign against the BJP in every neighbourhood. This is one promise I want you to make. Tell me that you will carry out this campaign while I tour the districts. After the elections I will take care of you,” Banerjee told the audience.Incidentally, Bhawanipore, Banerjee's assembly constituency in south Kolkata, has a sizeable number of Hindi and Punjabi speaking voters. Analysis of the last Lok Sabha poll results showed that the TMC was trailing in one of the civic body areas in Bhawanipore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-meets-hindi-speaking-people-urges-them-to-elect-tmc-101611849755595.html

28-01-2021||India||All you need to know about Maharashtra-Karnataka border row||The leaders of Maharashtra and Karnataka are engaged in a war of words over which state should have the ownership of certain border areas. In a fresh attack Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi demanded that Mumbai be made part of his state.Savadi's Maharashtra counterpart Ajit Pawar said Mumbai belongs to Maharashtra and will always be its part.The issue is pending before the Supreme Court. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier said that areas in north Karnataka which are dominated by Marathi-speakers be declared a union territory till the Supreme Court gives final verdict. The dispute is pending before the top court.Here is everything you need to know about the border dispute that has led to emotional attacks:The origin of the border dispute and Maharashtra's claimThe border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The law made Belgaum and 10 talukas of Bombay State, once part of colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. The act divided states on linguistic lines and became effective from November 1, 1956.Maharashtra opposed the move arguing that Belgaum, Nipani and Karwar had a majority of Marathi speaking population and should have been part of the state. The actual dispute is over 800-odd villages in two Karnataka border districts, Gulbarga and Belgaum.The Marathi speaking people in these areas have been protesting for inclusion in Maharashtra for five decades and have often alleged that Karnataka government has been trying to suppress their agitation as well as imposing Kannada language on them.Karnataka's standThe government of Karnataka has maintained that the villages are an integral part of the state. Chief minister Yediyurappa had ctiricised Thackeray's statement in which he said that areas of Karnataka where Marathi-speaking people are in majority will be incorporated in Maharashtra.Yediyurappa said it is painful that the chief minister of Maharashtra is trying to sabotage an amicable atmosphere.The Karnataka government has said that it considers the Mahajan Commission report to be final on the issue.What is the Mahajan Commission report?The government of India had constituted the commission in 1966 under the chairmanship of former former Chief Justice of India Mehr Chand Mahajan at the insistence of the Maharashtra government.A year later, when the Mahajan Commission gave its report, it recommended merger of some villages in Belgaum district in north Karnataka with Maharashtra, but rejected merger of Belgaum. While Maharashtra rejected the report, Karnataka welcomed it and has ben pressing for its implementation.What is MVA government doing?The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which is the ruling alliance in the state, is keen to take up the issue. Ajit Pawar, a leader of MVA constituent Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had said earlier that Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray had struggled his entire life to unite Maharashtra by including Belgaum, Karwar and Nipani.Chief minister Thackeray too had said in a tweet on January 17, “Including Karnataka-occupied Marathi speaking and cultural areas in Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who were martyred in the boundary dispute. We are united and committed towards it.” Incidentally, the day was observed as martyrs day by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, the organisation fighting for the inclusion of Marathi speaking areas in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-maharashtra-karnatka-border-row-101611851981247.html

The projection formed the basis of drawing up budget proposals which will be unveiled on Feb. 1, after the presentation of the Economic Survey -- an annual report card -- on Friday.The forecast for next year is in line with the International Monetary Fund’s estimate for 11.5% expansion, which will once again make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world ahead of China’s 8.1% pace.A finance ministry spokesman was not immediately available for a comment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is under pressure to shore up economic growth after the pandemic resulted in widespread job losses and pushed millions into poverty due to one of world’s strictest lockdowns that lasted nearly two months. A raft of reforms have been implemented since, including an incentive program to boost local manufacturing and tweak archaic labor laws to improve ease of doing business.The government also approved the roll out of vaccines this month. Besides, the administration has ensured a step up in spending to reverse the growth contraction and there has been a significant increase in capital expenditure in the three months ended Dec. 31, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-said-to-forecast-11-growth-buoyed-by-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-101611849906723.html

28-01-2021||India||Kerala announces new curbs as Covid-19 cases continue to surge||Amid an alarming rise in Covid-19 cases, Kerala on Thursday, announced a fresh set of restrictions to contain the virus including curbs on night travel and surveillance on festivities and public gatherings. While the rest of the country is busy relaxing norms Kerala has tightened restrictions to tide over the crisis.Talking to the media in the state capital chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan admitted that the situation is serious and the government will do everything possible to contain the surge. He denied any laxity on the part of the government and cited the example of some European countries which are still struggling with the second and third spell of the pandemic.“After 10 pm people with urgency will be allowed to travel. We have deployed 25,000 cops for surveillance and activated grassroot health machinery,” said the CM announcing a new programme named “Back to Basics” to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. He said a complete lockdown was not feasible at this juncture.The CM said the daily testing rate will be hiked to one lakh and at least 75 per cent will be RT-PCR tests. Many experts have earlier questioned the state’s obsession with less reliable and cheap antigen tests-- about 66 per cent of total 94,59,222 tests are antigen, statistics show.On Thursday, the state reported 5771 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 9.87. The active case load is 72,392 and it reported 19 deaths taking the death toll to 3682. Almost 45 per cent of fresh cases of the country are from Kerala and its TPR is five times higher than the national average.“After last month’s local body elections people lowered their guard. Slackness gripped all sectors. And after the arrival of the vaccine many thought remedy is around,” he said adding a study conducted by the community medicine department of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College showed 54% infected from their own houses.“It clearly showed home quarantine facilities were not done properly and many who came from outside transmitted the disease to their kin,” the CM said adding a genome study was underway to find reasons for steady surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-announces-new-curbs-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge-101611848855638.html

28-01-2021||India||BJP slams opposition parties for decision to boycott President's address to Parliament||Slamming opposition parties for their decision to boycott the President's address to Parliament, the BJP on Thursday accused them of "constitutional and moral bankruptcy".BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said if these parties think that the Modi government will backtrack from its support to three farm laws due to their collective pressure, then they should know that they lack such strength and that this dispensation bows only before people.Addressing a press conference, Bhatia said opposition parties had been calling for a session all this while as he hit out at them for their decision to boycott the address.A day before the start of the Budget Session of Parliament, 16 opposition parties led by the Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena and the TMC on Thursday decided to boycott the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament in solidarity with the farmers protesting the new farm laws.The BJP spokesperson said all major opposition parties had spoken before these laws were passed in the last session, rejecting their contention that the government had rammed through these legislations without following due consultation.What they have shown with this decision is their constitutional and moral bankruptcy, he said.Parties like the Shiv Sena had even supported these laws in Parliament before making a U-turn, so did the Shiromani Akali Dal, he said.Bhatia also lashed out at opposition parties like the Congress, TMC and the Samajwadi Party for not "condemning" the "anarchy" protesting farmers unleashed in the national capital on Republic Day and "insult" to the national flag.Some opposition leaders had disapproved of the violence but alleged that the government's refusal to heed the farmers' demand to repeal these laws was a factor in it.Bhatia said it is the government which has shown much flexibility and an open mind in its talks with farmer union leaders.He also lauded the Delhi Police for its restrain and overall handling of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-slams-opposition-for-decision-to-boycott-president-s-address-to-parliament-101611847306476.html

28-01-2021||India||West Bengal Assembly demands repeal of farm laws, Mamata Banerjee taunts BJP||The West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed a resolution on Thursday demanding repeal of the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre and extending its support to the protesting farmers.Speaking on the resolution on the second day of the two-day special assembly session chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that either the Centre should withdraw the farm-laws or step down from power.Later in the day at a function in the Trinamool Congress headquarters, Banerjee underlined that demand. “Interest of farmers cannot be compromised. Either you (Modi) withdraw the laws or step down,” she saidShe also said that there could be ideological differences between the political parties, but it was imperative that every party should unanimously support the farmers. She urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call a virtual meeting of all chief ministers.“When everybody was scared to speak up after the Delhi incident, I said the farmers are not at fault. They are maligning the farmers. The government of India is responsible. It was due to your (Centre) intelligence failure,” the chief minister said.So far, five non-BJP-ruled states - Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Kerala and Delhi - have passed resolutions in their respective assemblies against the contentious farm laws.Banerjee also took a swipe at the BJP over the violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital, saying, “First tackle Delhi, then think of Bengal”.“The Prime Minister should resign. The home minister should resign. Today I passed a resolution in the assembly. Two or three BJP legislators came to oppose the resolution. When they were asked by the Speaker to speak, they stood quietly. So, I delivered a strong speech, and they fled the house. The BJP will try to malign me. But I know you are there to protect me,” Banerjee told members of the non-Bengali communities at the function.Earlier in the day, BJP legislators trooped into the well of the assembly and raised slogans. Later they staged a walkout shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’.“This is unconstitutional and against the federal structure of the nation. The language which she used was in bad taste,” Manoj Tigga BJP MLA told reporters later.Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan said that the TMC government does not have any moral authority to bring a resolution against the Centre’s farm laws as the state too had passed similar laws a few years back.Members of the Left parties and the Congress also rushed to the well of the House in protest against certain comments by minister Tapas Roy when he was speaking about the Victoria Memorial controversy.The controversy had blown up at a programme to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birth anniversary at Victoria Memorial after Jai Shri Ram slogans were raised from the audience prompting Mamata Baneree not to speak.Speaker Biman Banerjee ordered that the objectionable words used by Roy against some members of the Left parties and the Congress be expunged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-assembly-demands-repeal-of-farm-laws-mamata-banerjee-taunts-bjp-101611847626505.html

28-01-2021||India||Border row: Maharashtra government releases 50 year old documentary to make its case||Amid sparring with Karnataka leaders over the Belgaum issue, the Maharashtra Government has re-released an old documentary which makes a case for inclusion of Belgaum and some other border areas in the state.The 35-minute black and white film titled "A case for justice", produced by the Maharashtra government 50 years ago, has now been released on YouTube in digital format."In view of the prevailing situation in the Marathi- speaking areas of Karnataka, chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray directed that the film be made available for public," a release from his office said on Thursday.It is now available on the YouTube channel of the Directorate of Information and Publicity of the state government.Directed by Kumarsen Samarth, it seeks to establish that Marathi was widely used in the area.There is a scene showing a teacher in a Karwar school teaching in English, Marathi and Konkani. Another scene shows Marathi placard of an NCC battalion."Vichari", local Marathi newspaper, a 1912 report in Marathi of the Karwar Urban Co-operative Bank and the Marathi plaque on a bridge in Belgaum constructed in 1890 also feature in the film.While the issue of Maharashtra's claim on Belgaum and other border areas in Karnataka is before the Supreme Court, a fresh war of words has broken out between leaders from the two states.On Wednesday, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi demanded that Mumbai be made part of his state and the Centre should declare it a Union Territory until then.His remarks came after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that areas in north Karnataka which are dominated by Marathi-speakers be declared a Union Territory till the Supreme Court gives final verdict.The NCP, which is part of ruling alliance in Maharashtra, asked state BJP leaders -- whose party rules in Karnataka -- to clarify their stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/border-row-maharashtra-government-releases-old-documentary-to-make-its-case-101611846319629.html
28-01-2021||India||Delhi riots: Court dismisses bail pleas of Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal in UAPA case||A court here on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of JNU student and Pinjra Tod member Natasha Narwal, booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a north east Delhi riots case.Narwal was arrested in the case for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said in a case of conspiracy of such a large scale, not having a video was not so vital as generally conspiracy, by its very nature, is hatched in secrecy and not having videos of such a conspiracy was obvious rather than doubtful.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 with an aim to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-dismisses-bail-pleas-of-pinjra-tod-activist-natasha-narwal-in-uapa-case-101611846165548.html
28-01-2021||India||SC expresses displeasure over Centre's affidavit in civil services exam matter||The Supreme Court Thursday questioned the Centre for filing an affidavit without specifying at whose level the decision was taken for not granting one more opportunity to UPSC civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020 exam due to Covid-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar expressed displeasure over it and said that the affidavit filed before it was not clear about at whose level this decision was taken.The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, observed that a “routine” affidavit has been filed before it by an under-secretary level officer.“It is a policy decision,” the bench said, adding the affidavit does not say anything about at “whose level this decision has been taken”.The top court has posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.The court is hearing a plea seeking grant of one more chance to appear in the UPSC's civil services examination to those aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020 due to the pandemic.On January 25, the Centre had told the apex court that allowing extra attempt in UPSC civil services exam to those who could not appear in their last chance in 2020 due to Covid-19 would create a “cascading effect”, detrimental to the overall functioning and level playing field necessary for a public examination system.In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre had said that giving an additional attempt or relaxation in age for some candidates would amount to extending differential treatment to similarly placed aspirants at the examination."It is therefore respectfully submitted that accommodating the present petitioners would create a cascading effect detrimental to the overall functioning and level playing field necessary to be provided in any public examination system,” said the affidavit, filed by an under secretary in the Department of Personnel and Training.The Centre said, “It may be noted that providing an extra attempt could further have a cascading effect by creating a ground for challenge on part of those candidates who have already appeared for the CS (Preliminary) Examination-2020.”It had said a total of 4,86,952 candidates appeared in the October 4 last year examination and the UPSC had “left no stone unturned in their pursuit to accommodate for the means and interests of the candidates.”“It is further submitted that the contention by the petitioners that their preparation was hampered due to the stress caused by the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, does not hold weight as the UPSC had already given extra time to the candidates by postponing the CS (preliminary) examination-2020 from May 31, 2020 to October 4, 2020,” it had said, adding that these conditions would have affected every candidate at the examination in a similar way.The affidavit had said that other non-final attempt candidates, who undertook the examination “without any murmur of discontent”, would be disadvantageously placed in future examinations if the relief prayed for by the petitioners is granted as it would enable vast number of experienced candidates to participate again, thereby making the future examination excessively competitive.The top court on September 30 last year had refused to postpone the UPSC civil services preliminary exam, which was held on October 4, because of the Covid-19 pandemic and floods in several parts of the country.However, it had directed the central government and the Union Public Service Commission to consider granting an extra chance to candidates who otherwise have their last attempt in 2020, with corresponding extension of the upper age-limit.The bench was then told that a formal decision can be taken by the Department of Personnel and Training only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-expresses-displeasure-over-centre-s-affidavit-in-civil-services-exam-matter-101611846216797.html
28-01-2021||India||With 1.9 lakh job vacancies, Telangana govt is working at 61% of total strength||As many as 1.91 lakh posts have been lying vacant in various government departments in Telangana for the last six years and the state government has been running the administration with outsourced and contract employees by paying them nominal wages, according to a report of the pay revision committee.Headed by retired IAS officer C R Biswal, the three-member pay revision committee which started its work in July 2018, submitted the report to the state government earlier this month. On Wednesday, the report was made available to the public.According to the report, there are 31 departments in the Telangana government with a sanctioned strength of 4,91,304 employees. However, at present, there are only 3,00,178 employees, which means there are a little over 1.91 lakh posts lying vacant in various departments, which is 39 per cent of the total strength.Three lakh-odd employees, 76.88 per cent belong to only five departments – school education, police, health and family welfare, revenue and panchayat raj. The school education department has the highest number of employees, majority of them being teachers. Out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,37,651, there are only 1,13,853 employees in this department.In the police department, which has the second highest number of employee strength, there are 61,212 employees as against the sanctioned strength of 98,394. This is followed by the medical and health department with an employee strength of 22,336 as against the sanctioned strength of 52,906.The sanctioned strength of the Revenue Department is 27,786 against which 19,825 are working. In Panchayat Raj & Rural Development Department the sanctioned strength is 26,201 against which 13,573 are working.The Biswal committee also pointed out that Telangana was lagging behind in terms of population-workforce ratio, compared to many other states. While the population of Telangana is 3.52 crore, the sanctioned employee strength is 4.91 lakh, which accounts for the population-workforce ratio of 1.40.“Nagaland has the highest population-employee ratio of 4.09, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (3.59), Himachal Pradesh (3.16), Goa (2.87), Maharashtra and Meghalaya (1.69) and Tamil Nadu (1.66),” the report said.An official in the general administration department said on condition of anonymity that there has hardly been any recruitment of employees in the last five years, except a few thousands in school education and police departments. “The government has been running the administration by hiring employees on outsourcing and contract basis, instead of regular recruitment,” he said.According to the Biswal committee’s report, there are around one lakh contract and outsourced employees in various departments working in various capacities starting from drivers, peons, junior office assistants to senior assistants with a monthly salary ranging from ₹12,000 to ₹17,500. The commission recommended enhancement of their salaries to a minimum of ₹19,000 to a maximum of ₹31,000.Besides, nearly 6,000 lecturers in various government junior and degree colleges in the state are working on contract basis with little higher wages, and the commission recommended an increase in their wages substantially.In December, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced that there would be a massive recruitment drive very soon to fill up as many as 50,000 vacant posts. An official statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said KCR had asked all the departments to furnish the details of the vacancies available which need to be filled up immediately.“The recruitment drive will be launched soon after the completion of the ongoing exercise of giving promotions to the employees, which has been pending for a long time,” the CMO had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-1-9-lakh-job-vacancies-telangana-govt-is-working-at-61-of-total-strength-101611845136079.html
28-01-2021||India||Covid-19 or border challenge, India capable on every front: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said last year India showed it was capable of taking strong steps for its security, be it Covid-19 or the border challenge. His comments came at a time India and China are locked in a lingering border row in the Ladakh sector.In his customary address at the National Cadet Corps rally, the PM said whether it was the protective cover of the vaccine or dealing with those who challenge India, the country was capable on every front.He made a mention of the Rafale fighter jets while talking about the military’s modernisation. He said the three Rafales that landed in India on Wednesday were refuelled mid-air by “India's friend UAE, helped by Greece and Saudi Arabia.”He said it reflected India's deepening ties with Middle East countries. The new jets will bolster the strength of the Indian Air Force’s only Rafale squadron, which is based in Ambala. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore. Of these, 11 have arrived and the remaining planes are expected by the year-end.The PM said the government has taken various steps to boost self-reliance in the defence sector and India will be known as a producer of military equipment, instead of being a market. India has set a target of $5 billion worth of defence exports by 2024.The PM spoke about more girls being inducted into the NCC. “NCC has seen a 35% increase in girl cadets. Every front of our defence forces is being opened for girls. India's strong daughters are ready to battle it out against enemies,” the PM said.He said modern simulators being given to the NCC will improve its training standards. “The government has increased the number of firing simulators from 1 to 98, micro-light flight simulators from five to 48 and rowing simulators from 11 to 60.”The PM paid tributes to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pak war at a time India is marking its golden jubilee. He recalled spending time with soldiers at Longewala on Diwali.“In the 1971 war, our jawans won a strategic and decisive battle in Longewala.In that war against Pakistan, India defeated the enemy on the borders. Thousands of Pakistani soldiers surrendered before India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-or-border-challenge-india-capable-on-every-front-pm-modi-101611844150666.html
28-01-2021||India||Cong, Left agree to share 193 seats in Bengal assembly, to hold talks on rest||The electoral alliance between the Congress and the Left parties for the upcoming assembly polls made noticeable progress on Thursday when the parties agreed to share 116 seats in addition to the 77 that they had won as allies in 2016. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats.The parties also announced that a rally will be jointly held at Kolkata’s historic Brigade Parade Ground on February 28. No other party in the fray has so far called a rally at the venue.“Today we took another step forward in forming a strong alliance against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier, we had decided to share the 77 seats that the Congress and the Left parties won in 2016. Today we reached an agreement on 116 more seats. People of Bengal want to give a befitting reply to the ruling party as well as the BJP,” Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said after the talks.Left Front chairman Biman Bose said, “The talks on seat sharing will continue, keeping in view the ground reality. We will jointly hold the rally at Brigade Parade Ground.”Congress leaders said they will invite either Rahul Gandhi or his sister Priyanka to address the rally.TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy, who had earlier urged the Left and the Congress to support the TMC, said, “These parties have lost a lot of strength but whatever gains they make will make the BJP suffer.”Reacting to the Congress-Left seat sharing, BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “Both are spent forces in Bengal. The contest is between the TMC and the BJP.”On December 24, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) formally approved a tie-up with the Left parties in Bengal.West Bengal, along with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, will go to polls in March-April.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left suffered badly while the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. The Left parties won none while the Congress tally came down from four to two. The CPI (M) central leadership did not give its approval to the Bengal unit’s move to share seats with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls.In October last year, the central committee of the CPI(M), the party’s highest decision-making body, approved the Bengal unit’s decision to have an electoral understanding with all secular parties, including the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-left-agree-to-share-193-seats-in-bengal-assembly-to-hold-talks-on-rest-101611842760743.html

The bills were passed in September last year.The central government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these laws will remain and have offered to make amendments into the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-in-ghaziabad-ask-farmers-to-end-protest-at-up-gate-vacate-site-by-tonight-101611838422942.html

Mohammad Sameer (26) was stabbed by a group of people in Keezatoor on Wednesday night and he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday, police said.The CPI (M), however, distanced itself from the incident saying a clash between two groups led to the killing. The Muslim League, on the other hand alleged that it was a well-planned and well-executed murder. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also said it was a political murder and asked the CPI (M) to dump its “politics of dagger”.The League said after the local body polls tension was prevailing in the area and the party made several complaints to the police but they failed to take action. “Sameer was threatened several times by CPI (M) workers. It is sad after the cold-blooded murder, the CPI (M) disowned responsibility saying some personal issues had led to the murder,” said Vallikunnu MLA P Abdul Hameed. The League has observed a shutdown in Manjeri and surrounding areas to protest against the murder.But the CPI (M) refuted the charges saying the incident was a fallout of a rivalry between two families and the party had nothing to do with the crime.

28-01-2021||India||India sends 6 lakh Covid vaccine doses to Sri Lanka and Bahrain||India rolled out 600,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines as grant assistance for Sri Lanka and Bahrain under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative on Thursday, a day after Nepal and Myanmar launched their inoculation drives with made-in-India doses.Two separate flights transported 500,000 doses to Sri Lanka and 100,000 doses to Bahrain as part of India’s plans to gift the AstraZeneca vaccine to friendly countries in the neighbourhood and key partners in other regions.The supplies to Bahrain marked the first such aid to a country in West Asia, which India sees as part of its extended neighbourhood. Bahrain is home to 350,000 Indians, the largest expatriate community, and New Delhi had facilitated the travel of Indian medical professionals to Manama last year to cope with the pandemic.The arrival of Indian-made vaccines in Colombo coincided with the celebration of Poya Day, which marks the first visit of the Buddha to Sri Lanka. Indian high commissioner Gopal Baglay offered prayers at Gangaramaya Temple for the well-being of the people of Sri Lanka and handed over the vaccines to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Rajapaksa said on Twitter: “Received 500,000 #COVID-19 vaccines provided by #peopleofindia at #BIA today (28). Thank you! PM Shri @narendramodi & #peopleofindia for the generosity shown towards #PeopleofSriLanka at this time in need.”The delivery fulfilled Modi’s commitment to his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, made at their virtual summit last September, for all possible support to address the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.Since the launch of the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative on January 20, India has gifted vaccines to Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Bangladesh (two million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Myanmar (1.5 million doses), Seychelles (50,000 doses), and Mauritius (100,000 doses).“Over the next few days, we plan to gift further quantities to Oman (100,000 doses), CARICOM countries (500,000 doses), Nicaragua (200,000 doses) and Pacific Island states (200,000 doses),” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Commercial supplies of Covishield have been sent to Brazil, Morocco (two million doses each) and Bangladesh (five million doses), and more supplies are planned for South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Mongolia. Another 10 million doses will be sent to Africa and one million doses will be provided to UN health workers under Gavi’s COVAX facility, he said.“We will continue to supply vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner. Decisions on these supplies will be calibrated against the requirements of the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine at home,” he added.On Wednesday, both Nepal and Myanmar launched their inoculation drives using made-in-India doses. Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, was Nepal’s preferred choice because of its compatibility with the country’s existing cold storage facilities.Nepal plans to inoculate 430,000 people, including health and frontline workers, security personnel, senior citizens and prisoners, in the initial stages of its drive. It also intends to cover six million people in the first phase of the drive and is engaged in talks with India for commercial supplies of more vaccines.Launching the vaccination drive, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said his government plans to immunise all eligible citizens in the next three months. Nepal will also receive millions of doses from Gavi or the Vaccine Alliance through the COVAX facility.Myanmar has signed an agreement with Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses, in addition to the 1.5 million doses it received as a grant last week, as part of plans to inoculate the population of about 54 million. The first commercial supplies from India are expected in early February.Authorities have said the initial stages of Myanmar’s drive will cover health workers, frontline service providers, government officials and lawmakers. Vaccinations for others will be rolled out from February 5, with first preference for people in most affected areas.Observers and experts noted India’s timely rollout of millions of doses as assistance was in contrast to China’s aid to countries in the region, including those with which it has close ties, such as Pakistan and Myanmar. China has pledged to provide 500,000 doses to Pakistan by January 31. Also, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi pledged 300,000 doses for Myanmar during a visit to the country on January 11 but supplies are yet to commence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-6-lakh-covid-vaccine-doses-to-sri-lanka-and-bahrain-101611834552954.html
28-01-2021||India||SC slams Centre for not curbing TV programs that instigate or impact a community||The Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up the Central government for doing nothing to curb TV programs which instigate or impact a community.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said, "There are programmes which instigate or impact a community. But as a government, you do nothing."The apex court observed that control over TV programs that are instigating in nature is as important as some preventive measures, and emphasised on fair and truthful reporting."Yesterday, you shut down the internet and mobile because of the farmers' visit to Delhi. I am using the non-controversial term (visit). You have shut down internet mobile. These are problems that can arise anywhere. I don't know what happened in the TV yesterday," the Bench observed while referring to the internet shut down after the tractor rally by farmers turned violent on Republic Day.The top court added, "Fair and truthful reporting is normally not a problem. Problem is when it is used to agitate others. It is as important as providing lathis to policemen. It is an important preventive part of the law and order situation."CJI Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre, that the government's power to control some news is very important."Control over some news is as important as some preventive measure and check law and order situation. I don't know why you are blind to this. I don't mean anything offensive but you are doing nothing about it," CJI told Solicitor General during the hearing.The court was hearing pleas filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party seeking action against media reports indulging in communal branding of Covid-19 pandemic in the light of Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin area. The pleas alleged discriminatory coverage by a section of the media and spreading communal hatred over the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.Solicitor General contended that the government can't control live shows or debates. "There can't be pre broadcast censorship. When there is something offending, we have taken actions by preventing channels to stop airing for a week etc.," Mehta said.The Bench said that it is not interested in people saying anything on TV but it is concerned about those programmes which have instigation effect."We are not stopping people saying anything, in any time on television, let them say that... We are on broadcast which can instigate and cause riots. There is loss of life. People say anything these days. There are situations which can destroy property, life etc.," CJI Bobde saidThe Solicitor General said that many times it is unfortunate but deliberate. He added that there are self-regulatory bodies like the broadcaster associations and News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) also has its own system.The apex court while posting the matter after three weeks asked all the parties in the case to file their affidavits in the meantime.In October last year, the Bench had observed that freedom of speech is one of the most abused freedom in recent times. It had also asked Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to file an affidavit detailing steps it had taken to stop broadcasts on TV channels which are targeting the Muslim community after Tablighi Jamaat incident.The Bench in November had expressed displeasure over the affidavit filed by the government in the case and had said that the government should consider setting up a regulatory mechanism to deal with such contents on TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-for-not-curbing-tv-programs-that-instigate-or-impact-a-community-101611834498832.html

The chief minister further said that a formal order in this regard will be issued soon.“We had been receiving many complaints regarding problems in the functioning of the district development authorities, so the chief minister has decided to dissolve the authorities. This is only being done for rural development authorities in all the districts,” the chief minister’s media coordinator Darshan Singh Rawat said.He also said that the state government would be looking into the situation and decide on the next course of action.Earlier in November, Bansidhar Bhagat, the chief of the Uttarakhand unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had submitted a memorandum to the chief minister, urging him to dissolve development authorities in the state in the public interest as they were not fulfilling the purpose for which they had been created.Bhagat had said after touring various areas of the state and interacting with people and party cadre, that one of the main complaints was that “development authorities had failed to fulfil the expectations of the people”.The BJP chief said these development authorities were not contributing much to the development of their respective areas. “On the contrary, people are facing difficulties due to them. Easy procedures are being made difficult for people. In some places, I even got complaints about corruption in the authorities. Against this backdrop, I realised there was no justification for the continuation of these development authorities in the state”, he had said.The opposition Congress reacted to chief minister Rawat’s decision said the government should have focused on why these bodies were not working properlySuryakant Dhasmana, vice-president of state Congress unit said, “Since the district development authorities are government bodies which have failed to help the public, the government should be focusing on checking why the bodies were not working properly. This government first takes wrong decisions and then takes a U-turn and praises itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-dissolves-district-development-authorities-after-complaints-101611833792999.html

28-01-2021||India||Maharashtra’s MVA slams Karnataka dy CM for seeking UT status for Mumbai||The constituents of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday slammed Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi for demanding that Mumbai be declared a Union Territory with the Congress calling it Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “sinister design” to weaken Maharashtra. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) called the demand baseless and pointless while the Shiv Sena said those making it should not forget Uddhav Thackeray is the Maharashtra chief minister.Savadi’s statement came in response to Thackeray call for declaring the disputed areas between the two states a Union Territory until the Supreme Court decides on a pending petition over Maharashtra’s claims over Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka. “Earlier, we were part of the Mumbai region. My demand and the demand of the people in this region is that Mumbai be attached to Karnataka. I demand the central government to ensure Mumbai should be declared as Union Territory. The issue will be resolved once we demand Mumbai,” said Savadi.Also read | Uddhav Thackeray to release book on Karnataka-Maharashtra border disputeCongress leader Sachin Sawant said Savadi’s demand exposes the plot of the BJP-led central government to weaken Mumbai and Maharashtra. “...attempts were made to shift the international financial centre and also trade to Gujarat. The central government has been a silent spectator as its ultimate aim is to make Mumbai a Union Territory. ...[Uttar Pradesh chief minister] Yogi Adityanath came [to Mumbai] and tried to woo Bollywood to his state. The Centre is using all central agencies like ED [Enforcement Directorate] and CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] to trouble the businessmen and Bollywood. It is all the part of the design to weaken Mumbai.”Sawant warned the BJP would face the wrath of Maharashtra’s people if it tried to play with their sentiments.Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said his Karnataka counterpart wants to please the people of Karnataka. “The demand made by the chief minister [Thackeray] has no connection with what Karnataka deputy chief minister has said in his response. As the head of Maharashtra, he [Thackeray] only said that until the dispute is resolved, declare the disputed areas as Union Territory. What is the connection between those areas and Mumbai?” he asked. “His [Savadi] demand is baseless and pointless.”He said Marathi speaking people used to elect their lawmakers, corporators and even the mayor from the disputed areas but to weaken their position, delimitation of the constituencies was done, and Kannadiga-populated areas were incorporated into them. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the Marathi speaking people in Belgaum are deprived of the independence given to the people from Karnataka in Maharashtra. “In Maharashtra, we have never acted harshly against our brothers from Karnataka residing in Mumbai and Maharashtra. They are enjoying full independence here, running Kannada language schools and also getting government aid. They are running many literary, cultural and art-related organisations here but is the situation for Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum the same?”He said Savadi’s remarks should not be given any importance. “The fight is to protect Marathi language and culture… The law will take its own course, but the Karnataka government should not forget that now the chief minister is Uddhav Thackeray.” He said a Marathi-speaking mayor was booked under sedition for taking the pro-Marathi stand. “This is nothing but the oppression of the Marathi-speaking citizens in the border areas.”The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. It made Belgaum and 10 talukas of Bombay State, once part of colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. Maharashtra opposed the move arguing Belgaum, Nipani and Karwar has a majority of Marathi speaking population and should ideally be a part of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-mva-slams-karnataka-dy-cm-for-seeking-ut-status-for-mumbai-101611833530461.html

Ahead of his departure, Momen told reporters in Dhaka that the sharing of cross-border rivers, including the Teesta, a planned meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission and the repatriation of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar would be on his agenda. The two sides are also expected to discuss a visit by home minister Amit Shah to Dhaka. The foreign office consultations, to be held on Friday, are expected to focus on all aspects of bilateral relations, including trade, connectivity and energy cooperation. Momen said a number of agreements are likely to be signed after the consultations but didn’t give details. Also read | Bangladesh to move 2,000-3,000 more Rohingyas to remote island this weekMomen and his Indian counterpart Harsh Shringla will also discuss Modi’s scheduled visit to Dhaka on March 26 to participate in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s independence and 50 years of diplomatic relations with India. “We will discuss all the bilateral issues we have on our plate right now…we will also follow up the joint declaration made after the PM-level virtual summit last month,” Momen told reporters on Wednesday. He said Bangladesh wants to hear “positive news” on the sharing of the waters of the Teesta river. “The ball is in India’s court. We will surely want to see that it gets resolved. We know the Indian central government and state government are yet to fully agree on Teesta,” he said. A planned bilateral agreement on sharing the waters of the Teesta has been held up by objections from the government of West Bengal, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee contending such a pact will affect water supplies in the dry season. A joint statement issued after the virtual summit between Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina on December 17 said the Bangladesh side had stressed the early signing of an interim agreement on Teesta waters, as agreed by both countries in 2011. During the virtual summit, India and Bangladesh signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation. Modi, in his opening remarks at the summit, described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. The two sides have closely cooperated to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, and India recently provided two million doses of Covishield vaccine as grant assistance to Bangladesh. Another five million doses were rolled out this week from the 30 million doses Bangladesh has contracted for with the Serum Institute of India. Momen will deliver a lecture at the Indian Foreign Service training academy on January 30 and meet Delhi-based ambassadors concurrently accredited to Bangladesh before returning on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-foreign-secretary-in-india-to-discuss-pm-modi-s-visit-bilateral-ties-101611831850802.html

He was sentenced to five years in jail.In her judgement, Justice Ganediwala noted that while the prosecution has established that the accused entered the house of the victim with an intention to outrage her modesty or sexually harass her, it has not been able to prove the charge of 'sexual assault' or 'aggravated sexual assault'.Also read| ‘No sexual assault’ in minor’s groping: Supreme Court stays Bombay HC orderThe high court noted that the definition of "sexual assault" under the POCSO Act says that there has to be "physical contact with sexual intent without penetration"."The acts of 'holding the hands of the prosecutrix (victim)', or 'opened zip of the pant' as has been allegedly witnessed by the prosecution witness (mother of the victim), in the opinion of this court, does not fit in the definition of 'sexual assault'," Justice Ganediwala said.The high court further said that the facts of the present case are not sufficient to fix the criminal liability on the accused (Kujur) for the alleged offence of aggravated sexual assault.Also read| SC seeks Centre's reply on Congress MP's plea against farm laws"At the most, the minor offence punishable under section 354-A(1)(i) of the IPC read with section 12 of the POCSO Act is proved against the appellant (Kujur)," the court said.The prosecution's case is that Kujur had on February 12, 2018 entered the house of the victim when her mother had gone to work.When the mother returned from work, she found the accused holding the hand of her daughter with the zip of his pants open.The mother, while recording her evidence in the lower court, had said that her daughter had informed her that the accused person had removed his private part from the pant and asked the victim to come to bed for sleeping.The high court quashed Kujur's conviction under sections 8 and 10 of POCSO Act, but upheld his conviction under the other sections.The court, however, said it was modifying the sentence and noted that Kujur has so far undergone five months in prison.Also read| Why comedian Munawar Faruqui was arrested: A timeline"Considering the nature of the act, which could be established by the prosecution and considering the punishment provided for the aforesaid crimes, in the opinion of this Court, the imprisonment which he has already undergone would serve the purpose," the court said.The court said the accused shall be set free if he is not required in any other case.Another judgment passed by Justice Ganediwala this month acquitting a 39-year-old man for groping a minor girl, noting that there was no "skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent" has faced severe flak.The Supreme Court had on Wednesday stayed operation of this order after Attorney General K K Venugopal mentioned the matter submitting that it was a very disturbing conclusion by the Bombay High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holding-hands-unzipping-pants-no-sexual-assault-under-pocso-bombay-high-court-101611825649538.html

The President will address both Houses of Parliament on the first day of the Budget session beginning on Friday.A joint statement, signed by leaders of Congress, the Left, the Trinamool Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party, said that the three laws passed in September are an assault on the rights of the states and violate the federal spirit of the Constitution."If not repealed, these laws will effectively dismantle the edifice of national food security that rests upon MSP, government procurement and public distribution system (PDS). The farm bills were brought without any consultations with states and farmer unions and lacked national consensus," the statement further said.The leaders also lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, calling it arrogant, adamant and undemocratic."India's farmers have been collectively fighting against the three farm laws arbitrarily imposed by the BJP Government that threaten the future of Indian agriculture which sustains over 60 per cent of India's population and the livelihood of crores of farmers, sharecroppers and farm labour. Lakhs of farmers have been agitating at the gates of the national capital of Delhi braving biting cold and heavy rain for the last 64 days for their rights and justice. Over 155 farmers have lost their lives. The government remains unmoved and has responded with water cannons, tear gas and lathi charges," the statement sai.The Congress had on Wednesday held Union home minister Amit Shah responsible for the violence that shook the national capital on Republic Day and said he should be sacked immediately.The opposition parties have decided go strong against the central government during the budget session of Parliament over the three controversial farm laws, the economic situation and the India-China border fracas.The budget session will begin on January 29 with an address by President Kovind.

28-01-2021||India||SC seeks Centre's reply on Congress MP's plea against farm laws||The Supreme Court Thursday sought the Centre's reply on a plea by TN Prathapan, Congress MP from Kerala, challenging the Constitutional validity of three contentious farm laws.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice to the central government on the plea and ordered tagging it with the ones pending on the issue.Prathapan, who represents Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala, has alleged that the laws are violative of Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination) and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution.He said the laws are "liable to be struck down as unconstitutional, illegal and void".Prathapan, in the plea filed through lawyer James P Thomas, said: "Indian Agriculture is characterised by fragmentation due to small holdings and has certain inherent weaknesses beyond control such as dependence on weather, uncertainties in production and an unpredictable market. This makes agriculture risky and inefficient in respect of both input and output management."It said the challenges faced by farmers such as dependence on weather, cannot be addressed by monetisation of the produce to increase their income, instead strengthening the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) system by infusing more capital and effective management of Minimum Support Price."The number of farmers that the Centre assumed for calculating the cost of PM-Kisan scheme is from the Agriculture Census of 2015-16, which had put the number of operational agriculture land holdings in the country at 14.5 crore."The matter is of substantial public interest and is emergent as there is need for striking down laws which violate the rights of the 14.5 crore citizens who are engaged in farming before serious financial damage is caused to them and the families of such persons," it said.The top court, on January 12, had already stayed the implementation of the farm laws till further orders and had constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.Prior to this, the court on September 28 last year, had issued notice to the Centre on similar pleas filed by Rashtriya Janta Dal lawmaker from Rajya Sabha, Manoj Jha and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi Siva, and a petition filed by Rakesh Vaishnav.The three laws — Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-on-congress-mp-s-plea-against-farm-laws-101611823301240.html

"LAC must be strictly observed, respected; any attempt to unilaterally change status quo is completely unacceptable," he added."For all the differences and disagreements we may have had on the boundary, the central fact was that border areas still remained fundamentally peaceful. The last loss of life before 2020 was as far back in 1971 that is why the events in eastern Ladakh last year, have so profoundly disturbed the relationship," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Jaishankar said that after the 1962 conflict, the first interaction between Beijing and New Delhi happened only in 1976. The first Prime Ministerial visit to China after 1954 actually happened only in 1988. "Rebuilding of our ties was actually painstaking and arduous," he said, according to ANI.On the relationship between the two countries going forward, Jaishankar asserted that if ties are to be steady and progress, policies must take into account learnings of the last three decades. "Whether it is our immediate concern or more distant prospects, the fact is that the development of our ties can only be based on mutuality. The three mutuals -- mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests -- are its determining factors," he added.His comments come in the backdrop of the standoff between the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the LAC for over eight months now. The soldiers of both the Indian army and PLA are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball at friction points on the contested border. As many as nine rounds of corp-commander level talks between the two sides have failed to bring a solution to the impasse.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-yet-to-explain-changed-stance-massing-of-troops-jaishankar-on-lac-row-101611821727507.html

28-01-2021||India||SC slams Centre for not curbing instigating TV programmes||The Supreme Court Thursday slammed the Centre for “not doing anything” to curb TV programmes which have “instigating effect” and said that control over such news is as important as some preventive measure and to check law and order situation.Referring to the internet shutdown in some areas of Delhi on January 26 when the tractor parade by farmers protesting against three new farm laws had turned violent, the apex court stressed upon the need for “fair and truthful” reporting and said that problem arises when it is used to agitate others.“The fact of the matter is that there are programmes which have instigating effect and you being the government is doing nothing about it,” a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, made this observation while hearing a batch of pleas which have raised the issue of media reporting of Tablighi Jamaat congregation here last year during the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.The congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in the national capital in March last year, attended by thousands of Indian and foreign nationals, was cited as being responsible for accelerating the spread of coronavirus or Covid-19, with its attendees allegedly carrying the infection to different parts of the country.“There are programmes which instigate or impact a community. But as a government, you do nothing,” the bench observed.“Yesterday, you shut down the internet and mobile because of the farmers’ visit to Delhi. I am using the non-controversial term. You have shut down internet mobile,” the CJI said, adding, “These are problems that can arise anywhere. I don't know what happened in the TV yesterday”.“Fair and truthful reporting is normally not a problem. Problem is when it is used to agitate others. It is as important as providing ‘lathis’ to policemen. It is an important preventive part of the law and order situation,” the bench said.The apex court said it is not interested in people saying anything on TV but it is concerned about those programmes which have instigation effect.“Control over some news is as important as some preventive measure and check law and order situation. I don't know why you are blind to this. I don't mean anything offensive but you are doing nothing about it,” the CJI said.“People can say anything. We are on broadcast which can instigate and cause riots. There is loss of life. People say anything these days. There are situations which can destroy property, life,” the top court said.Mehta told the bench that there are self-regulatory bodies like the broadcaster associations and News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) also has its own system.“Now, we are in the era of OTT. There was DTH, cable service etc too. We can lay down all the system before you,” Mehta told the bench.The bench asked the parties to file their affidavits in the matter within three weeks and said the matter will be heard thereafter.In November last year, the apex court had expressed displeasure over the Centre's affidavit in the case and said that the government should consider setting up a regulatory mechanism to deal with such contents on TV.Observing that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's affidavit did not deal with the applicability of Cable Television Network Act (CTNA) in the case, the top court had said that the government has the power to put a regulatory mechanism in place and it cannot be left to an agency like NBSA.The top court, which was hearing the pleas filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind and others alleging that a section of the media was spreading communal hatred over Tablighi Jamaat congregation during the onset of pandemic, had asked the Centre to file a fresh affidavit dealing with mechanism to regulate electronic media under the CTNA.The plea filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind has sought directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of "fake news" related to the Nizamuddin congregation and take strict action against those responsible for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-for-not-curbing-instigating-tv-programmes-101611820403086.html

28-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi thinks many farmers haven't understood new laws. Here's why||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Narendra Modi-led central government on Thursday as he said the country is being operated by the Prime Minister in the interest of a few big businessmen. The Congress leader had earlier tweeted in the day that the Centre had allegedly ruined India's economy. “Mr Modi’s governance is a lesson in how to ruin one of the world’s fastest-growing economies,” he wrote.Addressing a rally at his parliamentary constituency in Kerala’s Wayanad, Gandhi said, “You know the situation in the country today, it is clear for everybody to see what is going on. India is being run by the PM in the interest of 2-3 big businessmen. Every single industry today has a monopoly controlled by 3-4 people.” Sectors such as telecom, power, airports etc are being controlled by a limited number of people, he added.Also Read| On farmers' tractor rally violence, Kejriwal says ‘incident doesn’t end protest'Quickly shifting focus towards the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s farm reforms, Gandhi said that a majority of the farmers did not understand the details of the reforms and if they knew, there would have been an agitation all across and India would be on fire.Referring to an incident from the past, Gandhi pointed out that there had been an attempt to attack the country’s farmers in Bhatta Parsaul. As a result, the Congress party came up with a Land Acquisition Bill that guaranteed compensation and protection to the farmers, he said. However, Gandhi alleged that Modi tried to kill this bill when he became the Prime Minister in 2014 and upon failing to defeat the bill in Parliament, Modi told his chief ministers to kill the bill in their respective states.#WATCH: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says, "...The truth is that most farmers do not understand the details of the Bill (the three Farm Laws), because if they did, there would be an agitation all across the country. The country would be on fire." https://t.co/Y5yooquUwR pic.twitter.com/xaAg2Hsct0“We threw out the old British Bill and brought out a brand new Bill that guaranteed compensation & protection to our farmers...The first thing Narendra Modi ji did when he became PM was trying to kill this Bill. We fought him in Parliament & stopped him from killing it,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader is on a two-day visit to Kerala ahead of the assembly elections in the state scheduled for April-May. Earlier, he was on a three-day visit to the western belt in Tamil Nadu where he interacted with farmers, weavers and the public and also talked about the Congress’ alliance with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the upcoming assembly elections.Meanwhile, BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday sought an apology from Gandhi and alleged that the Congress had instigated the protesting farmers to carry out the tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day (Tuesday). Javadekar further alleged that the main opposition party did not want the agitation to end adding that people would give it a befitting reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-thinks-many-farmers-haven-t-understood-new-laws-this-is-the-reason-101611818956042.html

During the corona period, lakhs of cadets worked with the administration and society across the country. It is commendable," PM Modi said.He said that NCC can play an important role in adding discipline in the society. "During the parade on 26th January, you have displayed some brilliant performances and made the nation proud. We have witnessed that disciplined countries dominate across the world, and in India , NCC can play a pivotal role in adding discipline in social life," he added.PM Modi said that with the help of the NCC, Naxalism today exists in just a few districts of the nation."Naxalism today exists in just a few districts in the country and several people have left practicing it and are contributing to development in the country," he added.PM Modi said that the government has tried to widen the role of the NCC, adding that it's participation in commanding India's borders - both land and sea - is being increased."Last year, on 15th August, it was announced that near coastal and border areas, new responsibility will be given to NCC in 175 districts of the country. For this, the Army, Navy and Air Force is training 1 lakh NCC cadets. One-third of these are our girl cadets," he added.PM Modi also said that the government has increased the number of firing simulators from 1 to 98--nearly 100."The number of micro-light flight simulators, too, has been increased from 5 to 48 and rowing simulators from 11 to 60. These modern simulators will improve the training qualities of NCC," he added.The Prime Minister further said that the NCC has seen a 35% increase in girl cadets, adding that every front of India's defence forces are being opened for females. "India's strong daughters are ready to battle it out against the enemies. India needs your bravery," he added.Remembering the 1971 war, PM Modi said that the soldiers had won a strategic and decisive battle in Longewala."In that war against Pakistan, India had defeated the enemy on the borders. Pakistan's innumerable soldiers had surrendered to India. This year, we are completing 50 years of this war," he added.Stressing on the fact that the NCC digital platform already has over 20,000 cadets, PM Modi said that these cadets have started sharing their experiences and ideas. "I hope all of you would use this platform even more," he added.Portraying India's strengthening friendship with middle-east countries, PM Modi said, "India has received 3 more Rafales from France. They have the ability to refuel mid-air, which has been done by India's friend UAE, helped by Greece and Saudi Arabia."PM Modi was accorded the Guard of Honour at the rally of NCC at Cariappa ground in Delhi. He also inspected the parade at the rally and felicitated the NCC Cadets. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh was also present on the occassion.The NCC is a youth wing of India's armed forces and is open to students across all schools and colleges on a voluntary basis. The organisation comprises the Army, Air Force and Navy wing, and imparts basic military training in small arms and drills to the cadets. The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps act of 1948.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-ncc-s-role-in-serving-society-during-covid-19-pandemic-101611815422439.html

The SAD on Tuesday said it stands for communal harmony and had urged people to maintain peace at all costs“Only an international inquiry can expose the anti-social elements that had already been named by the independent media,” SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia told news agency ANI adding that the central agencies could not investigate as they were apparently involved in sabotaging the protest and ensuring that farmers and farm labourers do not get their dues.Also Read| Delhi Police issue notice to 20 farmer leaders, ask them to reply within 3 daysCondemning the violence in Delhi on January 26, the former Punjab minister said that this incident should not be used as an excuse to abandon the genuine demands of the farmers- who have been protesting at border points in Delhi for over two months.Slamming the Centre further, the SAD leader pointed out that the government agencies did not deign it fit to act immediately against the people who had incited violence and it was bizarre that they were allowed to move towards the Red Fort. “It is even more bizarre that the same persons were given a free run to enter the Red Fort which is otherwise impossible to even approach due to heavy security deployment.

A Purple Notice is issued to seek or provide information on modus operandi, objects, devices, and concealment methods criminals use.Also read | Pakistan left swipes dating apps including Tinder, says it’s immoral contentInterpol said the threat involves taking advantage of people’s vulnerabilities as they look for potential matches, and luring them into a sophisticated fraud scheme. “In the initial stages, an artificial romance is established via a dating app. Once communication becomes regular and a certain level of trust is established, criminals share investment tips with their victims and encourage them to join a scheme. Victims download a trading app and open an account, buy various financial products and work their way up a so-called investment chain, all under the watchful eye of their new ‘friend’.” The statement said they are made to believe they can reach Gold or VIP status. “As is often the case with such fraud schemes, everything is made to look legitimate. Screenshots are provided, domain names are eerily similar to real websites, and customer service agents pretend to help victims choose the right products. One day, however, all contact stops, and victims are locked out of the account. They’re left confused, hurt, and worried that they’ll never see their money again.”Interpol has also provided tips to ensure safe online dating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conmen-defrauding-people-through-online-dating-apps-warns-interpol-101611809828537.html

The last date for public comment on the draft is February 27.Also Read: South African President Ramaphosa to sign three-year road map during R-Day visit to take India ties forward“A quantum and qualitative boost to all of these would be given by suitable schematic initiatives and by encouraging the private sector to invest in new business opportunities. The new and emerging areas such as marine biotechnology, deep-sea mining and ocean energy will be promoted. Innovative financing and business models will be explored for these emerging sectors since they are capital intensive,”says the draft policy published on the India Meteorological Department’s website.The policy also underlines the need for marine clusters for port-led development as already conceptualised in the Sagarmala programme of the Centre. The ship building industry would be promoted and modernized in 30 years with a focus on Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiatives.The policy also speaks of marine diplomacy with engagements with neighbouring countries to safeguard strategic interests. One such emerging economic and strategic axis spreads from the East Coast of Africa to the Western Pacific Ocean, which can be called the Seychelles-Singapore-Samoa (SSS) axis, it states.“The draft policy aims to significantly enhance the contribution of the Blue Economy to India’s GDP in the next five years, improve lives of coastal communities, preserve our marine biodiversity and maintain the security of our marine areas and resources. Today, the Blue Economy holds the promise of being the next multiplier of economic growth and well-being, provided that the strategy places sustainability and socio-economic welfare at the centre stage,” the draft concludes.The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) has put together the draft policy based on recommendations of seven working groups under the Blue Economy initiative.India has a unique maritime position. Its 7,517km-long coastline is home to nine coastal states and 1,382 islands. India has 12 major ports and 187 non-major ports, handling about 1,400 million tons of cargo every year, as 95% of India’s trade by volume transits by sea.India’s Exclusive Economic Zone of over two million square kilometers is rich in living and non-living resources and holds significant recoverable resources of crude oil and of recoverable natural gas. The coastal economy also sustains over 4 million fishermen and other coastal communities, the policy says.“The draft policy brings together several existing economic priorities that have long footprint in coastal and marine areas i.e. island tourism, port led development, deep-sea mining and frames as blue economy. It has two main focus areas, building over coastal lands and extracting from the sea. It pays mere lip service to the environment question and does not address the impacts on coastal livelihoods. In effect the draft document will give the policy justification to several changes that area underway to make way for the priorities envisaged in the text. Changes to regulations, approval of new projects and acquisition of land draw their mandate from policy documents of this nature, none of which has been initiated, assessed, disclosed by the government so far,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, responding to the draft policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/island-tourism-deep-sea-mining-highlights-of-india-s-blue-economy-policy-101611804488101.html

But many parts of NW India are recording both cold day and nights this winter.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5°C or 6.4°C below normal. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10°C or below and/or is 4.5 notches less than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4°C in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-wave-likely-to-persist-over-nw-india-till-sunday-101611802147893.html

28-01-2021||India||Beijing opposes New Delhi move to retain ban on 59 Chinese apps||China on Wednesday opposed India’s decision to retain a ban on 59 Chinese-origin mobile phone applications, saying the move violated the World Trade Organisation’s non-discriminatory principles and had the potential to “further damage” bilateral cooperation.India’s electronics and information technology ministry has informed the Chinese firms that the ban on 59 apps, including TikTok, would be retained following a review of the responses provided by the companies after the imposition of the ban last year amid a military standoff in the Ladakh theatre along the Line of Actual Control.The ban was imposed last June on grounds of national security, months after the military standoff emerged into the open.Responding to reports about the retention of the ban on 59 apps, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Ji Rong, contended that India was using national security as an “excuse” to impose restrictions on Chinese firms.“Since last year, the Indian side has repeatedly used national security as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background,” she said in a statement. “These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. ” Ji claimed.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese spokesperson’s comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beijing-opposes-new-delhi-move-to-retain-ban-on-59-chinese-apps-101611795208127.html
28-01-2021||India||Ministries at odds over NEET exam||The ministry of health and family welfare is not in favour of a proposal by the ministry of education to hold the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical and dental courses twice a year. This was conveyed to education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal by health minister Harsh Vardhan after consultations with the National Medical Commission (NMC), an official confirmed to the HindustanTimes.Following this, Pokhriyal made a personal appeal to the health minister to reconsider the matter. “The health minister has now assured (his counterpart) that he will reconsider the decision,’’ an official aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.Dr Aruna V Vanikar, who is the president of the Undergraduate Medical Education Board, told Hindustan Times that a final decision is awaited. “We are yet to hear the final word on this from the government of India.’’The official cited in the first instance confirmed that Pokhriyal’s pitch for holding the exam more than once , was met with apprehension by health ministry officials,although it was not clear exactly why. The official said that this was after deliberations by the National Medical Commission (NMC), which is responsible for the syllabus of the tests. HT got in touch with chairman of the commission, Dr SC Sharma, who declined comment. “Please ask the health ministry for further details,’’ he said.A health ministry spokesperson told HT: “It (the proposal) is presently under consideration of the NMC and the ministry.”’ But a second official said the health ministry’s and especially the NMC’s reluctance to give the clearance was because they felt it was within their purview to decide the course of medical exams and not the National Testing Agency’s call.Pokhriyal’s proposal raised the hopes of thousands of students who were hoping to get two options to take the exam. The education ministry has already announced that the joint entrance examination for admission to engineering colleges will be held online four times a year from this year. The ministry was hoping for a similiar decision for medical students too.Hindustan Times reached out to National Testing Agency head Vineet Joshi, who didn’t respond to queries. The agency wrote formally to the health ministry to allow online exams earlier this month. Its rationale for providing an online option and an alternative date was to make it easier for the 1.5 million candidates who had registered for the exam last time around.While there were many students who moved Supreme Court against the exams being held during a pandemic, when the exam took place in September, just around 10% of students were absent. The second official said that while fears about Class XII students being distracted by NEET twice a year was a valid concern, the real reason could be the health ministry not being thrilled by MBBS students being selected by the education ministry’s NTA instead of NMC, which controls medical education.Lawyer Shoeb Alam, who appeared for students in the NEET matter last year, said: “Increasing the frequency of the exam will be a popular move with students as they don’t have to wait another year to take the exam.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-at-odds-over-neet-exam-101611793163242.html
28-01-2021||India||Swimming pools to movie halls, more curbs relaxed||The Union ministry of home ministry affairs (MHA) on Wednesday took a fresh step towards normalcy in the country battered by the coronavirus disease, announcing further relaxation of curbs on gatherings, cinema halls and swimming pools in the first set of guidelines against Covid-19 released in the new year.The guidelines for “Surveillance, Containment and Caution”, applicable for February 1-28, also said the civil aviation ministry may take a call on further opening up of international air travel in consultation with the MHA. At present, India is operating international flights under special arrangements with 24 countries, and Vande Bharat rescue flights to pick up its citizens stranded abroad.Social, religious, cultural, sports, entertainment and educational gatherings will be subject to standard operating procedures (SOPs) by states and Union Territories (UTs), the government announced, lifting restrictions on these activities first imposed by it in March 2020, when the pandemic gripped the nation. Initially, these activities were completely banned. At present, they are permitted, but with a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity and a ceiling of 200 people in closed spaces.Cinema halls and theatres, already allowed to function with 50% of seating capacity, can now have a higher capacity, but the ministry of information and broadcasting will release SOPs to this effect in consultation with the MHA.Besides, swimming pools, where only sportspersons are allowed at present, have been opened to all. The youth affairs and sports ministry will release the SOPs with MHA inputs. Similarly, all types of exhibition halls will be permitted in February and the SOP to that effect will be released by the department of commerce. Business-to-business (B2B) exhibition halls have already been permitted in the country.All other activities are permitted outside containment zones, which are epicentres of Covid-19 infections and have restricted entry and stringent perimeter control.In a letter to states and UTs, home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said: “As you are aware, the number of active cases in the country have been declining steadily over the past four months. However, there is a need for maintaining caution and strict surveillance so as to fully overcome the pandemic.”Bhalla added that “the essence behind the graded re-opening and progressive resumption of activities is to move ahead”.Till Wednesday, India has recorded 10,702,073 Covid-19 cases and 153,903 fatalities. The seven-day average of infections now stands at 12,897, compared to the peak of 93,617 on September 16, 2020.The guidelines also said there shall be no restriction on inter- and intra-state movement, “including those for cross land-border trade under Treaties with neighbouring countries”. No separate permission or e-permit will be required for such movements.People above 65, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below 10 years are advised to stay at home. The government also encouraged citizens to use the contact-tracing mobile application, Aarogya Setu. The guidelines asked states and UTs to ensure wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. National directives for Covid-19 management, such as fines on spitting in public places, will continue to be followed. For offices and marketplaces, the guidelines advocated staggering of work and business hours, thermal screening and proper sanitisation, and social distancing.The guidelines said containment Zones, if required, “shall be carefully demarcated by the district authorities at the micro level”. Police and municipal authorities will be responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed. After 68 days of hard lockdown (when only essential services were allowed) last year, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen business activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swimming-pools-to-movie-halls-more-curbs-relaxed-101611792913432.html
28-01-2021||India||Govt indicates offer to farmers still on table, channel for talks kept open||Although the farmers’ protest march on Republic Day took a violent turn, leaving many police personnel injured and leading to the destruction of public property, government managers indicated on Wednesday that the Centre will keep its communication channels with farm unions open and its offer to put the three controversial agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months will stay.On January 25, after the 11th round of meetings between the government and the farmers’ unions, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar maintained that the Centre’s proposal to suspend the farm laws for one to one-and-half years was the “best offer” it could make and the farmers should reconsider it.The offer, however, is seen by many farm leaders as a tactic by the government to buy time, particularly keeping in mind the Punjab assembly elections due in February 2022.At least three government managers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that there hasn’t been any thinking so far in the government to withdraw the offer to keep the laws in abeyance in the wake of the violence by a section of the farmers in New Delhi on Tuesday.“It was the final offer from the government and it has not been withdrawn. The violence will be dealt with as per the law but talks with farmers can always continue,” said an official.Another official said the government will be ready to meet farmers’ representatives whenever they are ready. The government has made its offer. It’s up to the farmers now to respond,” a second official said.Two days before the violence broke out in parts of Delhi, Tomar maintained the Centre had made its best offer and would wait for the farmers to return to the negotiating table.“The government has given the best offer to farmers’ unions. I am hopeful that they will convey their decision to us after discussing it among themselves. Once they communicate, we will take it forward,” Tomar said.The first official, however, said the government seem to have an upper hand because public sympathy for the farm law protesters has largely waned after the visuals of chaos in Red Fort, mob violence and attempts to run tractors over policemen emerged on social media.“The government crisis managers might feel they are now better positioned in the negotiations. But thousands of genuine farmers are still out in the street camps and yet to go back to their states. So, the government can’t take it easy,” said the first official.According to the three officials, another round of meetings may take place soon.The government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers staging a massive protest on several of Delhi’s border points since November 26 say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-indicates-offer-to-farmers-still-on-table-channel-for-talks-kept-open-101611792445123.html
28-01-2021||India||Actor, ex-gangster at centre of farmers’ ire||Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana were the primary targets of farmers’ ire on Wednesday as large sections of protesters blamed the duo for provoking violence during the Republic Day tractor rally and instigating their supporters to break through barricades, clash with police, and storm the Red Fort.The farmers accused the two of taking control of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha stage on Monday evening, and pushing farmers to march onto the Outer Ring Road rather than the route decided with the police. HT takes a look at the two people at the centre of the storm:Deep Sidhu, 36A trained lawyer and an amateur basketball player, Sidhu first completed his graduation from Punjabi University, Patiala, and later a degree in Law. After winning the Kingfisher Model Hunt award, he decided to work in films and started his career with ‘Ramta Jogi’ in 2015, produced by actor Dharmendra. He shot to fame with the 2018 Punjabi movie ‘Jora Das Numbria’, in which he played the lead role of a young gangster.He first made news during the 2019 general elections by campaigning for Bollywood actor Sunny Deol from the Gurdaspur constituency on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. Deol won the election but later distanced himself from Sidhu.Around six months ago, he started commenting on political and social issues of Sikhs and Punjab on Facebook, and at times criticised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the central government. He, along with Punjabi singers, joined the farmers’ stir at Shambu barrier on the border with Haryana on September 25.However, singers and other activists disassociated themselves from him after he launched a separate outfit, saying his decision was a conspiracy to torpedo the stir. Sikh intellectual Ajaypal Singh Brar, who was his associate during the Shambu movement, said they distanced themselves from him. “The way he was acting in the stir, we could not go with him, so we parted ways with him,” he added.Two weeks ago, he was summoned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice. He was among several people participating in the two-month-long farmer protests to receive the NIA notice.On Tuesday, he posted a Facebook video around 2pm in which Sidhu could be seen along with his supporters at the Red Fort. Many of them held the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and a young man could be seen climbing a flagstaff in the background, with the ‘kesari’ flag in hand. Sidhu posted another video on Facebook at 5.40pm, where he admitted to hoisting the “Nishan Sahib” but said he did nothing wrong.“When a struggle like this begins, where people’s genuine concerns and rights are ignored, then it makes them very angry and things flare up. In such a case, you cannot blame one person for that display of anger,” he said in the post.Lakha Sidhana, 42﻿﻿Gangster-turned-politician and activist, Lakhbir Singh or Lakha Sidhana, has been mired in controversy for years. A kabaddi player when he was young, Sidhana hails from Rampura-Phull of Bathinda district and first made news as an associate of a prominent local politician. He has gone to jail many times, and currently faces at least 10 criminal cases, including that of land grabbing and murder.He dabbled into politics during the 2012 Punjab assembly elections, contesting on the symbol of the now-defunct People’s Party of Punjab, which was formed by the state’s current Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal after quitting the Shiromani Akali Dal. He was recently accused by SAD leader Parmbans Bunty Romana of assisting the murder of a villager.In 2019, Sidhana hit the headlines in Punjab when he met jail minister Sukhjinder Randhawa to give suggestions on how to improve prison functioning. The development embarrassed the Captain Amarinder Singh government. Sidhana been camping at the Singhu border since November 26 and has claimed in the past that he had quit crime and joined social activism. But he was never a favourite of farm leaders and was seldom allowed to speak from the dais at Singhu border.Sidhana has distanced himself from the violence on Republic Day and said he only marched up to the Outer Ring Road in Delhi. “I am pained at the incidents that took place on Tuesday but I am not involved in these. There is no video, photo or other evidence that shows that I instigated people. We had marched towards the Outer Ring Road under our farmer leaders in a peaceful manner. We never had any agenda of going towards the Red Fort,” said Sidhana.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-ex-gangster-at-centre-of-farmers-ire-101611792059860.html
28-01-2021||India||Jayalalithaa’s residence: Madras HC allows state to hold event on January 28||The Madras high court on Wednesday allowed the Tamil Nadu government to proceed with the inauguration scheduled on January 28 to open late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s residence ‘Veda Nilayam’ as a memorial but did not allow public entry until further hearings on the case. The court observed that it was constrained to allow the opening so that it does not cause difficulties to the government which has already made arrangements when it should have restrained from such a function.Justice N Seshasayee passed the interim order based on writ petitions filed by Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs -- her niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak-- against the government’s acquisition and converting the late AIADMK leader’s residence into a museum and throwing it open to the public on Thursday.Even though the case was posted for February 4, the court heard the case on Wednesday based on their request, “keeping aside the consideration of the main controversy involving the legality of the acquisition.”The opening ceremony, “will not in any way confer any right to the Government, nor deprive the petitioners of their right in the subject matter of the writ petitions,” the court order said. It also placed a list of conditions-- only the main gates can be opened but the building cannot be opened, no flex boards, banners are allowed. Once the function is over the keys of the property have to be handed over to the registrar general of the court.“Since the inventory (of moveable assets) has not been completed, the right, title and the interest of the heirs cannot be marginalised, the justice said during the hearing,” said Deepak’s counsel S L Sudarsanam. The court order also noted that, “So far as movable properties of...Jayalalitha are concerned, they are not even valued, and it is unfair and impermissible for the government to declare open 'Veda Nilayam' as a memorial when the entire acquisition proceedings is not yet complete.”Jayalalithaa has been living in this property which she purchased in the 60s until the time of her death. Her close aide and expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala was her housemate for three decades until she went to a Bengaluru prison in February 2017 and was formally released on January 27. The government enacted a legislation last year establishing a foundation for the property’s upkeep to be turned into a memorial and stated that the property was acquired legally after depositing a compensation of ₹67.9 crore before the civil court in Chennai.The ruling AIADMK government on Wednesday inaugurated an 80-crore phoenix themed mausoleum at Jayalalithaa’s burial place on the Marina beach. On January 28, the chief minister will open Jayalalithaa’s residence at 10.30am following which he would unveil her statue in another complex in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jayalalithaas-residence-madras-hc-allows-state-to-hold-event-on-january-28-101611778053653.html
28-01-2021||India||Fix timeline for judicial appointments, says SC||Even as a new memorandum of procedure (MoP) on judicial appointments is pending for almost four years, the Supreme Court on Wednesday urged the central government to set a fixed timeline for clearing appointments of judges to the high courts and the apex court after receiving the recommendations of the collegium. The court said there were 189 proposals regarding appointments pending with the government as on December 31.Taking a grim view of the situation where certain proposals remain pending before the government for more than six months, an apex court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said that all endeavours should be made to ensure appointments come through in a time-bound manner.Out of the total strength of 1,079 judges in the high courts, there were 411 vacancies — more than a third of the total positions — as of January 1.In 2015, the top court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment, which sought to give the executive a say in the appointment of judges. This judgment held that judicial appointments will be carried on by the recommendations of the collegium, which comprises the CJI and four other most senior Supreme Court judges.In this judgment, the court had also said that a new MoP should be put in place in consultation with the government to guide all future appointments of judges. A draft MoP was sent by the SC collegium to the Union law ministry in March 2017, but the government returned it, suggesting certain improvements.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a written replyto a question in the Lok Sabha in March 2020, informed the House that the government’s suggestions have remained pending with the top court ever since.While the new MoP on eligibility criteria and a timeline for judicial appointments awaits finalisation, the bench, which also included justices Sanjay K Kaul and Surya Kant, on Wednesday called it a “matter of great concern” that the collegium had not heard from the government for months together after making some recommendations. According to the bench, a proposal would get stuck without knowing the reason whether the government had any objection to a certain name or there were other issues.“Suppose you have reservations and send back the names to us, then we can reiterate or can look into your objections. But if you don’t give comments for five months on a collegium recommendation, it is a matter of great concern,” the bench told attorney general KK Venugopal, who represented the Centre.Around a dozen names for appointments to high courts of Allahabad and Bombay have been pending since May and June last year.Underscoring the importance of timely appointments in the constitutional courts, the bench added: “We need to put the house in order. You need to see the bottlenecks and iron them out.”Justice Kaul, during the hearing, also gave an illustration on the pendency at the government’s end, pointing out that even a proposal to appoint some government lawyers as judges had not been cleared expeditiously.“In the last five months, the collegium cleared nine judges for various high courts. Out of them, six names are pending with the government. Out of these six, four are in fact government counsel,” the judge told Venugopal.Justice Kant, referring to a note prepared by justice Kaul about the time taken by the government in processing some appointments, told the A-G that there had been some instances in which the government took more than a year to respond.“You say something is pending with the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and in some cases chief ministers have not responded about appointments in the high courts. But we want to know what is your (Centre’s) timeline,” the judge asked Venugopal, while mentioning the proposals from the high courts of Allahabad and Bombay.On his part, the A-G said that there were attempts being made to bring down the pendency of such cases and many such proposals were now being cleared speedily. Venugopal, however, also admitted that there were some cases that had been “pending for a phenomenal amount of time”.At this point, the CJI cited justice Kaul’s note to highlight that as many as 189 proposals were pending as on December 31 and requested the A-G to study the chart.“The main purpose of the proceedings is to speed up the pendency of appointment of such judges to high courts and is pending with the government. We all need to see a timeline to achieve this target,” the CJI told Venugopal.The government has now been asked to consider laying down a timeline for judicial appointments in the higher judiciary and respond in two weeks.The law ministry did not respond for a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fix-timeline-for-judicial-appointments-says-sc-101611777768049.html
28-01-2021||India||TMC rigged the 2018 panchayat polls, alleges Suvendu Adhikari||The ruling Trinamool Congress had rigged the 2018 panchayat polls, former TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party has alleged.“I was then in the TMC. People of Jhargram and Purulia had voted for the lotus (symbol of BJP). But the TMC used police force that night, till around 3 am, to rig the ballots. It was the BJP who had actually won the Zilla Parishad of Jhargram and Purulia. But the public opinion was never reflected,” Adhikari, who was then the state transport minister and a trusted lieutenant of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, alleged on Wednesday.While the panchayat election in 2003 gained infamy for the death toll, the 2018 polls set a record in the number of seats won without a contest. In 2018, the TMC won uncontested in around 34.2% seats.“The opposition was not allowed to file their nomination. Goons armed with guns and bombs had surrounded the BDO offices, where nominations were to be filed. Opposition leaders were implicated in false cases and some were even abducted to ensure that they are not able to file nominations. They were not allowed to campaign, and violence was unleashed on the polling day,” Adhikari added. He was speaking at a public rally in Jhargram.The TMC, however, hashit back calling it the height of hypocrisy and refuting the charges as baseless allegations.“He is making baseless allegations of which there is no proof. If he was aware of such malpractice, why did he not raise objections at that time? Why now? He should have raised his voice then. This is height of hypocrisy,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.The BJP’s influence in Jangalmahal started growing since 2014. The TMC suffered a blow in the area in the 2018 panchayat elections.In Jhargram district, out of the 780 gram-panchayats, where elections were held, 373 and 329 seats were won by the TMC and the BJP, respectively. Similarly, in Purulia district, of the 1,921 seats, where voting was held, the TMC and the BJP won 754 and 528 gram-panchayat seats, respectively.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP gave the ruling TMC another jolt after it won all the seats that fall under ‘Jangalmahal’ (Purulia, Midnapore, Bishnupur and Jhargram).With assembly elections round the corner, the BJP has already requested the Election Commission of India to deploy central forces at least 15 days before the polls so that free and fair elections can be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-rigged-the-2018-panchayat-polls-alleges-suvendu-adhikari-101611776341177.html

They, however, continued to claim that there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” to thwart the agitation.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha also held a series of meeting late into the night on Wednesday, its confidence shaken as it wondered how to carry on an agitation that had forced the Union government to offer a series of concessions, including a proposal to put the laws on hold.It’s an offer government officials say is still available to the farmers, but that the latter will now have to make the first move.Several key farm leaders were missing from the front ranks of Tuesday’s rally, which they should have been leading, and there appeared to be coordinated action by farmers at all three entry into||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cracks-in-stir-after-mayhem-farmers-call-off-feb-1-march-101611775852629.html

28-01-2021||India||Twitter suspends at least 500 accounts for ‘spam, manipulation’||New Delhi: Microblogging website Twitter on Wednesday took down at least 500 accounts for “spam and platform manipulation”, as the fall out of the farmers’ tractor rally that turned violent in Delhi on Tuesday. “We have taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm and by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends,” a Twitter spokesperson said. The suspendedaccounts included those that called for a separate Sikh state Khalistan. According to the protesting farmers, Twitter had taken down accounts linked to “Sikh/Punjabi news analysis sites, activists, local organisations and Sikh magazines”. These include Sikhsiyasat, Isamvad, Sikhsahadat, Sikhpakh, Panthsj, Malwasikhjatha, Iamparmjit and Kisaanvichaar. “The accounts that have been removed arbitrarily,” said Bhupendra Choudhary, of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Haryana. “The government is suppressing those who are raising their voice against the government. Many people have said we were writing about farmers and our accounts have been suspended. Twitter should take action against those inciting violence, but be transparent about it. There are people saying they have been wronged. “The spokesperson added that the decision was taken using a “combination of technology and human review” and that “Twitter worked at scale and took action judiciously and impartially on hundreds of accounts .... regardless of their political beliefs, background and affiliations”. “We have also applied labels to Tweets that were found to be in violation of synthetic and manipulated media policy. We are monitoring the situation closely and remain vigilant, and strongly encourage those on the service to report anything they believe is in violation of the rules,” the spokesperson added. Twitter did not divulge details of the accounts that were suspended.The people whose accounts have been suspended can file an appeal with Twitter. People familiar with the matter, however, denied that the accounts were linked to any particular group. “It should not be linked or seen in the context of any particular group. To state explicitly, this action is not only limited to accounts that may be linked to the conversation about Khalistan,” a person familiar with the matter said. Twitter’s labelling policy include three categories -- synthetic and manipulated media, civic integrity and Covid-19 misinformation. The policy faced severe criticism after the microblogging site banned former US President Donald Trump. Trump’s account was labelled for violating the civic integrity policy and was eventually taken down. Thousands of farmers drove tractors from the borders of Delhi into the city for a massive tractor rally on Tuesday. Authorities say they defied police orders and turned towards important institutions in the centre of Delhi, creating a security nightmare on Republic Day.They hoisted Sikh religious flags atop the Red Fort from where the Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech. Riot police beat protestors with batons and fired tear gas to scatter mobs at several places in Delhi. In return, the protesters tried to run down policemen with their tractors.Asia Pacific Director at Access Now Raman Chima said that the decision was not transparent, clear and effective. “There is a large amount of content that seems to be taken down by Twitter, lately,” Chima said. “However, there is a genuine lack of transparency with respect to the content that was taken down and later labelled. Some of the content is still unavailable. There are examples, including instances of people calling for violence against protesters, that were only taken down after reports were sent to the Twitter by the media. Twitter’s lack of willingness to talk about the action they have taken is also in direct contradiction with action taken in the US.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-suspends-at-least-500-accounts-for-spam-manipulation-101611773099581.html
