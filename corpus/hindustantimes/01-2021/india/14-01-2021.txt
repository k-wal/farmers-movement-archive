They contain information on vaccine platform, physical specifications, dosage, cold storage requirements, contraindications and minor AEFIs.The health ministry has directed the States/UTs to disseminate information to program managers across all levels and through them to call chain handlers and vaccinators for ready reference.Mentioning precautions and contraindications for Covid-19 vaccination, the letter noted: "Under the emergency use authorisation, Covid-19 vaccination is indicated only for 18 years and above. Interchangeability of Covid-19 vaccine is not permitted. The second dose should also be of the same Covid-19 vaccine which was administered as the first dose."In case of co-administration of vaccines: if required, Covid-19 vaccine and other vaccines should be separated by an interval of at least 14 days, the ministry said.Explaining contraindication, the letter said, "A person with a history of an anaphylactic or allergic reaction to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Immediate or delayed onset anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to vaccine or injection able therapies, pharmaceutical products, food items etc.""Pregnancy and lactation: pregnant and lactating women have not been part of any COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial so far.

14-01-2021||India||After 10-month long Covid-19 isolation, Naveen Patnaik holds 1st public meet||Ahead of civic polls this year and panchayat polls next year, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday broke his 10-month-long Covid-19 isolation as he addressed a meeting in Kalahandi calling it a model of development for the entire country.“Some people were trying to turn Kalahandi into a laboratory of poverty, but the concerted efforts of my government have turned it into a development model for the entire country. It has turned into the rice bowl. Farmers of Kalahandi are now providing food to the nation,” said Patnaik at his first-ever post-Covid-19 public meeting in Kalahandi district where he inaugurated a 43-km long lift irrigation canal. The canal will irrigate over 25,000 hectares of farmland in 38 gram panchayats from Upper Indravati project. Patnaik also announced development projects worth ₹2085 crore.Recounting the experience of his late father and former chief minister Biju Patnaik in Kalahandi, he said Biju Patnaik had visited Bhawanipatna in the 1990s when he was hurled stones at the Statue Chhak.“But, he was least bothered about it as he immensely loved Kalahandi and always dreamt of its development and prosperity. People of Kalahandi love me a lot and I also love them. I will work 10 times more for the development of Kalahandi in comparison to the drops of blood I have shed in Kalahandi,” he said.For Thursday’s meeting 2500 people were allowed into a barricaded area after they tested negative for Covid-19. However, leader of opposition in the Odisha Assembly and BJP’s Bhawanipatna MLA Pradipta Naik boycotted the meeting protesting erection of a separate stage for the chief minister.“A separate special stage has been set for the Chief Minister while another stage has been constructed for other leaders. Then why did we undergo a Covid-19 test? Even after being diagnosed Covid-19 negative, we were not allowed to share the stage with the CM in today’s mega event in Kalahandi district. This is a clear sign of the feudal system in a democracy. Even though it is completely a government programme, the chief minister has organised the event on his party lines” said Naik, alleging that despite the canal being built with 90% central funds, the state government was claiming sole credit for the projects.BJP MP from Kalahandi Basant Panda welcomed the launch of a slew of development projects on Thursday. While refusing to comment on the boycott of the meet by Odisha Assembly LoP, Panda said, “We support the development of Kalahandi. But the state government should also clear land requirements for the wagon factory in Narla and medical college at Kalahandi.”Political analysts said the chief minister's visit to Kalahandi amid the Covid-19 pandemic was a signal that the party is desperate to rebuild its base in western Odisha that has come under siege from BJP. For Thursday’s meeting, the party had sent 69 of its MLAs and ministers to arrange crowds in 38 gram panchayats where farmlands would be irrigated by the Indravati waters.Maheswar Duriya, assistant professor of political science in the government autonomous college in Bhawanipatna, said the ruling party is making a concerted attempt to mount a challenge to the rising BJP. “In 2017 panchayat polls, BJP won 33 of the 36 Zillah Parishad seats while in 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, it won the MP seat and the Bhawanipatna assembly seat. Though BJD won more number of MLA seats in Kalahandi, its popularity has gone down considerably due to the image of its local leaders. I think BJD will hold more such meetings of Patnaik in western Odisha to check BJP's support base,” said Duriya.Rabi Das, another political analyst, said Patnaik is well aware of BJP's plan to mount a serious challenge to BJD's rule after the Bengal assembly polls are over in April. “The CM knows BJP will not wait till 2024 for a chance to win Odisha. It's natural for Patnaik to keep BJP engaged in western Odisha and win back its voters,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-10-month-long-covid-19-isolation-naveen-patnaik-holds-1st-public-meet-101610647531745.html

Families of the deceased were given a compensation of ₹2 lakh each while those seriously ill were given ₹50,000 each.The condition of three others who are under treatment is critical, officials said.The district collector has formed a committee to investigate the matter.On Tuesday evening, around a dozen people had drank illicit country-made liquor at Chak Samari village in the district, following which their health deteriorated.They were rushed to Rupwas community health centre, where two of them were declared brought dead. Five others died during treatment, principal medical officer Dr Navdeep Saini said.The deceased were identified as Pappu Kushwaha, Maangi Kushwaha, Kampotar Kushwaha, Ramjeet Kushwaha, Vasudev Kushwaha, Padam Singh and Mangilal.Three others, Santosh, Lallu Ram and Ravi were referred to Jaipur on Thursday morning after their condition deteriorated, officials said.“Seven have died so far while the condition of three is critical. They have been sent to Jaipur for treatment. The reason behind the incident is poisonous liquor,” said Nathmal Didel, district collector, Bharatpur.Bharatpur superintendent of police Devendra Kumar BIshnoi and Bharatpur range inspector general of police Prassana Kumar Khamesara visited the village after the incident.“Police and excise department officials were directed to trace illegal liquor selling points to take action against them. Prima facie, the incident took place due to poisonous liquor, but the exact reason will be known after the post mortem reports,” Didel said.Villagers accused the district administration of not paying attention to their demand for action against the sale of illicit liquor in the area. “We approached officials many times to request action against the sale of illegal liquor, but no action was taken,” said a villager on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharatpur-hooch-tragedy-toll-rises-to-7-district-excise-officer-cops-suspended-101610646800551.html

The situation is believed to be the outcome of the China-Australia trade dispute.Great Eastern Shipping Company, the owner of MV Jag Anand, decided to undertake a crew change in the Japanese port of Chiba, where the ship will disembark its 23 Indian crew members, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “The disembarking crew will be flown back to their hometowns in India from Tokyo,” he said.“As regards MV Anastasia, we are closely coordinating with the Chinese authorities who are finalising the process or standard operating procedures to effect crew change at anchorage. As soon as this is received from the Chinese authorities, the company is expected to initiate the process of crew change,” he added.MV Jag Anand had been at anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, while MV Anastasia – with 16 Indians on board – has been on anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20.The external affairs ministry and the Indian mission in Beijing have been continuously pursuing the matter with China so that the two vessels could carry out a crew change and the Indian seafarers could be brought home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/working-on-bringing-home-16-indian-sailors-stranded-in-chinese-waters-mea-101610646127198.html

We will decide what to do next based on how the government will behave. One committee member has already resigned which is a good thing,” Pal was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier on Thursday, Mann recused himself from the committee and said that his allegiance remains with farmers across the country. While staying the implementation of the three central farm laws on January 12, the Supreme Court had appointed committee with Mann, president of Maharashtra's Shetkeri Sangthana Anil Ghanwat; Pramod Kumar Joshi, the director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati as members to resolve the impasse between the government and the farmers who have been protesting for the past seven weeks.Mann is the national president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).“I am thankful to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India for nominating me in the four-member committee to start dialogue with kisan unions on the three laws brought in by the central government. As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions among the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country,” Mann said in a letter tweeted by BKU.The government and the farm unions held eight rounds of discussions but could not arrive at a resolution regarding the farm bills. Farmers claim that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, will allow corporates to enter and earn profits from the agricultural sector affecting farmers’ incomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/darshan-pal-welcomes-mann-s-decision-to-recuse-himself-101610645636939.html

In a series of tweets, he also answered questions about side effects and catching Covid-19 even after getting vaccinated.Vardhan used informative tweets, along with graphics, to allay fears of the people before the vaccination begins.After being administered #COVID19Vaccine, some individuals may have side effects like mild fever, pain at injection site & bodyache.

The caller tune disseminates information about the disease and how to prevent it.In the last few months, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan lent his voice for the novel initiative. But now, there are reports that his voice is being replaced with a new one.Some media reports quoted sources in the Union health ministry to say that the new voice - which will be that of a female - will inform people about the vaccination drive which will begin from January 16.The drive, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world's biggest, will see inoculation of healthcare and other frontline workers who have been engaged in treating and helping the people affected by Covid-19. About 30 millions such workers are expected to be vaccinated in the first phase of the drive.Earlier this month, a Public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Centre to remove Bachchan’s voice from the caller tune on the grounds that he himself, along with some family members, had been infected by the virus.The matter has been listed for hearing on January 18.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday released details about the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive scheduled to begin on Saturday.In a statement, the PMO said that over 3,000 sites across all states and union territories (UTs) will be virtually connected when Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches the drive via video conferencing on January 16.In the second phase, people above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million will be inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-caller-tune-with-amitabh-bachchan-s-voice-to-be-replaced-with-new-one-report-101610643531417.html
14-01-2021||India||NCP to decide Maharashtra Minister Dhananjay Munde's fate over rape allegations||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said that the allegations or rape and sexual exploitation against Maharashtra social justice minister and a senior leader of the party Dhananjay Munde are serious and the party will take a call on his fate.Pawar's statement is being seen as an indication that the party leadership may ask Munde to tender his resignation. Munde also said he will accept any decision taken by the party.“The allegations being made against Munde are serious in nature. Being a political party we will have to discuss it and take a decision considering all the views. Munde has explained the matter in detail and it is my responsibility to convey it to the senior leaders and take the next step as soon as possible. I don’t think this should be delayed,” Pawar told reporters, in his response on allegations against the social justice minister.Munde has found himself in the centre of a controversy after a woman accused him of rape on the pretext of marriage and other favours. The woman, an aspiring singer, alleged that the police were not accepting her written complaint against the minister and that her life is under threat. Munde, however, claimed that the woman is trying to defame and blackmail him.On Thursday afternoon, Munde went to the NCP headquarters and conducted proceedings of the weekly janata darbar. Before that, he also met the state NCP chief Jayant Patil. Senior NCP leader Praful Patel also met Pawar at his residence where the leaders are said to have discussed the issue in detail.Patil said that it would be unfair to take any action without going into details of the allegations. “Munde has already gone to the Bombay high court over calls of threat and blackmail from a woman and police are investigating the matter. Allegations are serious but taking action without verifying the fact would be improper,” Patil told reporters outside NCP headquarters.Meanwhile, in a new twist to the drama, BJP leader and former MLA Krishna Hegde on Thursday accused the same woman of a honey trap and harassment for years. He also filed a complaint with the Mumbai police against the woman."The woman used to call and say we are in a relationship but I kept avoiding her. It started in 2010 and continued till 2015. Although I blocked her many times she used to call me from another number. I didn’t know her intention so I did some background check and found out things were not very right. I didn’t want to come out and say anything about a lady as it also didn’t concern me because I never met her.”"But when this episode of Mr Munde came to the fore I realised she is a serial offender. First she did it with me, she must have done it with someone else and now doing it with Dhananjay Munde. I felt somewhere this thing had to be stopped and thus registered an official police complaint. When I was going to the police station, Manish Dhuri from MNS also called me and informed me that he had a similar experience with that lady,” Hegde said.Manish Dhuri from Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in Mumbai also alleged that the woman first tried to honey trap him by calling at her flat in Andheri a few years ago.“It was in 2008-2009 when she messaged me from a VIP number and a conversation started between us. It turned into a friendship and one day she asked me to come at a flat saying her sister wanted to meet. She tried to get intimate with me saying that no one was at home. But I felt someone was there who may want to click our pictures. I could sense her intention and left the place as soon as possible. Since then, I started avoiding her calls and messages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-to-decide-maharashtra-minister-dhananjay-munde-s-fate-over-rape-allegations-101610643706103.html
14-01-2021||India||Go to Delhi, BS Yediyurappa dares BJP MLAs dejected with cabinet expansion||A day after Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa finally completed a long-awaited cabinet expansion by adding seven new members and dropping one, several BJP leaders on Thursday expressed unhappiness over regional and caste imbalance.In the 33-member cabinet, 13 ministers belong to just two districts of Bengaluru and Belgavi, with several of the remaining 28 districts not even having token representation in the ministry.While capital city Bengaluru has eight ministers, Belgavi has five representatives in the state cabinet.Senior BJP leader and former minister S A Ramdas expressed unhappiness at Mysuru district not having a representative in the cabinet."It is unfortunate that no legislator from Mysuru was considered for induction. It is essential to have a region wise balance," Ramadas told HT. The CM's political secretary M P Renukacharya too lammented the lack of representation to Davangere district. Renuckacharya who failed to get a cabinet berth despite intense lobbying now intends to take his grievance to the party high command in Delhi."Unlike other leaders who hide the real reason for going to Delhi, I am openly saying that I will go to Delhi and meet party seniors to seek justice," Renukacharya told reporters on Thursday.Apart from the regional imbalance, the other grouse that several BJP leaders have is about over representation of some castes and under representation of others.Analysts point out that the cabinet has 11 Lingayat members including the chief minister. Lingayats are estimated to be a sixth of the population but have a third of all cabinet berths.A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified said the party hopes to rectify the imbalance. “Yes, it is a fact that the Lingayat community has backed the party more than others and thus we have more legislators belonging to that community and thus higher representation. However, this is something which we hope to rectify in the long run."Vokkaligas the second largest community has seven representatives, four Kurbas and five Scheduled Caste and two Scheduled Tribes members. Brahmins and OBCs have two representatives each.Sunil Kumar, a three-term MLA from Karkala who was expecting a cabinet berth but did not make it, even tweeted about saying that while he was a loyal party worker, he did not know the method of 'caste glorification' to get a cabinet berth.Despite the grumblings of unhappy lawmakers, Yediyurappa remained unfazed and said "If any of them (legislators) have reservations (about cabinet expansion), let them go to Delhi and complain to the national leadership of BJP."However Yediyurappa's bitter critic within the party, Vijaypura MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal continued his tirade against the CM and alleged that he had been blackmailed."It is unfortunate that blackmailers have got cabinet berths. Some of Yediyurappa's CDs recorded by his own grandson are not viewable and some have used it to blackmail him and get cabinet berths," Yatnal told reporters.Karnataka’s Congress unit president DK Shivakumar demanded that a judicial inquiry should be held into what these CDs are and who are the people who allegedly have the possession.Leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramiah said, "A BJP MLA himself is alleging that several BJP leaders got cabinet berths by blackmailing the CM. Does Yediyurappa have the courage to file a criminal case against those who have blackmailed him?"The CM has not responded to Yatnal's allegations even as state unit chief Nalin Kumar Kateel had earlier said that he had recommended disciplinary action against the Vijaypura MLA for making accusations against Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/go-to-delhi-bs-yediyurappa-dares-bjp-mlas-dejected-with-cabinet-expansion-101610640966047.html

Usually five to six lakh pilgrims throng the hill temple on Makara Vilakku day marking the end of the pilgrimage season, but this time policemen and officials outnumbered pilgrims.The state government has restricted the number to 5.000 due to Covid-19 and put severe conditions on pilgrims. Though the cash-strapped Travancore Devasom Board (TDB), which runs the temple asked the government to hike the number to 20,000 the government has turned the request down considering the surge of Covid-19 cases.Once lauded for its Covid-19 control management, the state has turned a virus hotspot since last month. On Thursday, it reported 5,490 new cases with a test positivity rate of 8.11%. The active caseload in the state is 66,503-- now at least one-fourth of the total cases in the country are from Kerala, latest statistics show.The meagre footfall at the temple has drained the plush coffers of the temple and it has asked the government for a bail-out package. “Our total revenue reduced by 20 per cent when compared to the last few years. We have approached the government for ₹100 crore to tide over the crisis,” said TDB president N Vasu. He said usually Sabarimala revenue was pumped to fund other temples in Travancore region (south Kerala) and low returns have affected even salaries of the employees.During the last pilgrimage season— November 2019 to January 2020—the total revenue of the temple was ₹263.57 crore. Aravana payasam -- a black kheer made of rice, jaggery, ghee and cardamom-- forms 60 per cent of the temple revenue. But this time it was reduced to 20 per cent and in the last two weeks the revenue was ₹15 crore, said Vasu adding it was less than a single-day revenue during the normal season.Pilgrims from five south Indian states swarm the temple nestled in the Western Ghats in Pathanamitta district during the annual season and it is often considered the largest seasonal pilgrimage after Mecca. During peak season at least 5 lakh pilgrims trek to the shrine on a day, temple statistics show.The temple had witnessed unrest in 2018 after the Supreme Court opened its doors for women of all ages-- women of reproductive age are barred at the temple citing the eternal celibate status (naishtika brahmachari) of the deity, Lord Ayyappa. A larger bench of the SC is hearing the case now.Pilgrimage to the temple is unique in many ways-- a secular temple, all are welcome here. There is a small mosque at the hilltop (Vavar Swami, considered a disciple of presiding deity Lord Ayyappa) and devotees will have to pay obeisance there before entering the sanctum sanctorum. A devotee will have to take a 40-day fast abstaining from all worldly affairs and he will be known as ‘Swami’ once he puts the black bead and dress. At the top of the temple there is an inscription in Malayalam ‘Tatvamasi’, which translates “I am you”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-sees-subdued-makara-vilakku-cash-strapped-temple-seeks-govt-help-101610640466699.html

Once inside the monk’s chamber, the victim was allegedly subjected to unnatural anal sex, a punishable offence under section 377 of the Indian Penal code.The defence counsel pleaded that the accused had been falsely implicated in the case and that the witnesses were influenced.On the other hand, the special prosecutor argued that the prosecution had successfully proved its case, and since the accused had been involved in an unnatural sexual act, he should be given severe punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monk-from-royal-thai-monastery-jailed-for-10-years-for-sex-with-teen-in-bihar-101610639962554.html
14-01-2021||India||Joint commission meet with Nepal not right forum for taking up border row: India||India on Thursday signalled that a joint commission meeting with Nepal on Friday was not the appropriate forum for discussing a border row, as Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali began a two-day visit aimed at shoring up bilateral ties.Gyawali is the senior-most Nepalese leader to visit India in more than a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. He is also the first leader to visit New Delhi since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli triggered political turmoil by dissolving Nepal's Parliament last month and calling early elections.Nepal’s foreign ministry, while announcing the visit on Tuesday, said in a statement that the joint commission will discuss the gamut of bilateral relations, including the boundary issue, Covid-19 cooperation, infrastructure, connectivity, trade and transit.However, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava made it clear the joint commission wouldn’t be the right forum to discuss the border issue. “Our position on the boundary issue is well known. Let me say that the joint commission meeting and boundary talks are separate mechanisms,” he told a weekly briefing.“The joint commission is an important mechanism that provides the opportunity of reviewing at a high level the entire gamut of our bilateral partnership and providing political guidance to further enhance the special and unique ties that we enjoy,” he said, adding India is looking forward to “constructive discussions” on numerous sectors.Gyawali will meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar for talks on Friday, after which they will chair the joint commission meet. This will be only the sixth meeting of the body since 1987, though it has convened four times since 2014. Gyawali also held several private meetings on Thursday.The Nepalese delegation includes the foreign secretary and health secretary, reflecting the focus on Covid-19 cooperation. Though Nepal has formally reached out to India and China for vaccines, Kathmandu has indicated a preference for sourcing doses from New Delhi because of factors such as pricing, logistics and well-established links between the health sectors of the two countries.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Nepal is hoping India will provide vaccines as assistance to inoculate some portion of the 12 million people it plans to cover in its first phase of vaccinations. Nepal also plans to buy millions of doses from foreign suppliers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.India has said its ability to export vaccines after meeting domestic needs will become clear over the next few weeks. Officials have also said India’s neighbours will get priority for the supply of vaccines.India-Nepal ties came under the shadow of the border row last year after Oli issued a new political map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a strategic road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China.The external affairs ministry described Nepal’s new map as “unjustified cartographic assertion”, and the people said the focus of Friday’s meeting will be taking forward development cooperation, including India-backed projects in Nepal.Given that Oli currently heads a caretaker government, there is unlikely to be any substantive movement on the border issue. One option the two sides could look at is asking the bilateral boundary working group to look afresh at ways to finalise the border in disputed sections at Kalapani and Susta.Before Oli’s sudden decision to dissolve Parliament, normalcy was restored in bilateral ties by back-to-back visits to Kathmandu last year by Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla.India has been keeping a wary eye on China’s efforts to broker an understanding between Oli and his main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, in order to keep the Nepal Communist Party united.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said Nepal is among the “borderline countries” in India’s neighbourhood, with which ties require “constant nurturing and hand-holding”.“India’s thrust over the past few months shows that it has adopted a very clear and calibrated approach while keeping political and diplomatic channels open. Cordial cooperative ties are in the interest of both sides, though there are challenges,” he said, adding the Nepalese side may opt to raise the border issue but the joint commission wasn’t the forum to discuss such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joint-commission-meet-with-nepal-not-right-forum-for-taking-up-border-row-india-101610638644786.html

Negative ones will be taken to a quarantine facility for 7 days followed by 7 days home quarantine,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had tweeted.He had further said that this has been done “to protect Delhiites from exposure to virus from UK”.“As a matter of abundant precaution, in view of the increased transmissibility of the new variant, it is decided that all travellers coming from the UK to India would be mandatorily subjected to self-paid RT-PCR tests on arrival at the airport. Those who are found positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility in a separate (isolation) unit as per existing laid down protocol. Those who are found negative shall be kept in compulsory institutional quarantine for a period of seven days followed by seven days of home quarantine,” read the order.The new variant of coronavirus disease – B.1.1.7 – has been dubbed as highly infectious by scientists and medical experts as the UK government has confirmed that the infection rates have increased faster than expected in the affected areas where the new strain has been circulating and stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.Delhi on Thursday reported 340 new cases of coronavirus taking the total count of cases to 6,31,249.So far, a total of 109 cases from the UK strain of coronavirus have been reported from across the country.In a proactive approach to fight the virus outbreak, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a Covid-19 vaccination drive that is scheduled to start on January 16 and will be done across 81 locations in the national capital."So far, we have received 2,74,000 doses of vaccine from the Centre. Each person will be administered two doses and Centre provides 10 per cent extra vaccine, taking damage into account. So the 2,74,000 doses will be sufficient for around 1,20,000 health workers," Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-extends-14-day-quarantine-order-till-january-31-for-uk-returnees-101610636055606.html
14-01-2021||India||Activist Anna Hazare writes to PM seeking assurance on fixing MSP for farmers||Social activist Anna Hazare on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that farmers should get 50 pc more than the cost of inputs but they do not get it though the government had given assurances in this regard in the past.The letter in Hindi said, "The written assurance given by your government on March 29, 2018 after seven days of my fast at Ramlila Maidan, New Delhi, has not yet been complied with. This is with regard to complying with the assurance and regarding fast in January.""Your government has accepted the Ahwal (recommendations) of Swaminathan Commission. If accepted, it is necessary to follow them. The recommendation of the Swaminathan Commission says that 50 per cent of the cost price of agricultural produce should be increased while fixing the MSP. On this demand, we had a fast in Ramlila Maidan on 23 March 2018. On 29/03/2018 you sent the Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the then Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis with written assurance from the Prime Minister's office," the letter read.Hazare stated in the letter that it was written in the assurance that the decision has been taken by the Central Government to fix the minimum support price (MSP) 50 per cent more than the cost. And it is also mentioned in the budget speech. And it will be followed. Such assurance was given in writing.As per the letter, while fixing the minimum support price of agricultural produce which comes at the cost of the crop the flowing are included-- the labour of the farmers, cattle or machine is hired, the cost of the seed, the value of the fertilizer, the value of electricity, the value of the irrigation, the land revenue, the insecticide (the insecticide), the herbicide (the herbicide), the khurpani (weeding), and the nangarni (ploughing).As per Swaminathan Commission, the farmers should get 50 per cent more than the cost price. But due to the reduction by the Central Agricultural Price Commission (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), the farmers do not get more than 50 per cent of the cost price. Also the farmers do not even get the cost price of their produce. That is why they commit suicide, Hazare said in the letter.He said, "As per our Constitution, it is the responsibility of the public welfare government to ensure that no one is exploited. They get the right labour price. This is their right. But the farmer of our country who nourishes the public is only exploited. Because of that, he commits suicide. It is necessary to give 50 per cent more than the cost price for agricultural produce. You gave us a written assurance."Hazare then said that he will go on a hunger strike in January end."I have corresponded with you five times in this matter so far. But no answer has come. That is why I have decided to go on a hunger strike in the end of January. To get Ramlila Maidan as venue, four letters have been written to that authority. I did not get an answer yet," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activist-anna-hazare-writes-to-pm-seeking-assurance-on-fixing-msp-for-farmers-101610636909755.html

He responds||Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria on Thursday said that the soon-to-be ordered LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jets would be way ahead of the JF-17 fighter planes operated by the Pakistan Air Force.The JF-17 has been jointly developed by China and Pakistan.With its advanced weapons and sensors, the LCA Mk-1A jets will have good strike capability, he told news channels a day after India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved a ₹48,000-crore proposal to buy 83 advanced jets to bolster the IAF’s combat potential.“There is no comparison with the JF-17,” he said.The air chief added that even the existing final operational clearance (FOC) variant of the LCA was superior to the JF-17. He said the LCA Mk-1 jets would be equipped with the indigenous Astra beyond visual range missiles.Also Watch | ‘LCA Tejas well ahead of Pakistan-China’s JF-17 aircraft’: IAF chief BhadauriaThe CCS approval came 10 months after the ministry gave a green light to the purchase of 83 Mk-1A jets from state-owned plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft. HAL is expected to deliver the first Mk-1A jet to the IAF three years after the deal is signed, with all the aircraft likely to be delivered by 2028-29. The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced FOC configurations.The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejas-jets-no-comparison-to-china-pak-s-j-17-fighters-air-force-chief-101610635825525.html

There is no stock of perishable items in this whole sale market. Whatever surplus like onions and potatoes we had after the snowfall has almost finished,” said Bashir Ahmad Bashir, President of the Parimpora Mandi and chairman of Kashmir Fruit Growers cum Dealers Union.He said that whatever little is left is with the retailers that are being sold at very high rates. “At this time we mostly get our vegetables from outside because it is winter time with no local production,” he said.He said that hundreds of fruit laden trucks on the way to Jammu were also stranded on the highway.The prices of vegetables like onion have almost doubled while meat is also in short supply.“The vegetables are also in short supply. Onions are ₹70 per kg while potatoes are ₹50. Peas are not available. People are now mostly relying on locally produced Haakh and turnips. The highway is still feared to be closed for another 10 days. Let’s see how much we will sustain,” said Mohammad Amin, a grocery and vegetable seller in Srinagar’s Old City.Director Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department Kashmir, Bashir Khan said that the valley has enough stock of food grains to last for two months, gas for 15 days, petrol and diesel for 8-10 days. He conceded that there is less quantity of these things in the market and if in a few more days they get depleted further, the people should opt for dry vegetables.“What can be done we have to bear with the system till the highway is opened. Although we still have availability of green leafed vegetables, if there is scarcity after a few days, we should change our food taste,” he said.He said there are examples of snow-locked places like Karnah and Tanghdar. “They switch over to dry vegetables,” he said.Manzoor Ahmed Mir, Superintendent of Police (Traffic), Rural Kashmir said over 8,500 vehicles including empty and fruit laden trucks were stranded on the Kashmir side of the highway. “Most of these drivers are spending their nights in their vehicles,” he said.The minimum temperatures in Kashmir have been plunging to records levels. Srinagar recorded minus 8.5 degree Celsius on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, lowest to be recorded in January in the past 25 years.Jatinder Singh Johar,SSP Traffic, National Highway in Ramban, said that the work on the repair of the wall as well as on the construction of a Bailey bridge was underway.“The actual bridge will take 10-15 days to be motorable as it takes time for the concrete to set in. The BRO is also working on the Bailey bridge and let’s see how much time it will take,” Johar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammusrinagar-road-blockage-sparks-scarcity-of-essential-commodities-in-kashmir-101610635733801.html

The court approved the decision of the state and sought details of the probe undertaken by the new officer to be submitted in court within four weeks.The victim’s mother had approached the court seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in July 2020. In her petition, she highlighted instances to show unwillingness on tpart of the police to follow leads to identify the culprits behind her daughter's tragic end. The victim died on October 17, 2019 and a suicide note left by her described the manner in which she was tormented and sexually harassed by her supervisor and colleagues at Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Hyderabad. An attempt to rape her at the office premises traumatized her, acting as the trigger for her suicide. The victim had revealed this fact to her sister a day before her death.A three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar heard the petition on January 11 and examined the affidavit presented by VC Sajjanar, Commissioner of Police, Cyberabad giving details of the investigation conducted so far. The Telangana government on its own assured to entrust some senior official to conduct further investigation with immediate effect. The bench, also comprising Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, recorded this assurance in its order and sought a detailed progress report from the state by February 10, the next date of hearingEarlier, on December 5, the Court had made strong observations with regard to the insensitivity shown by the police in handling the probe in this case. The Court directed the Telangana Home Secretary to personally examine the matter and issue appropriate orders. The probe since then picked up pace.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava who appeared for the victim’s mother said, “Following the Supreme Court monitoring, the investigation is now progressing in a just and fair manner. In the light of the recent evidences gathered, which I cannot disclose, the petitioner is quite confident of getting justice.”The bench told the state not to reveal details of investigation as the probe was still on. The top court clarified in the order that the move to entrust probe of the case to a senior police official shall not be seen as a reflection on the investigation conducted so far.The victim, aged 33, had joined BHEL in July 2009 and maintained a good track record. A week prior to the incident, the victim filed a complaint before the Cyber Cell of the Telangana Police alleging that her colleagues (named in the suicide note) hacked her mobile phone. No action was taken on her complaint. After her death, the police took 40 days to unlock her phone and made no attempts to retrieve data from the phones of the accused named in the suicide note, the victim’s mother stated in her petition.The mother accused the police of botching up the probe in order to give a clean chit to the accused. She had earlier approached the National Commission for Women (NCW) with a complaint. In response, the Telangana Police filed a report on June 2, 2020 telling the Commission that no material was available against the persons named in the suicide note. For eight months after the victim’s death, no charge sheet was filed. The police alleged that the death was a result of her alleged mental illness although BHEL testified her to be mentally fit.Bringing all this on record before the Supreme Court, the victim’s mother, a resident of Bhopal filed a writ petition seeking investigation of the case to be transferred from Telangana Police to an independent agency such as CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-hyderabad-police-officer-to-probe-bhel-suicide-case-telangana-tells-sc-101610634463120.html

14-01-2021||India||The return of traffic congestion||Traffic congestion in four of India’s major cities – Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, and Pune – have crawled back very close to levels seen before the Covid-induced lockdown, which had caused global annual traffic congestion to fall for the first time in at least 10 years, a report released on Wednesday showed.Every year, Amsterdam-based location technology specialist TomTom releases the TomTom Traffic Index, a report detailing the traffic situation in 416 cities in 57 countries. The firm’s traffic data is powered by 600 million connected devices ranging from cellphone carrier data to vehicular GPS data.What is Congestion level percentage?Congestion level percentage is the extra travel time a driver experiences compared to an uncongested situation. The report determines a baseline by calculating the pace of free-flow travel time in a region. For instance, a 50% congesting level means that an hour-long journey would take 30 minutes more (so an hour-and-a-half) than it would during the city’s uncongested conditions.Indian cities congested again In India, the big change is how far congestion levels have fallen due to the global pandemic, and how by the end of December, most cities were again very close to levels before the pandemic.New Delhi saw a decrease (average of 9%) in congestion, and an 18% and 14% average decrease in congestion during morning and evening rush hours respectively. The other three cities from India featured in the Index – Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Pune saw an average decrease in congestion levels by 12%, 20%, and 17% respectively.Global rankings Overall, Moscow was the world’s most congested city in 2020, despite a congestion fall of 8% from 2019. Bengaluru was the most-congested city in the world in 2019, but it fell to 6th spot in 2020 with nearly a 30% of drop in traffic year-on-year.Despite drop in congestion levels, three cities from India featured in the TomTom Traffic Index’s global top 10 list – Mumbai (2nd), Bengaluru (6th), and New Delhi (8th). Pune, the only other Indian city mapped in the overall rankings, was on the 16th spot.Need for action Werner van Huyssteen, TomTom India, general manager, said, “Although traffic congestion in India was down in 2020, it’s not going to become a trend unless we take action. We might even see traffic levels shoot up again as people get back to work and back into old routines. That’s why now is the time that India’s city planners, policy makers, employers – and drivers – must take stock of what they will do to make the roads less congested in the future."Source: TomTom Traffic Index, 2020||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-return-of-traffic-congestion-101610611876079.html

He also said the Centre will bear the cost of vaccination for healthcare and frontline workers.The Prime Minister is also expected to interact with healthcare workers who would receive the vaccine shots.The roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine will provide priority to the healthcare workers and the frontline workers who are estimated to be around 30 million in the first phase, followed by those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million.The vaccination drive will begin with 10 million healthcare workers from across the country.Three phases of dry runs have already been conducted across the country to prepare health authorities for the vaccination drive and identify and rectify the shortcomings.Two Covid-19 vaccines - Oxford University-Astrazeneca's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin - have been given emergency use authorisation after a high-level meeting chaired by PM Modi. These vaccines may cost in the range of ₹200 to ₹295 in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panindia-launch-of-covid-19-vaccination-programme-at-10-30-am-on-jan-16-pmo-101610633544293.html
14-01-2021||India||SC-appointed panel on farm laws should have been truly independent: Sharad Pawar||NCP chief Sharad Pawar has questioned the composition of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to discuss the contentious farm laws with protesting farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court.He welcomed the intervention in the issue by the apex court but said that the members of the committee have supported the three farm laws in the past and thus farmers do not have faith in the panel. He said that the committee should have been independent in the true sense.The Supreme Court formed a four-member committee on Tuesday to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court on Tuesday. It comprises Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agriculture economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana).On Thursday, Maan opted out of the committee citing “farmers’ interests”.“I welcome the intervention made by the SC but if you see the composition of the committee, all the members have supported the farm bills at different points of time in some or other way. This is the reason farmers do not have faith in the committee and believe that nothing will come out of the discussions with it and I share the same view,” Pawar told reporters in South Mumbai on Thursday."An independent committee in the true sense should have been appointed," the former agriculture minister said.He also expressed discontent at the way the Centre has handled the farmers' agitation.“It would have been better if the central government would have understood the seriousness of the issue," Pawar said.Despite a severe cold wave, the farmers, many of them with their families have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for 50 days now seeking the repeal of the farm laws.The farm unions have said they would not interact with the committee because all the members in it had previously indicated their support for the controversial laws. They have also insisted that the protest would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scappointed-panel-on-farm-laws-should-have-been-truly-independent-sharad-pawar-101610632545583.html
14-01-2021||India||Ban on Delhi poultry markets lifted after samples test negative for bird flu||The three civic bodies — north, east and south — on Thursday decided to withdraw its order regarding ban on the storage, packaging and sale of poultry and live birds across the national capital. The development comes after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that laboratory reports suggested that the avian influenza had not affected poultry birds in Delhi. He had instructed the civic bodies to allow poultry markets to re-open and withdraw the temporary restrictions on import of live birds and packaged chicken from other states.The ban on sale and storage of poultry, its products and chicken was imposed by the three municipalities on Wednesday.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “The ban on sale-purchase, processing and packaging of poultry meat and products, including serving of cooked or half cooked poultry products, in restaurants and hotels has been withdrawn with immediate effect.”He said that the decision has been taken after due discussion in the video conference with Union minister of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, Giriraj Singh. The meeting was attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, all the three mayors and commissioners of the three civic bodies.Municipal officials said that bird flu tests of the samples collected from Ghazipur poultry market were found to be negative and orders were issued on Thursday to open the wholesale market by the Delhi government.Nirmal Jain, mayor East Delhi Municipal Corporation, also confirmed the development and said that precautions for bird flu would be continued to be taken by the concerned departments. He appealed to the public to follow the guidelines, and safety procedures.The Delhi government on Monday had confirmed that the avian influenza has hit the national Capital and accordingly had shut the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the entry of live birds into the city without proper health certification from authorised veterinarians.The government, later, also had prohibited the sale of packaged or processed chicken brought from outside Delhi. But, it had not put a total ban on sale of chicken and eggs within the city.On Wednesday, the north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations went a step further and imposed a complete ban on any form of activity related to poultry and live birds including prohibiting restaurants and hotels from serving any item containing chicken or eggs to their customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-delhi-poultry-markets-lifted-after-samples-test-negative-for-bird-flu-101610632426992.html
14-01-2021||India||No foreign chief guest at Republic Day parade amid Covid-19, says Centre||India on Thursday confirmed that there won’t be a foreign head of state or government as the chief guest at this year’s Republic Day celebrations, only the fourth time this has happened since independence in 1947.It had been widely anticipated that India would go ahead with the annual Republic Day parade without a chief guest after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson – the dignitary invited this year – cancelled his planned visit to India to focus on countering a recent surge in Covid-19 infections in Britain.Hindustan Times had reported the government decision on Monday. On Thursday, the formal announcement was made.“Due to the global Covid-19 situation, it has been decided that this year, there will not be a foreign head of state or head of government as the chief guest for our Republic Day event,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a regular news briefing.The only other years when a foreign chief guest wasn’t present at the Republic Day parade were 1952, 1953 and 1966.This year’s parade will also be shorter, involve fewer participants and only a fourth of the usual number of spectators will be allowed at Rajpath because of Covid-19-related restrictions.A 122-member tri-services contingent from Bangladesh will be part of the Republic Day parade, only the second time foreign troops have joined the annual showcase of military might and the country’s diverse culture. In 2016, a French contingent had participated in the parade.Bangladesh has been invited to participate in this year’s parade because the two countries are commemorating 50 years of diplomatic ties this year. The Bangladeshi tri-services contingent was flown into New Delhi on a C-17 heavy-lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force.“This is testimony to our ties, which are forged in shared sacrifice. This year will be historic in our relations as we are also commemorating the 50th anniversary of [Bangladesh’s] liberation war,” Srivastava said.During a virtual summit of the prime ministers of the two countries in December, New Delhi and Dhaka agreed to jointly organise several activities to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties and the liberation war in India, Bangladesh and third countries.“A number of events and activities are being planned and these will celebrate the legacy of our shared history,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-foreign-chief-guest-at-republic-day-parade-amid-covid-19-says-centre-101610631159803.html

14-01-2021||India||109 cases in 16 days: How UK strain of coronavirus has progressed in India||Almost three months after it was first detected in the United Kingdom, India reported its first cases of the mutated variant of coronavirus on December 29 last year.The health ministry had then announced that six people with a travel history to London tested positive and said that the new UK variant genome of Sars-CoV-2 - B.1.1.7 - was detected in three samples in the labs of Hyderabad, Bangalore and Pune.Sixteen days after the first reported infection, India has already clocked more than a hundred cases of the new variant.Within a week of reporting the first case, India's tally for the new genome of the virus crossed 50. It crossed the 100-mark in the next seven days. On Wednesday, the number stood at 102, the health ministry announced.India's tally of the variant increases gradually at the time Britain is recording another 563 fatalities from the virus, bringing its deaths to over 81,400, one of the highest tolls in Europe.Soaring cases are forcing UK medical chiefs to try to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed and the government to reinforce its campaign for people to abide by stay-at-home orders.The B.1.1.7 variant genome, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last 38 days.From November 25 to the midnights of December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK, the government said. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect the presence of the new variant.The government took cognisance of the reports of the virus reported from the UK and said it has put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant.This strategy included temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK from December 23 to January 7 and mandatory RT-PCR test for all UK-returnees.The samples of all those found positive in the RT-PCR test will be genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs.Countries like Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore have also reported cases of the new variant so far.Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention states that preliminary epidemiologic indicators suggest that this variant is associated with increased transmissibility, which implies that it is more efficient and is transmitted rapidly.Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that the variant has any impact on the severity of disease or vaccine efficacy, the CDC has stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/109-cases-in-16-days-how-uk-strain-of-coronavirus-has-progressed-in-india-101610624854807.html

Delay in projecting Bhupendra Singh Hooda as CM in Haryana, ousted the party from the power while in Punjab and Karnataka the party got the advantage as it had declared a CM face before the elections”, he said.A few days ago, Harish Rawat had urged the party leadership to project the CM face under whose leadership the coming election would be contested. Other than Tamta, no one has yet backed Rawat as a chief ministerial candidate. In one of his social media posts, Rawat had ruled himself out of contention.Congress unit president in Uttarakhand, Pritam Singh and leader of opposition in the assembly Indira Hridayesh opposed Rawat, saying the party should contest assembly election under collective leadership.Amid the tug of war in the party, Tamta's backing of Rawat may now fuel more controversy in the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mp-pradeep-tamta-bats-for-harish-rawat-as-cm-face-in-uttarakhand-101610627795455.html

14-01-2021||India||Farmer unions welcome Mann's decision, but say won't accept any committee||Protesting farmer leaders welcomed Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision on Thursday to recuse himself from a Supreme Court-appointed committee, and reiterated that they do not want any panel and will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws.They said the other three members of the committee should follow suit as the agitating unions had never demanded formation of any committee to resolve the impasse between farmers and the Centre over the new agri laws.Some leaders also invited Mann to join the agitation against the legislations.Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him on the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers’ interests from being compromised.Farmer unions and opposition parties had raised doubts over the composition of the panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past."Mann's decision is a good step as there is no importance of any committee for farmer unions as it has not been our demand. Mann knew that no farmer union would appear before the court-appointed committee that's why he has taken this decision," farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI.Chaduni is a senior member of the Sankyukt Kisan Moarch -- an umbrella body of around 40 protesting unions. He said that farmer leaders will not appear before the committee even if the rest three members also recuse themselves and new members are appointed.He asserted that farmers will not settle for anything less than the repeal of new agriculture laws.Another farmer leader, Abhimanyu Kohar, said that government knows that the court cannot repeal the laws and that it should stop playing with the sentiments of farmers who have been camping at several Delhi borders since November 28."This is a good thing that Mann has recused himself from the committee. Forming a committee is not a solution. The new farm laws have been enacted by Parliament and the court cannot do much. The government knows this that's why we are asking the government to repeal these three laws," Kohar said.Asked whether union leaders would attend the next round of talks with the government scheduled for Friday, he said that they are not against any dialogue and that they will hold talks with Union ministers.Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait also welcomed Mann's decision and invited him to join the ongoing agitation against the three laws.Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said that they will accept any committee only if the government repeals the three farm laws first.Farmer leader Harinder Singh Lakhowal also said that they will not call off their protest until the government repeals these laws and gives a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Earlie this week, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three central laws till further orders and announced the formation of the committee to hear the grievances of the farmers and the opinion of the government.Apart from Mann, Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat, International Food Policy Research Institute's Pramod Kumar Joshi and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati were appointed on the panel.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-welcome-mann-s-decision-but-say-won-t-accept-any-committee-101610627260311.html
14-01-2021||India||Air pollution shot up in some northern towns last year despite lockdown||A new analysis has found that air pollution increased in small towns and cities outside Delhi and NCR in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region last year.Even though the average PM 2.5 levels for summer and monsoon months last year is considerably lower than in 2019, winter pollution levels increased in Punjab and Haryana (north of NCR) leading to an increase in their annual average PM 2.5 levels.Bigger cities and towns including Delhi recorded a significant reduction in annual PM 2.5 concentrations during the pandemic year. Delhi for example recorded an almost 13% improvement in 2020 compared to 2019.The analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment suggests air pollution levels spiked in certain parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains mainly because of a combination of reopening of the economy after the national lockdown (March 25 to May 31 and phased reopening till December) and adverse meteorology in winter.Several bigger cities have witnessed a reduction in annual PM 2.5 levels, smaller towns and cities have recorded an increase: Fatehabad in northern Haryana is the worst performer with 35% increase from 2019 level. It is followed by Bhatinda at 14%; Agra 9%; Khanna 7%; Mandi Gobindgarh 6%; Moradabad 5.5% and Kurukshetra recorded a 1% increase.Sirsa recorded a 44% decrease in PM 2.5 levels; Varanasi 31%; Gaya 27%; Muzaffarpur 13%; Delhi 13% and Hisar recorded a 12% reduction among others.CSE used real-time data (15-minute averages) for 26 cities in the IGP region from the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Central Control Room for Air Quality Management for the analysis. The analysis highlights that Fatehabad which recorded the highest increase in PM 2.5 concentrations last year and Sirsa which recorded the highest improvement are only 40 km apart.“Therefore, this massive variation cannot be attributed to meteorology and has to do with local factors. The annual average of these towns along with other smaller towns like Hisar and Jind in the north-west is heavily influenced by episodic pollution caused by burning of crop stubbles. The influence is so strong that it can elevate their monthly PM2.5 levels for November to that of Delhi’s, but unlike Delhi, these towns are directly exposed to the smoke. The elevated November levels do not linger on for the rest of the winter in these towns (as is the case in Delhi),” said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE’s Urban Lab team of the Sustainable Cities programme.“This brings out the impact of the extraordinary disruption that 2020 has caused. Despite the dramatic reduction in air pollution during the lockdown, pollution has bounced back across the region post-lockdown unmasking the high impacts of local and regional pollution. This demands quicker regional reforms and action to curb pollution from vehicles, industry, power plants and waste burning to further bend the air pollution curve on a regional scale,” explained Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-shot-up-in-some-northern-towns-last-year-despite-lockdown-101610626154993.html
14-01-2021||India||Day before ninth round of talks with farmers, agriculture minister Tomar says hopeful of positive discussion||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has confirmed that the ninth round of negotiations with protesting farmer unions will take place as scheduled on Friday and hoped that it would lead to positive discussions regarding the newly implemented farm bills."Hopeful of positive discussion at the ninth round of talks with farmer unions on Friday," Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency PTI on Thursday. The minister reiterated the government's stance and said that the Centre is ready to hold talks with farmer leaders with an open mind.The farmer union too said that they will attend the scheduled talks on Friday asserting that it is necessary to continue the dialogue to resolve the deadlock and end the agitation. "Let's see what happens tomorrow. But, our meetings will continue with the government till our protest ends as it is necessary. We will not oppose the meetings with the government," Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said.The government and representatives of the farmers' unions have previously held eight rounds of discussions but both sides continue to stick to their original stance. After the last round of discussions, Tomar had asked farmers to suggest an alternative for the farm laws and made it clear that the government will not repeal the laws.On their part, the farmers have maintained that they will not end their protest till the time the three laws - passed by Parliament in September - are repealed. They have also sought a legal guarantee that the system of procurement under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) will continue unaffected.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the farm laws and ordered the formation of a four-member committee to end the impasse between the government and the farmers who have been protesting near Delhi since late November.The three contentious laws are Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act after several petitions were filed against them.The farmers' unions representatives after the Supreme Court order had said that they do not want the four-member committee to resolve the issues citing government's stand on the farm laws. They highlighted that discussions with the committee will not lead to any results if the government remains firm on not repealing the laws.Farmer unions believe that these laws allow multinational companies to enter the agricultural sector and earn profits at the expense of the farmers. They also believe that these laws will affect government procurement of crop yields under the MSP system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-ninth-round-of-talks-with-farmers-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-says-hopeful-of-positive-discussion-101610626250771.html
14-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi watches Jallikattu, says message to Centre; BJP slams 'hypocrisy'||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday watched the bull taming sport jallikattu here, noting the animals were not getting injured as was being made out and said his visit was a message to the Centre that wants to "suppress" the Tamil culture. The BJP ridiculed Gandhi for his 'hypocrisy' by witnessing jallikattu and praising the sport, reminding that the Congress-led UPA had banned it in 2011.Sharpening his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government over the three contentious farm laws which have put farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana on the warpath, he accused the government of "conspiring to destroy" peasants to benefit a select few businessmen.Flanked by senior Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy and TNCC President K S Alagiri, Gandhi witnessed jallikattu at Avaniapuram here and said his visit was aimed at sending out a message to "those who think they can run roughshod on Tamil people." The former party president was joined by DMK Youth Wing Secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin on the dais. Jallikattu is held in the state, especially with much vigour in this district, coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Pongal which heralds the auspicious Tamil month Thai."One of the main reasons I came is, today the government in Delhi is under the impression that they can destroy the cultures of this country. They believe that they can suppress the emotions of Tamil people, they believe they can crush the language of the Tamil people, they can suppress the spirit of the Tamil people.""I came to give them a message that nobody can suppress the Tamil spirit," he told reporters at the airport here before returning to Delhi.After witnessing jallikattu he got a sense of why Tamil people appreciate it, Gandhi said."There was a sense. Many people had mentioned to me that jallikatu is harmful to the bulls. I witnessed it today and I must say that the way it was done there was absolutely no chance of the bull getting injured.""In fact if it was anyone to get injured it was the young men doing jallikattu. I am happy to say that there have been some changes to make it safer for everybody," he said.Gandhi further said he flew down from Delhi to watch the hugely popular event "because I think Tamil culture, Tamil language (and) Tamil history are essential for the future of India and need to be respected by everybody." The Tamil spirit cannot be crushed, he said, adding he was 'completely' against the idea of one particular idea, language and notion."There are many different languages, ideas and all these contribute to our strength and that is my message," he said.However, the BJP lashed out at the Congress leader over his visit to the temple town today. Party national general secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge, C T Ravi accused Gandhi of insulting Tamil 'makkal' (people) on jallikattu with his hypocrisy.Taking a dig at Rahul's visit to Avaniyapuram, Ravi made a referrence to the UPA government banning the sport by adding bulls in the list of performing animals."Dear @RahulGandhi, Your Govt in 2011 labelled #Jallikattu as cruel & barbaric. Your Party manifesto supported ban on Jallikattu. Today, you are in Tamil Nadu to watch this traditional sport live. Aren't you insulting lovely Tamil Makkal with your hypocrisy? Happy Pongal," Ravi said in a tweet.Hitting out at the Centre on the contentious farm laws, Gandhi alleged that the government was "conspiring to destroy" the ryots and asserted that his party will stand with them. "The government is not just neglecting them (farmers), the government is conspiring to destroy them. There is a difference. Neglecting is ignoring...they are not ignoring them," he said in response to a query. "They are trying to destroy them, because they want to benefit two or three of their friends. They want to give what belongs to the farmer to two or three of their friends," he alleged. "You are suppressing the farmers (and) helping handful of businesses," he said. Extending his party's support to the farmers, Gandhi said the laws will indeed be repealed."Mark my words..these laws-- the government will be forced to take them back," he said, adding he was "proud" of what the farmers were doing (protesting against the laws). Charging Narendra Modi with "not supporting" the common man during the coronavirus pandemic, Gandhi asked "whose Prime Minister are you?" "Are you the Prime Minister of the people of India or the Prime Minster of two-three selected businessmen?" he asked. He also sought to know why Modi was "silent" on the months long Sino-India standoff, asking "why are the Chinese people sitting inside Indian territory." Earlier, Gandhi attended the Pongal celebrations with people of Thenpalanji village in the district and also had food with them. He took photos with local youth and interacted with some elderly people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-watches-jallikattu-says-message-to-centre-bjp-slams-hypocrisy-101610625280817.html
14-01-2021||India||Politicians against farmers' protest not allowed in this UP village||The villagers of Saroorpur Kala in western Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district have banned the entry of those leaders who are not supporting the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three contentious agriculture laws. The decision was taken by a panchayat of 36 caste groups in the village on Wednesday. The village has a population of about 25,000.Subhash Nain, a farmer who attended the panchayat, said, “The entire panchayat unanimously condemned those leaders (of political parties or farmers' organisations) who are not extending their support to the ongoing movement and unanimously decided to ban their entry in the village.”“What's their relevance if they can't stand with the farmers during their battle for survival?” asked Nain while quoting the panchayat's views.The panchayat also decided to visit the protesting farmers in Delhi with ration and other essential items on January 16.It was decided to collect donations, monetary or otherwise, from each family of the village, irrespective of their caste and community, in support of the movement.“Villagers have so far donated ₹4.5 lakh and spared at least nine tractors to take ration and other commodities (mainly firewood to protect farmers from the cold),” said Nain. He added that the village pradhan Jeet Singh had made a contribution of ₹21,000 and spared his tractor for Delhi.Similarly, former pradhan Tejveer Singh and Jagveer Singh had contributed ₹5,000 and ₹2,100, respectively, he added. Other villagers have also donated in support of the protesting farmers, he said.The villagers claimed that they had nothing to do with any party."What to do with a government which doesn’t listen even to the genuine demands of people?” asked a villager.Meanwhile, the farmers’ indefinite dharna (sit-in) continued on the 28th day in Baraut town of Baghpat district. Earlier, farmers led by khap chaudharies (khap or clan leaders) sat on dharna on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway on December 17 in order to extend their support to the ongoing protest.Activists of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tomar) led by their divisional president Padam Singh staged a day-long dharna at the Meerut Cantt railway station on Tuesday to show their solidarity with the farmers' movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politicians-against-farmers-protest-not-allowed-in-this-up-village-101610623665119.html
14-01-2021||India||Maharashtra: NCP minister facing rape charges may step down||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said the rape allegations against Maharashtra minister Dhananjay Munde are serious in nature and the party will have to take a decision on the latter’s continuation in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. He added he will discuss the matter with his NCP colleagues before taking any decision.“Being a political party, we will have to discuss it and make a decision considering all the views. Munde has explained the matter in detail and it is my responsibility to convey it to the senior leaders and take the next step as soon as possible. I do not think this should be delayed,” Pawar said.Pawar’s statement is being seen as an indication that the party leadership is likely to ask Munde to resign.A woman has accused Munde of raping her on the pretext of marriage and other favours. She has alleged police were not accepting her written complaint against Munde and that her life is under threat.Munde has rejected the allegations and accused the woman, her sister, and their brother of trying to defame and blackmail him since 2019. He met Pawar, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, and minister Chhagan Bhujbal over the matter on Wednesday.Munde held the weekly janata darbar at the NCP office on Thursday and met the state NCP chief Jayant Patil. NCP leader Praful Patel also met Pawar and the two are said to have discussed the issue.Jayant Patil said it will be unfair to take any action without going into details of the allegations. “Munde has gone to the Bombay high court over threat and blackmail by the woman and police are investigating the matter. Allegations are serious but taking action without verifying the facts would be improper.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-ncp-minister-facing-rape-charges-may-step-down-101610624186751.html
14-01-2021||India||Harish Rawat insists Congress names a ‘CM face’ for Uttarakhand polls||Congress national general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat has sparked a debate in the party by insisting that it should declare its chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 assembly election.Rawat had recently said that the party leadership should declare the CM face for the polls which would help end the factionalism and clear confusion among party workers.On Tuesday, he took to social media urging the party national leadership to declare Pritam Singh, Uttarakhand Congress unit president as the CM face for 2022. In the same media post he also named leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh as another possible candidate saying he "doesn't have a problem with her either as the CM face."His statements have made the state leadership including Singh and Hridayesh uneasy. Both Singh and Hridayesh have been saying that the party would fight the elections under a "collective leadership."In one of his social media posts on Tuesday, Rawat wrote, "Pritam Singh is our ‘General’ (Senapati). Hence, I request the leadership to declare him the CM face of Congress in 2022 polls. I will also welcome the name of Hridayesh as I have already ended the speculations regarding my name for the same."In the same post, he also underlined that he wants to exit the “collective leadership.”"I request the party leadership to free me from the collective leadership as sometimes it is also important for one to stay free. Also, the debacle of 2017 polls has made me a burden on the state leadership which I want to end by keeping myself away."Even before the unease that his posts had sparked died down, he put out another post on Wednesday saying he would “stand behind whosoever the party declares the CM face.""From a strategic point of view also, it is important to do so as it would end the winning streak of BJP. It could be our strategy to go in with a Congress CM face vs a BJP CM face. I believe doing so will improve the party’s performance in 2022," he said.Amid the discomfort in the Congress, Pritam Singh tried to play it down saying that it was Rawat’s “personal suggestion.”"Declaring CM face is his suggestion. Our party had earlier fought the previous assembly polls without declaring the CM face whether it was 2002, 2007 or 2012. We will do the same in 2022 also. Moreover, our party state unit in-charge Devendra Yadav has already said that the party would fight the polls under collective leadership and accept whoever the central leadership decides for the CM candidate," said Singh.Leader of Opposition, Hridayesh however, countered Rawat's suggestion by reminding him of his loss on both seats from where he contested in 2017 as the party's CM face."Rawat himself was the CM face in 2017 polls and lost on both the seats from where he fought which anyway was a bad decision. Also, all know we have never declared the CM face before polls. In 2017 when he was the CM face, we failed to win in all the districts which could have given us 13 seats instead of the present 11," she said.Rawat’s pitch for a chief ministerial face seemingly also has not yet made an impression on the party’s national leadership.The Congress party’s Uttarakhand in-charge Devendra Yadav said, "We are at present focused on our preparations for the 2022 polls. We will fight it under collective leadership and think about the CM face later after winning it."MM Semwal, a political observer, believes the “CM face” is a clever card by Rawat to jockey for the chief minister’s post."Rawat is a very shrewd and seasoned politician. Whatever he says or does is very well planned and he knows what the results would be. Rawat also knows that he is the only major face for the Congress in Uttarakhand and what he had said about a CM face is just to burnish that image in the state before the polls. If Congress wins the 2022 elections, there is every chance that Rawat will again become the CM and he too knows that," Semwal said.The ruling BJP insists that a CM face will make no difference to the Congress’ fate in the polls."Congress is divided into factions which is an open secret. They are now fighting over the CM face for the next assembly polls which is like swinging a stick in the air. We will win more than 60 seats and again come to power while Congress will keep dreaming to win it," said Bansidhar Bhagat, BJP president in Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harish-rawat-insists-congress-names-a-cm-face-for-uttarakhand-polls-101610623427814.html
14-01-2021||India||'If any superpower wants to hurt our self-esteem...': Rajnath Singh's stern message to China||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday indirectly gave a stern message to China saying that India's soldiers are capable of giving befitting reply to any "superpower" that wants to hurt India's self-esteem."We don't want war, but if any superpower wants to hurt our self-esteem, then our soldiers are capable of giving a befitting reply," Singh said on the occasion of Armed Forces Veterans Day without naming China, according to new agency PTI."India does not want conflict with anyone; it wants peace and friendly ties since it's in our blood and culture," PTI further quoted him as saying.The defence minister is in Bengaluru at Indian Air Force's HQ Training Command.Talking about the ₹48,000 crore defence deal cleared by the Centre on Wednesday, Singh said, "We have given approval for the acquisition of 83 indigenous LCA Tejas fighter jets from HAL. This decision will help generate more than 50,000 job opportunities in the country."The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the largest indigenous defence procurement deal to buy 83 LCA Tejas Mark1A fighter jets.The deal would strengthen the Air Force's fleet of homegrown fighter jet. Singh had earlier called the deal "game-changer for self-reliance".The defence minister's remarks come amidst the Ladakh standoff which has now entered its ninth month, with soldiers holding forward positions at friction points in extreme weather conditions. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-level officers.Singh today said that during the standoff, India's soldiers displayed exemplary bravery and patience and "if that can be narrated then every Indian will feel proudChief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh on Monday for a security review.In a year-end review of major developments published on January 1, the defence ministry had said that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation in the sensitive theatre by using unorthodox weapons against Indian soldiers and amassing a large number of troops during the ongoing border standoff along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The ministry said the PLA attempted to alter the status quo in the sector by force but the Indian Army was well-entrenched to counter any misadventure by the adversary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-veterans-day-rajnath-s-superpower-remark-is-a-message-to-china-101610623620542.html
14-01-2021||India||It’s time to reward party workers in Rajasthan, says Pilot||Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Thursday said that with a compact and comprehensive state Congress committee in place, political appointments will also be completed in January itself. “We welcome the new, compact and comprehensive team formed by Rajasthan in-charge Ajay Maken and party’s state president Govind Singh Dotasara. After discussing with everybody, as decided, political appointments in board will be done [in January]. The government has completed two years and it is time to reward hardworking party workers,” he said. He added that the Congress was left with 21 seats in 2013 and came back with full majority only because of its workers. “The sacrifice of workers at the time when the BJP was in power should be rewarded. It is time to appreciate such workers. Congress workers are demanding not only posts but respect and appreciation as well,” he said. The former deputy CM also said he was with the farmers as far as the Supreme Court orders were concerned. “The government should leave its stubbornness and repeal the farm laws...the questions raised by the famers on the panel formed by the Supreme Court are valid,” he said. Meanwhile, the state president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed his party’s morale was high. Satish Poonia said, “People across the country accept our ideology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-time-to-reward-party-workers-in-rajasthan-says-pilot-101610623767178.html
14-01-2021||India||BSP chief Mayawati asks party workers to celebrate birthday by helping the poor||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati on Thursday called upon party workers to celebrate her 65th birthday on Friday as Jankalyankari Diwas.“The birthday should be celebrated in a simple manner following Covid-19 guidelines,” she said.In a series of tweets, Mayawati told the party workers to assist the poor and impoverished people who have had to suffer due to the pandemic.On the occasion, she will release the 16th edition of her book “A Travelogue of My Struggle Ridden Life and BSP Movement”. The travelogue will generate self-respect among party supporters and guide them towards taking the movement launched by the BSP forward, she said.A BSP leader said the party chief would celebrate her birthday with party leaders at the party’s central office in New Delhi.In Uttar Pradesh, the party’s state unit had directed party leaders to celebrate her birthday in all 75 districts by assisting migrants, farmers, labourers and the poor people who were facing problems due to the economic slowdown, he said.In Lucknow, the birthday programme would be organised at the divisional office located near Pasi Qila.“We will visit hamlets or hospitals to distribute sweets and fruits,” he said.The BSP used to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner when the party was in power in Uttar Pradesh. It began the practice of observing Jankalyankari Diwas after being voted out of power in the 2012 assembly elections.Mayawati has been camping in Delhi, where she is holding regular review meetings to gear up the party cadre for the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. She has directed party office bearers to expedite the process of strengthening the organisation at the booth level. To regain lost ground, the BSP plans to win back the support of the Brahmins, backward classes and Muslims, the party leader said.The BSP did not win any seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. It bagged 19 seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls and 10 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when it had an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, but parted ways with the SP soon after the results were declared.After Mayawati became the UP chief minister for the fourth time in 2007, there was a grand celebration across the state on January 15, 2009. The display of opulence was quite palpable, the state capital was draped in blue and a massive stage was set up on the ground near the chief minister’s residence. BSP supporters were transported from all the districts and neighbouring states to participate in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-chief-mayawati-asks-party-workers-to-celebrate-birthday-by-helping-the-poor-101610622781268.html

14-01-2021||India||Congress links Kerala chief minister to gold smuggling||Congress lawmaker PT Thomas on Thursday targeted Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over the recovery of 30 kg of gold smuggled into India in baggage addressed to the UAE consulate last year, saying he cannot get away by sacrificing some of his officials. He called Vijayan the “main accused” in the case. Thomas claimed Vijayan was aware of the activities of his former principal secretary M Sivasankar, who was arrested three months back in connection with the recovery at the Thiruvananthapuram airport of the gold hidden inside the bathroom fittings.“How can a chief minister who supported the smuggling activities be called a Communist and continue in power? The arrested secretary even said if he approaches the chief minister with a tissue paper, he will sign on it in seconds. They were so close and how can he wash off his hands now?” asked Thomas while introducing an adjournment motion over the matter in the state assembly. He accused Vijayan of turning a blind to the matter as the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) members tried to shout him down with counter-allegations. Also read | ED denies Sivasankar’s allegations of pressure to name political targetsThomas claimed Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the case, was threatened in jail “not to take big names.” He added Vijayan was aware of Sivasankar’s foreign trips with Suresh. Thomas said initially Vijayan gave “a good certificate” to the probe agencies but turned against them after they summoned his close aide C M Raveendran.Thomas said after he questioned an IT company owned by Vijayan’s daughter, Veena, the site of the Bengaluru-based firm disappeared.Vijayan rubbished the charges saying the government took immediate action after the case came to light. He added he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a central agency probe into the case. Vijayan said some opposition members were unnecessarily blaming him and spreading “loads of canards”.“We sacked the secretary immediately... We want to get to the bottom of the smuggling. So, we asked for a central agency probe. I criticised them when they deviated from their path. Now they are in a race to portray the government in a bad light but they will never succeed because people are with us.”Vijayan wondered whether opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala agreed with the repeated charge of the Congress leadership that the Centre was using central agencies to target opposition leaders. He cited cases against Congress leaders including P Chidambaram to make his point.After a two-hour discussion, opposition members stormed out of the House as Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan denied permission for the adjournment motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-links-kerala-chief-minister-to-gold-smuggling-101610621187088.html
14-01-2021||India||Med students can seek course transfer in case of permanent disability: Bombay HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court recently upheld a rule laid down by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) that allows medical students seek mid-course transfer from one college to another only if they acquires permanent disability of 40℅ or above.The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote was hearing petition filed by Manali Barde, a medical student pursuing MBBS course at Government Medical College at Akola who had sought transfer claiming that she suffered from allergic bronchitis with chronic bronchial asthma, of a moderate persistent nature, frequently leading to breathlessness, and was this highly susceptible to Covid-19.She moved HC after her application for transfer to a medical college in Nagpur was rejected by the DMER on August 20, 2020, primarily on the ground that in terms of clause 13(a)(ii) of the DMER brochure, transfer of medical students from one college to another was permitted only if the student acquires permanent disability of 40% or above.Barde then challenged validity of the clause. Her counsel, Dr. Uday Warunjikar, submitted that clause 13(a)(ii) was ultra vires the power of DMER or state, and was therefore required to be quashed and set aside.Dr. Warunjikar pointed out that the clause was completely contrary to Medical Council of India (MCI) Regulations of December 2018, which allow mid-course transfer of medical students on “genuine grounds.” He asserted that it was impermissible for DMER to lay down the guidelines and specify specific conditions for migration of medical students.“There cannot be any two views that the regulations framed by the MCI, being framed by virtue of the Statutory power under Section 33 of the Medical Council of India Act, 1956, have primacy, over any guidelines, which may be framed by the DMER and the State,” said the bench.The bench, however, said under the MCI Regulations, state governments, universities and institutions have been authorised to frame guidelines for grant of no-objection certificate for migration, and the MCI regulations do not define or clarify what “genuine ground” would mean.The court said in absence of defining the expression “genuine ground” by the MCI in its regulations, it would be open and permissible, for the DMER or the state to lay down guidelines, defining the parameters of the expression “genuine ground.”The bench also ratified the DMER brochure, saying “the requirement of 40℅ or above permanent disability, so as to be considered as a genuine ground is based upon Section 2(Zc) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and the schedule as appended thereunder, and thus has a statutory backing to it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/med-students-can-seek-course-transfer-in-case-of-permanent-disability-bombay-hc-101610620827186.html

14-01-2021||India||Farm leader opts out of SC panel citing farmers’ interest||Bhupinder Singh Mann, a key farm union leader appointed by the Supreme Court to a panel it had formed to scrutinise three contentious farms laws has declined the job, citing the “interests” of farmers. Mann, a former MP and the national president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a farm union, said he was “recusing” himself from the committee of four set by the Supreme Court to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws. On January 12, the court had kept in abeyance the laws that have prompted hundreds of thousands of farmers to stage a months-long protest. It also set up a committee to start a dialogue with protesting farmers, comprising economists Ashok Kumar Gulati and PK Joshi as well as farm union leaders Anil Ghanwat and Mann as members. The panel formed by the Supreme Court has attracted public criticism because all four members named for the panel had either endorsed the farm laws or suggested improvements. Protesting farm unions said such a committee was already biased in favour of reforms. “As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions among the farmers and public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as not to compromise the interests of Punjab and the farmers of the country,” Mann said in a press statement. Mann is the chairman of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, a platform of farm unions who have supported the farm laws. Mann had met Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in December, urging him not to repeal the laws. This pitted him against hundreds of other farm unions demanding a repeal. An official of the agriculture ministry declined to comment on Mann’s move, saying this was a Supreme Court-monitored process. Farm unions protesting the laws to open up agricultural markets said they were indifferent to Mann’s decision. “Our stand is we will not take part in any consultations by the court-appointed committee because our only demand is repeal of the laws,” said Darshan Pal, a senior member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the organisation leading the farmers’ protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leader-opts-out-of-sc-panel-citing-farmers-interest-101610618008144.html
14-01-2021||India||Former bureaucrat Arvind Sharma joins BJP, buzz over his role in UP politics||Former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Arvind Kumar Sharma joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Lucknow on Thursday in the presence of state party chief Swantantra Dev Singh and Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma."I come from a backward village of Mau district in Uttar Pradesh. I was working on the post of a secretary and don't have any political background. To bring a person like me into the party, only PM Narendra Modi and BJP can do it," Sharma later told reporters.Sharma, who assumed the charge as Secretary in the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in April last year, took voluntary retirement from service recently ahead of his scheduled superannuation in July 2022.The central government accepted his voluntary retirement plea on Monday, when the BJP state unit was busy finalising names of candidates for the biennial election to 12 seats in the UP Legislative Council. The quick acceptance of his application for voluntary retirement has started a buzz in the BJP circles that Sharma may be sent to the Legislative Council.Elections are being held on 12 seats and the last date for filing of nominations is January 18.Even while senior BJP leaders are maintaining a silence over Sharma’s candidature for the council, those privy to the developments on the issue said, he may be made the deputy chief minister in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. Another view on his role suggests he may be given a key assignment at the Centre.Sharma is considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had worked in the Gujarat government and as Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his tenure as the chief minister of Gujarat. Sharma also served as additional secretary in the Prime Minister Office (PMO).A postgraduate in political science from Allahabad University, Sharma is a native of Kajha Khurd village in Muhammadabad Gohna tehsil in Mau district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bureaucrat-arvind-sharma-joins-bjp-buzz-over-his-role-in-up-politics-101610617566697.html

Farmers have said that they will not hold any talks with the committee as all four members are pro-government.The other members of the court-appointed committee are economists Ashok Gulati, Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi and farmer leader Anil Ghanwat. The committee has been asked by the Supreme Court to submit its report in two months.Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of Delhi against the farm legislation enacted by the Parliament in September last year. So far, eight rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmers but have failed to resolve the deadlock. Both sides will now meet on January 15 to discuss the matter.Farmers have been demanding a complete withdrawal of the laws which has been refused by the government. Instead, it has offered to make amendments.Farmers are also demanding a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP) system for the procurement of their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-view-of-apprehensions-member-opts-out-of-supreme-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-101610617112085.html
14-01-2021||India||Nepal foreign minister Gyawali in New Delhi to discuss Covid-19 cooperation, boundary issue||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali arrived in the Indian capital on Thursday for a two-day visit expected to focus on procuring Covid-19 vaccines and development cooperation, though Kathmandu has also signalled its intent to raise the border row. Gyawali will meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar for talks on Friday, and the two ministers will chair a meeting of the bilateral joint commission. This will be only the sixth meeting of the body since 1987, though it has convened four times since 2014. Gyawali was also set to hold several private meetings on Thursday. The minister is the most senior Nepalese leader to visit India in more than a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. He is also the first leader to visit New Delhi since Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli triggered political turmoil by dissolving Parliament last month and calling early elections in April-May. Gyawali’s delegation includes both the foreign secretary and health secretary, reflecting the focus on Covid-19 cooperation. Though Nepal has formally reached out to India and China for vaccines, Kathmandu has indicated a preference for sourcing doses from New Delhi because of factors such as pricing, logistics and well-established links between the health sectors of the two countries. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Nepal is hoping India will provide vaccines as assistance to inoculate a part of the 12 million population it plans to cover in its first phase of vaccinations. Nepal also plans to buy millions of doses from foreign suppliers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.Also read | Nepal PM Oli pledges to ‘retrieve’ Kalapani region from India through talksThe Indian side has said the country’s ability to export vaccines after meeting domestic needs will become clear over the next few weeks. Officials have also said India’s neighbours will get priority for the supply of vaccines. India-Nepal ties came under the shadow of a border row last year after Oli’s government issued a new political map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a strategic road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China. In a statement announcing Gyawali’s visit on Tuesday, Nepal’s foreign ministry said the joint commission meeting will discuss the gamut of bilateral relations, including “trade, transit, energy, boundary, Covid-19 cooperation, infrastructure, connectivity, investment, agriculture, tourism, culture, among others”. The people cited above said India had made its position on the border row very clear – the external affairs ministry last year described Nepal’s new map as “unjustified cartographic assertion” – and the stance hadn’t changed. They added the focus of the upcoming meeting will be taking forward development cooperation, including India-backed projects in Nepal. Given that Oli currently heads a caretaker government, there is unlikely to be any substantive movement on the border issue, the people said. One option the two sides could look at is asking the bilateral boundary working group to look afresh at the border issue to help finalise the border in the disputed sections at Kalapani and Susta, the people added. Before Oli’s sudden decision to dissolve Parliament, normalcy was restored in bilateral ties by back-to-back visits to Kathmandu last year by Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. Gyawali is also expected to brief the Indian side on the political developments in Nepal. India has been keeping a wary eye on China’s efforts to broker an understanding between Oli and his main rival, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, in order to keep the Nepal Communist Party united.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-foreign-minister-gyawali-in-new-delhi-to-discuss-covid-19-cooperation-boundary-issue-101610616746897.html

Many matters relating to life and liberty, including bail, which require immediate attention remain unheard, creating a helpless situation for litigants and lawyers," the letter said.There are many flaws in the virtual court hearing, including network connectivity issues and no proper management by the Registry, it said.The letter, which was also signed by more than 500 lawyers including many senior lawyers of the Apex Court, stated that the members of the Bar, particularly young practitioners, have been going through a difficult stage in the past 10 months between the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent virtual functioning of the Supreme Court.The letter also claimed that the virtual hearing of the Top Court has more lacunae than benefits and that it has failed to adequately serve the cause of justice."In this regard, it is also noted that judges, as well as the Attorney General of India, had expressed reservations about the virtual system's functioning," the letter stated.No response to the calls by the dealing officers when it comes to mentioning, said the letter, seeking a direction of the CJI to start physical hearings in the Supreme Court.Dismissing of mentioning of urgent matters by mentioning bench without providing any reason, over 50 per cent of young practitioners have been constrained to leave Delhi as they are unable to meet living expenses, the letter claimed.It further underlined that various High Courts in the country have also started physical hearings and the Apex Court should also consider starting the same with precautionary measures in the view of COVID-19.

"When the laws were passed, he had congratulated the prime minister saying that Mahendra Tikait's soul must be in peace after 27 years and his dreams are being fulfilled through these laws," the minister told PTI.Mahendra Tikait was an influential and well-known farmer leader of Uttar Pradesh.Also Read | Farmers' protest: Centre willing for 9th round of talks but farmers doubtfulThe minister's comments came ahead of the 9th round of meeting between the Centre and farmers, which hangs in balance after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the farm laws and set up a committee to broker peace between the Centre and the farmers. Since the new committee will now listen to the grievances of the farmers, union leaders are questioning whether there is any use of continuing the parallel talks which so far has not yielded any result.The protest against the laws which farmers see as pro-corporates commenced on November 26 and is still going on. Farmers will not go back unless the laws are completely repealed, union leaders have said. The Centre, on the other hand, reiterated their stance that the laws will not be withdrawn, though some amendments can be accommodated.Farmers are not willing to appear before the Supreme Court panel as well as they think the members of the panels are supporters of the farm laws."Unions are saying that the members in the committee had at some point supported the laws, but I would like to say union leader Rakesh Tikait had also supported the laws," the minister said.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-rakesh-tikait-congratulated-pm-modi-on-farm-laws-minister-attacks-farmer-leader-101610613457796.html

This would be the world's largest immunisation exercise. Therefore, it has been decided by the Ministry of Health in consultation with the office of the President of India to reschedule the Polio vaccination day, also known as the National Immunisation Day (NID) or 'Polio Ravivar' to 31st January."A limited number of sites out of the 2,934 inoculation centres have been shortlisted from where the beneficiaries can interact with the prime minister and the authorities in those centres have been asked to make provisions for IT infrastructure for providing a two-way interactive communication facility to enable it to link and interact with the national launch site through a video link, the sources said.Officials at New Delhi's AIIMS and Safdarjung hospitals, which are among the shortlisted facilities, said they are "ready for a two-way communication".Around three lakh healthcare workers will get vaccine shots at 2,934 sites across the country on the first day of the massive nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive, a senior official said.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries.According to the guidelines issued to the shortlisted vaccination centres, healthcare workers (those registered in Co-WIN to be vaccinated) on the launch shall include not only doctors, nurses but also nursing orderlies, safai karamcharis, ambulance drivers, and would be from a mixed age group, including above 50 years.The full initial procurement of 1.65 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin-- has been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database."Therefore, there is no question of discrimination against any State in allocation of vaccination doses. This is the initial lot of supply of vaccine doses and would be continuously replenished in the weeks to come. Therefore, any apprehension being expressed on account of deficient supply is totally baseless and unfounded," the ministry said.States have been advised to organize vaccination sessions taking into account 10 per cent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session per day.Therefore, any undue haste on the parts of the states to organize unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised, the ministry had said on Wednesday.The states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilizes and moves forward.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers, and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.Cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-covid-19-vaccination-drive-on-january-16-101610612470716.html

Eight rounds of talks have failed to resolve the deadlock between the government and farmers’ unions representing the protesting farmers, with the government insistent on not rolling back the laws and the unions adamant on a total repeal.Here are some key dates of an agitation that looks unlikely to end anytime soon:Nov 26 and 27: Farmers, majority from Punjab, begin their "Dill Chalo" march on November 26, Constitution Day.

Farmers propose December 29 but the government fixes December 30 for the next round of talks.Dec 24: Gandhi leads a four-member Congress delegation to meet President Kovind. The delegation submits to Kovind letter containing “3 crore signatures” against the laws.Dec 30: Sixth round of talks take place as the two sides manage to arrive at a consensus on two out of four demands raised by the unions. Impasse continues on legal assurance for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and total repeal of laws.Jan 2: Farmers’ unions announce a series of programmes to build pressure on the government to repeal the laws. This includes a mega tractor march in Delhi on Republic Day and a “trailer” on January 6.Jan 4 and 8: Seventh and eighth round of talks take place but once again no resolution is found. January 15 fixed as the next date.Jan 7: Farmers hold their “trailer” for the Republic Day tractor march: a tractor rally on the Kondli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway after earlier postponing it by a day due to bad weather.Jan 11: The Supreme Court hears a clutch of pleas challenging the laws and indicates it would order a stay on their implementation for the time being.Jan 12: Implementation of farm laws stayed until further orders and a four-member committee formed to handle the negotiations.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will roll out the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination exercise, it added. “Therefore, it has been decided...to reschedule the polio vaccination day, also known as the National Immunisation Day (NID) or ‘Polio Ravivar’ to 31th January 2021 (Sunday),” the ministry said in a statement.President Ramnath Kovind will launch the polio immunization programme by administering polio drops to children at the Rashtrapati Bhawan.“The decision [to defer the polio campaign] is in keeping with the stated policy of the Health Ministry to ensure that COVID management and vaccination services as well as non-COVID essential health services proceed in tandem without adversely impacting each other,” the statement said.The polio vaccination drive takes place each year in January with a mop up round in the second half of the year.In a letter written to states last week, the ministry asked them to postpone the anti-polio drive until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-polio-immunisation-programme-deferred-due-to-covid-19-vaccination-101610609006596.html

However, both the AIMIM and the BJP have rejected these claims.Sakshi Maharaj’s statement assumes significance in the view of AIMIM’s impressive showing in Bihar polls, which is believed to have dented the prospects of the candidates from the Mahagathbandhan on several seats in close contests with the winning National Democratic Alliance or the NDA.The Mahagatbandhan suffered a big setback in the Seemanchal region where AIMIM put up a strong show, which could have cost GA the elections in Bihar, claim analysts.After gaining a foothold in Bihar, AIMIM has announced its plan to strengthen party organisation and fight elections in other key states like Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.Owaisi’s party is likely to contest the upcoming panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh under an electoral pact with regional outfit Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The SBSP, headed by former UP minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, is garnering smaller and regional parties under the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha."Candidates belonging to Asaduddin Owaisi's party are likely to be fielded in the panchayat elections as the Morcha's joint candidate," PTI quoted Rajbhar as saying on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/owaisi-would-help-bjp-in-up-and-west-bengal-polls-says-skashi-maharaj-101610608732513.html

Multiple cases of fake identification have been registered by the government railway police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF).The cards were identified during an inspection by railways ticket checking staff.Local train services resumed for employees working in essential services on July 15, 2020. Differently-abled passengers and cancer patients were also permitted to use the rail services, and later, women passengers and lawyers were given stipulated time slots within which they could travel.“During our regular checking, we have found many passengers trying to travel with fake identity cards. Majority of cards have been found by pharmaceutical companies, diagnostic and imaging centres,” said a senior CR official.Train services were suspended from March 23 due to the spread of coronavirus in the city.Most recently, a woman passenger was detained at Kalyan railway station on Tuesday for attempting to travel by a local train carrying a fake identity card. The Kalyan GRP registered a case against the passenger.Last Friday, CR officials caught 58 fake identification card-holders at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT).Meanwhile, passenger associations have stated that many daily wage workers have no other options and train services should resume for the general public with staggered office hours.“Most of the people who have started to go to work daily cannot afford road travel. Local trains are an affordable means of commute. The state government and railways should introduce staggered office timings for private and government employees, and allow the general public to travel,” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association.Further, the CR anti-tout squad arrested three people and seized 400 e-tickets worth ₹6.43 lakh in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hundreds-booked-for-travelling-on-mumbai-local-trains-with-fake-ids-101610607326541.html

She advocated in favour of the farm laws and alleged that farmers were being misled and were not protesting on their own. She held that the Central government passed the farm laws for farmers’ benefit.Hema Malini, who was visiting her parliamentary constituency after 10 months, interacted with the media on Wednesday.“Farmers should say what is wrong in the farm laws and what needs to be done. Farmers are opposing farm laws without understanding them. During talks with the Centre, farmer representatives do not point out any problems in the farm laws but simply call for their withdrawal. If farmers understand, they will find the farm laws to be beneficial,’” said Malini.She accused the opposition of hypocritical behaviour on the issue. ‘The Opposition is opposing the farm laws just for the sake of it. Congress wanted to bring such laws during their regime but is now opposing them,” Malini said, while welcoming the Supreme Court order aimed to break the deadlock between the protesting farmers and the Central government.Speaking in favour of setting up industries in Mathura, the BJP MP favoured decreasing the area of Taj Trapezium Zone so that big industries could come up in Mathura. There are certain restrictions on industries in TTZ area on environmental pretext.She also welcomed the proposal for setting up a film city in NOIDA and reiterated her commitment to get Mathura included in the National Capital Region (NCR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-don-t-understand-farm-laws-are-being-misled-hema-malini-101610606877262.html

The ministry has advised the states to not organise "unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day".The emergency vaccination for healthcare workers has been much awaited as several countries started vaccination last year December.The Centre has also urged the states to take into account 10 per cent wastage of doses, which is a general possibility.After the Drug Controller General of India on January 3 gave restricted, emergency-use authorisation to two vaccines, preparations were on to officially procure them to kick off the vaccination drive.The Centre procured 1.65 crore vaccine doses including 1.1 crores of Serum Institute's Covishield and 55 lakh of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. The doses have been dispatched to all states.Some states have raised complaints that the number of doses they have received will not be adequate to cover all their healthcare workers, but the ministry has said that the procurement was done according to the database provided by the state governments. Also, this is the initial supply of vaccine doses which will be replenished in the weeks to come, the ministry has said.Instead of trying to accommodate more people than recommended per session, the state governments should gradually increase the number of vaccination sites "in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward".Based on which vaccines are being administered, sites will be identified as Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) and Covishield (Serum Institute) sites as beneficiaries will have to be inoculated again after 28 days.Amid a raging debate of healthcare workers not being able to choose between Covaxin and Covishield, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan earlier said no country has given this option to those who are being inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-room-for-10-wastage-don-t-rush-centre-s-advise-to-states-on-vaccination-101610602137297.html

We do not expect the temperatures to fall beyond this.” He added Srinagar recorded a minimum temperature of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius two days earlier. Lotus said the weather will remain dry till January 20. “There is no forecast of snow or rainfall till January 27. However, light rain and snowfall cannot be ruled out,” he said.The lowest temperature ever-- minus 14.4 degrees Celsius--was recorded in Srinagar in 1893.The mountainous resort town of Pahalgam was the coldest place in the Valley as it recorded a minimum temperature of minus 11.1 degrees Celsius, up from minus 11.7 a day earlier. The mercury plunged to minus 7 in Gulmarg, the famous ski resort over 150 km away.The freezing temperature has added to the woes of people as water supply pipes have frozen and roads have become risky for motorists amid complaints about delays in snow clearance following the heaviest snowfall in the Valley this season last week.Kashmir is in the middle of the harshest 40-day phase of winter known as Chillia Kalan that ends on January 31.“Saw big icicles hanging around house roofs in Srinagar after a long, long time. Chilai Kalan, this year, is showing its full might. Clearly reminiscent of the childhood days when such scenes would be a routine every winter,” wrote a netizen Mir Faheem on social media.

He is responding to the treatment," the official said.The team from AIIMS arrived in Goa on Tuesday and reviewed the health condition of the Union Minister of State for Defence and AYUSH.On Wednesday, the team of AIIMS doctors extubated Naik (removed the tube inserted to assist him in breathing) and he was put on HFNC, the official said.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said Naik is conscious and recovering.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who visited the GMCH on Tuesday, had said that if required, Naik will be shifted to New Delhi for further treatment.Naik received injuries, while his wife Vijaya and an aide died on Monday when their car met with accident near Ankola in Uttar Kannada district while he was returning to home state Goa from Dharmasthala in neighbouring Karnataka.GMCH's Dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar on Tuesday said when Naik was brought to the GMCH on Monday night, he was critical and four major surgeries were performed on him.Bandekar had also said that Naik will continue to be in the hospital for another 10 to 15 days, and it will take at least three to four months for him to recuperate completely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-shripad-naik-s-health-improving-doctors-101610598280597.html
14-01-2021||India||Govt to set up faceless digital mechanism to levy income tax penalties||After implementing faceless assessment and faceless appeal systems on income tax matters, the government has decided to set up a National Faceless Penalty Centre to have an unbiased and transparent digital faceless mechanism for imposing penalties on tax defaulters.The government on Tuesday notified the faceless penalty scheme, which will have a National Faceless Penalty Centre at the apex level. It will be assisted by regional centres, local penalty units and penalty review units, two officials with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity.Also read | 5% more income tax returns filed this year“The system will provide adequate opportunity to assessees to be heard and also have provisions for review on legal and technical grounds. A review could also be initiated on the ground of arithmetical correctness of computation of penalty,” one of the officials said.Till the time the National Faceless Penalty Centre, its regional centres and local units are set up, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will direct the National e-Assessment Centre (NeAC) and its units to also act as faceless penalty system, he said.Faceless schemes – inspired by the concept of digital governance -- are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s August 13, 2020, announcement of three key structural tax reforms under the Transparent Taxation - Honouring the Honest platform. They are – Faceless Assessment, Faceless Appeal and Taxpayers Charter. The technology-driven faceless systems aim to end overreach by officials, while the charter defines the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, a second official said.Naveen Wadhwa, DGM at Taxmann, the publisher on taxation matters, said that faceless systems will certainly curb corruption, but it will also serve the larger purpose of reforms in tax administration. “The income tax department is aiming to build a complete eco-system of an end-to-end digital solution for all proceedings under the [Income-Tax] Act,” he said.“India is the first country to build a system for faceless assessment, appeal and penalty proceedings. This is just another step to harness the power of technology in reforming the income tax department,” he said. Currently, all key processes related to income-tax administration, such as permanent account number (PAN) enrolment, filing of returns, assessment proceedings, penalty proceedings and appeals, are governed digitally.Sanjay Kumar, partner at consultancy firm Deloitte India, said, “Faceless system does remove person-to-person contact. It also ensures that any tax or penalty imposition is not done by an individual, but is technically reviewed by a panel of senior officers.” This peer-review is essential to make sure that tax adjustments and penalties are not imposed on the basis whims of officials, he said.“Faceless system also ensures that the cases are picked up in a centralised manner, and dealt in a centralised manner, ensuring uniformity of approach and proper application of law,” he said, adding that a fair and efficient system is now evolving. “Though the output is still to come, but I’m quite confident that it would be able to achieve the desired fairness and efficiency,” he added.The faceless penalty centre would help in creating a fair and efficient system, said Wadhwa. “Currently, AO [assessing officer], who is assessing the taxpayer, is required to conduct penalty proceedings. It is often seen that the penalty order passed by the AO is challenged by the taxpayer on the grounds that it has been passed without following the principles of natural justice or an incorrect assumption of law. Under the Faceless Penalty Scheme, this issue will be ruled out as the penalty proceedings shall be done by an entirely different unit, and not by the unit conducting the faceless assessment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-set-up-faceless-digital-mechanism-to-levy-income-tax-penalties-101610598145924.html

Dr Vinod Paul, member (health) Niti Aayog and chairman, national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) will inaugurate the laboratory on Thursday morning, in the presence of Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet, and Avani Singh, chief executive officer, SpiceHealth.India had started genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples of UK returnees soon after the flights from UK were suspended on December 23, 2020. The total number of persons found to be positive with the new UK variant genome stands at 102 as on Wednesday. India has begun sequencing the genes of at least 5% of all Covid-19 positive samples in an attempt to better track mutations in the Sars-CoV-2 virus. To do this, the government has set up a genomic surveillance consortium under the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Ten highly advanced labs in reputed institutes from across the country have been designated to perform genome sequencing of samples. The laboratory network-- Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) was specifically created for this purpose last month. The labs are NIMHANS, Bengaluru, CCMB, Hyderabad, NIV, Pune, IGIB, Delhi, NCDC, New Delhi, NCBG, Kolkata, NCBS, InSTEM, Bengaluru, CDFD Hyderabad, ILS Bhubaneswar, and NCCS Pune. The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-international-airport-to-get-genome-sequencing-lab-today-101610595926134.html

Launched on January 9, the nationwide campaign titled Ek Mutthi Mitti Shaheedon Ke Naam is expected to conclude in Delhi within a month, Youth Congress president Srinivas BV said. He said the campaign is inspired by the historic Dandi March of Mahatma Gandhi against the British salt monopoly.Thousands of farmers, mainly from northern India, have camped on the borders of Delhi since November 26 to protest against the laws they say will weaken their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.“Over 65 farmers have lost their lives at Delhi borders since past 50 days agitating in a peaceful and democratic manner. They are braving extreme weather conditions and have remained undeterred by the excessive force used by the central government against them,” said Srinivas BV.During the campaign from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, the soil will be collected, especially from villages and home towns of the 65 farmers, who have lost their lives during the agitation. Srinivas BV visited Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh last week to collect the soil.“With that soil, we will create a map of India, the one built on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and sacrifices made by martyrs who laid their lives during the freedom struggle of India,” said Krishna Allavaru, the national in-charge of the Youth Congress.Srinivas BV has organised health, blood donation campaigns and provided food and medicines to the protesting farmers at different places along Delhi’s borders with Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Congress has also announced countrywide protests on January 15 against the three farm laws.A delegation of Congress leaders, led by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, on December 24 met President Ram Nath Kovind to demand a special Parliament session to repeal the laws.The Congress-ruled states have also passed bills bypassing the central laws that allow agribusinesses to trade with minimal regulation, permit traders to stockpile large quantities of food commodities for scale, and lay down new contract farming rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-youth-congress-collects-soil-for-india-s-map-as-a-tribute-101610594725824.html

The indigenous content of LCA-Tejas is 50% in Mk-1A variant which will be enhanced to 60%,” Singh said in a statement posted on his Twitter timeline.The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft, the defence ministry said in a statement.The sheer number of fighters to be ordered and the capability that the Mk-1A variants will bring along with their modern weapons will significantly enhance the staying power and combat potential of the IAF, said Air Marshal KK Nohwar (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“The approval for the deal couldn’t have come at a better time considering the strong message it will sent to India’s neighbourhood. Also, it reflects the government’s sharp focus on the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (self-reliant India movement,” Nohwar said.HAL is expected to provide the first Mk-1A deliveries to the IAF three years after the deal is signed, with all the aircraft likely to be delivered by 2028-29. The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies, the officials said. “HAL has already set-up second line manufacturing facilities at its Nasik and Bengaluru Divisions. Equipped with the augmented infrastructure, the HAL will steer LCA-Mk1A production for timely deliveries to the IAF,” Singh said in another tweet.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123.The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability.The AESA radar, BVR missiles, electronic warfare (EW) suite and air-to-air refuelling are critical capabilities that will make the LCA Mk-1A a potent platform that meets the operational requirements of the IAF, the defence ministry said in a statement. “The decision taken today will considerably expand the current LCA ecosystem and help in creating new job opportunities. HAL follows a system integrator model in LCA Mk-1A program and acts as an umbrella organisation, fostering manufacturing & design capabilities in pvt. Industry,” the defence minister tweeted. The Tejas programme will boost the Atmanirbhar drive in the aerospace and aeronautics sectors, said HAL chairman R Madhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-clears-48k-cr-tejas-deal-first-deliveries-in-2024-101610569100193.html
14-01-2021||India||Probe all custodial deaths, rules NHRC||Ten years after it wrongly interpreted section 176 (1A) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has revoked a 2010 order which limited the scope of enquiry into custodial deaths to only those cases where there was reasonable suspicion of foul play or well-founded allegations of an offence.The human rights body issued a revised order in September 2020 that was not made public. The order, seen by HT, stated that the enquiry in all cases of custodial deaths, including natural deaths or deaths due to any illness, shall be conducted by a judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate.Section 176 (1A) was inserted in the statute in 2005, mandating an enquiry by judicial magistrate or metropolitan magistrate in cases of death, rapes and disappearances in custody; such enquiries were done by executive magistrates before 2005.However, a full bench of NHRC, on April 5, 2010, misinterpreted the law and issued an order saying that “when there is no suspicion or foul play or where there is no evidence or allegation of an offence, an enquiry by a judicial magistrate is not mandatory”.As a result, state police forces have been registering most custodial deaths incidents as natural deaths or suicides, according to experts. For example, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) , out of 85 total cases of custodial deaths in 2019, 33 were recorded as suicides and 36 as being caused by illnesses. Only two deaths were recorded due to physical assault in police custody. Similarly, almost 70% of deaths in police custody in the past decade (out of a total 1,004) have been attributed to illness, suicide or death from natural causes.NHRC’s full commission, led by its former Chairperson H L Dattu, observed the anomaly in the 2010 order and decided to withdraw it.In its recently revised order, reviewed by HT, and circulated to all states and Centre, NHRC has said – “…in three circumstances viz. death, disappearance or rape alleged to have been committed on any woman within the police or judicial custody, there must be an inquiry to be conducted by the Judicial Magistrate or Metropolitan Magistrate, in whose jurisdiction, the incident has taken place.”The provision, it said, cannot be diluted by qualifying that such an inquiry will be conducted only in suspicious circumstances.Dattu, who completed his five-year tenure as NHRC Chairperson last month, said: “I felt it required some sort of tinkering to bring it to proper perspective as there was something missing in the judgement (referring to the NHRC 2010 order). We noticed that several complaints were coming to the NHRC regarding natural death or suicide cases not being inquired by judicial or metropolitan magistrates. This required correction”.Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said “In most of the cases, to cover-up the store of abuse, the deaths are recorded as natural death or due to illness. It’s important that there is course correction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-all-custodial-deaths-rules-nhrc-101610567294556.html
14-01-2021||India||BSF finds tunnel used by Pulwama attackers||The Border Security Force (BSF) and Jammu Police on Wednesday detected a 150m long cross-border tunnel at the international border that intelligence agencies believe may have been used by Mohammad Umar Farooq, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar’s nephew, to enter India to execute the February 14, 2019, Pulwama terror attack in which 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed.The tunnel, approximately 100m long on the Indian side and believed to be 50-60m long on the Pakistani side, is suspected to have been used by JeM terrorists to infiltrate India at least four times since April 2018, intelligence officials added on condition of anonymity.It was the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that mapped Farooq’s route from Pakistan to India using GPS data recovered from his phone, satellite imagery and the interrogation of several suspects.NIA recovered a video from his phone in which Farooq and others were seen praying at the launchpad just before infiltrating into India in the Shakargarh area.A counterterrorism official, who did not want to be named, said the information about the tunnel was shared by NIA with central intelligence agencies, BSF, and the Jammu & Kashmir Police in March 2020, and since then, efforts were made to locate it. “However, the terrain and the tall elephant grass on the Pakistani side makes it difficult to detect tunnels at the border,” added this person.BSF inspector general NS Jamwal gave details of the tunnel to reporters in Jammu on Wednesday: “The tunnel detected along the International Border in Hiranagar sector of Kathua is approx 150m long, [and] proper engineering effort has gone into its construction. It was dug 25 to 30 feet beneath the ground. We have found 10-15 sand bags with Pakistani markings in the tunnel. It seems that it hasn’t been used recently.”The counterterrorism official said that its possible that JeM may have stopped using the tunnel after Indian investigators cracked the Pulwama case.Farooq, 24, a skilled bomb-maker trained in hybrid camps of al Qaeda, Taliban, JeM and the Haqqani network inside Afghanistan, is believed to have entered India in April 2018 using this particular tunnel in Hiranagar Sector of Kathua along with four others, including Mohammad Ismail alias Saifullah. He soon took over as the JeM commander of Pulwama, officials said. Farooq was killed in an encounter with the security forces on March 29, 2019, but not before bringing India and Pakistan on the brink of war by executing the deadliest terror attack in the Valley. Saifullah is believed to be the current chief of Jaish in the Valley.This is third such sophisticated tunnel detected by central agencies since August 29, 2020, in Jammu-Samba Sector. Counterterror and security officials believe these are used for infiltration, the smuggling of arms and ammunition, and also to ferry across money to fund terror strikes.An intelligence official, who asked not to be named, said Indian agencies have reason to believe that there may be two similar tunnels in the area which need to be detected.Former BSF director general DK Pathak said: “Ever since we got fencing on the border, Pakistani infiltrators try to dig tunnels that are not clearly visible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-finds-tunnel-used-by-pulwama-attackers-101610564042524.html

He has bought residences in Noida with disproportionate assets. He has used district budget plans to purchase fodder from Punjab at twice the cost without having any authority to do so and beyond the prescribed rates of the Government of Uttarakhand. He has taken a large number of officers on deputation in the Sheep Board without creating any posts thereby causing veterinary hospitals in districts to shut down. These officers have no work but get salaries. This has clearly been done after monetary gratification…”She urged that the programme be stopped immediately and the appropriate action is taken. “This is equivalent to the scandals of coal, Bofors etc.”Reacting to the allegations, Anand had said, “I am preparing a reply which will be submitted to the secretary of the department and other senior authorities of the state government. Whatever money has been spent has been done following all protocols.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-orders-probe-after-maneka-gandhi-alleges-scam-in-wool-board-101610561896708.html
14-01-2021||India||4-tier workforce to oversee vaccination drive||The authorities have put in place a four-tier supervisory and management system that stretches down to the district and block levels to ensure a smooth roll-out of the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination programme, which will begin on January 16.Assisted by committees, task forces and control room personnel, an army of government officials and representatives of foreign aid agencies will monitor the complex immunisation drive at every level and act quickly to keep the programme on track if anything goes amiss, people familiar with the matter said.This command structure will also include dedicated units to tackle any adverse events following immunization that include side-effects of the vaccines. At the state as well as district levels, special committees on adverse events have been formed, in line with the official guidelines.The National Expert Group on Covid Vaccine (NEGVAC), the nerve-centre of the Narendra Modi government for all vaccine-related issues, has played its role since August 202. Now, as the vials started reaching the hinterland of India and vaccination, it is the turn of the rest of the machinery to get into the act.Every state will have a steering committee as well as a task force and a control room to monitor the immunisation drive. The steering committee will be headed by the chief secretary and the health secretary will head the task force.The steering committee, comprising representatives of several departments, has been assigned tasks such as oversight on the creation of a database of health-care workers, review of the preparedness of the cold chain, operational planning and even to devise strategies to tackle “anticipated state-specific challenges,” the people cited above said.This panel will also be in charge of financial planning and explore the use of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to pay for activities related to the Covid-19 vaccination drive.The state task force, which meets at least once a fortnight, will oversee the roll-out of the vaccines, develop a media plan to address rumors and will be responsible for social mobilization of the vaccine recipients. It will resolve issues of micro-planning, logistics, human resource availability, training and waste management.The control rooms, with a clear chain of command, will be involved in day-to-day planning for mobilization of workforce as well as logistics. The guideline issued by the Centre said: “They need to oversee that while planning for the sessions and session site allocation” and “ensure that there is no delayed decision making.”The urban centres, which are expected to see a higher concentration of vaccine recipients and vaccination sites, will have their own separate task forces. Headed by the municipal commissioner, their work will be similar to that of their district counterpart.The block task force, headed by a sub-divisional magistrate or a block development officer, will meet every week and are entrusted with identifying vaccinators across government and private sectors, monitor the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines at the block level and ensure minimal disruption of other routine health services.The immunization will see a mega workforce—mostly comprising government officials—with specific duties.“For us, it is an extension of the ongoing universal immunization programme. But this is the first time, a vaccination of such a large scale is taking place in a time-bound manner. No wonder there will be several backroom boys and managers playing crucial roles behind each vaccination,” an official familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4tier-workforce-to-oversee-vaccination-drive-101610561483774.html
14-01-2021||India||Debate over vaccine approval intensifies, Paul says have faith in regulator||The controversy around the use of Bharat Biotech’s coronavirus vaccine candidate Covaxin continued on Wednesday as the inoculation began shipping for the first time, with leaders from the Congress questioning the government’s decision to roll it out even though it had not progressed far enough in its human trials – concerns that officials attempted to allay afresh later in the day.Covaxin is one of two manufactured-in-India coronavirus vaccines cleared by regulators for emergency use on January 3. Bharat Biotech, the Hyderabad-based manufacturer, began phase III clinical trials in mid-November and is expected to require several months more before it can determine how effective the vaccine is.The first vaccinations will be carried out on January 16.“Covaxin was licensed by government for emergency use. Now government is saying that the recipient won’t be able to pick and choose the vaccine which is administered to them. When phase 3 trial of Covaxin is not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari told news agency ANI on Wednesday.His reference was to comments by government representatives on Tuesday that recipients selected for vaccination in the first phase will not have a say in which shot they will get.“You can’t use rollout as phase 3 trial, Indians are not guinea pigs,” he added.“Deeply disturbing report. It is imperative that the Covaxin trials meet the highest standards and that no one is pressed into participation without their informed consent,” Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said in a tweet, while linking to a news report that said trial volunteers had been misled.The Union ministry of health and family welfare announced on Wednesday it had allocated all procured doses of Covaxin to States and Union Territories in proportion of health care workers database, and concerns regarding its safety were baseless.Officials in non-BJP ruled states too have expressed concerns over the vaccine. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee took up the matter in a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday and Chattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo on Saturday said the shot should not be used until its complete results are out.“People should have faith in India’s drugs regulator; the product has been approved after due diligence. Having said that we are still in the process of learning; we are adapting based on the evidence before us and it is an accepted norm. The research is going on and we are keeping a close watch,” said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.“No government currently is offering a Covid vaccine choice to its people; not even US and UK. There simply aren’t enough supplies in market. It is a public health emergency and the government’s are regulating the vaccination drive so that all those who need the vaccine are not left out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/debate-over-vaccine-approval-intensifies-paul-says-have-faith-in-regulator-101610561423296.html
14-01-2021||India||Decriminalising adultery could lead to ‘instability’ in armed forces: Govt to SC||The Centre has sought a clarification from the Supreme Court to the effect that the 2018 order decriminalising adultery would apply only to civilians and not defence personnel because not prosecuting soldiers for adultery could cause “instability” in the armed forces.Maintaining that “honour is the sine quo non of the services,” a plea by the ministry of defence (MoD) asserted that adultery must remain a valid ground to prosecute defence personnel under army laws.In September 2018, a five-judge constitution bench struck down Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, declaring it to be unconstitutional and violative of right to equality of women in treating them as “chattel” (an item of property) and inferior to their husbands. Section 497 made adultery an offence only with respect to a man, who has a relationship with wife of someone else.The wife was considered neither adulterous nor an abettor in law, while the man could be jailed for up to five years. In that case, the Centre defended the law, saying it protected sanctity of marriages.On Wednesday, MoD’s clarification plea was argued by Attorney General KK Venugopal before a bench, headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman, where the law officer submitted that the armed forces required a completely different standard of discipline and that, therefore, the army act and other pertinent laws must be treated as outside the scope of the 2018 judgment.“Adultery can be defined as an ‘unbecoming act’ or punishable under “good order and discipline” rule under the army act. Such officers can be court martialed and cashiered. We thus want a clarification that the constitution bench judgment is not applicable to personnel of the armed forces,” Venugopal told the bench, which also included justices Navin Sinha and KM Joseph.Venugopal added that this clarification was required to obviate any counter-argument by an officer sought to be prosecuted that the armed forces were acting contrary to the Supreme Court’s verdict.Agreeing with the AG, the bench responded that it was also of the prima facie view that the IPC and the army act or other laws governing navy and air force stood on different footings and therefore, even as adultery was no more an offence under the IPC, it could constitute an ‘unbecoming conduct’ under the army act.But the bench, at the same time, added that it was not competent to issue a clarification in this regard since the 2018 judgment was passed by a constitution bench of five judges. “This will have to be put up before the constitution bench,” the bench told the AG.The bench then referred the matter to the Chief Justice of India for constituting a five-judge bench to examine the MoD’s application. It, however, issued a notice to the PIL petitioner in the case, Kerala-resident Joseph Shine, who was represented in the court through advocate Kaleeswaram Raj.The plea by the MoD has stated: “The aforesaid judgment passed by this court may cause instability within the Services, as defence personnel are expected to function in peculiar conditions, during the course of which many a time they have to stay separated from their families for long durations, when they are posted on borders or other far-flung areas or in areas having inhospitable weather and terrain.”It sought to highlight that since the Supreme Court has decriminalised adultery, “there will always be a concern in the minds of the army personnel who are operating far away from their families under challenging conditions about the family indulging in untoward activity.”Drawing a distinction between Section 497 in the IPC and the relevant laws in the armed forces, the MoD stated that unlike Section 497, the army laws did not make a difference between a male or a female and that it was a gender-neutral provision prosecuting soldiers of both the sexes for such acts.“In other words, the army would equally proceed against a female subject to the act, if she enters into an adulterous/illicit relationship,” said the application, adding the laws governing the defence personnel were not discriminatory in nature.The Attorney General’s arguments in the top court are based on inputs obtained from the defence ministry and the armed forces, army officials familiar with the case said on the condition of anonymity. Adultery definitely amounts to conduct unbecoming of a soldier and those guilty have to be punished, the officials said.The armed forces see adultery -- “stealing the affections of a brother officer’s wife” -- as an offence that is just a notch below the worst offence an enlisted person can be accused of, cowardice. The provision to deal with this, drawn from Section 497, exists in all three services, and the punishment is usually dismissal.The MoD underlined the necessity of retention of adultery as an offence for the defence personnel: “That one has to remember that the Armed Forces exist in an environment wholly different and distinct from civilians. Honour is a sine qua non of the service. Courage, and devotion to duty, even at the risk of one’s lives, is part of the unwritten contract governing the members of the armed forces.”It also relied upon Article 33 of the Constitution to make a point that this provision allowed Parliament to restrict or modify operation of fundamental rights with regard to armed forces so as to ensure proper discharge of duties and maintenance of discipline.Looking from this prism too, the MoD said, its laws to govern defence personnel could not be held bad only because they abridged some of their fundamental rights.In 2018, months after the top court’s judgment, then finance minister Arun Jaitley had said that the Supreme Court had ventured into areas best left alone with its landmark verdicts against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and adultery.Speaking at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Jaitley wondered if sexual activity was treated as part of free speech, then if it could be restrained in any form in a school hostel, prison or army frontier.“While writing these historical judgments the judges get carried away and want to be part of history,” he had said. “You go a step further.”With the adultery judgment, Jaitley felt the court overstepped when it said adultery was like other matrimonial offences and were personal wrongs and not public wrongs, therefore outside the criminal law.“Now will it cover bigamy and polygamy also? Will it cover cruelty? Will it cover dowry offences – if this was the case, the judgment would be wholly anti women,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-adultery-a-crime-in-forces-says-centre-101610561363314.html
14-01-2021||India||Stage set for vaccine roll-out as Covaxin adds to supplies||As the first supplies of Bharat Biotech International’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, Covaxin, were dispatched from its Hyderabad base on Wednesday, the Centre intends to instruct state administrations on the number of sites where it should be deployed, a top government official said on condition of anonymity.It will be up to the governments to decide the locations of the sites where Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Covaxin, the indigenous vaccine Bharat Biotech has developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) , will be administered..“The Centre will communicate to the states the number of vaccination sites where Covishield and Covaxin will be deployed respectively. The states will decide the specific sites, that is site names, on their own where the vaccine supply is to be directed,” said the official, who is involved in the vaccine delivery process.Bharat Biotech announced in a statement on Wednesday that the company had shipped Covaxin to 11 cities: Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai and Lucknow.Although 5.5 million doses of Covaxin have been procured by the government, the company did not disclose how many had been shipped on Wednesday.“After having received the government purchase order for 55 lakh doses, Bharat Biotech shipped the first batch of vaccines (each vial containing 20 doses)… While some shipments have arrived in the respective cities, others will be delivered later this evening. Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” the company said in a statement.Most of the states that have received Covaxin will be administering it in bigger health-care facilities such as medical colleges so that adverse reactions after immunisation, if any, are better tracked.Covaxin is still in Phase 3 trials, and is to be administered in a clinical trial mode, according to a condition in its regulatory approval.“As per the Centre’s guideline, Covaxin is to be sent to bigger facilities, which for us will mean medical colleges. I will discuss it with the principal secretary and firm up a vaccine distribution plan tomorrow,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, who is also the state nodal officer for the Covid-19 vaccination.Bihar has received 1,000 vials of Covaxin that is equal to 20,000 doses.Individual consent has to be taken before administering Covaxin to any heath-care workers who will be vaccinated in the first phase of immunisation from January 16, added Kumar.In Odisha, Covaxin will be administered to 9,000 health-care workers.“Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech will be administered to 9,000 front-line health-workers in Bhubaneswar while Covishield of Serum Institute of India will be given to shortlisted people in all other districts across the state,” said Dr Bijay Panigrahi, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in Odisha.Even though 1.65 million vaccine doses were given by Bharat Biotech to the government of India for free, the total number of doses that the government has purchased from the company is 5.5 million. The remaining doses will be sold at a price of ₹295 plus government taxes.“The evaluation of COVAXIN™ has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants,” the company statement read.“This vaccine has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data…,” it added.With inputs from states||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-vaccine-roll-out-as-covaxin-adds-to-supplies-101610561243255.html

This was kind of Christmas and New Year gift for the entire Estonia nation. We are very happy about it because this is proof of our bilateral relations, trust and common interest to promote further bilateral relations," Kivi told ANI.The opening embassy in Estonia is not just an announcement, it also means the expansion of India's trade into the entire northern region and a kind of gateway to enter in European Union, said Kivi."The opening of a new embassy in Estonia has many benefits for both countries. One of the best benefits is to open an Indian mission in European soil or Estonian soil, through which Indian businesses will reach out not only in Estonia but to the entire European Union market, and this is a very dynamic and very comprehensive business reach out in northern Europe. I would say not only India could open up the resident mission in Estonia but it also concludes the free trade agreement with European Union that might be getting more beneficial for both the countries," the Estonian envoy told ANI.The Estonian envoy further said the way of aggressiveness shown by India against terrorism is welcome and it is known to all that India has always raised the concern of terrorism in all global fora."Estonia absolutely condemns terrorism in any form and all forms.

The incoming Biden administration hasn’t fully spelled out its China policy though most experts believe president-elect Joe Biden will be less confrontational even as he counters challenges from Beijing.The strategy document states that China “seeks to dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics”, and use them in the “service of authoritarianism”.China’s dominance in these technologies poses “profound challenges to free societies”, and China’s proliferation of “digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations will damage US efforts to promote our values and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region” and even in the Western hemisphere, the document adds.The strategy also envisages China taking “increasingly assertive steps to compel unification with Taiwan”.One of the strategic goals of the US, according to the document released on Wednesday with slight redactions, is working with partners on every continent to resist “Chinese activities aimed at undermining their sovereignty, including through covert or coercive influence”.In a specific section on China, the document points to US efforts to counter China in the trade and military spheres, including Beijing’s industrial policies and “unfair trading practices” that distort global markets, and its use of military force against the Washington and its allies or partners.On the military front, the US’s objective is deterring China “from using military force against the United States and US allies or partners”, and developing capabilities and concepts to “defeat Chinese actions across the spectrum of conflict”.According to the document, the US will work to “enhance combat-credible US military presence and posture in the Indo-Pacific region, to uphold US interests and security commitments”, and help its allies and partners “improve their security posture, including military capabilities and interoperability, to ensure strategic independence and freedom from Chinese coercion”.The US will also expand “partnerships and capabilities that limit China’s ability to coerce allies and partners”, the document adds.In order to counter China’s intelligence activities, the US will equip its allies and partners to counter “China’s clandestine activities in their countries” and expand American intelligence and law enforcement activities that counter “Chinese influence operations”.The US will also help allies and partners develop high standards in counterintelligence, counter-proliferation, cyber-security and industrial security.China’s “predatory economic practices” freeze out foreign competition, undermine US economic competitiveness, and abet the “Chinese Communist Party’s aspiration to dominate the 21st century economy, and the US will build “international consensus that China’s industrial policies and unfair trading practices are damaging the global trading system”, according to the strategy document.While seeking to maintain American industry’s innovation edge vis-a-vis China, the US will work with allies and like-minded countries to “prevent Chinese acquisition of military and strategic capabilities; broaden the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to cover venture capital and other forms of investment by China; and adopt domestic policies that promote growth in key technologies”.In order to promote US values across the Indo-Pacific to counterbalance Chinese models of government, the US will develop “public and private messaging and promote initiatives that show the benefits of democracy and liberty...including economic, technologic, and societal benefits”, and coordinate efforts to “protect and promote internationally recognized rights and freedoms”.The US will also enhance its engagement in the Indo-Pacific while “educating governments, businesses, universities, Chinese overseas students, news media, and general citizenries about China’s coercive behaviour and influence operations around the globe”, and invest in capabilities that “promote uncensored communication between Chinese people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/secret-indo-pacific-strategy-how-the-us-sees-china-101610517981601.html
