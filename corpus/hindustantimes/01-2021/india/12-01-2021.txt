JeM chief Masood Azhar was sanctioned by the Security Council in May 2019, almost a decade after a request for his listing, when China withdrew a “technical hold” on the matter.“Some states lack the legal and operational frameworks and technical expertise needed to detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist financing cases. However, other states are clearly guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism and wilfully providing financial assistance and safe havens,” Jaishankar said.“While we must enhance capacities of the former, the international community must collectively call out the latter and hold them accountable,” he added.While proposing the eight-point action plan, Jaishankar called for reforms in the working methods of UN committees dealing with sanctions and counter-terrorism to ensure transparency, accountability and effectiveness. “The practice of placing blocks and holds on listing requests without any rhyme or reason must end. This only erodes our collective credibility,” he said.He said the action plan should also recognise and address links between terror and transnational organised crime. In a reference to Dawood Ibrahim’s organisation, Jaishankar said, “We in India have seen the crime syndicate responsible for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts not just given state protection, but actually enjoying five-star hospitality.”The action plan also included political will to unhesitatingly combat terrorism, removal of double standards and ending the distinction of good and bad terrorists, discouraging “exclusivist thinking” that divides the world and breeds mistrust and hatred among communities, and ensuring that listing and delisting of individuals and entities under the UN sanctions regime is done objectively and not for political or religious considerations.The action plan further called for the effective combating of terror financing. Jaishankar said there should be enhanced cooperation between the UN and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which should continue to identify and remedy weaknesses in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism.He also recommended adequate funding for UN counter-terrorism bodies from the regular budget needs and said the forthcoming review of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy offers an opportunity to strengthen measures to combat terror and build the capacities of member states.Jaishankar said the time had come for all nations to “walk the talk” and commit themselves to the goal of zero tolerance for terrorism at a time when terror groups and lone-wolf attackers had significantly enhanced their capabilities by gaining access to new technologies such as drones, encrypted communications and virtual currencies, and social media networks were contributing to radicalisation and recruitment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dawood-ibrahim-s-group-enjoying-five-star-hospitality-jaishankar-101610475824156.html
12-01-2021||India||'Fatalities will increase if courts open for physical hearing': CJI||Medical advice to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and other judges of the Supreme Court has ruled out against the physical functioning of Courts for the present. Fatalities due to Covid-19 could rise with lawyers and judges congregating for open court hearings.This was stated by CJI SA Bobde during the hearing of a petition filed by lawyer Nilakshi Chaudhary who demanded the reopening of courts. The lawyer, who appeared in person, expressed concerns over the smooth conduct of hearings through videoconferencing platform Vidyo through which the Supreme Court has been conducting virtual court proceedings since March last year.Along with her petition, several bar associations too pleaded before the Court the cause of lawyers facing penury due to loss of work during the Covid-19 lockdown. Some state bar councils were even willing to stand as a guarantee if the Central government was willing to provide interest-free loans to the lawyers.Also read: Trump slams impeachment move as Democrats press aheadRuling out any reopening of physical courts for the present, a three-judge bench headed by the CJI remarked, “We are facing problems in virtual court hearings for almost a year now. But we have also received medical advice from medical authorities that it is dangerous for people to congregate at this time. If physical courts are started, the number of fatalities will increase.”The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, cited instances of High Courts which had to close down after resuming physical courts as Covid-19 began to spread. “In Madras High Court, lawyers are not coming for open court hearings. They have now stopped. Similarly, Rajasthan High Court too resumed physical court hearings but had to close down.”The bench said that the decision to reopen the apex court is being periodically reviewed. “We will start after following medical advice and not without that. We will regularly revisit our decision,” the CJI remarked.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta lauded the Court for keeping the Courts open through the difficult time of the pandemic by ensuring access to justice for litigants through virtual court proceedings.“In a huge country like ours, the top court has not stopped the administration of justice even for a day. That is salutary,” Mehta said. On the aspect of providing financial aid to lawyers under financial distress, Mehta assured the Court of exploring possibilities by taking up the issue with the officers in the concerned department after consulting senior leaders of the bar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatalities-will-increase-if-courts-open-for-physical-hearing-cji-101610475591850.html

They tortured him saying he is a Keralite. Kappan told me and our lawyer that the UP police asked him to name some CPI(M) leaders so that he can escape from the orderal," she said."They also asked why Rahul Gandhi visited our house and whether Kappan eats beef. They accused him of having assets worth ₹100 crore. But just see our house and everyone will understand how much we have," she added.Hamsa, elder brother of Kappan, said the Kerala chief minister had said that the government was unable to interfere in the matter as it was outside the state."We had written a letter to CM seeking his intervention in the matter. But we got a reply saying the government was unable to interfere as it was outside the state. This dharna is to demand the intervention of the CM in the matter. We hope he will. We have been requesting everyone. They (UP police) have not even presented any evidence in the matter," Hamsa said.Reaiheanath said the health of Kappan's mother, who is 90, was deteriorating and needed help for everything.Mother of three minors, Reaiheanath (37) is running from pillar to post seeking justice for Kappan and her family.On January5, the judicial custody of Kappan and three others--Atiq-ur Rehman, Masood, and Alam--was extended by 90 days.Uttar Pradesh police submitted to the court that since most of the offices of the PFI and other allied organisations are based in Kerala and during the investigation there some more information has surfaced, the STF needs the accused to be in judicial custody for verification of the information.According to the FIR, charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the IT Act were also filed against the four men, who were accused by the state police of having links with the PFI.The four men were arrested from a toll plaza in Mathura as they were heading to Hathras district to visit the victim's native village.The Hathras incident that witnessed nationwide outrage involved a 19-year old Dalit woman who was allegedly raped at a village in the district by four men on September 14 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/family-of-arrested-kerala-journalist-siddique-kappan-seeks-cm-s-intervention-101610472391360.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders discussed the law and order situation as Haryana is the “epicentre of farmers’ stir,” Khattar said after the meeting, according to news agency PTI.“Today, the Supreme Court stayed the farm laws and formed a committee. All these were discussed (during the meeting with Amit Shah). Events on January 26 should go well as it's a national festival. Farmers assured in their press conference that it'll be peaceful. It's being hoped that they'll call off agitation and go back home,” Haryana chief minister told news agency ANI after the meeting.“The ball is now in the court of the SC and I feel whatever is its decision, it will be acceptable to all,” Khattar had said after the meeting.The protesting farmers, however, have refused to call off the demonstrations, till the three agricultural legislations are repealed. They said they won't accept any committee formed by the apex court to end the impasse between the government and the protesters as “the members of the committee are pro-government.”Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala along with the state presidents of BJP, the JJP and state cabinet ministers met the home minister in Delhi.Khattar also said that the political situation in the state was alright. “The speculations by the Opposition and media are baseless.

12-01-2021||India||BJP gets a boost in Darjeeling with a clutch of GJM leaders joining it||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday received a shot in the arm in the Darjeeling hills when some leaders of its former partner, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), joined the saffron camp.The BJP which won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat in 2009, retained it in 2014 and 2019 with support from local political parties, the most important among which was the undivided GJM led by Bimal Gurung.The GJM split in 2017 when Gurung, who was charged under anti-terror law by the West Bengal government for the violent Gorkhaland movement, went into hiding. One faction of the party, headed by Binoy Tamang, became an ally of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and it currently runs the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA).Gurung surfaced from hiding in October last year. He too offered support to Mamata Banerjee and swore to defeat the BJP in the coming assembly polls.Among those who joined the BJP at a rally in the outskirts of Siliguri on Tuesday are Swaraj Thapa, former political advisor to Gurung; B P Bajgain, Gurung’s former spokesperson and Sawan Rai and L M Lama, former central committee members of the GJM’s Binoy Tamang faction.Many GJM (Gurung faction) leaders from Terai, Kalimpong and Kurseong also joined the BJP. The party also roped in many academicians and trade union leaders and a retired West Bengal Civil Service officer.Sayantan Basu, the BJP state general secretary who addressed the rally along with Raju Bista the party’s Lok Sabha MP from Darjeeling said, “The BJP is committed to the cause of the Gorkhas.”“The development will create more fissures in the local parties including the GJM’s Gurung faction,” said Kalyan Dewan, the BJP’s Darjeeling unit president. Dewan himself was a senior leader of the Gurung faction before joining the BJP.The hill leaders who joined the BJP said that they still believe that the BJP is the only party that will deliver what it promised to the people of Darjeeling.The BJP, in its 2019 election manifesto, had promised to find a permanent political solution to the Gorkhaland issue and give scheduled tribe status to 11 Gorkha communities.Gurung has alleged in his recent speeches that the BJP betrayed the Gorkhas and wasted their time for 12 years. He appeared before the media in Kolkata on October 21 and announced that he would shift his allegiance to Mamata Banerjee. Gurung has been asking people to vote for the TMC since then.Lacking local leaders, the BJP was finding it difficult to set up a new base in the north Bengal hills. The scenario somewhat changed on Tuesday. Other smaller parties, such as the Gorkha National Liberation Front and Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists have already offered to support the BJP if it helps the cause of the Gorkhas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-gets-a-boost-in-darjeeling-with-a-clutch-of-gjm-leaders-joining-it-101610468891452.html

So from the said point of view, the petitioner satisfies the requirement of the meaning of the expression leader of opposition,” Justice Bujor Barua said in his order.“Prima facie the order contained in the notification dated 01-01-2021 of the secretary, Assam legislative assembly withdrawing the recognition of the petitioner Debabrata Saikia as the leader of opposition would be unsustainable, both on law as well as on facts,” the order added.The matter has been listed for hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gauhati-hc-stays-removal-of-congress-leader-of-opposition-in-assam-assembly-101610467825290.html
12-01-2021||India||Elusive tiger attacks another forest official in Kerala’s Wayanad||The elusive tiger which triggered panic in Pulpally in Wayanad district of north Kerala attacked another forest guard on Tuesday while officials were trying to dart the big cat. The tiger, however, escaped the dragnet yet again.Last Saturday, a forest ranger T Sasikumar was attacked by the tiger while he was searching for it in a private estate after it killed three domestic animals. Wayanad forest divisional officer B Ranjith Kumar said hectic efforts are on to trap the animal which strayed into human habitat from the nearby Bandipur tiger reserve.Earlier forest officials had brought urine of a female tigress from Mysuru Zoo and sprayed it near the trap to attract the animal and cage it. But it failed to fall into the “honey trap”. For the last two days, at least 70 forest officials and local people have beenpressed into service to locate the male tiger.On Tuesday it was located with the help of a drone and officials fired darting shots but it attacked a forest guard and got away. Local people have been warned not to step out of their houses till the animal was trapped. Local people say straying of a tiger into human habitat has become routine these days.Two months back another tiger was trapped in the district after it killed many domestic animals and tried to attack human beings. The injured big cat is now undergoing treatment. Wild animals straying into human habitat is regular in Wayanad these days, local people blame the rising tiger population for this. In June a tribal youth was killed and his half-eaten body was recovered later. A woman two-wheeler rider had a narrow escape in August after it chased her.The district also boasts of a wildlife sanctuary which is a favourite habitat of elephants and tigers. According to the last wildlife census the Wayanad wildlife sanctuary spread over 344 sq km is home to 80 tigers. The district has 60 per cent forest cover and it is a good tourist destination also. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi represents it in the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elusive-tiger-attacks-another-forest-official-in-kerala-s-wayanad-101610465415768.html

This is expected to lead to a surge in prices of mutton, chicken, fish, duck etc.“Assam has not recorded any case of bird flu, but the ban on import has been placed to ensure that the disease doesn’t reach our state. There’s no threat of bird flu if people consume poultry products which are cooked properly,” said Ashok Barman, director, animal husbandry and veterinary department.The ban on import hasn’t affected markets which are flooded with fish, chicken, duck and other products from within the state. People across the state are also busy preparing traditional sweets called ‘larus’ and ‘pithas’ for the festival.As has been seen in previous years, villages in many parts of Assam took part in collective fishing in rivers, ponds and water bodies to prepare for the Uruka feast on Wednesday night.In villages across Assam, people are also giving finishing touches to traditional ‘mejis’ and ‘bhela ghars’ (temporary night shelters made of bamboo and straw) which are burnt on the morning of Magh Bihu.“Bhogali Bihu is a estival fof feasting and celebrations. True to the spirit of Bhogali Bihu where ‘mejis’ are set on fire, we should all give up our ill feelings and consign them in the flames of ‘mejis’ to strengthen our bond of unity,” Governor Jagadish Mukhi said in his Magh Bihu greetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-prepares-for-magh-bihu-celebrations-amid-bird-flu-scare-101610464152473.html

A reward of ₹10,000 has been announced on arrest of each of the accused," Sharma said.The tragedy in Morena comes less than three months after at least 14 people lost lives in Ujjain district in a similar incident.District excise officer Javed Ahmad and Bagchini police station in-charge in Morena district Avinash Rathore were suspended on the ground of dereliction of duty, officials said.The deceased include Ram Kumar Kirar, Dharmendra Singh, Dilip Shakya, Jitendra Jatav, Sarnam Kirar, Kedar Jadhav, Mukesh Kirar and Mukut Singh Rathore, residents of Manpur-Chhaira village, Bunty, Jitendra and Ramnivas, residents of Pawali village and Amar Singh, a resident of Bilaiyapura, police said.“Twelve persons died and seven fell after drinking what is suspected to be spurious liquor. An FIR has been lodged under section 304 (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of Madhya Pradesh Excise Act. Investigation in the case is going on. Some people have been detained for questioning,” deputy inspector general (DIG) of police of Morena range Rajesh Hingankar had said earlier in the day.A police officer who did not wish to be named said the victims were in a group who attended a party where they drank. It was around midnight when the victims started falling ill and their condition deteriorated leading to the death of 10 of them on the way to hospitals.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said that illicit alcohol was responsible for the casualties.“The deaths caused by spurious liquor in Morena are unfortunate and painful. A police station in charge has been suspended. A separate team is being sent for an investigation. None of the guilty will be spared.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also termed the incident as unfortunate in a tweet and said the guilty would not be spared.“Though investigation in the case is going on, the district excise officer has been suspended on the ground of his carelessness in supervision. As and when facts during the investigation come to light the guilty will not be spared. We will take a stern action,” he said.The opposition Congress, however, attacked the BJP government for the tragedy.State Congress president Kamal Nath said, “The mafia who were crushed by the then Congress government are operating with impunity during the BJP government. The liquor mafia continues to wreak havoc in the state. Earlier they killed about 16 people in Ujjain and now they have killed more than 10 in Morena.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-men-die-after-drinking-illicit-alcohol-in-madhya-pradesh-s-morena-district-101610464158702.html

Those who propagate this distinction have an agenda and those who cover up for them are just as culpable.”The Union minister pointed out that some states lack the legal or operational frameworks and technical expertise to detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist financing cases while there are others that are guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism provide financial assistance and safe havens.“While we must enhance the capacities of the former, the international community must collectively call out the latter and hold them accountable,” he told the UN members.Jaishankar asserted, “Nor should we allow terrorism to be justified & terrorists glorified. All members must fulfill the obligations enshrined in int'l counter-terrorism instruments,” according to ANI.The foreign minister said that enlisting and delisting of individuals and entities under the UN sanctions regimes must be done objectively and not for political or religious considerations. “Proposals in this regard merit due examination before circulation” he added.According to the minister, terrorist groups and lone-wolf attackers have enhanced their capabilities in the recent years by gaining access to emerging technologies, including drones, virtual currencies and encrypted communications. Social media networks have contributed to radicalization and recruitment of youth, he added.Emphasising on the seriousness of the times, Jaishankar said the Covid-19 pandemic has only aggravated the situation further. The relative isolation and extended disruption due to the lockdowns and the associated distress and economic uncertainty has made the world more susceptible to radicalizing narratives and extremist propaganda, he said in his address.He said the linkages between terrorism and transnational organized crime need to be fully recognized and addressed vigorously. “We, in India, have seen crime syndicate responsible for the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts not just given State protection but enjoying 5-star hospitality,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/breaking-at-unsc-debate-jaishankar-says-there-must-be-no-ifs-and-buts-in-fight-against-terrorism-101610462898716.html

12-01-2021||India||Gap of 28 days between two Covid-19 vaccine doses, effectiveness to begin after 14 days: Govt||There will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and its effectiveness will begin 14 days after the second dose, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday.Addressing a press briefing, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said vaccine effectiveness will be seen only after 14 days."So we urge people to keep following Covid appropriate behaviour," he said. Bhushan said there will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of Covid-19 vaccine.India will launch its Covid-19 vaccination drive from January 16 with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.India had recently granted emergency use authorisation to two vaccines, Oxford's Covishield being manufactured by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. Both vaccines, the statement from the Health Ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.Dr V K Paul member, NITI Aayog member, said these two vaccines have been tested in thousands of people, they are the safest and there is no risk of any significance."We should have no doubt that the two vaccines approved are the safest of the vaccines. Both the vaccines have been tested on thousands of people and side-effects are negligible. There is no risk of any significance," he said.Bhushan said that as said earlier, there will be a sequential rollout of Covid-19 vaccination."Healthcare workers (approximately one crore) will be on the top priority, followed by frontline workers (approximately 2 crore) and prioritized age groups (approximately 27 crore). The cost of healthcare workers and frontline workers will be borne by the central government," Bhushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gap-of-28-days-between-two-covid-19-vaccine-doses-effectiveness-to-begin-after-14-days-govt-101610459728160.html
12-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccines, cooperation to be focus of Nepal foreign minister's visit||Procuring Covid-19 vaccines and development cooperation will be the focus of Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali’s visit to India during January 14-16 though the border row is expected to figure in discussions, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.Gyawali is visiting at the invitation of his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar for a meeting of the India-Nepal joint commission, which will discuss the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including Covid-19 cooperation and the boundary issue, according to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry.Though Nepal has formally reached out to both India and China for vaccines, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity that Kathmandu had indicated a preference for sourcing doses from New Delhi because of a variety of factors, including pricing, logistics and well-established links between the health sectors of the two countries.“The joint commission meeting will discuss the whole gamut of Nepal-India bilateral relations, including trade, transit, energy, boundary, Covid-19 cooperation, infrastructure, connectivity, investment, agriculture, tourism, culture, among others,” the readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry said.The people cited above said Nepal is hoping India will provide vaccines as assistance to inoculate some portion of the 12 million people it plans to cover in its first phase of vaccinations. Nepal is also looking to buy millions of doses from foreign suppliers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.“These are the sort of issues that will be discussed at the joint commission meeting so that we can work out modalities,” one of the people said.Jaishankar said on Tuesday that India’s ability to export vaccines after meeting domestic needs will become clear over the next few weeks. Officials have already said India’s neighbours will get priority for the supply of vaccines.India-Nepal ties had come under the shadow of a border row last year after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s government issued a new political map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a strategic road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China.Following back-to-back visits to Kathmandu last year by Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, bilateral ties were put on an even keel and the two countries held a series of meetings to boost cooperation in areas such as energy and trade.Ahead of Gyawali’s visit, Oli has sent mixed signals on the border row. Addressing the upper house of Parliament on Sunday, he pledged to “retrieve” Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh from India through diplomatic talks. At the same time, he has also spoken of forging a stronger bond and friendship with India.The people cited above said India had already made its position on the border row very clear – the external affairs ministry had last year described Nepal’s new map as “unjustified cartographic assertion” – and the stance hadn’t changed.Gyawali is the senior-most Nepalese leader to visit India since the Covid-19 outbreak and his delegation will include the foreign secretary, health secretary and other senior officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/untitlcovid19-vaccines-cooperation-to-be-focus-of-nepal-foreign-minister-s-vis-101610459927218.html

12-01-2021||India||54.72 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses received till Tuesday afternoon: Centre||The Centre said 54.72 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses have been received at designated national and state-level stores till Tuesday afternoon, and all the shots -- 1.1 crore from the Serum Institute of India and 55 lakh from Bharat Biotech -- will be received by January 14.A massive pan-India inoculation drive against Covid-19 was set in process with Covishield vaccine leaving Pune for 13 cities across India early in the morning, four days before vaccination is scheduled to begin on January 16.Apart form the 1.1 crore doses of Covishield being procured from the Serum Institute of India, 55 lakh doses of indigenously developed Covaxin were being obtained from Bharat Biotech, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference."Fifty-five lakh doses of Covaxin are being procured from Bharat Biotech. For 38.5 lakh doses the price is ₹295 each, excluding taxes. Bharat Biotech is providing 16.5 lakh doses for free which ultimately brings the cost of Covaxin down to ₹206 per dose," he said.Bhushan said there are four Central Government Medical Stores Depots at Chennai, Karnal, Kolkata and Mumbai where the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, doses are being received.Besides this, all states have at least one regional vaccine store. Some big states have multiple stores. Uttar Pradesh has nine such stores, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat four each, Kerala has three such facilities, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka and Rajasthan two each, he said."As we speak, 54,72,000 doses have already been received till 4 pm at these vaccine stores, while 100 per cent doses, 1.1 crore from Serum Institute and 55 lakh from Bharat Biotech, will be received by January 14 in all states and Union Territories," the health secretary added.NITI Aayog member Dr V K Paul, Covishield and Covaxin have been tested on thousands of people. "They are the safest and there is no risk of any significant side effect."Bhushan said that Zydus Cadila, Russia's Sputnik V, Biological E and Gennova are the other vaccines which are in advanced stages of clinical trials in India."In the coming days some of these vaccines too may be approaching the drug controller for emergency use authorisation. There will be sequential roll-out of Covid-19 vaccination."Healthcare workers will be on the top of priority list, followed by frontline workers and prioritized age groups. The cost of vaccination for healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the central government," the Union health secretary said.Giving a scenario of the price of vaccines available round the world, Bhushan said each dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech costs ₹1,431 per dose, Moderna ₹2,348 to ₹2,715, Sinovac ₹1,027, Novavax ₹1,114, Sputnik V less than ₹734 and the one developed by Johnson and Johnson at ₹734."All these vaccines except the one developed by Pfizer can be stored between two to eight degrees Celsius. The one developed by Pfizer needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius," he added.About the effectiveness of the vaccines, Bhushan said those can be observed only after 14 days. "So we urge people to keep following Covid-appropriate behaviour."The health secretary said the five key principles for anti-coronavirus vaccination are to ensure people's participation, utilise the experience of elections and universal immunisation programme, making no compromise on scientific and regulatory norms and neither on existing healthcare services.Noting that the Covid-19 situation is worrisome around the world, he said even though daily new cases are declining in India, there should not be any laxity in following Covid-appropriate behaviour.India's overall Covid-19 positivity rate stands at 5.7 per cent while positivity rate in the last one week was recorded at 2 per cent, Bhushan said, adding that about 43.96 per cent of the total Covid-19 patients are in healthcare facilities while 56.04 per cent patients are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5472-lakh-covid-19-vaccine-doses-received-till-tuesday-afternoon-centre-101610457391541.html
12-01-2021||India||‘Will hold ground in Ladakh for as long as needed’: Gen Naravane on standoff||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China to reduce tensions in the sensitive sector are “prolonged,” even as he described a joint threat from China and Pakistan as “very potent.”He said India should not read too much into the recent withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no reduction of troops by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.Hindustan Times reported on Monday that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but the PLA’s frontline deployments remain unchanged.Speaking to reporters at his customary annual press conference ahead of Army Day on January 15, Naravane said he was hopeful that the ongoing dialogue with China would yield an “amicable solution” but stressed that the operational preparedness of the army was of high order and the force was ready to deal with any eventuality.The two armies are due to hold the ninth round of talks between their senior commanders to resolve the lingering border dispute that has brought chill to ties between India and China.“Eight rounds of talks have taken place between military commanders and each of these rounds has either been preceded or followed by diplomatic level engagement. We will ensure that through the medium of these talks we reach a solution which is acceptable and not detrimental to our interests. And if the talks get prolonged, so be it. We are prepared to hold our ground for as long as it takes to achieve our national goals and interests,” the army chief said.The army chief’s remarks convey two important things, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “First, it is a declaration of resolve and intent to continue with a strong posture along the LAC till the time the matter is resolved to India’s satisfaction and that time is not of paramount importance. Secondly, it also shows that an early resolution appears unlikely, most probably due to the positions of both sides being quite different on the terms of disengagement and de-escalation,” Hooda said.The army chief said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of "mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.The army chief also indicated that there had been no change in the ground situation in eastern Ladakh and the army had carried out a troop rebalance on the northern borders to deal with any challenge. There are plans to use elements of a strike formation in the plains to deal with the Chinese threat.“On the situation at the northern borders, we are carrying out certain studies. We carry out a periodic review of our operational plans and our strategies to deal with various threats --- both external (one front or two fronts) and internal. And based on these reviews, a certain amount of rebalancing does happen. And as the events in eastern Ladakh have shown, there was a requirement of carrying out a certain amount of rebalancing towards our northern borders and this is what we have now put into place,” the army chief said.He said the army was focused not only on eastern Ladakh but along the border with China --- stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand to Arunachal Pradesh.“There is no eyeball-to-eyeball deployment in the central and eastern sectors but friction points are there. In these areas, China has built a lot of infrastructure on its sides including roads and barracks. We monitor all these developments and factor them in when we devise a new strategy,” he said.The army chief did not view the recent withdrawal of Chinese troops from their depth areas as a significant development but pointed out that the PLA’s moves were being closely monitored. He said various Chinese army units and formations come to the Tibetan plateau for their summer training and go back when the winter sets in.“We should not read too much into their presence of absence in these training areas. These areas are well in depth and are as much as 500 km to 1,500 km away from the border. All the same, we keep an eye on their deployments on the Tibetan plateau because these are the forces that could be mobilised and sent to the borders in 24 to 48 hours…However, what is more important is that in the border areas where there is eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, there has been no reduction of troops. That is where we have to be more concerned and careful,” the army chief said.On the origin of the border row with China, Naravane said the army had full details of where the PLA was training in the Ladakh theatre last summer but the latter had the “first-mover advantage” that can never be predicted. He said the Indian Army exploited the same advantage last August when it moved swiftly and occupied strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.“They (PLA) come for training every year and we had full details of the areas they were present in. We were regularly monitoring the situation. But suddenly they had the first-mover advantage. This first-mover advantage will always remain, like we had in the month of August. Even though we were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact, China had no clue that we would surprise them,” he said.The Indian Army swiftly occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The army chief said that there was no doubt that India faced a collusive threat from China and Pakistan.“This is not just something that was part of some strategic paper or loud thought process. It is very much manifesting itself on the ground. There is indeed increased cooperation between China and Pakistan in both military and non-military fields. And a two-front threat is something that we have to be prepared for. And in dealing with such a threat, we have to see which threat is more serious, prioritise it and deal with it first,” he said.The two countries together pose a very potent threat that cannot be wished away and the army keeps that element in mind during its strategic planning, he said.The army chief said that the force was reducing its footprint in the North-east with the security situation there improving manifold in recent years. He said one brigade had been relieved of counter-insurgency duties and two more would follow suit. “We are drawing down in the North-east. It will help us focus more on our primary task, which is dealing with external threats,” he said.On a recent controversial one-man study --- published by a think tank --- that said half of the army was under stress, Naravane said it was based on a highly inadequate sample size of just 400 people. “For 99% accuracy, the sample size should have been 19,000.”On a lighter note, he said maybe there is stress in the army and “I am also stressed.” Stress is not always bad as it can also get work done, he said, adding that measures were in place to deal with the problem.Army women to fly choppers soonArmy chief Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said that the army would soon open the doors of its aviation wing to women officers.“Last month, we moved a proposal to allow women officers in the flying branch of the Army Aviation Corps. Until now, women officers were only carrying out ground duties in army aviation,” the army chief said. The army’s aviation wing operates helicopters.Naravane said that the first batch of women officers will commence training to become pilots in July 2021. They will join front-line flying duties on completion of training in July 2022. Women in the Indian Air Force and the navy carry out flying duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-ground-in-ladakh-for-as-long-as-needed-gen-naravane-on-standoff-101610456603925.html

The assembly elections are likely to take place sometime in April-May.Keeping in mind social distancing norms due to coronavirus pandemic, the Commission could increase the number of polling stations in these states to restrict the number of voters per polling station.In the recently-held Bihar polls, the number of voters per polling station was reduced from 1,200 to 1,000, resulting in creation of additional polling stations.More polling stations would mean deployment of additional election staff and security personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-home-secretary-discuss-requirement-of-central-forces-for-assembly-polls-101610457189166.html
12-01-2021||India||Nepalese PM’s comment on disputed areas sparks unease along Pithoragarh border||After months of calm in Lipulekh, Luimpiyadhura and Kalapani near the Indo-Nepal border in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district, there is unease after Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday said the country would “take back” the three disputed areas from India.The three places had first come under limelight after India inaugurated a road connecting Dharchula to Lipulekh near border with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar on May 8 last year.After Sunday's development, political events have also increased in the Darchula district of Nepal sharing the border with Pithoragarh district where all three disputed areas are located. The Nepal government is also carrying out its own road construction project - the 87-km long Darchula-Tinkar road on its own side of the border after India's move.According to the officials, there are seven villages in the three areas with a total population of about 6,000. Amid the border dispute, they had asserted that they are Indians since ages and Nepal has no authority over the three areas."After PM Oli's statement on Sunday, a political event was held in a village near the border in Darchula on Monday by the leaders of the ruling Nepal Communist Party," a district administration officer said on condition of anonymity.“In the event which was also attended by a senior official of the Nepalese government, a local leader of the ruling party delivered a provocative speech urging the people of the area to be united to take back these areas from India," said the officer.Five border crossing points between the two countries in Pithoragarh have been closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Residents on the Indian side of the border say Oli's statement would "create unwanted political tension on the other side of the border.""The people on both sides of the border have good relations with each other as they have been crossing over for years for trade and other social events. Now, after the issue has flared up again, there will be tension which is not good for people on either side of the border, who don’t want any politics. We have been part of India and will always remain so," said Gurendra Samwal, a resident of Gunji village near Indo-Nepal border.When contacted, district magistrate Pithoragarh, Vijay Jogdande, said, "We can't do anything much or worry about developments on the Nepal side.""There may be political events on that side over the border issue, but we can't do anything about it. The border patrolling agencies are on alert as always even as the border crossing points remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic," said Jogdande.Despite several attempts the chief district officer (equivalent to district magistrate) of Nepal’s Darchula district could not be connected for a response.The relations between the two countries came under strain after Nepal’s Parliament on June 18 passed a constitutional amendment under which it unanimously voted to endorse the new political map showing the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal following India's move of constructing a new road connecting Lipulekh in Pithoragarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepalese-pm-s-comment-on-disputed-areas-sparks-unease-along-pithoragarh-border-101610455539215.html

Addressing a briefing on Tuesday evening, the members of the farmer unions said that the members of the committee are pro-government."We'd issued a press note last night stating that we won't accept any committee formed by Supreme Court for mediation. We were confident that Centre will get a committee formed through Supreme Court to take the burden off their shoulders," said Darshan Pal, the president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, one of the farmer bodies participating in the agitation."We had said yesterday itself that we won't appear before any such committee. Our agitation will go on as usual. All the members of this Committee are pro-government and had been justifying the laws of the government," said Balbir Singh Rajewal, a member of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The farmers are adamant that the government must repeal the three laws passed by Parliament in September last year.The Supreme Court, while hearing a petition on the laws, stayed the implementation of three new farm laws till further orders and decided to set up a four- member committee to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.The names to be included in this committee are: Harsimran Mann of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Dr Pramod Kumar Joshi, agriculture economist Ashok Gulati and Anil Ghanwat of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a Maharashtra-based farm union.Out of these members, Gulati is the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the advisory body of the Government of India on food supplies and pricing policies. The agricultural economist was honoured with the Padma Shri by the President of India in 2015.Dr Joshi is a leading name in the field of agriculture research. He has served as the director of the National Academy of Agricultural Research Management, Hyderabad, and the director of the National Centre for Agricultural Economics and Policy Research, New Delhi.Anil Ghanwat is the president of the Shetkari Sanghatana which has been backing the government in the entire agitation by farmers.

His attempt will be to improve them, said Ghanwat."We are not lauding the Centre's three acts that are described as giving freedom to farmers. It was the Shetkari Sanghatana headed by late Sharad Joshi which had pressed for these changes first," Ghanwat, whose organization has been accused of backing the Centre on the issue despite representing farmers, said."Now the current government has tried to implement them to some extent. My role in the committee will be to protect the interest of farmers and improve these laws," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-reiterate-they-won-t-accept-any-committee-formed-by-sc-on-farm-laws-101610455125354.html

12-01-2021||India||‘Khalistanis have infiltrated farmers' protest’, says Attorney General; SC seeks affidavit||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that a banned Khalistani organisation is extending support to the farmers protesting against the three farm laws of the government.The comment was made by attorney general K K Venugopal during the hearing on the three farm laws, during which the bench stayed the implementation of the controversial laws.Venugopal told the bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde, Justice AS Bopanna, and V Ramasubramanian that 'Khalistanis' have infiltrated into the ongoing farmers' protest, the bench asked him to file an affidavit in this regard."Laudably, the farmers have so far carried on the agitation peacefully and without any untoward incident. But it was pointed out in the course of hearing that a few persons who are not farmers have also joined, with a view to show solidarity with the farmers".It said that an apprehension was expressed that the possibility of some persons creating trouble cannot be entirely ruled out. "In fact, a specific averment is made in an intervention application filed by one Indian Kisan Union, in...that an organisation by name 'Sikhs for Justice', which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. This averment is supported by the learned Attorney General also," it said."If there is an infiltration by a banned organization, and somebody is making an allegation here on record, you have to confirm it. You file an affidavit by tomorrow", Chief Justice Bobde told the AG.The top law officer said that he will do so by Wednesday.The apex court stayed the implementation of the three laws - the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act - against which farmers from all over the country have been protesting.The bench also set up a four-member committee consisting of Bhartiya Kisan Union's HS Mann, Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkeri Sangthana, Pramod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati to help resolve the deadlock between the government and the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalistanis-have-infiltrated-farmers-protest-says-attorney-general-sc-seeks-affidavit-101610454579741.html
12-01-2021||India||Covishield, Covaxin tested on thousands, no doubts about safety: VK Paul||Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have been authorised for restricted emergency use and there should be no doubt about their safety, Dr VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog said on Tuesday, adding that the two vaccines against the coronavirus disease have been tested on thousands of people and the side effects are negligible. “There is no risk of any significance,” he said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also assured that there will neither be any compromise on the scientific and regulatory norms nor on the existing healthcare services during the vaccination drive that begins from January 16 across the nation. “The Centre had been proactive and pre-emptive in addressing the vaccination needs in the country and a task force was set up in May last year to promote indigenous research and development in vaccines, pharmaceuticals and diagnostics,” he said during a health ministry briefing.The remarks come as Pune-based pharma firm SII started the shipment of the Astrazeneca-Ofxord vaccine Covishield across several cities. The Centre has sent a purchase order of 11 million doses of the vaccine which is being provided to it at ₹200 for the first 100 million doses. The price will later be increased to ₹1000 per dose, according to SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla.Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech is ready to dispatch its vaccine Covaxin from the Rajv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad on Tuesday evening. Covaxin, which is still in the third phase of trial, is indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV).During the briefing, VK Paul also lauded the Indian Medical Association (IMA) that has requested its 3.5 lakh members from 1800 local branches to volunteer for Covid-19 vaccination to demonstrate its safety and efficacy to the general public. “The IMA has decided to accept and support the two indigenously developed vaccines. I would like to thank them for this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-covaxin-tested-on-thousands-no-doubts-about-safety-vk-paul-101610453194503.html

He listened to online lectures of hardline Islamic preachers, including 'Anwar Awlaki', the NIA official said.Subsequently, he came in contact with other radicalised youths and travelled to Syria in December 2013 and participated in various terrorist activities of the ISIS, the official said, adding that after his return to India, he continued to remain associated with the ideology of the ISIS.Utilising his knowledge of ophthalmic lasers and medical science, he made efforts to develop applications for medical and military requirements of the ISIS, the NIA spokesperson said.He was in regular communication with ISIS terrorists located abroad and in India, including Wani, through Threema, a secure messaging platform, the official said.The NIA official said Rahman achieved significant progress towards developing a medical application for treatment of ISIS terrorists and also a laser guided anti-tank missile application for controlling trajectory of missiles for enhancing their effectiveness.Further investigation in the case is underway, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-doctor-who-joined-isis-101610453982795.html

It further said that the committee shall hear the government as well as the representatives of farmers’ bodies and other stakeholders.The bench said this committee is “constituted for the purpose of listening to the grievances of the farmers relating to the farm laws and the views of the government and to make recommendations”.The court stayed the implementation of the laws passed by Parliament in September last year. "Stay on implementation of farm laws will encourage farmer bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood," the bench said.It also said in its order that Minimum Support Price (MSP) system, which was in existence before the enactment of new farm laws, shall be maintained until further orders."In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e. no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws," said the court.It also lauded the farmers for carrying on their agitation against the farm laws peacefully. The farmers had launched their agitation on November 26 near Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-asks-the-committee-it-formed-on-new-farm-laws-to-hold-first-sitting-within-10-days-in-delhi-101610454560508.html
12-01-2021||India||Delhi Riots: Court grants bail to two accused, casts doubt on credibility of police witnesses||A Delhi court Tuesday granted bail to two persons in a case related to the north-east Delhi riots while casting doubts on the credibility of the two police witnesses in the matter.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted the relief to Mohd Shoaib and Shahrukh on furnishing a bail bond of ₹20,000 with surety of like amount in the case of alleged vandalism and torching of a shop by a riotous mob in Gokalpuri area.The court noted that the prosecution was opposing both the bail pleas on the strength of their categorical identification by beat officers -- Constable Vipin and Head Constable Hari Babu -- in their statements recorded under section 161 (examination by police) of the Code of Criminal Procedure on April 7, 2020.Their identification was hardly of any consequence, it said, adding that even though they were posted as beat officers in the area at the relevant time of the incident, they waited till April to name the accused when they had categorically seen and identified them allegedly indulging in riots on February 25, 2020.“Being police officials, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same in the knowledge of higher police officers. This cast a serious doubt on the credibility of two police witnesses,” the cour said in its order.It further said that the CCTV footage relied upon by the police in the case pertained to February 24, 2020, whereas the incident took place the next day.“No CCTV/video footage of February 25, 2020, (on which date the incident in question took place) has been placed on record by the investigating agency."The applicants (Shoaib and Shahrukh) were not arrested from the spot, instead their arrest has been formally affected in the case on April 15, 2020 (i.e after lapse of about 55 days of the date of incident) in Mandoli Jail...,” it added.It also said both the accused were entitled for grant of bail on the ground of parity as the role assigned to them was on identical footing as co-accused Rashid who was already enlarged on bail.“Be that as it may, the investigation in the matter is complete; charge sheet has also been filed; trial in the matter is likely to take long time; applicants cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.It directed both the accused not to tamper with evidence and to install “Aarogya Setu” app on their mobile phones.During the hearing, advocate Salim Malik, appearing for the accused, claimed they have been falsely implicated in the matter and were mere “bonafide bystanders”.Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for the police, argued that both the accused were allegedly present at the spot with an unlawful assembly which was armed with stones, sticks, petrol bombs and acid bottles.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-two-accused-casts-doubt-on-credibility-of-police-witnesses-101610453367755.html

If they visit our village, they will face opposition from the villagers. We cannot permit them to play with our sentiments.”The banners came up a few days after Uttarakhand education minister Arvind Pandey had to face the anger of villagers while going to attend a programme on January 5.The villagers blocked the road and gheraoed Pandey forcing him to return without attending the programme.Harvinder Singh Herry, a farmer of one of the villages said, “Our villagers are against the farm laws and any leader who supports the law will not be tolerated in the village. We will continue the ban such leaders till the laws are withdrawn.”Similar banners have been put at the entrance of Bazpur’s Shivpuri village. The villagers are opposed to the farm laws and are participating in the protests with high spirit, said a resident.Bazpur has emerged as a major hub of farmer politics after the Centre enacted the three farm laws last September. This area is known for big farms and rich farmers. Several farmers are participating in the farmers’ protest at Gazipur on the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border.Farmers have also started running a bus between Bazpur and Gazipur twice a week to ferry those who want to participate in the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villagers-in-uttarakhand-ban-anti-farmer-pro-farm-laws-politicians-101610452004229.html
12-01-2021||India||US planned to back India in addressing issues like border dispute with China: Document||Two years before the military standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the US framed a strategy for the Indo-Pacific that envisaged offering diplomatic and military support to India to address challenges such as the border dispute with China, according to a newly declassified US national security document. In early 2018, US President Donald Trump endorsed the strategy developed by the National Security Council throughout 2017. A national security briefing prepared by the White House, which was classified “secret” and “not for foreign nationals”, was declassified last week and will be released on Wednesday. Australia’s public service broadcaster ABC News obtained the document on Tuesday. The US planned to “offer support to India through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels — to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China”, ABC News reported, citing the document. The US objective is to “accelerate India’s rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security” by building “a stronger foundation for defense cooperation and interoperability; expand our defense trade and ability to transfer defense technology”. Also read | India-China ties ‘profoundly disturbed’ by first act of bloodshed in 45 years: JaishankarThe document also referred to the need to “align our [US] Indo-Pacific strategy with those of Australia, India and Japan”, of deepening the US’s cooperation with Japan and Australia, and a quadrilateral security relationship with India. Over the past three years, the US has signed three key defence agreements, one at each of the 2+2 ministerial meetings, to facilitate the real-time sharing of sensitive military information and transfer of sophisticated technology. These agreements are the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), the Industrial Security Annex to the General Security of Military Information Agreement, and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). In a recent farewell address, outgoing US ambassador Kenneth Juster had specifically referred to these agreements and said concluding them had elevated the bilateral defence partnership. During the same event, Juster had said the US was “very supportive” amid the India-China border standoff but declined to go into details. “We both share a vision of the Indo-Pacific region...and that is an inclusive vision that provides opportunities for all countries to grow and prosper but also wants to avoid incursions of any type, intimidations and predatory financing, and when there’s a situation that is along those lines, we cooperate to try to resist it,” he had said. The four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – elevated the body to the ministerial level in 2019 and the second ministerial meeting was held in Tokyo last year. Ahead of that meeting, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had spoken about plans to formalise the Quad. The US national security document was declassified 30 years earlier than normal and experts said the move was apparently aimed at signalling continuity in American policy for the Indo-Pacific amid the change in government in Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-planned-to-back-india-in-addressing-issues-like-border-dispute-with-china-document-101610451227873.html
12-01-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh: SEC expresses reservations over govt timeline for panchayat elections||The state election commission (SEC) has expressed reservations over the Uttar Pradesh government’s proposed timeline for holding the three-tier panchayat elections, terming it “impractical” considering all the work the commission has to accomplish before issuing the poll notification. The SEC feels it may need more time to be poll-ready even if the government completes preparations on its part.Though the government has not issued any official timeline, it has indicated that it wants the panchayat elections to conclude by March-end before board examinations begin in schools.Also Read: For BJP, panchayat polls a ‘test’ match before 2022 UP assembly electionsMinister of panchayati raj Bhupendra Chaudhary has publicly said the government will issue its poll notification around mid-February for the commission to start voting by mid-March. According to sources, the SEC has, however, told the government that it might not be possible for it to hold rural polls as per the government’s plan due to paucity of time required to complete the revision of electoral roll. “The government is free to decide the timeline for itself and complete the work related to delimitation, reservation etc accordingly, but there are certain things, such as the voters’ list revision, that the commission has to do and for which some time is required,” an SEC official said, requesting anonymity. Currently, the commission is in the middle of giving final touches to the electoral roll revision for the entire state, barring the three districts of Moradabad, Shamli and Gonda, where delimitation of gram sabhas and wards is still in progress. The last panchayat elections in these three districts were held on the basis of the 2010 data and delimitation exercise there could not be carried out in 2015. The delimitation exercise of villages affected by creation of new blocks in some districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar, is also underway and the government has proposed completing the job and issuing a final notification by January 18. The SEC is going to make final the publication of voter lists for the rest of the state on January 22 after four months of protracted exercise. “Now, the problem is that we will have to carry out a fresh exercise to revise the voter lists in three districts of Moradabad, Shamli and Gonda, where major changes are expected in the configuration of gram sabhas as well as in villages that come under new blocks,” another commission official said requesting anonymity. The commission, he said, needed a minimum of 30-35 days to complete the fresh electoral roll revision. “This means we cannot make publish the electoral rolls for the remaining districts and villages before February-end, that too if the government sticks to its January 18 deadline for the completion of delimitation,” he pointed out. The state government and the commission, he said, cannot issue the poll notification before the voter list revision for the whole state is completed. Sources said that in the given situation, rural polls were unlikely to be held before April. When told about the commission’s doubts, additional chief secretary, panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh, said there was still time to make preparations to conclude the polls by March-end. “Let us see. We, on our part, will complete the delimitation work as per our timeline,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-sec-expresses-reservations-over-govt-timeline-for-panchayat-elections-101610451167588.html

Instead, devotees can only bring their palms together to offer a`namaste'.Carrying 'prasad' (offerings) inside the sanctum sanctorum is also not allowed in line with the standard operating protocol of the state government, authorities said.Temples and other places of worship reopened in the state in June, 75 days after the lockdown came into effect."Sashtang pranam is not allowed as per the government guidelines. No devotee is allowed to touch anything as per the SOP," said Vijaysinh Chavda, manager of the famous Somnath temple."People are allowed inside the sanctum sanctorum only for `darshan' to ensure minimum contact in view of the pandemic," he said.Sashtang pranam or namaskar involves prostrating oneself in such a way that eight parts of the body touch the floor."No devotees are allowed entry in the temple for aarti which is performed thrice a day, and no more than five devotees are allowed to sit for prayers at once. No more than three persons are allowed during yagna," Chavda further said.Ambaji Mata Temple in Banaskantha district, another major shrine in Gujarat, too has banned sashtang pranam as per government guidelines, said its spokesperson Ashish Raval.Social distancing and wearing a mask are compulsory and devotees are allowed inside only after thermal screening, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-no-sashtang-pranam-only-namaste-in-gujarat-temples-101610450434985.html
12-01-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Bihar Cong to march to Raj Bhavan on Jan 15||Newly appointed All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, on Tuesday thanked the Supreme Court (SC) for acknowledging the apprehensions of agitating farmers and said the party would take out a march to Raj Bhavan in Patna on January 15 in support of the cause.Talking to media persons after a meeting of the party’s farmers’ wing, Das, also a former Union minister, questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the issue. Alleging that the Centre did not care about the electorate, he said,“Apart from the farmers, who will become instant victims of the Acts, common people would be compelled to buy essential commodities at three to four times of their actual cost as the Centre has repealed the stock limit under the essential services commodities act.”The AICC leader lambasted the Central government for undermining constitutional institutions and said it did not have any regard for the RTI Act. “How can a government, elected by the people, act against those who elect them? Aren’t farmers patriots? Farm sector’s contributions in the GDP had gone down to 1-2% against 4-5% recorded during the UPA-2 regime ,” said Das.About his strategy to strengthen the organisation in Bihar, Das said that he would start divisional-level meeting of the party workers from January 31. “The process of revamping the state unit would start in the next couple of months after the meeting of stakeholders. Instances of indiscipline will not be tolerated,” said Das, without getting into details, when asked about a reported scuffle during the farmers’ unit meeting earlier in the day at BPCC office.Party insiders said that Das asked BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha to expel Raj Kumar Sharma, the self proclaimed chief of the famers’ wing, from the party if he did not leave the venue as his supporters were creating a ruckus. Earlier, Das met Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Monday and extended support to the Opposition’s human chain formation on January 30 to protest against growing unemployment and migration issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-bihar-cong-to-march-to-raj-bhavan-on-jan-15-101610450567597.html
12-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand HC stays Governor’s nod to de-notify Shivalik Elephant Reserve||The Uttarakhand high court on Monday stayed a notification regarding the governor’s assent given on January 8, 2021 for de-notification of the Shivalik Elephant Reserve.On January 8, the day when the HC stayed the approval given by the State Wildlife Advisory Board on November 24, 2020 for de-notification of the Shivalik Elephant Reserve, the Uttarakhand government also issued a notification to denotify with the Governor’s nod.The Shivalik Elephant Reserve is spread over 5405 sq km in eights districts of the state.Abhijay Negi, counsel for the petitioner in the case said the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Manoj Tiwari stayed on January 8, 2021 a notification during an urgent hearing while responding to the fresh application moved in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dehradun-based activist Reenu Paul.Negi said the government’s move was surprising. “On the very same day, the Government of Uttarakhand released a notification relying on the approval of the State Wildlife Board for denotification of the Shivalik Elephant Reserve, which was stayed by the court,” he said.“During the urgent hearing, the Advocate General, who represented state government said since the Shivalik Elephant Reserve was notified as an elephant reserve as a policy decision by a Government Order in 2002, it was always open to the government to review or call back its own policy decision. The petitioner highlighted the conduct of the government in this matter; stressing that denotification also merits to be stayed as HC had stayed the approval on the same day. The petitioner also highlighted that the said decision of the government was being taken without obtaining prior approval of the Central government and was in violation of the Forest Conservation Act,” he said.On November 24, 2020, the state wildlife board during its 16th meeting had approved the de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve, with government officials saying there is no law to define an elephant reserve.In September last year, the state government had written to the Union environment ministry for obtaining prior approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 87.0815 hectares of forest land for “Expansion of the Jolly Grant Airport”. This land falls within the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. Officials estimate that about 10,000 trees will be cut for the expansion.Uttarakhand has over 2000 elephants at present according to the elephant census released in June last year. There are 2026 elephants in the state currently, while in 2012, there were 1559 and in 2017 there were 1839 elephants in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-stays-governor-s-nod-to-de-notify-shivalik-elephant-reserve-101610450033488.html

Addressing the public via a recorded video message, Rane that he initially supported the project with a view to bring development to the villages. “I had felt that if we bring the IIT, development will come to the villages. But today, I’m seeing that many people are agitated and upset. I have written a letter to the chief minister that we do not want the IIT here now,” Rane said. “I appeal to the chief minister to withdraw the cases filed against the protesters. Today, the situation is such that I have to take a decision keeping the interest of the people in mind and what the people want. I will always stand by the people. The IIT can be taken somewhere else in Goa, we do not want it here, my concern is only for development, jobs and employment for the youth,” he said. Rane’s change of heart comes a day after he indicated he was willing to back down after initially insisting that the project would go ahead despite the protests and opposition to it. “Issues raised by our people is of utmost concern to me, and I shall be working towards resolving the same. I shall be assessing the ground situation with our people regarding IIT at Shel-Melauli and will discuss the matter with the CM in this regard,” Rane had said on Monday evening. On Monday, the chief minister said he was willing to discuss the issue with the protesting villagers even as he added that the demand for shifting the IIT campus to another location would not be considered. Protesting villagers, who have set up a blockade at the entrance to the proposed site, have, for several months now, been refusing to allow government surveyors to demarcate the land to be handed over to the IIT. They have also turned down the state government’s offer to exclude lands surrounding the village temple from the campus as well as concessions for those who claimed to use the land for agricultural purposes. In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 1 million sq mts of land in Melaulim village in North Goa, for setting up of IIT-Goa. Since 2014, the institute has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College.Earlier also, two sites identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub districts, for setting up of a permanent campus were scrapped in the face of protests from local residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitgoa-campus-minister-writes-to-cm-not-to-go-ahead-with-project-101610446967582.html

The report is to be submitted in five weeks.Citing media reports, the commission observed that it appears to be a glaring instance of violation of human rights of an individual in police custody for which accountability rests on the police force of the state.Thirty-year-old Dharmendra Manjhi, who was arrested on charges of liquor smuggling on Friday, had died while being taken to police station from the court on Saturday. Police had cited Manjhi’s ill health for his death.Following the incident, an irate mob on Sunday gathered outside the police station, blocked Patna-Gaya main road and burned tyres to register their protest. They also pelted stones targeting the police station, forcing cops to remain inside till reinforcement reached there from different police stations.Police claimed that late on Saturday Manjhi’s health deteriorated and he was taken to the hospital. But the doctors declared him dead on arrival.The victim’s family members have alleged that the man died due to torture by police. They also accused the police of demanding money from them for the man’s release.The commission has fixed the next date for hearing on February 18.Earlier on December 4, the BHRC has ordered state government to pay ₹7 lakh as compensation to the wife of software engineer Ashutosh Kumar Pathak alias Appu, who was killed due to torture during police custody in Naugachhia police district on October 24, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-rights-body-seeks-report-over-custodial-death-of-dalit-man-101610444914597.html

12-01-2021||India||Sand price in Bihar shoots up by 30-40%, real estate sector hit||Several districts in Bihar are hard hit with an upward revision in sand prices by 30-40 per cent, sparking fear of slowdown in the real estate sector.Traders say the escalation in cost has encouraged black marketing and illegal mining of the basic construction commodity.“The sand price in December was ₹5,400 for a trailer of tractor, now, it has risen to ₹7,000 in Patna. There are reports that the price of sand in other districts has risen by 30-40%,” said Mahesh Lal, a sand trader of Danapur.“The sand traders are hard pressed as they have to pay royalty to mines department besides charges of loading, ‘raiyati’ (cost of sand), patrolling party and money for crossing road that comes on the land owners,” said Niraj Kumar, who is into sand business and also a transporter. He added, “The mines department thinks that the traders have to just pay royalty, but the business involves other charges too, leaving a petty margin for us.”Another dealer of sand at Gaya, Arun Yadav, said the price of sand has risen ₹800 per trailer of tractor since December.The spike in price of sand is being witnessed after the state cabinet took a decision to extend the validity of lease of existing sand mining ghats with 50% increase in lease fee.A mines and geology official said the need of extending the lease of old lease holders of sand ghat was necessitated after some people filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the new sand mining policy of the Bihar government. Now, the mines and geology department has moved the Supreme Court to seek relief.The sharp rise in sand price has spurred smuggling of both yellow and Ganga sand, despite the mines and geology department claiming that raids were being conducted.Mines commissioner-cum-principal secretary, mines and geology department, Harjot Kaur Bamhrah said, “To check illegal mining of sands, frequent raids are being conducted in districts. The DMs and SPs have a district mining task force, which conducts regular meetings and raids are conducted. FIRs have lodged and offenders booked.”Another official of the mining department said the department had earned about ₹35 crore this fiscal till December by penalising the sand smugglers.Boats plying on the Ganga river could be spotted lifting sand from the river bed, making it shallower. The NGT has banned lifting of sand from the river bed.Seeing the massive smuggling of sand, Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh on Sunday asked the officials to constitute a special team to nab the smugglers.Former national president of Builders Association of India, Sachin Chandra, agreed that the rise in the price of sand was going to badly hit the real estate sector.“The real estate sector has already been hit by a slowdown caused by Covid-19 and the escalation in the price of sand is a bolt from the blue,” he said.“With a 30-40% rise in sand price, the project cost is going to rise by ₹200-300 per square feet,” he said, claiming, many builders might wait for the price of sand to ease to start their work. He said the margin of income of builders who had already taken money from the buyers was going to face a deep cut due to the rise in price of sand and steel.Bamhrah said, “The high court has given many rulings that once the royalty is charged by the mines and geology department, the price of sand will be decided by the market forces. However, still the prices are going beyond a particular gradient and we will look into it and start conducting raids so that the prices can be checked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sand-price-in-bihar-shoots-up-by-30-40-real-estate-sector-hit-101610444159400.html

Since 1985, his birth anniversary is observed every year as the National Youth Day. Several youngsters have been inspired by his philosophy and the speech he gave in the Parliament of Religions in America in September of 1893. The speech gained the spotlight as Hinduism and its philosophy was introduced to the western world for the first time in Chicago.He became India's spiritual ambassador in America and tried to teach Vedanta philosophies in the west through rational and humanistic approach. Vivekananda's teaching included seeing god in all and promoted peace and unity amongst all. William James, a philosopher at Harvard University, called Swami Vivekananda as the "paragon of Vedantists.""I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration, but we accept all religions as true," Swami Vivekananda had said in his speech at the Parliament of Religions.Also Read | Swami Vivekananda's 158th birth anniversary celebrated across Bengal"As the different streams having their sources in different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee," he had said."Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now," he had added.Many political leaders paid their tributes to the great personality. Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid homage to Swami Vivekananda while addressing the valedictory programme of the National Youth Parliament Festival. "Inspired by the great ideals of Swami Vivekananda and his vision for youth empowerment, the National Youth Parliament Festival gives a platform to India’s youth to showcase their skills. It also furthers the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ among youngsters," the prime minister had said.Born on January 12, 1863, he died in 1902 on July 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remembering-swami-vivekananda-and-his-teachings-on-his-birth-anniversary-101610444009992.html

Using that, we are working to start snow leopard tours in the high-altitude areas of Uttarkashi district, where sightings of snow leopards have increased in the past few months.”The senior forest official said that the tours will be started in the month of February and bookings will be made on a first-come, first-served basis."A maximum of six participants will be allowed for every tour, who will travel with medical and forest staff. These tours will increase chances of snow leopard sightings as due to peak winters all animals come down to lower reaches," added Bhartari.Aparna Pandey, state project officer for Secure Himalayas, said, "The main objective of this initiative is to connect conservation with livelihood opportunities. With these tours, the locals will get jobs as tour operators, adventure guides, cooks. They will also naturally want to work towards conservation of the animal. This model has worked successfully in Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh."Meanwhile, the union environment ministry on Monday tweeted, "Sustainable tourism for wildlife conservation.. through Secure Himalayas Project; Global Environment Facility, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Uttarakhand Forest Department and United Nations Development Programme are partnering with Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board to organise first ever winter snow leopard tours in Uttarakhand and promote nature-based livelihood in the Himalayas."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-organises-winter-snow-leopard-tours-promotes-conservation-101610443870629.html

For him, it did not make much sense as the opportunities in the field were restricted to weddings and appearances on the state-owned TV and Radio stations. But Adil Manzoor Shah did not give up and convinced his father to teach him music. His persistence has paid off and he is now among more recognisable musicians in Kashmir thanks largely to video-sharing site YouTube and social media.Adil Manzoor Shah is not alone. Many like him have excelled thanks to new avenues to showcase their talent and by giving a modern touch to the folk music like Chakker for which instruments like harmonium, rabab, sarangi, and nout (earthern pot) have traditionally been used.“We are bringing newness to Chakker by using guitar, keyboard, and dholak. ...YouTube is giving it more prominence,” he said. “Folk [music] should not die. With some subtle changes, the younger generation is happily accepting it.”Adil Manzoor Shah, who began singing when he was 14, has his YouTube channel, which is helping new and talented singers to reach a wider audience and the Kashmiri diaspora. His channel has over 100,000 subscribers. A duet he sang has over 3.1 million views so far.Another singer Tariq Ahmad Bhat, who used to be a dancer and then learnt harmonium, said people looking for singers to perform at weddings would often ask about his previous work. “[Then] I started recording my work. YouTube has [since] given me a lot of fame,” he said.Shazia Bashir, 32, who has been in the music industry since winning a talent show on Doordarshan over a decade back, said not everybody would get the platform to showcase her talent earlier. “Before social media, talented people would find it difficult to get a break. ‘How to start’ used to be a big question back then. Now social media provides you the ultimate platform. Nowadays, newcomers and budding talent are in good shape due to social media.”Prominent singer and composer Waheed Jeelani advised the younger singers to first learn the basics instead of getting carried away by instant fame. “The youths understand that our identity is Kashmiri music. Though they also experiment with western instruments and do innovations like introducing the guitar to revive old songs sung by Kashmiri stalwarts. They present them in a fresh way and get a lot of fame. What is important is that, in this way, many youngsters are coming towards Kashmiri music particularly the folk.”Jeelani said social media gives information but it cannot be one’s teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/young-kashmiri-singers-gain-prominence-as-social-media-youtube-help-them-showcase-talent-reach-wider-audiences-101610443186895.html

But the court refused to stop the probe.“It seems an intellectual fraud played in furtherance of the MoU so as to avoid audit by the CAG and to get kickbacks and gratifications. MoU was not entered into in accordance with Article 229 of the Constitution which pertains to the government contract,” the court ruled saying it was clinched to avoid the CAG audit.There are allegations that senior IAS officer M Sivasankar, now in jail in connection with money laundering charges related to the gold smuggling case, and his accomplices allegedly played a key role in clinching the project.The gold smuggling case came to light in July last year after the Customs seized 30 kg of gold from a consignment that came to the UAE Consulate camouflaged as a diplomatic parcel. Now a multi-agency investigation is on and 35 people have been arrested including the CM’s private secretary M Sivasankar. Opposition Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have welcomed the verdict. “It is a slap on the face of the government,” said Anil Akkara, Congress legislator who had approached the CBI.The project relates to building 140 housing units in Vadkancherry in Thrissur district. As per the application filed by the CEO of the project in the High Court, the Red Crescent authority of the UAE consulate offered to sponsor the project and an MoU was entered into in 2019.According to the MoU, the sponsor will execute the project through independent contractors. The Congress lawmaker later filed a complaint alleging 10 lakh UAE Dirham was transferred to the private contractor, Unitach, in violation of FCRA norms. It was found during investigation that out of the ₹20 crore project, ₹four crore was allegedly siphoned off to people who worked behind the project and the quality of construction was inferior. It was also found that the Centre’s permission was not obtained before signing the MoU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-rejects-govt-plea-questioning-cbi-probe-into-life-mission-project-101610439251104.html

12-01-2021||India||India-China ties ‘profoundly disturbed’ by first act of bloodshed in 45 years: Jaishankar||The relationship between India and China has been “profoundly disturbed” by the first incident of bloodshed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 45 years, which had a “huge impact” on public opinion, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday. Jaishankar made the remarks at the virtual Reuters Next conference, even as Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane told a news briefing that troops are prepared to hold ground along the LAC for as long as needed to meet national objectives. The standoff in Ladakh sector, Naravane said, will be resolved on the basis of mutual and equal security. “After 45 years, you’ve actually had bloodshed on the border,” Jaishankar said, referring to the clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in June last year that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and resulted in unspecified Chinese casualties. Also read | China tried to change status quo by force in Ladakh, says MoD review“And that’s had a huge impact on public opinion and politically...really the impact on trust and confidence in India where China and their relationship is concerned. That has been profoundly disturbed,” he added. Jaishankar reiterated his contention that China is yet to offer an explanation for deploying a large number of troops along the LAC. “Now last year, for reasons which are not clear to us, the Chinese really brought an enormous military force to one part of the border. And then at the LAC, obviously we moved up when we saw them coming and that has sort of created friction points along the LAC,” he said. Tens of thousands of troops from both sides have dug in for the harsh winter along the LAC, backed by artillery and armoured formations. Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks between the two countries have not led to headway in disengagement and de-escalation at friction points in Ladakh. The deaths in Galwan Valley were the first fatalities on the LAC since four Indian soldiers were killed at Tulung La in Arunachal Pradesh in 1975. Jaishankar has said several times that Chinese aggressive actions along the LAC have violated several agreements for maintaining peace and tranquillity on the disputed border. On the other hand, Jaishankar said India’s ties with the US were on the upswing and he was confident about the direction of the relationship under the incoming Biden administration. “When I look at many of the challenges we face, the US is going to be much more open looking for partners and I’m confident about where we are going with the relationship,” he said. “Structurally, the relationship with the US is very, very sound, it has very unique elements, there is political convergence, growing security and defence convergence,” he added. Shared concerns about China have led to greater cooperation between India and the other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – Australia, Japan and the US – in recent months. On the issue of trade, Jaishankar acknowledged that India and the US had got bogged down in details and lost the “wood for the trees”. Negotiators had worked towards a mini trade deal for months without making headway, and he said India will respond positively to any offer from the Biden administration to restart some kind of free trade talks. Jaishankar also told the Reuters Next conference that the government will have greater clarity within the next few weeks on exporting Covid-19 vaccines after meeting domestic needs. India, he said, understands the anxieties of foreign governments with regard to getting the vaccines delivered to their populations. “We will get clarity pretty soon on what our own consumption is going to be, (what) deployments are going to be. And we will keep our global role very much...,” he said. “The policy of course is we will start the rollout in India. We have our own challenges,” he said. “A number of countries are in touch with us...and what we are telling them is, look, this is the first month...The production is now coming into stream. There is a certain amount of stock-taking going on.” India is one of the world’s largest producers of vaccines and pharmaceutical products and supplied medicines and equipment to some 150 countries amid the pandemic. It is expected to be a key manufacturing centre for Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-ties-profoundly-disturbed-by-first-act-of-bloodshed-in-45-years-jaishankar-101610440666374.html

We don't want to hear arguments that farmers will not go to the committee. We are looking to solve the problem. If you (farmers) want to agitate indefinitely, you can do so," CJI Bobde said.Farmers' leaders welcomed the Supreme Court's order but said they would not call off their protest until the legislations are repealed. The Sankyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 protesting farmers' unions, has called a meeting later in the day to decide the next course of action.The bench was hearing a batch of petitions, including those filed by DMK lawmaker Tiruchi Siva, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj K Jha, regarding the constitutional validity of the farm laws, passed by the central government in September last year, and the plea to disperse protesting farmers from the borders of the national capital.The three-judge bench had earlier said that it is willing to suspend the laws but not indefinitely without any activity going on both sides.The top court had said on Monday it is “extremely disappointed" with the way negotiations between the Centre and the farmers' representative were going while hearing a bunch of petitions on the farm laws.Also read | Put farm laws on hold, or we will, SC tells govtIt also indicated that the three contentious laws will have to be put on hold for creating an atmosphere conducive for talks.The bench had also asked the Centre if it was willing to pause the implementation of the laws, saying it will do it otherwise.

According to official sources, the flight carrying the vaccines landed at the Kempegowda international airport here. Earlier in the day, Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar said 7.95 lakh Covishield vaccines were arriving. "... 7,95,000 vials of Covishield vaccine are arriving in the first consignment at around 11:45 this morning.. the arrival of the remaining of the total 13,9000 vails that the state will get, will be known in the later stages," he said.

Noting that the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has given approval to Covishield and the Centre has purchased 1.1 crore doses, Sudhakar claimed that there was no other country in the world that has fixed the price of the vaccine at such low rates. "It has been procured at ₹210 per dose including GST from the Serum institute, Pune. The total cost is ₹231 crore," he said. The central government will be vaccinating about 3 crore people in the country in the first phase for free of cost.

"28 days after taking the first dose, a second dose should be taken. The vaccine will help in developing immunogenicity. The vaccine is completely safe and there is no need for anyone to worry or fear," he said The vaccination will be held as per protocols and guidelines issued.

However, officials said that the tiger is present in the reserve. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, said, “It is a young male tiger which has a lot of power and aggression. It is likely that it removed the radio-collar on its own. But the tiger is present in the reserve as it was camera trapped on January 10.” The chief wildlife warden added that the forest department’s main objective is to safely translocate the tigers to the western part of Rajaji with the aim of repopulating the landscape. “We have been monitoring tigers in Rajaji Tiger Reserve even without radio collars. Our aim is to translocate the tigers and their monitoring will be done through camera traps and patrolling as done for other animals,” added Suhag. On Saturday, the tiger was released in the western part of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, in Motichur area, by state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat. Before this, on December 24, a four-year-old tigress was translocated and released in a temporary enclosure in Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The tigress was translocated as part of a project to repopulate the western part of Rajaji, already home to two tigresses, which has not reported breeding in almost a decade. The project for translocation of tigers to the western part of Rajaji was approved by the Central government in 2016. A total of five tigers will be translocated to Rajaji. Rajaji Tiger Reserve currently has around 37 tigers with only three tigresses in its western part, which is spread over 570 sq km. It has a carrying capacity of 83 tigers, revealed a recent survey conducted by the state forest department. The eastern and the western part of the reserve are divided by a busy traffic corridor making it difficult for the tigers to migrate between the two parts.

12-01-2021||India||No prohibition on inter-state transport of gutkha, paan masala through Maharashtra: HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court has held that a ban on gutkha and paan masala in Maharashtra cannot be extended to prohibit inter-state transport of the banned products through the state. The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote, however, clarified on Monday that the food and drugs administration (FDA) can examine and seize the consignments being transported across Maharashtra, in order to ensure that they are not offloaded in the state under the guise of inter-state transport.The court was hearing a petition filed by owner of a truck seized by FDA officials at Jaulka in Washim district on October 3, 2020, and the transporter who had engaged him to ferry the consignment.FDA officials seized the consignment as it contained paan masala, zarda and scented tobacco products banned in the state under an order issued by the food safety commissioner, Maharashtra, on July 15, 2020. The truck owner and the transporter said they were merely transporting the consignment from Valsad in Gujarat to two locations in Odisha where there is no ban on betelnut-based products.They had challenged the July 15, 2020 order, contending that it was unconstitutional and ultra vires the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA), 2006, for the enactment does not confer any power on the food safety commissioner to prohibit inter-state transportation of any goods, including gutkha and paan masala.One of their argument was that inter-state trade and commerce is a subject within the domain of Union of India, and as such, cannot be prohibited by the state.The HC accepted the contention and the bench said though FSSA is a central enactment, and though the food safety commissioner acts under it as a delegate of the Centre, his jurisdiction is limited to the state and any prohibition to manufacture, storage, distribution or sale, imposed by the commissioner has to operate within the state or such lesser area as may be notified by him.The bench clarified that this however will not mean that the FDA will be restrained from enforcing the prevailing ban on gutkha and paan masala in the state.In this regard, HC also took note of the grim reality that though there is a ban on manufacturing, distribution, storage and sale of gutkha and paan masala in Maharashtra, these products are available in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-prohibition-on-inter-state-transport-of-gutkha-paan-masala-through-maharashtra-hc-101610436646635.html

12-01-2021||India||Signal becomes most downloaded app as privacy concerns dog WhatsApp||Messaging application Signal became the most downloaded app on Apple App Store on Monday days after Facebook-owned WhatsApp updated its privacy terms.WhatsApp seeks the right to share user data like location and phone number with Facebook and Instagram as part of the new privacy terms. The terms have triggered a backlash and migration of users to platforms such as Telegram and Signal amid concerns about Facebook’s poor record of handling user data.Signal was one of the most downloaded apps on Google Play Store globally on Monday and was ranked third with at least 10 million installations. It was the highest-ranked on App Store even as the number of downloads was unavailable. WhatsApp was in the third position on Apple App Store and did not feature among the top 10 apps on Google Play Store.Also Read: Paytm CEO ‘Signals’ users should leave WhatsApp over data privacy concernsInternet Freedom Foundation Trustee Apar Gupta called Signal a better alternative as it does not gather any data linked to users. “WhatsApp gathers metadata such as locations we share, our display pictures, who we message and when we message,” said Gupta. “We do not know how much data is stored and collected by WhatsApp, who is it being sold to and how are we being targeted with different kinds of ads. This is the core distinction between Signal and WhatsApp.”Gupta said to proceed with the continued use of WhatsApp, users cannot refuse their latest changes. “Once the data bill is passed [in India], a data protection authority will be able to monitor WhatsApp’s privacy policy.”Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said Facebook promised to keep WhatsApp separate when it acquired the app. “Then, they [Facebook] said they would start transferring data, such as the number of users, contacts, who we regularly message. In the European Union, the European Commission fined Facebook for lying and suppressing a material fact. Facebook paid the fine and acknowledged that it had indeed suppressed information about data sharing.”Chima said metadata, one’s activity on WhatsApp with respect to messaging and contacting, may result in profiling for third-party services, allowing them to target selected people. “They are doing all of this without the informed consent of the users.”Unlike WhatsApp, Signal is decentralised, does not store metadata, or have advertising interests. Signal’s encryption protocol and software design are also available openly for researchers, making it trustworthy, experts say.In a tweet, Signal cited the advantages it has over WhatsApp. “Facebook is probably more comfortable selling ads than buying them, but they’ll do what they have to do in order to be the top result when some people search for ‘Signal’ in the App Store. P.S. There will never be ads in Signal, because your data belongs in your hands, not ours”.WhatsApp has given users until February 8 to accept the policy. It is also working to launch its own payments service. In a tweet, WhatsApp said, “We want to address some rumours and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption.”Union Information technology ministry officials said that they were monitoring the developments. The government is formulating a personal data protection bill, which is currently under review of a parliamentary panel. The bill proposes to disallow companies from storing users’ data abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/signal-becomes-most-downloaded-app-as-privacy-concerns-dog-whatsapp-101610434185730.html

In a series of tweets, Mufti on Monday said the PAGD has rattled Delhi and there was speculation regarding the future of PAGD, which swept the District Development Councils polls in the Kashmir Valley last month. The polls were the first major electoral exercise in the region after it was stripped of its special semi-autonomous status under Constitution’s Article 370, which was nullified in 2019.“Amidst all the unnecessary speculation about PAGD, Id like make a few things absolutely clear. The purpose of this grand alliance [PAGD] is not for petty electoral gains. It exists for a much larger cause & purpose i.e to restore J&Ks special status,” tweeted Mufti, who heads the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).“A lot of baseless theories are being deliberately floated to discredit PAGD amongst masses since they overwhelmingly voted for us in the DDC elections. Regardless of who fought how many seats, our purpose to deny BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] & its proxies democratic space has been achieved.”Mufti said that all parties of PAGD stand united. “Delhi is deeply rattled by PAGD so I expect this false campaign to intensify in the coming days. Many PDP leaders are already arrested & I expect the situation to worsen. But this will not break our resolve to stand united & fight for whats rightfully ours.”Mufti’s tweets came after two leaders of PAGD constituent People’s Conference and PDP leader Fiyaz Ahmad Mir questioned National Conference, which leads the grouping, for allegedly fielding proxy candidates in DDC polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pagd-not-for-petty-electoral-gains-but-for-restoration-of-j-k-s-special-status-reiterates-mufti-101610434126103.html

The grant-in-aid restricted use to friendly neighbours will be rolled out soon after the Indian roll-out on January 16, people familiar with the matter said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that the commercial supplies of Serum’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin to foreign countries should be done under the aegis of the external affairs ministry in consultation with the pharmaceutical ministry, a senior government official said. PM Modi is in touch with the health ministry over the vaccine management and is ensuring that all government departments are in sync with each other as well as the private sector.“As of now, globally all vaccines are being sold only to national governments under emergency use authorisation, whether it is Pfizer or Moderna. The market authorisation is expected in the second quarter of the year, by which time the Phase 3 trial of all the named vaccine contenders are completed,” said a senior official.While the Modi government will buy 1.1 crore vials of vaccine by January 14, the shipping of “symbolic” quantities of the restricted use vaccine will be done immediately after the Indian roll-out.Bangladesh has tied up with Serum India for commercial supply of 30 million vials. Nepal is looking to procure 12 million vials from India apart from other neighbours such as Bhutan, Myanmar and Sri Lanka who have requested New Delhi for the Indian vaccines.Officials said the decision on the amount of vaccine to be made available under the emergency use authorisation will be taken by the external affairs ministry, which had last year also coordinated supplies of Hydroxychloroquine in the early phase of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/untitleindia-to-help-neighbours-with-emergency-covid-vaccine-commercial-supplie-101610432616480.html

At the meeting between the Prime Minister and the chief ministers on Monday, Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy demanded that MPs and MLAs must be given Covid-19 vaccine on a priority basis as they, too, are in the frontline in tackling the virus and they have to interact with people in their constituencies. Refusing to entertain such an exemption for the elected representatives, he said in his concluding speech at the end of the meeting, “All these demands will send a very bad message. It will look like the government is not worried about the common people but is busy trying to cater to lawmakers.” The demand for vaccination of lawmakers also came as Parliament as well as state assemblies are set to hold their budget sessions in the next few weeks. The issue about cost-burden of the vaccines was raised by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. The PM replied that the cost of vaccination of 30 million healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the Central government. The PM and the CMs are expected to meet again towards the end of this month or early February to discuss the modalities and cost sharing issues for the vaccines required for the remaining 270 million people in the priority list. “There will be another meeting to discuss about the expenses required to inoculate senior citizens and those with comorbidities,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-rejects-proposal-to-vaccinate-mps-mlas-on-priority-basis-101610429565859.html

The procurement will follow the purchase of wheat from April, they added.Food and civil supplies commissioner Manish Chauhan said the paddy will be purchased till the procurement season ends and they may request the Food Corporation of India to move the surplus from Uttar Pradesh. “...we may also think of distributing rice under the public distribution system for two months at one go to create additional space,” he said.Uttar Pradesh distributes 8lakh metric tons (LMT) of subsidised rice monthly.Officials said over 57 LMT of paddy worth Rs10,274 crore has been purchased from 1.1 million farmers so far. The target for purchase was 55 LMT. They added the final procurement is likely to around 70 LMT. Around 45 LMT of paddy was purchased during the corresponding period last year.Chauhan said overall 56.6 LMT paddy was purchased last year. “...[It] was the highest-ever and this year the paddy purchase has already broken last year’s record.”Uttar Pradesh’s total storage capacity is around 50 LMT.An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they have to store paddy scientifically and unlike wheat, rice cannot be stored in the open. “We are fast running out of safe storage capacity and the government will have to find a short-term solution immediately.”Chauhan said the Minimum Support Price (MSP) that the government is offering is much higher than what the farmers are being offered in the open market. “...because of this, most farmers are trying to sell their paddy to the government at MSP,” Chauhan said.Officials said the government has also undertaken aggressive procurement in view of the protests against the three farm laws enacted in September to liberalise the farm economy. The protesting farmers say the laws will lead benefit big corporations and erode the MSP system.Officials said the difference between MSP and the market price for paddy is around ₹400-500 per quintal in Uttar Pradesh. “Earlier, the difference used to be nominal due to which many farmers preferred to sell their produce to private players even if the MSP was a little higher to avoid inconvenience involved in taking the produce to government purchase centres,” said a second official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-paddy-purchase-outstrips-its-storage-capacity-as-procurement-continues-101610428665015.html

Ramkumar Tiwari is one of the four sons of Shyamcharan Tiwari who started the famous Muchhad Paanwala shop at Kemps Corner in south Mumbai in the late 1970s.NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed the arrest. “Drugs were found in a warehouse owned by Ramkumar Tiwari. He is one of the owners of Muchhad Paanwala,” said Wankhede. Tiwari will be produced in court on Tuesday, added Wankhede. NCB, however, did not give details of the drugs found in the warehouse.Also Read: Drugs found from warehouse of Mumbai’s famous paan vendorWankhede said that others working at the paan shop were being interrogated and that the drugs seized have been send for testing. Jaishankar Tiwari, Ramkumar Tiwari’s brother, was summoned on Monday after the name of Mucchad Panwala cropped up in NCB’s investigation, following the arrest of a British national Karan Sejnani and sisters Rahila and Shaista Furntiurewala from Bandra on January 9. About 200 kilograms of marijuana was seized from the three.NCB had arrested Sejnani following a specific input, after the agency seized around 340 grams of marijuana stored in three parcels from the office of a courier service company in Bandra. They raided Sejnani’s flat at Khar and found 194.6kg of imported strains of marijuana. After his interrogation, officers raided the home of Rahila and Shaista Furniturewala in Bandra and found a small quantity of drugs.

12-01-2021||India||Bird flu spreads to forests, triggers concerns about safety of endangered species||Bird flu, or avian influenza, has spread to the forest and protected areas of Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, and Kerala and infected mostly migratory duck species over the past week, the Union environment ministry has said. In other states, mostly poultry has been impacted.“The first cases of avian influenza were reported from the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh. But following that reports have come from forest areas of Kerala and Gujarat where the affected birds are mostly migratory duck species in forest wetlands,” said the ministry’s additional director general, Soumitra Dasgupta.The ministry is trying to get other agencies like the department of fisheries involved in controlling the spread. “We have to see which are the other bird species that have been infected,” said Dasgupta.Dasgupta added an advisory was issued to all chief wildlife wardens on January 3 asking them to keep a strict vigil on the wintering habitats of migratory birds including wetlands for any mortality or outbreak signs.Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) director Bivash Pandav said most migratory waterfowl species are known to be carriers of the H5N1 virus (bird flu). “Most recently there have been reports of red junglefowl [contracting the disease]... They are a relatively rugged species. So, it is very surprising that they contracted the virus. The avian influenza virus normally does not jump over to humans but can be easily transmitted from migratory species to domestic birds and has great potential to completely damage our poultry... and even pigs.”Also read | Poultry sector predicts losses of over ₹1k-crPandav said the possibility of endangered bird species contracting the virus cannot be ruled out. “We have to be extremely watchful and monitor wetlands and other wintering grounds. You cannot catch migratory birds and vaccinate them. All you can do is protect other species like vultures. Precautions must be taken in zoos. This epidemic cannot be taken lightly as the virus mutates and evolves very quickly.” Pandav added birders and nature lovers can help in reporting cases of dead or sick birds but they should avoid going close to them.The ministry’s advisory said the affected birds have symptoms such as tremors, diarrhoea, head tilt, and paralysis. The disease spreads quickly causing paralysis and staggering. The advisory asked state chief wildlife wardens to prepare action plans for monitoring migratory birds and for dealing with any emergency.“Dead birds should be handled with utmost caution and scientific supervision and surveillance should not be restricted to the protected areas alone, but to all such wetlands and habitats that provide grounds to the migrating birds and to areas where there is a possibility of interaction of migratory birds and poultry such as backyard poultry.”The forest department staff has been asked to use protective gear like rubber gloves, eye gear, or face shield, and to disinfect hands and surfaces and take antiviral drugs. The virus is much more difficult to inactivate if it is encrusted in organic material such as faeces or soil.Experts say bird flu has various strains with H5N1 being the worst as it can jump from birds to mammals. H5N1 also spreads through fomites or infected surfaces. So, surfaces interacting with infected bird species can also spread the virus.Ornithologist Asad Rahmani said most domestic birds are kept away from wild birds but as domesticated ducks feed in the same paddy fields where wild ducks also feed, there are chances that disease may transmit either way. “Similarly, poultry farms are spread all over India, sometimes near to areas where wild birds are found. Hence, poultry farm birds are also susceptible to get the avian flu from wild birds [and vice versa].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-spreads-to-forest-areas-triggers-worries-about-safety-of-endangered-species-101610425184758.html

12-01-2021||India||Congress panel waits for Rahul Gandhi’s return to finalise internal poll schedule||A Congress panel tasked to hold organisational elections is waiting for former party chief Rahul Gandhi to return to India to finalise the schedule for the internal polls, people aware of the matter said. Gandhi, who left for abroad on December 27, is expected to return in next few days. A member of the central election authority (CEA) of the Congress said the panel was to announce the schedule by December-end but it got delayed as efforts to build consensus on the presidential candidate are on. He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with party leaders, including some members of the group of 23 letter writers, was part of that consensus-building. “What we gather is that there is a broad consensus among the party leaders on the name now,” the CEA member quoted above said on the condition of anonymity. Also Read: ‘Too much vikas’: Rahul Gandhi stings govt; uses GDP, employment dataOnce the schedule is finalised, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, will meet to clear it. At Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with dissenters and other senior leaders at her 10, Janpath residence on December 19, there was a renewed call for Rahul Gandhi to return as the party chief. While Rahul Gandhi said it would not be appropriate to interfere in the ongoing internal election process, the dissenters are firm that they will not accept a “proxy” candidate and insist that polls should be held at all levels, including the CWC. As per Congress Constitution, 12 of the 25 CWC members have to be elected by All India Congress Committee (AICC) delegates and the rest appointed by the party president.The CWC has not witnessed any election in over two decades now. The last elections to the CWC was in 1997 during the Kolkata plenary. Prior to that, the CWC polls took place in 1992 at the Tirupati session. The CEA member quoted above said the panel is expected to wind up the organisational polls by February-end as per the deadline to inform the Election Commission of the completion of the process. He said in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CEA has decided to restrict the number of electoral college AICC members. “We will not include the co-opted members this time. So, the electoral college will have around 800 members only” he added. The CEA member further said that the digital IDs of the AICC members are almost ready to enable the panel to hold virtual sessions in case it is difficult to hold such a convention physically due to Covid-19. The five-member CEA is headed by Madhusudan Mistry and its members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani and Arvinder Singh Lovely, one of the 23 signatories to a letter written to Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 seeking a complete overhaul of the party and a full-time leadership to stem the steady decline of the 135-year-old organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-panel-waits-for-rahul-gandhi-s-return-to-finalise-internal-poll-schedule-101610424044101.html

12-01-2021||India||Akhilesh Yadav on hop, stop, click temple run in Uttar Pradesh||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has been keeping a bustling schedule, visiting Hindu pilgrimage centres like Ayodhya, Chitrakoot across Uttar Pradesh and meeting saints and seers almost on a regular basis. Yadav has also been invoking Hindu deities - Ram, Krishna, Hanuman, and Parshuram. Political observers say it appears the party is treading the soft Hindutva path in the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, due to be held early next year.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister made a brief stopover in Ayodhya from Azamgarh four weeks back, where he said: “Is Lord Ram not of Samajwadis (socialists)?"Then, on January 8, Yadav visited Chitrakoot, did a full 5.5-kilometre parikrama (circumambulation) of the Kamtanath temple at Kamadgiri. Kamadgiri is believed to have been the abode of Lord Ram, Sita, and Lakshman during their exile.The 47-year-old also visited half-a-dozen temples, including a Hanuman temple, and met seers and saints there. He took their blessings and posted pictures of his visit on his Twitter account. He took credit for development of the circumambulation route and accused the BJP government of neglecting it.Before this, in Ayodhya, he had similarly stated that it was his government that planted Parijat trees on the Ayodhya parikrama routes.“When Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya, Parijat trees showered flowers on him. Parijat is also associated with Lord Krishna, it was he who brought the tree to earth. That story is different. We revere all the incarnations of Lord Vishnu — Ram, Krishna, and others," he had said and added that he would soon visit Ayodhya with his family.He also emphasised: “I am religious. I have a temple at home, one outside, and had built one at the chief minister's residence during my stay there.”Political observers call it a clear and emphatic display of soft Hindutva by the former chief minister and say that it is an attempt to attract Hindu voters."It's a logical strategy. The party is aware that apart from its traditional Yadav and Muslim vote banks, and secular posturing, it’s important to win over Hindu voters as well if they have to win the 2022 polls," said Prof SK Dwivedi, a political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.“WH Morris Jones, an eminent writer, wrote that in Indian politics there are three political idioms at play — traditional (caste, creed, etc), modern (democracy, secularism, constitution, etc), and saintly (religion, religious leaders, seers, maulanas, etc). What Akhilesh Yadav is exercising is saintly idiom ahead of the polls. It’s logical also considering the ruling party, the BJP, has been emphatic about its Hindutva,” Dwivedi added.Two weeks ago, a group of Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh religious leaders from Ayodhya visited him in Lucknow. On the occasion, Ayodhya’s former SP MLA Tej Narayan Pandey, aka Pawan Pandey, who is most likely to contest the 2022 polls from Ayodhya again, had accused the BJP government of ignoring Parshuram, a Brahmin warrior.He had said: “This BJP government scrapped the holiday that Akhileshji’s government had introduced on Parshuram Jayanti (birth anniversary).”Yadav had said several times that on return to power, he will reintroduce the Parshuram Jayanti holiday.He also frequently talks about the ancient King Harshvardhan whose capital was Kannauj and his contribution to Kumbh fair where he used to donate everything he had.Yadav represented Kannauj thrice in Lok Sabha. And it was at the same event that he made the statement: "Lord Ram is not of BJP alone. Lord Ram is of all Indians and all the people outside India.”Perhaps in response, chief minister Yogi Adityanath was quick to say in a public meeting: "Those who used to say Ram was a kalpanik (imaginary) figure, are now saying Ram is of everyone.”On Sunday, on his return to Lucknow from his Chitrakoot trip, Akhilesh Yadav tweeted: “Harey Krishna, Harey Krishna, Krishna Krishna Harey Harey; Harey Ram, Harey Ram, Ram Ram Harey Harey”. Along with the tweet, there was a picture of him standing next to a temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-on-whirlwind-hop-stop-click-temple-run-in-uttar-pradesh-101610422620570.html

Defence minister Rajnath also spoke to the Goa chief minister. "The State Government is properly managing the treatment of Sripadji. Pray to God that Shripadji recovers soon," Singh tweeted in Hindi.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has condoled the death of Vijaya Naik and the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Sadanand Tanavade also wished speedy recovery of the Union minister."Shocked and pained to learn about the tragic death of Vijaya Naik in an accident. Wishing for the earliest recovery of Shripad Naik. Hope he is out of danger soon. Also, pray to Mahaprabhu Jagannath to give Shripad and family the strength to overcome this loss," Union minister of petroleum and natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan said.Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said he is "anguished to hear about the demise of Vijaya Naik ji in a road accident.

In Delhi, the maximum temperature was 16.2 degrees Celsius, 3.8 degrees below normal. Day temperatures are likely to fall further on Tuesday.According to IMD, a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature that is 4.5 degrees Celsius or 6.4 degrees below normal respectively. A “cold wave” occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree Celsius in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures was lower than normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cold-day-conditions-likely-over-many-parts-of-northwest-india-101610421023640.html

The deadline for filing ITRs for tax audit cases was extended from January 31, 2021, to February 15, 2021.“It would also postpone the collection of revenue thereby hampering the efforts of the government to provide relief to the poor during these Covid times,” the CBDT order said. Various deadlines were extended for the third time on December 31, 2020, to provide relief to different category of taxpayers who had been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. While the initial deadline for individual taxpayers was July 31, it was first extended to November 30, then to December 31 and finally to January 10, the order said.

The first consignment of Covishield consisting of 34 boxes and weighing 1,088 kg was carried from Pune to Delhi on SpiceJet flight 8937. We will be carrying multiple vaccine consignments to different Indian cities, including Guwahati, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Bengaluru, Patna and Vijayawada, through the day today. SpiceJet is fully committed and prepared to transport the Covid vaccine both within and outside India. Today marks the beginning of a long and decisive phase in India’s fight against the pandemic and SpiceJet is proud to assist in the biggest vaccination drive in the history of mankind,” said SpiceJet chairman and managing director, Ajay Singh.The first doses of the Covishield vaccine were sent via three trucks from SII’s Pune campus early Tuesday morning for Lohegaon Airport.

The Centre will bear the entire cost of vaccinating 30 million health care and frontline workers — employees across government departments, the police and civic bodies — at the start of the world’s biggest immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday.The Centre, last Friday, had issued guidelines for the packaging and transportation of the Covid-19 vaccines by air, directing airlines and airport authorities to ensure the vaccines are packaged in dry ice and refrigerated material in a bid to maintain low temperatures ranging between -8° C to -70° C essential for its transportation.The guidelines issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) stated that all scheduled operators, which are currently authorised to carry dangerous goods, may carry Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice, meeting regulatory requirements.Elaborating on the need to package the vaccines with dry ice, the DGCA noted that the temperature maintenance requirement for Covid-19 vaccines is reported to be varying from -8°C to -70°C and hence, the use of refrigerant material during the transportation becomes essential.“Though there may be different refrigerant options, the use of dry ice (Carbon Dioxide Solid) is the most commonly used, affordable and readily available refrigerant material available in the country for transportation of perishables by air. Dry ice continually sublimates (Dry ice that is solid, transforms into Carbon Dioxide gas (COz)) at temperatures higher than -78°C (-108.4°F) under normal atmospheric pressure. At reduced pressures, the sublimation rate of dry ice will increase while all other factors being the same,” it noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-flight-ferrying-covid-19-vaccines-departs-from-pune-to-delhi-101610419602527.html

Deputy commissioner of police Namrata Patil cracked open a coconut to flag off the trucks. Patil was accompanied by SII employees who clapped as the trucks left the building amid heavy police cover."This is the first of the rollout of the vaccine. These trucks are airport bound. One is of Koolex company while two are of Serum Institute of India. We will be providing security for the trucks right up to the airport. The destination of these vials is not something we can comment on," Patil said.The Centre will start vaccinating frontline workers against the coronavirus disease from January 16. Covishield has been developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Pune based company.The trucks left the SII building at 4:55am behind a police escort vehicle with more police officials following it soon after. The unloading began at the cargo terminal of Pune International Airport at around 5:30am. A group of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials was providing security to the cargo entrance of the airport as the boxes were unloaded one by one.Read more: Speedy distribution of vaccine a major challenge for global govts: WHO expertsThe vials are stored in what appear to be boxes made of white cardboard and are covered in a plastic layer. The boxes will be transported on multiple flights of private airlines throughout the day and are bound for cities in multiple states, according to an official at the cargo terminal of the Pune airport.A senior airport official confirmed that 14 flights were to leave from Pune airport with the vaccine vials weighing 14.592 tonnes in about 456 boxes. A Delhi-bound SpiceJet flight, which will leave Pune at 8:05am, will be the first aircraft to carry the boxes containing the vaccine vials. SpiceJet flight SG 8937 is scheduled to land in Delhi at 10:15 am, officials aware of the development confirmed.These vaccines would be carried in private air carriers and include two Chennai-bound, two Chandigarh-bound, two Kolkata-bound, and one each headed for Gandhinagar, Hyderabad, Vijaywada, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Bengaluru, Patna, and Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-trucks-loaded-with-sii-s-covishield-vaccine-leave-pune-ahead-of-jan-16-rollout-101610414772501.html

The DSMB concluded that no safety concerns were identified and the study has met the primary endpoints of safety.“The Indian clinical trial being conducted by Dr Reddy’s and RDIF is an adaptive design phase 2/3 trial. It is a bridging study to the larger global phase 3 study on 31,000 subjects. The phase 2 study in India showed a very good safety profile. This further reinforces our confidence in the safety of Sputnik V, which has now been administered to more than 1 million people in Russia and more than 300,000 people in Argentina. We are working closely towards fast-tracking the launch of the Sputnik V vaccine in India,” said G V Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said, “The safety data from the phase 2 clinical trial from India is very positive, and confirms the safety profile of Sputnik V in the international markets. The Sputnik V consistently shows safety and high efficacy in international clinical trials as it is based on safe human adenoviral vector platform.”The clinical trials are being conducted by JSS Medical Research as the clinical research partner in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-vaccine-found-safe-in-phase-2-clinical-trials-dr-reddys-101610412398760.html
12-01-2021||India||No chief guest this R-Day||India has decided to go ahead with a truncated parade to mark Republic Day (January 26) without a chief guest, people familiar with the matter said. The decision was taken after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s last-minute decision to cancel his visit due to the spread of a mutant strain of the virus that causes Covid-19 in the UK.This will be the first time in at least five decades that the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in India’s diplomatic calendar, will not have a chief guest. The last time the parade did not have a chief guest was In 1966 when Indira Gandhi was sworn in as prime minister on January 24 after the demise of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on January 11. There were two other years when the parade did not have a chief guest: 1952 and 1953.One official said the decision was taken on account of multiple reasons. “We did not want to put any foreign dignitary in an awkward situation,” the official said, underscoring that a last-minute acceptance of India’s invitation could be potentially embarrassing for the invitee back home as the head of state would be seen as a replacement. Since 1950, India has twice identified replacements after guests cancelled at the last moment.Although PM Boris Johnson publicly accepted India’s invitation, Downing Street later indicated his inability to attend the annual event marking the adoption of the Indian Constitution due to the rapid rise in Covid cases in the country.India was also aware that given the mutant virus’ impact on the UK, and elsewhere, there would be continued uncertainty about the visit right till the end. Since then, there have been reports of new strains that have been spotted in other countries such as South Africa and Japan. The South African variant, like the UK strain, is driving a surge of infections in the country. And the Narendra Modi government also did not want to take any risks, this official explained.Social distancing protocols due to the Covid-19 pandemic have already forced the government to opt for a truncated version of the parade, the highlight of the Republic Day celebrations that showcases India’s military might and cultural diversity.The parade will be shorter and end at National Stadium in the national capital Delhi rather than the Red Fort. The marching contingents will also be smaller, with 96 participants in each squad that was earlier made up of 144. Also, the number of spectators along Rajpath have been capped at one-fourth of the 100,000 in previous years. Children below the age of 15 will not be permitted at the parade.The plan to have a marching contingent of the Bangladesh army participate in the parade as part of the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the 1971 liberation war of Bangladesh is so far intact. This is only the second time that foreign soldiers will be marching down Rajpath as part of India’s biggest ceremonial event -- the first was the French in 2016. Fifty years ago, the Pakistan Army surrendered to the Indian Army paving the way for the formation of Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-chief-guest-this-rday-101610411651577.html
12-01-2021||India||SC advises Nagaland Lokayukta to resign||Nagaland Lokayukta Uma Nath Singh, the state’s anti-corruption ombudsman, was on Monday advised by the Supreme Court to step down from his position given the spate of controversies the former high court chief justice has been embroiled in.An SC bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde suggested to the Lokayukta’s lawyer that it is better to give up the post rather than demeaning himself and the offices that he has held in his career.“When there is no dignity in continuing, why go through all this and insist to continue at any cost?” the bench asked the former judge’s lawyer Vikas Singh, as it referred to the petition filed by the Nagaland government demanding that the Lokayukta be stripped of all his powers.The state government has sought removal of the Lokayukta, alleging various acts of impropriety and unjustified personal demands by him. Its petition contended that the Lokayukta has continued to work online from Delhi even though the chief secretary did not approve of this.Representing Nagaland in the court, its advocate general KN Balagopal submitted on Monday that the former judge’s assumption of office as Lokayukta had itself flouted the law because he did not discontinue his arbitration work despite it being an office of profit. Balagopal also produced records of cases pending before the Lokayukta.The Lokayukta’s lawyer, on his part, responded that it was because of the outbreak of Covid-19 that Singh had insisted on doing his work from DelhiBut this argument failed to cut any ice with the bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. “We don’t agree with you at all...”.The case was adjourned for a week to give the Lokayukta time to ponder over his willingness to call it quits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-advises-nagaland-lokayukta-to-resign-101610406688903.html
12-01-2021||India||Centre will bear cost of 1st phase of vaccination: Modi||The Centre will bear the entire cost of vaccinating 30 million health care and frontline workers — employees across government departments, the police and civic bodies — at the start of the world’s biggest immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday.According officials who did not want to be named, the cost for this phase could be around ₹10,000 crore.Modi hailed the two made-in-India vaccines that have received emergency use authorisation from the Drug Controller General of India — Serum Institute of India’s Covisheld and Bharat Biotech International’s Covaxin — as a matter of pride for India because the country doesn’t have to depend on expensive, imported antidotes to the viral disease.In his last meeting by video link with state chief ministers five days before the vaccination campaign gets underway, Modi said some more vaccines are in the pipeline and expected to arrive by the time India starts inoculating senior citizens and those with comorbidities.He also rebutted past criticism that India’s progress towards the vaccination drive had been slow. He cautioned states not to let rumours and misinformation to gain currency; many vested interest groups or even corporate rivals may try to derail India’s vaccination programmeIndia intends to vaccinate 300 million people in the first phase of the drive, turning its attention to people above 50 years of age and those below 50 with comorbidities, after administering the shot to health-care and front-line workers who are at the vanguard of the fight against the pandemic that has left how many people dead and affected in India.Monday’s meeting with the chief ministers marked the first time that the PM held out a categorical assurance that the Centre would pick up the bill for the vaccination of health-care and front-line workers -- the two groups that have worked untiringly in the past 10 months.“The total number of such personnel is around three crore. State governments will not have to bear any cost towards vaccinating these three crore people in the first stage. Centre will bear this cost,” Modi told the CMs.Citing the indigenously produced vaccines, the PM said: “Both vaccines are more cost-effective. Just imagine, if India had to depend on foreign vaccines, what would have been our situation?”According to officials who requested anonymity, the government has earmarked ₹50,000 crore to cover the vaccination campaign while the infrastructure and logistics of the universal immunization programme will be used to support the Covid-19 vaccine drive. According to officials, the vaccination will run parallelly to the regular immunization programme with different dates and slots for the two.The PM also underlined that India the made-in-India vaccines would go to neighbours as well as other friendly countries, adding: “We have to be more responsible.”There will be another interaction between the PM and the states before the vaccination of the elderly and those with comorbidities starts. It will be the most complex part of the campaign in terms of transportation of vaccines, outreach and the number of vaccination sites, including mobile centres that will be dispatched to difficult terrain.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee argued that adequate scientific opinions should be obtained before confirming the safety and efficacy of both vaccines, while she also requested clarification on whether there might be any side-effects after vaccination, according to a statement released by the state government.“She submitted that optimal number of trials and fool-proof studies through such trials were needed before vaccinations were unequivocally advised in favour of both the vaccines,” it said.Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who too participated in the video conference, said the state government was well-prepared to roll out the vaccine.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said of the 30 million vaccinations beginning January 16, the state will get about 1.6 million doses in the first phase.“Health, revenue and police officials would get the first dose and after 28 days the second dose would be given to them. Already 235 centres across the state have been identified for this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-will-bear-cost-of-1st-phase-of-vaccination-modi-101610406320398.html

She was released on December 13.According to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the accused had abducted Rubaiya Sayeed to force the government to release five militants.Yasin Malik, who shunned terrorism to join politics in 1994, has been accused of playing a key role in the kidnapping that he and his associates allegedly executed.The court, after hearing public prosecutor Vijay Kumar Dogra and advocate MA Goni (both representing CBI) and the confessional statements of other accused, observed that sufficient grounds existed to presume that all the accused had committed offences. “Hence, charges are required to be framed against each of the accused persons, separately,” the court stated.In March last year, a court under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, or TADA, had also framed charges against Yasin Malik and six others for their alleged involvement in the killing of four unarmed Indian Air Force (IAF) officials in 1990 in Kashmir.Malik is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/30-years-later-charges-to-be-framed-against-malik-others-101610405826588.html
12-01-2021||India||Will win over 100 seats: Nadda at Assam rally||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Monday expressed confidence that the party would return to power in Assam, predicting that it would win over 100 of the 126 assembly seats in upcoming elections .Nadda addressed a “Vijay Sankalpa” (victory pledge) rally in Barak Valley’s Silchar, beginning the party’s campaign for the assembly elections, likely to be held in April-May.The BJP has given due recognition to Assam’s culture, language and identity, since coming to power in the northeastern state in 2016, Nadda said.“The task of protecting Assam’s culture, language and identity has been done well by the BJP governments at the Centre and the state and we will continue that. We have been sensitive about the rights of Assamese people,” said Nadda.Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior party leaders including general secretary (organization) BL Santosh and state in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda were also present at the rally.“The BJP has been working peacefully for the development of Assam, taking into consideration the interests of all communities. It has fulfilled their demands without harming others…Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah resolved the 50-year-old Bodo issue by signing a peace accord and bringing the militants to the mainstream. All stakeholders were taken into confidence and the accord ensured that their demands were given due recognition,” he said.Nadda also cited the proposed grant of scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities and the smart fencing of border areas with Bangladesh.At the rally, the BJP chief targeted the Congress, alleging that there had was no progress in the state in the 15 years of Congress rule between 2001 and 2016.“During those 15 years, the state saw killings of 2,155 civilians and 284 security personnel and over 12,000 people were kidnapped. Over 51% area of the state was not covered by electrification and 56% homes didn’t have toilets. All that has changed in the past years,” he said.“During 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre, Assam received ₹50,000 crore in assistance. But since 2014, when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP came to power, the state has got ₹300,000 crore till date,” Nadda said.Reacting to Nadda’s statement, senior Congress leader Debabrata Saikia said, “Most of the development that took in Assam happened during the 15 years of Congress rule. Nadda seems to be unaware of it. He also seems to have no idea that crime rate in Assam hasn’t improved and the state has the highest rate of crimes against women.”The BJP president’s comments come close on the heels of the launch of several new regional parties in the state, which have accused the ruling party of not being sincere in safeguarding Assam’s ‘jaati’ (community), ‘maati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (base).Two student organisations, All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), who were spearheading the anti-Citizenship Ament Act (CAA) protests in the state in December, 2019, have joined hands to form Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP).Another organisation at the forefront of the anti-CAA stir, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), has also formed a political party called Raijor Dal. The organisation’s leader, Akhil Gogoi, who is in jail since December, 2019, for his role in the violent protests, was named president of the new party last week.The BJP president, who arrived here on Monday on a two-day visit, is set to leave later in the day for Guwahati, where he will hold meetings with members of the party’s state unit core committee, election committee and other office bearers.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-win-over-100-seats-nadda-at-assam-rally-101610405614632.html
12-01-2021||India||Farm stir fanned by vested interests: Govt||he central government has in the Supreme Court blamed “vested interests” for instigating the ongoing farmers’ protests, maintaining that the recently enacted farm laws have in reality received “wide acceptance” throughout the country.In its affidavit filed hours after Monday’s hearing, the government told the court that the three legislations are a result of two decades of deliberations and that the demand to repeal them in entirety is “neither justifiable nor acceptable.”“The Acts have received wide acceptance throughout the country and, therefore, some farmers and others objecting to the law had put a condition of its repeal, is neither justifiable nor acceptable,” said the affidavit, filed by the agriculture ministry.The three Acts in question are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations and erode the government’s procurement system.The government submitted that the affidavit was prepared and filed “hurriedly” after the conclusion of the hearing on Monday during which the SC bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, expressed its inclination to suspend the operation of the laws while questioning the consultation process and their efficacy.“This affidavit is filed only to remove a deliberate wrong perception created systematically by non-farmer elements present at the protest site and using media/social media, and to apprise this Hon’ble Court with true facts,” said the government.It claimed that “the farmers of the nation are happy” as they are given an additional option over and above the existing ones. “The agitation by/in the name of some of the farmers may, therefore, not be treated as reflection on the validity of the law or its efficacy and usefulness for the farmer community,” said the affidavit.The government said the agitation being limited to just one place in the country was an evidence that majority of farmers were not only happy with the legislations but found these legislations to be progressive and in their interest.The affidavit said that the government wished to also dispel “the erroneous notion that the protestors have peddled that the Central Government and the Parliament never had any consultative process or examination of issues by any Committee before passing of the laws.”Starting with the constitution of the Expert Committee in December 2000 to review the system of agricultural marketing and to recommend measures to make the system more efficient and competitive, the government adduced a brief history of various committees subsequently formed, recommendations made and consultations done with the states to augment its argument on adequate deliberation. “Government of India has been, thus, actively and intensively engaging with the States for about two decades to achieve the aforesaid objectives of reforms to provide accessible and barrier free market system for better price realization but states either showed reluctance to adopt the reforms...or made partial or cosmetic reforms,” asserted the affidavit.“The legislations are not hurriedly made but is a result of two decades of deliberations. The farmers of the nation are happy as they are given an additional option over and above the existing and, therefore, no vested right is taken away,” it said.According to the affidavit, talks with the farmers failed only because they insisted on repealing the laws as a precondition for talks while the government was ready to allay their apprehensions about the new laws by discussing it clause by clause.“As a responsible Government, it has taken all conceivable steps to ensure that specific grievances of some farmers who are agitating are discussed and sorted out so far as possible...,” read the affidavit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-stir-fanned-by-vested-interests-govt-101610402044333.html
12-01-2021||India||Put farm laws on hold, or we will, SC tells govt||The Supreme Court on Monday said it was “extremely disappointed” with the way the Union government was handling the controversy surrounding the three farm laws at the core of massive protests at the Capital’s borders, and indicated that these laws will have to be put on hold to create an atmosphere conducive for talks.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde asked the government if it was willing to pause the implementation of the laws; it said otherwise the court will do it, and also constitute a committee to examine the farmers’ grievances with the legislation.“Why there should be an insistence to implement a law at any cost?” the bench asked attorney general KK Venugopal, and urged him to come back with a reply if the government was willing to stay the operation of the three laws of its own accord, because the court would otherwise be inclined to do so through a judicial order.It also sought to confirm the consent of the farmers’ unions in joining the deliberations before the court-appointed committee, and asked their lawyer Dushyant Dave to consult the farmers and inform it on Tuesday, when the court will pass its order.On Monday evening, the government filed a counter affidavit blaming “vested interests” for instigating the farmers’ protests, and suggested that it was not going to repeal the laws — a demand it described as “neither justifiable nor acceptable”.Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of major farm unions that is leading the protest, said it was grateful to the top court for suggesting that the laws be put on hold but refused to be a part of a panel to scrutinise the laws because it is “unanimous in the decision that laws must be repealed forthwith”.The hour-long hearing on Monday witnessed sharp criticism of the government by the top court in handling the disputations over the recently enacted agricultural laws, which are meant to liberalise the farm economy, but which, the protesting farmers believe, will lead to monopolies controlled by big corporations while eroding the system of state-set minimum prices (MSPs).As soon as the hearing commenced before the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, the A-G drew the court’s attention towards the next round of talks slated for January 15.But the bench retorted: “We don’t wish to hear all this.We are extremely disappointed with the way the government is handling this issue. We don’t know what kind of consultation went on before you brought this law. And since the last three-four times, you have been telling us we are talking; we are talking. What are you talking? How are you talking?”As Venugopal tried to elaborate that the consultation regarding these farm laws began in 2010 when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power, the court shot back: “We understand what you’re trying to tell us but it won’t help the government to say some other government started this. We understand the kind of arguments you are trying to make. You should reserve it for when we start hearing this matter finally.”Rejecting the A-G’s submission that negotiations were still on, the CJI lamented that the court specifically asked the government during a hearing on December 17 if they were willing to put the laws in abeyance, but there was still no answer.“What is the pressing need involved in his? Hold this in abeyance. This matter is becoming worse and worse; people are committing suicides,calling names to each other, they are protesting in this cold weather. There is no social distancing. Old people, women and children are out in the cold without any safety. We don’t even know if they have food and water,” the court observed.“Our intention is to see if we can bring about an amicable solution to the parties,” stressed the bench, saying it would set up a committee, which could be headed by a former CJI and would comprise members from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and similar organisations, to hear representatives of both sides to discuss and resolve the dispute.At this, Venugopal said the government had no problem with constitution of the committee but a law could not be stayed in such a “drastic” manner when none of the petitioners had raised arguments on either lack of power with the Centre to frame these laws or violation of any fundamental right and constitutional provision.The bench, however, responded: “You are in this state because you haven’t been able to solve the problem. You have framed a law, which has resulted into strikes and protests which you should have solved. We read the talks are breaking down only because farmers want laws to be repealed while the government wants to discuss it clause by clause. We cannot wait. We will make the atmosphere conducive for talks. With so much jarring over this law, we will put it on hold so that talks can go on.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, also appearing for the government during Monday’s hearing, sought to emphasise that the laws were progressive, already operational and that a “vast majority” felt they were beneficial too.Some other farmers’ groups, such as Indian Kisan Union and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, supported the S-G in saying that these laws were good for farmers and that they should not be suspended. The bench, however, said that this “vast majority” should also go to the committee and present its views since the court was “not an expert on agriculture or economics”.Representing a Delhi resident who complained against the blockades along the Delhi borders, senior counsel Harish Salve intervened during the hearing to state that the protesters should agree to shift and decongest now that the court is in favour of either staying the laws or at least the controversial clauses in it.To this, the bench said that it did not want any criticism that the court was slighting the right to protests and that the protests could carry on.“Right to protest should be exercised the way Mahatma Gandhi did it and the protest was on a much larger scale. Right to protest has to be exercised peacefully. We are not here to protect breaking of the law but we are trying to ensure no such incident takes place in future,” it said.It further observed: “The most serious question occupying the mind of this court is a possible loss of life and property. We have an apprehension that someday because of some incident, there will be a breach of peace.Each one of us will be responsible if anything goes wrong. We don’t want anybody’s blood or injury on our hands...who is going to be responsible if there is a bloodshed. We are constitutional court and we have a duty to protect people’s life and property. Who will be responsible if something serious happens tomorrow?”CJI Bobde asked Dave, HS Phoolka, Colin Gonsalves, Prashant Bhushan, and other lawyers representing the farmers’ unions, to make an appeal on his behalf to the old people, women and children to go back to their homes in the interest of their safety and health due to Covid-19.“Passions may be high at this time but you must send old, women and children back to their homes due to Covid, cold, etc. If the laws are stayed, there is nothing to fight for but to only talk,” said the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/put-farm-laws-on-hold-or-we-will-sc-tells-govt-101610401152064.html
12-01-2021||India||Won’t be part of SC panel: Farm unions||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of major farm unions protesting three agricultural laws, on Monday said it was grateful to the Supreme Court for suggesting that the Union government put the laws on hold, but refused to be part of a panel proposed by the top court to scrutinise the laws.“While all organisations welcome the suggestions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court to stay the implementation of the farm laws, they are collectively and individually not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” a statement by the protesting farm unions issued on Monday said.The Supreme Court on Monday said it was “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations were being held between the Centre and the farmers over the three farm laws. It suggested a committee of experts to look into the laws “threadbare” and also suggested the government put the laws on hold.Farmers’ unions spearheading the fight against the farm laws said they “are unanimous in their decision that laws must be repealed forthwith”, the statement added.In what has been a tough political challenge for the Narendra Modi government, tens of thousands of protesting farmers have encircled the national capital for over a month, demanding the government scrap the three laws approved by Parliament in September to open agricultural markets.“Our demand remains the same. We want the laws repealed. We have discussed everything with our lawyers,” Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader, said.The decision to not be a part of a court-proposed committee was taken in a discussion of top farm leaders and their lawyers including Balvir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Prem Singh Bhangu, Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala and Jagmohan Singh. The team of lawyers included senior advocates Dushyant Dave, Prashant Bhushan, Collin Gonsalves and HS Phoolka.Explaining the reasons behind the decision, Pal said: “Looking to the attitude and approach of the government, which they made it clear before the court today repeatedly, that they will not agree to a discussion for repeal before the committee.” The stand deepens a stalemate in negotiations between the government and farm unions.“We met our lawyers this evening at length and after deliberation on pros and cons of the suggestions of a (proposed) committee, we informed them (farmers’ lawyers) that we are unanimously not agreeable to go before any committee that may be appointed by Hon’ble Supreme Court today due to stubborn attitude of the government,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-part-of-sc-panel-farm-unions-101610398030115.html
12-01-2021||India||PM should apologise to farmers, says Oppn||The Congress on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologise to protesting farmers and repeal the three new agricultural laws, noting that the Supreme Court too had expressed its anguish and disappointment over the repeated failure of conciliatory talks and the government’s inability to find a solution.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, meanwhile, met Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja in New Delhi to discuss the Supreme Court observations.“We did discuss the Supreme Court order, informally. But the decision on what has to be done has to be taken by the farmers. They have to react to it. We stand by their demand for the repeal of the laws,” Communist Party of India general secretary Raja said.The meeting at Pawar’s residence came on a day the Supreme Court criticised the central government over its handling of the agitation.“We know that they have issued a statement. We will wait for their comprehensive reaction before making a comment,” Raja said.But the Congress upped the ante against the PM and the government after the top court’s observations. The party chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also urged the the Supreme Court to register cases against Modi, home minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath after taking note of their actions that, he said, had caused damage to public property.He said the central government and state governments have dug up roads and caused blockades on the national highways to stop the farmers from entering Delhi.“The Prime Minister should apologise not only to the families of 65 farmers who have sacrificed their lives but also to the 62 crore farmers of the country. He should talk to the agitating farmers and nothing short of it is acceptable to the annadatas (food givers),” Surjewala told reporters.The Congress spokesperson held the PM, the home minister and chief ministers of Haryana and UP directly responsible for the current agitation, saying they stopped farmers from coming to Delhi and expressing their opposition to the farm laws in a Gandhian manner.Nationalist Congress Party leader Jayant Patil said, This is a victory for farmers. It is now clear that the Centre has not handled the farmers’ agitation properly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-should-apologise-to-farmers-says-oppn-101610397606915.html
12-01-2021||India||Bird flu spreads to 10 states, govt says human threat low||Bird flu spread to 10 states on Monday with Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand confirming the viral outbreak, which experts said would be difficult to control because a large number of birds in the wild had been infected.The Central government moved to ease concerns of the infection spreading to humans through contaminated meat or chicken, saying that in India the disease had been spread mainly by migratory birds and added that the secondary spread to poultry birds had occurred only at a few places.“There are no scientific reports on transmission of bird flu to humans and consumers should not be scared,” minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday, asking the states not to close wholesale markets or restrict the sale of poultry products.Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined Himachal Pradesh , where close to 4,000 migratory birds have died in Pong Dam, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana in confirming bird flu cases.While transmission of the virus to humans is rare, it easily spreads among birds through droppings. “The entire water body gets infected with the virus, a reason for so many birds dying in Pong Dam in Himachal. Also, it spreads the disease from one species to another,” said Suresh Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India and migratory bird expert.Migratory birds reach India at wintering sites through the Central Asian flyway, which extends from the Artic in the north to Maldives in the south and from central China in the east to eastern Europe in the west. It is one of the eight major migratory bird flyways and least studied among all, said a report in Birdlife International, a global partnership of non-government organisations devoted to avian conservation.Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said the birds from Central Asia, China, Mongolia and Siberia cover more than 5,000 kms to reach hundreds of wintering sites in the Indian subcontinent and some of them even fly to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Sri Lanka.Close to 90% of the 370 identified species in the CAF reach the Indian subcontinent and spread across the country. “You can find Bar-headed Goose in Kaziranga and Pong Dam. They may enter India through two ends of Tibetan plateau. They are of same species but represent different populations,” Kumar said.Rahmani said that some of these migratory birds may be carriers of bird flu although they may not perish. Not much research has been done on bird diseases, and it would not be possible to say which birds carry which strain of bird flu, he added.Testing by Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) indicates that both the strains of bird flu came from migratory birds. H5N8, a sub-type of avian influenza found in poultry and wild animals, has been found in crows in Rajasthan, Uttarkand and Madhya Prades; the strain came from migratory birds. The other strain is H5N1, found in ducks in Kerala and the Bar-headed Goose in Himachal. While H5N8 transmission to humans is not known, there have been cases of H5N1 transmission to humans, although rare.“There is no way one can control bird flu in wild birds,” Kumar said, noting that it spreads from droppings in water bodies that are impossible to clean. “Poultry bird flu is easier to contain as all birds can be culled and cleaning operations can be completed in 90 days.”That could be a probable reason that Kerala and Haryana, where the virus was reported in poultry, were able to control bird flu and not Rajasthan, Himachal and Madhya Pradesh, where it was present in birds in the wild.On Monday, Madhya Pradesh’s animal husbandry director Dr RK Rokde said the latest reports had confirmed bird flu in pigeons, sparrows and herons, but morbidity was the highest among crows.“As of now, 1,300 birds have died of bird flu in about 35 districts of MP and spread of avian influenza has been confirmed in 18 districts,” said Rokde.In Rajasthan, bird flu reached Jaipur zoo, causing the death of three ducks and a black stork, forcing the authorities to close the bird section. Fowl deaths had earlier been reported from Kanpur zoo in Uttar Pradesh. The total bird deaths because of bird flu in a week doubled to 3,321 on Monday with the spread of aviation influenza to 15 of 33 districts of Rajasthan. Most of the birds that perished were crows.Apart from Sanjay Lake in Delhi, bird flu was confirmed in wild birds, mostly crows, in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. An outbreak of avian influenza was reported among poultry in Parbhani district of Maharashtra while bird flu in crows was confirmed in Mumbai, Thane, Dapoli and Beed, officials said.In Uttarkhand, bird flu in crows has been confirmed from Pauri Gharwal district. In Gujarat, bird flu cases have been confirmed in crows in Surat and Vadodara districts, officials said.Rahmani said the only way to control bird flu infection from migratory birds was through satellite-based monitoring of major bird species and rapid information sharing between 30 countries on the Central Asian Flyway. Kumar said nine flagship migratory species including the Amur Falcon, Common Crane and Black Kite are monitored under an environment ministry’s programme.(With inputs from state bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-spreads-to-10-states-govt-says-human-threat-low-101610395088031.html
12-01-2021||India||Poultry sector predicts losses of over ₹1k-cr||A surge in avian influenza or bird flu, an outbreak that has now spread to 10 states, has decimated over three dozen large farms, shut down hundreds of hatcheries and upended supply chains as more poultry farmers confront the pervasive fear of its rapid spread.Even in states free from the avian flu so far, consumption of poultry has plunged, several stakeholders said.Regions where H5N8 cases have been confirmed are spread out across the country, forming a south-to-north arc, raising the threat for other central and eastern states, an official from the department of animal husbandry said.Samples of dead birds are piling up at the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) as the epidemic tears through 10 states: Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.“Our estimate is that business losses are to the tune of ₹1,500 crore. This includes layers, or poultry farms specialising only in egg production,” said Surinder Khanna,a former poultry development officer with the Haryana government and a consultant.Avian flu has significant economic impact. Poultry farmers are counting losses from devastated farms.“My farm is empty now. It is one of the six medium sized layers where 100% culling took place. Nearly 3,000 day-old chicks and 3,000 30-day-old chicken were culled, causing losses of ₹2,40,000,” said P. Suresh of Dynamix Poultry Cooperative in Kerala’s Allapuzha.According to Khanna and other analysts, an estimated half-a-million birds may have been culled so far, although no official figures are available. Industry figures show that a one-day-old chick sells for ₹45, while it costs poultry farmers ₹80-90 to raise a chicken for 30 days.Wholesale prices of chicken and eggs have crashed 80% and 60%, according to figures from the Poultry Federation of India.India’s poultry business runs largely on a contract model, whereby poultry firms enter into written contracts with raisers.“During outbreaks of bird disease, if affected population in a firm is more than 10%, which is usually the case in epidemics, farmers aren’t paid anything in accordance with contract terms,” Khanna said.Union minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday that the Centre was “coordinating with states to implement a national action plan” and there was no need for panic.The flu has a domino effect in related supply chains. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm. Maize is a major feed used for poultry, which consumes 14 million tonnes of corn annually.“Poultry consumption in eastern Indian states, unaffected by bird flu, has fallen by an estimated 70%,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, the editor of industry poultry journal Pashudhan Praharee.According to official data, India’s layer farms produce 250 million eggs a day. The country produces 1.5 billion broilers a year, while 380 million chicken are raised annually for laying eggs.Poultry is one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural sector in the country. While output of crops has seen a decadal rise at a rate of 1.5-2% annually, that of eggs and broilers has been rising at a rate of 8-10% annually, according to agriculture ministry data.India has among the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, showing how difficult it is to prevent poultry diseases in the country.Bird flu epidemics have occurred 24 times in the country since the first outbreak in 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, when the flu infected poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and MP.Kerala and Haryana have completed several rounds of culling in accordance with national animal disease guidelines.Avian flu mostly comes from infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their faeces. In India, the disease mostly is spread by migratory birds, such as geese, ducks and shorebirds.Since 2004, compensation worth ₹400 crore from federal funds were given to poultry farmers who faced the epidemic, aside from financial aid from states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poultry-sector-predicts-losses-of-over-1kcr-101610393225095.html
12-01-2021||India||SC seeks concrete measures from Centre on stubble burning||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the recently-constituted Commission for Air Quality Management in Delhi and Adjoining areas to submit an action plan to curb stubble burning this year.Finding the problem to repeat itself every year with no solution still in sight, a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, “You come back with concrete measures being taken about stubble burning.”The Court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two young environmental activists led by Aditya Dubey. The PIL alleged that the spike in pollution caused due to stubble burning could increase health risks caused by Covid-19 leading to more deaths.Senior advocate Vikas Singh appearing for the petitioners said, “Stubble burning problem is over for last year (2020) but some concrete steps must be taken by the Commission.”Also read: China pulls back 10,000 troops from Ladakh theatreSingh told the Court that a detailed affidavit filed last month by the Centre detailed the work done by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) since its formation by way of an Ordinance on October 28, 2020. “The affidavit makes no mention about the steps taken to curb stubble burning,” he added.On December 17, when the case was last heard, the CJI-headed bench had remarked, “We are not very satisfied” about the work done by the Commission. In October 2020, the Court had even formed a one-man committee headed by former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan Lokur to report on farm fires after air pollution in Delhi deteriorated. To put in place a permanent mechanism against air pollution, the Centre issued an Ordinance forming the said Commission.The Commission, drawing members from Central ministries and representatives from neighbouring states, was expected to provide a consolidated and conjoint approach which included monitoring, tackling and research in air pollution. The body was even tasked with the responsibility of coordinating measures taken by Delhi’s neighbouring states to prevent factors causing air pollution. Stubble burning was one of the major causes of air pollution under consideration of the Commission’s radar.The affidavit filed jointly by the Centre and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) disclosed about 50 teams being formed to monitor pollution on the ground. As per data furnished by the Commission, active farm fires in Punjab have been 44 per cent higher in 2020 (September 21-November 25) with 76,590 stubble fires as compared to same period in 2019 with 52,991 fires. Correspondingly, farm fires in Haryana saw a decline of 25 per cent over last year. In 2020, the state reported 5,000 stubble burning incidents compared to 6,652 in 2019.The Commission relied on the Ambient Air Quality Standards to show that in 2019, Delhi had 121 days and 63 days of ambient air quality for PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels as compared to 2018 when the corresponding figures were 98 days and 48 days.The affidavit further disclosed that on November 27 last year, the Commission held deliberations with Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and state governments of Punjab and Haryana on various measures to mitigate the issue of paddy crop burning. Scientists working in the field of agriculture proposed the use of PUSA-decomposer for microbial disintegration of agricultural stubble that could be an alternative to stubble burning. The Commission met various NGOs and civil society groups on this aspect, the deliberations of which are expected to come up in the subsequent affidavit to be filed by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-concrete-measures-from-centre-on-stubble-burning-101610390356655.html

The NDMC has also cordoned off the duck corner in Lodhi Garden due to the bird flu scare, officials said.NDMC controls 42.74 square kilometre area which is nearly 3% of Delhi’s total area. The area under the Council’s control mainly includes Lutyens Delhi, diplomatic area of Chanakyapuri, and residential areas of government officials such as Sarojini Nagar, East Kidwai Nagar, Gole Market.The NDMC region has a number of popular parks such as Lodhi Garden and Nehru Park. Civic officials said that any decision on closure of parks due to bird flu is yet to be taken.“We are yet to decide whether to close parks. A direction in this connection might be issued by today (Monday) evening. We have, however, advised visitors not to go near the duck corner in Lodhi Garden and have cordoned it off and sprayed mixed lime in and around the enclosure to reduce chances of virus infection,” an official said.The five-member rapid response team will work under the supervision of medical superintendent of NDMC’s Moti Bagh veterinary hospital. An order in this connection has also been issued. Details regarding actions taken by the three municipalities— North, South and East — are yet to come.Also read | Bird flu hits Delhi; culling begins at Sanjay Lake park, more to be shutAccording to the document, the rapid response team also has one veterinary surgeon (from veterinary hospital Moti Bagh), area sanitary inspector, senior statistical investigator and medical social worker.A senior NDMC official said that the team will visit different areas in the jurisdiction of the civic body to examine birds especially chicken, ducks, migratory birds and others and also take all necessary measures for prevention and control of avian flu in the NDMC area.The Delhi government on Monday said that the city is now affected with bird flu as eight of the 109 samples sent for testing were positive.The culling of live birds was immediately initiated from Monday morning in Sanjay Lake Park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2.
