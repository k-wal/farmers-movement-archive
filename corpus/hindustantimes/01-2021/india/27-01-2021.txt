Sera collected from 38 vaccine recipients, who received Covaxin vaccine-candidate in phase-II trial had equivalent NAb titers to homologous strain and two heterologous strains with the characteristic substitution of the UK-variant," said the authors."The median ratio of 50 per cent neutralization of sera was found to be 0.8 and 0.9 when compared with earlier detected SARS CoV-2 strains against mutant UK strain," they said."Our study evidently highlighted comparable neutralization activity of vaccinated individuals sera against variant as well as heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains.""Importantly, sera from the vaccine recipients could neutralise the UK-variant strains discounting the uncertainty around potential escape. It was reassuring from the neutralizing antibodies data generated in our laboratory that the indigenous Covaxin following its rollout in the vaccination program, could be expected to work against the new UK-variant. It is unlikely that the mutation would be able to dampen the potential benefits of the vaccine in concern," it said.The ICMR scientist mentioned that they have reported the development of an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Covaxin) which elicited remarkable neutralizing antibody response in phase I clinical trial against homologous, and two heterologous strains from the unclassified cluster.In phase II clinical trial, the vaccine candidate showed noteworthy results with plaque reduction neutralization test. The sero-conversion rate with neutralizing antibodies following vaccination with Covaxin was 99.6 per cent.It is pertinent to note that the rapid surge in SARS-CoV-2 cases due to the Variant of Concern (VOC) in the United Kingdom (UK) raised concerns in several countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-effective-on-uk-virus-strain-of-covid-19-says-icmr-101611737406620.html
27-01-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to meet select TMC leaders amid dissent among section of MLAs||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee has called the party’s Parliamentarians and a section of legislators and district leaders for an important meeting at her residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata on Friday, party leaders said Wednesday.The closed-door meeting is being described by party leaders as crucial in view of the dissent among a section of lawmakers. Some have spoken against the TMC while a few have joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the run up to the assembly polls due in April-May.The most prominent among those who switched allegiance is former transport minister Suvendu Adhikari. Two more ministers, Rajib Banerjee and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, a former Indian cricketer, have quit the cabinet. Both were elected from Howrah district. Shukla left the TMC as well. A third lawmaker from Howrah, Vaishali Dalmiya, was expelled last week on disciplinary grounds.Over the past few days, Banerjee made fresh organizational changes in some district units and frontal organisations. Significant among these is the appointment of coordinators for the five assembly constituencies in East Midnapore district, the home turf of Adhikari who joined the BJP on December 19 with six sitting MLAs, the Lok Sabha MP from Burdwan East and around 20 district TMC leaders.“On January 25, Banerjee appointed coordinators for Tamluk, Panskura East, Kanthi North, Khejuri and Egra assembly segments,” a TMC leader said on condition of anonymity.“On the same day, she appointed 16 vice-presidents, 25 general secretaries and 15 secretaries for the revamped East Midnapore district committee,” he added.Although Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari has been removed from the post of president of the district committee he and his elder son Dibyendu are still Lok Sabha members from the district. In a bid to counter any move by Adhikari to induct more leaders from the TMC, Banerjee has revamped 30 community block committees as well.Since Banerjee will contest the Nandigram seat from where Adhikari was elected in 2016, the TMC has started making preparations. Banerjee has asked senior state leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee to camp in Nandigram next month and carry out a survey of the party's organizational strengths and weaknesses in every community block.“By convening the meeting at her residence Banerjee has made it clear that she wants to send a message. The party’s most crucial decisions have been taken at her residence. Had she intended to address all leaders she would have called them somewhere else. Her residence does not have the space to accommodate all MLAs and district leaders,” said a TMC MP who has been asked to attend the meeting.The BJP is also busy making preparations for the month-end visit of Union home minister Amit Shah. He will visit two districts, North 24 Parganas and Howrah, on January 30 and 31.In North 24 Parganas, Shah will lead a roadshow at Thakurnagar where the headquarters of the Dalit Matua community is located. He will also visit the temple of the Matuas who have demanded implementation of the new citizenship law. BJP’s Shantanu Thakur, a Matua leader, won the Bangaon Lok Sabha seat in 2019, defeating his relative and TMC’s then sitting MP Mamata Bala Thakur. The chief minister has sworn that she will not let the citizenship law be implemented in Bengal.In Howrah, Shah is scheduled to address a rally at Domjur, the constituency of former forest minister Rajib Banerjee. He has won the seat twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-meet-select-tmc-leaders-amid-dissent-among-section-of-mlas-101611769533785.html
27-01-2021||India||Jagan Reddy announces cash incentives for unanimous polls to gram panchayats||With the Supreme Court refusing to stall the elections to local bodies in Andhra Pradesh, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government has now turned its attention on capturing as many gram panchayats as possible unanimously without having to conduct the elections.As part of the strategy, the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday issued an order announcing hefty cash incentives to be given to gram panchayats where sarpanches and ward members are elected unanimously without any contest.According to the order (GO No. 34), the state government will pay a cash incentive ranging from a minimum of ₹5 lakh for a gram panchayat with population of less than 2,000 to a maximum of ₹20 lakh for each gram panchayat with a population of more than 10,000, if the elections are unanimous.“This is not a new practice. It has been there in Andhra Pradesh since 2001. Even in other states like Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, it exists. We have only increased the quantum of cash incentive to encourage unanimous elections, so that the political interference is reduced, violence would be decreased and peace and harmony would exist in the villages,” state panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said.Since the elections of sarpanches and gram panchayats are held on a non-party basis, the incentive would help the elected bodies strengthen the administration at the village level, he said.Though the elections are held on a non-party basis, the YSRC has roped in all the MLAs and MPs into the electioneering to see that ruling party supporters get elected unanimously in a majority of the gram panchayats.Senior YSRC leader and advisor to the state government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy and party general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy held teleconferences with party seniors to ensure that majority of gram panchayats witnessed unanimous elections.Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu called upon party leaders at the grassroot level to see that there is a strong contest in the gram panchayat elections. Naidu, who addressed a meeting of party leaders, asked them not to get scared by threats or intimidated by YSRC leaders.He reminded party workers that during the initial phase of elections to Block Parishads and Zilla Parishads in March 2020, the ruling party had created terror and made attacks on the opposition candidates, forcing them to withdraw from the contest. “Over 25 per cent of the seats in these local bodies were declared unanimous in favour of the YSRC and now in the gram panchayats, it wants to use the same tactics,” he alleged.State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, who held a video conference with district collectors and other officials in the morning, said unanimous elections in gram panchayats were welcome as long as they were voluntary and not forced.“We shall ensure that there would be no forcible unanimous elections. We have appointed a special officer Sanjay Singh, who will look into the prevention of forced unanimous elections,” he said.Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said announcement of cash incentives to the gram panchayats was ridiculous. “Elections are part of the democratic process and people should have a choice to elect their representative,” he said.He said going by this practice, there was no need to conduct the elections to the state assembly as well. “Why should there be elections to the state assemblies? The Centre can announce an incentive of ₹25 crore or ₹30 crore to each assembly constituency and see that the MLAs are elected on a non-party basis unanimously. Does it make any sense?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-announces-cash-incentives-for-unanimous-polls-to-gram-panchayats-101611767305126.html

We reiterated our firm commitment to deepen India-US defence cooperation. We exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest to strengthen our strategic partnership."We reiterated our firm commitment to deepen India-US defence cooperation. We exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest to strengthen our strategic partnership," he said.It is not immediately known whether the eastern Ladakh standoff between India and China was discussed in the talks.Three days back, Austin spoke to his Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi during which China's growing activities in East China Sea figured prominently.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years and in June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-speaks-to-us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-discusses-regional-and-global-issues-101611768859150.html

State NCP president and Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil said that the yatra will involve discussions and meetings with party workers.Patil will be travelling to every assembly constituency and all the districts in phases during the tour starting with the Maoist-infested Gadchiroli district. He said that the objective of the rally is to strengthen the organisation by having a dialogue with party cadres and also create better coordination with Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners - Shiv Sena and Congress - at the local level.In the first phase, Patil will be covering 82 assembly constituencies situated in 14 districts covering Vidarbha region and parts of north Maharashtra and by travelling around 3,000-km in 17 days. During the tour, he will cover Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal, Washim Nagpur, Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon district, where the first phase is going to culminate.Patil is considered one of the most trusted aides of the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and was also appointed as head of the state NCP unit in April 2018 in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections.The MVA in Maharashtra comprises Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress. The three parties forged an alliance post-Assembly elections in 2019 to keep the BJP away from power. The Shiv Sena, which had contested the Assembly election together with the BJP, decided to end the alliance after the saffron party refused to accept their demand for the chief ministe's chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-to-launch-rashtravadi-parivar-samwad-yatra-on-thursday-101611767953014.html

27-01-2021||India||India extends restrictions on flights from UK till February 14||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday extended the restrictions of limited flight operations between India and the UK imposed in a bid to contain the spread of a new strain of coronavirus.“The competent authority has further extended the restrictions of flights between India and UK up to February 14, 2021. The other terms and conditions of the said letter shall remain unchanged,” DGCA wrote in an order to airlines operating between the two countries.On December 21, India joined a growing list of countries to seal off access to people who have been to the UK, suspending all flights to and from the country between December 23 and December 31 in order to stop the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 feared to spread more rapidly.On December 30, India extended the suspension of flights from UK till January 7. The government earlier this month announced it will allow flights to operate between United Kingdom and India from January 7 but with restrictions that include limiting flight operations to 15 weekly flights each per country till January 23.The Centre has put a cap of 30 weekly flights between the two countries with 15 flights each allowed for carriers between the two countries.Before the restrictions were imposed, nearly 70 flights per week were operating between the two countries, according to DGCA with 10 flights operating per day. Airlines including Air India, British Airways, Vistara and Virgin Atlantic were operating on these routes.India has been operating international flights through bilateral transport bubbles with 24 countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), since calling off scheduled overseas flight operations when it announced the nationwide lockdown in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-extends-restrictions-on-flights-from-uk-till-february-14-101611766183131.html
27-01-2021||India||RJD eyes Bengal, Assam assembly polls, considers pacts with TMC, Congress-AIUDF||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will contest the upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam for which the party’s senior leaders will hold talks with Trinamool Congress and Congress–AIUDF alliance, party leaders said Wednesday.The RJD is looking to contest seven to eight seats in West Bengal and 12 seats in Assam.Sources said the RJD’s top leadership has taken a decision to contest the West Bengal polls following much deliberation in the last few weeks after initially being skeptical about the idea. Many within the party had felt that the RJD should not contest the election and rather support secular parties in their fight against the BJP which is the main challenger to the ruling TMC in that state“We want an alliance with TMC as it is our first choice. Our primary goal is to defeat the BJP in Bengal and also in Assam,” said a senior leader, wishing not to be quoted.A delegation of party’s senior led by national principal secretary general Abdul Bari Siddiqui and national general secretary Shyam Rajak will meet TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC’s youth leader Abhishek Banerjee during their visit to Kolkata from January 30 to February 2.“We will meet TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee and then the West Bengal CM to talk of an alliance and seat sharing. We will also hold talks with RJD’s West Bengal unit and all aspiring candidates,” said Shyam Rajak. He said the state unit’s views would be a deciding factor in forging an alliance with like- minded parties.The RJD’s top leaders feel that the TMC, which is facing a big challenge from the BJP, could benefit from an alliance with their party as there are sizable Bihari voters from different caste groups in Kolkata and other districts. “Both the TMC and BJP are eyeing voters from UP and Bihar. In this scenario, RJD’s alliance with secular parties could benefit the secular bloc,” said Siddiqui.Insiders said the RJD, which had contested three to four seats in previous polls, is eyeing seven to eight seats in an alliance with the TMC. Some of the seats identified are in Asansol including Raniganj, a few seats in Kolkata and few in south Bengal in Kharagpur. Sources said in case talks with TMC on seat arrangement does not materialise, the RJD would then approach the Left-Congress alliance.A senior TMC leader, who did not want to be named, said, "In the past the RJD contested seats in Bengal, but as a partner of the Left Front. The same was done by the Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh. Only Mamata Banerjee can take a decision on this."Insiders said the RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav may visit Kolkata in the coming weeks based on the response the party’s delegation gets from the TMC on seat adjustment.The delegation will leave for Guwahati on February 2 to meet representatives of AIUDF (All India United Democratic Front) led by Badriuddin Ajmal on seat sharing and possible alliance.“We want to contest 10-12 seats in Assam. It will be the first major foray of the RJD. In the past the party had contested polls but it did get the desired results,” said another senior leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-eyes-bengal-assam-assembly-polls-considers-pacts-with-tmc-congressaiudf-101611766331292.html
27-01-2021||India||Congress stoking unrest due to poor show in polls, says Javadekar||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday blamed the Congress for wanting to create a “situation of unrest” in the country and said the party has been provoking the farmers agitating against the farm laws.A day after violence broke out in the Capital after a section of protesting farmers marched to the Red Fort, Javadekar said, the government has already held 10 rounds of talks with the farmers and offered to put in abeyance the farm laws for 18 months, but the Congress does not want a resolution to the stalemate.“These laws make an effort to give the farmers an option but the Congress does not want this to happen. I feel those who have lost elections, they are all getting together to spoil the atmosphere in the country,” Javadekar said.To bolster the BJP’s claims that the farmer protests are being stoked by the Congress, the minister said, barring Punjab where the Congress is in power, farmers elsewhere are not agitating against the laws.The Congress, however, pinned the blame for the violence on the BJP. Addressing the media, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said it was a conspiracy to malign farmers and discredit them. “The facts (that) have unfolded over the last 24 hours, a concerted conspiracy, aided and abetted by the Modi Government took place to malign the entire farmers’ movement. A set of people with premeditated motive of violence, who have nothing to do with the ‘Samyukt Kisan Morcha’, they were permitted to enter the premises, the sanctum sanctorum of the Red Fort, the pride of India, climb on to its columns and put a flag there, this is sacrilege. This is unacceptable and those who did it, Deep Sidhu and Gang, they have been seen in the past cohabiting with the Prime Minister of India and Home Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Shri Amit Shah, ample evidence of which is now available in the public domain. Instead of arresting them, then and there, they were permitted to go back.”The BJP retaliated by alleging that that the Congress is stoking unrest because of its poor electoral performance. Javadekar said just as the popularity of the BJP and Prime Minister Modi is continuing to increase, the Left parties and the Congress continue to face rejection in elections.“The Congress is disappointed, it has been losing elections and the Communists are also losing (in elections), therefore in West Bengal they are trying to forge a relationship. They just want to create unrest through violence so that police have to take action or fire and there should be destruction of life and assets. The Congress is following provocative politics now,” he said.The minister who holds the portfolios of information and broadcasting and environment and forests praised the Delhi Police for its handling of the situation on the ground. He said, “The Delhi Police showed exemplary restrain. They were attacked with swords, sticks, stones but the police showed restraint and this is admirable. The whole situation was brought under control within a short span of time.”“Congress and Rahul Gandhi should apologise because such kind of negative politics is not good for the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-stoking-unrest-due-to-poor-show-in-polls-says-javadekar-101611763791237.html
27-01-2021||India||Govt extends restrictions on flights between India and UK till Feb 14||The government on Wednesday extended the restrictions in flights between India and the United Kingdom till February 14 to control the spread of the new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The flight services between the two countries had resumed earlier this months, but with restrictions. The flight services had resumed with limited capacity - 30 flights are operating including 15 each by Indian and UK carriers.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri had tweeted the frequency of flights between India and the UK saying the government will keep reviewing it.After the rapid spread of the new mutant strain of Covid-19 in the UK, India had put an embargo on flight services between the two countries in December last year. Initially, the ban was till December 31, but was later extended to first week of January.The flights from India to the UK started on January 6, while operations from the UK to India began on January 8.After India resumed regular flights to the UK under its air bubble agreement, 70 flights per week have been operated. But the number has been brought down to 30 in the wake of the new Covid-19 strain. The reduced number will stay after civil aviation ministry's order on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the UK variant of the disease has spread to 70 countries.This comes after recent announcement by a group of researchers that the coronavirus strain sweeping Britain could be more deadly as well as more transmissible. Initially, British experts said that their evidence suggested the new strain circulating in the UK - one of several to have emerged internationally in recent months - was between 50 per cent and 70 per cent more transmissible.Last week, however, the government said the new variant could also be 30-40 per cent more deadly, although it stressed the assessment relied on sparse data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-restrictions-on-flights-between-india-and-uk-till-feb-14-101611764998747.html

Amit Shah is the target||The Congress on Wednesday sharpened its attack on the central government for the violence and vandalism on the streets of Delhi during the tractor parade in the national capital a day earlier, accusing the government of conspiring to malign the farmers’ protest.“It is clear that this is a concerted conspiracy, aided and abetted by the Modi government that took place to malign the entire farmers’ movement,” Congress national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said at a press conference on the vandalism during the tractor parade.Thousands of farmers, demanding that the government scrap three new farm laws, drove tractors into the city, defying police orders to stick to the pre-approved routes in breach of the agreement between the police and the farm unions. There were sporadic clashes between the police and the protesters at several locations.Police Commissioner SN Srivastava told reporters on Wednesday that 300 police personnel were injured in the clashes and vowed that he would spare no one found responsible for the violence. He also rejected suggestions that there was an intelligence failure, accusing leaders of the protesting farm unions of breach of trust.Scores of farmers breached the Red Fort too and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, at the first available flag post. Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar called it an insult to the tricolour and blamed the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi for instigating farmers.Surjewala said what had happened was “unacceptable”.Also Read: Farm leaders postpone February 1 march to Parliament“A set of people with the pre-meditated motive of violence, who have nothing to do with the ‘Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’, they were permitted to enter the premises, the sanctum sanctorum of the Red Fort, the pride of India, climb on to its columns and put a flag there, this is a sacrilege.”“Those who did it, Deep Sidhu and gang, have been seen in the past cohabiting with Prime Minister of India and Home Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Shri Amit Shah, ample evidence of which is now available in the public domain.

Shri Amit Shah must be sacked and if the Prime Minister does not sack him, it will be apparent that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a part of this concerted conspiracy to malign the farmers’ movement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-sharpens-attack-on-centre-for-violence-in-delhi-amit-shah-is-the-target-101611764040787.html

Rahul Gandhi wasn't only supporting protest but also instigating it. It was the same during CAA," claimed Javadekar.The Union minister for information and broadcasting said that the Congress holds rallies, they instigate people to take to streets and agitation begins next day. "It happened during this agitation too. They instigated farmers," he said.The Punjab government should have monitored the tractors leaving the state and made preventive arrests of habitual criminals, Javadekar said at a press conference.Referring to the unfurling of a flag from the ramparts of Red Fort, Javadekar said, "India won't tolerate the manner in which the Tricolour was insulted at the Red Fort. The manner in which there was violence in Delhi yesterday, the more it is condemned, the less it is."Pointing to an alleged political motive, Javadekar said that the Congress wants to stoke disturbance in the country."Congress wants to create a situation of unrest in the country. This is what is left of Congress' politics. They are worried as to what will happen to the family-based politics? Thus, Congress is trying to fire up every situation of violence," Javadekar said.The Union minister lauded the Delhi police and said, "Delhi Police displayed remarkable restraint yesterday. They were attacked by swords and even stones were thrown, but they did not retaliate. They brought the situation under control with patience."Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava addressed a press conference on Wednesday where he said that farmer leaders made inflammatory speeches and were involved in the violence during the tractor parade by agitating farmers that left several cops injured and warned that no culprit will be spared.Srivastava also said that farmer unions did not follow conditions set for the tractor rally that was supposed to be held from 12 pm to 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rahul-gandhi-instigated-farmers-protest-claims-prakash-javadekar-101611761379438.html
27-01-2021||India||Congress to field mix of youth and experience for Kerala polls: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the party-led United Democratic Front (UDF) will sweep the upcoming assembly elections in Kerala and the party will field a mix of youth and experienced candidates to achieve this.Addressing a meeting of party office-bearers in Nilambur, part of his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad, he said winning this election was important to the party and the leaders will go all out in the coming days. He said the party will field more youth and women, but experienced people won’t be left out and it will be a proper mix of both.“We will devise a new election strategy. Manifesto committee is a step towards this. Manifesto panel members will meet a cross section of people and it will reflect aspirations of people. If we work systematically we can sweep the election. I am sure we will achieve this,” he said while addressing a meeting of the UDF block office-bearers. Senor leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor heads the manifesto committee with the assembly elections being due in April-May.On a two day visit to his constituency, he will kick-start the party’s election campaign in the state and meet many leaders. There are reports that he will campaign extensively in the state-- his candidature in Wayanad and 2018 Sabarimala stir protesting against the Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women of all ages at the hilltop shrine are considered the main reasons for the landslide win of the UDF in the last Lok Sabha polls in which it bagged 19 out of 20 seats.Earlier in the day, Gandhi interacted with girl students in Wandoor after inaugurating a new block of the Government girls’ higher secondary school. He asked students to be independent, financially and psychologically, and open up to knowledge around them.After the local body election debacle in December, the party had summoned three top leaders of the state-- former CM Oommen Chandy, state president Mullapally Ramachandran and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala to Delhi to formulate a fresh strategy for assembly elections. It also named a 10-member panel to supervise elections in the state.As the polls draw near, many youngsters have started flocking to the party offices seeking seats. Party national spokesperson Shama Mohammad, a woman TV personality, Kerala Students Union state president K M Abijith are some of the names doing the rounds. There are reports that Shama Mohammad will be fielded from one of the seats in Kannur in north Kerala. A doctor by profession, she hails from north Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-field-mix-of-youth-and-experience-for-kerala-polls-rahul-gandhi-101611762922636.html
27-01-2021||India||Odisha govt fails to file charges, IFS officer, son get bail in corruption case||In a major embarrassment for Odisha vigilance department, a vigilance court in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday granted bail to senior Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Kant Pathak and his son Akash Pathak by ‘default’ after the department failed to submit the charge sheet within the mandatory period of 60 days.Pathak, a 1987-batch Indian Forest Service officer, working as Odisha’s additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Plan, Programme and Afforestation), was arrested on November 27 last year after vigilance officials raided his official residence in Bhubaneswar, his office, his apartment and a clutch of other locationsHis son Abhay Pathak who had vehicles like Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier as well as high-end motorcycles registered in his name, was also arrested. The agency which had accused Pathak of amassing disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore ( 435 % of his total income), had claimed that it was the biggest case of disproportionate assets in its history.Though it was incumbent upon the vigilance department to submit fie charge sheet in the case within 60 days of arrest, the agency failed to do it."As per the SC judgment in the case of Rakesh Paul vs state of Assam in 2017, in cases involving Prevention of Corruption Act, the prosecuting agency has to submit the charge sheet within 60 days. That the vigilance department officials failed to submit it by January 25, the due date, shows that the case was a malafide attempt to tarnish the reputation of the senior IFS officer," said Pitambar Acharya, lawyer of Pathak.Acharya said the vigilance department kept the IFS officer and his son behind bars for 60 days without any shred of evidence. "The vigilance department curtailed the liberty of my clients by keeping them in custody on flimsy evidence for 60 days. The entire operation against the Pathaks smacked of vendetta. The department does not have sufficient evidence to file a charge sheet," he alleged.The vigilance department, however, said the disproportionate assets case is not a conventional crime involving private individual."It is an offence committed by a public servant, investigation is based on records and documents and it requires detailed investigation for collection of information relating to assets, income and expenditure from multiple sources. In this case, it is a multi-State investigation, involving major investigation outside the State, which is time consuming. It also requires prosecution sanction from government for submission of charge sheet and cognizance of offence by the court to prosecute accused public servant," the department said in a statement.The vigilance department had alleged that Pathak and his family had made at least 20 trips to different cities of the country through chartered planes at an expenditure of over ₹3 crores during Covid lockdown last year. The vigilance sleuths found hotel bills of more than ₹90 lakhs at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and advance booking amount of ₹20 lakh at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan for the marriage of Pathak's son with the daughter of former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy. The marriage was scheduled for December 11 last year.Following his arrest, the Indian Forest Service officer was suspended from service and subsequently, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik also recommended his compulsory retirement. The recommendation is awaiting the Centre's approval.However, Abhay Pathak and his son Akash Pathak may not get out of jail as they are accused in more cases. The IFS officer and his son are accused in a case of cheating over non-payment of money to a travel agency in Bhubaneswar. The father-son duo had booked chartered flights, five-star hotels and air tickets through the agency which cost around ₹2.78 crore. However, they have paid ₹2.13 crore while an outstanding bill of ₹65,16,233 is yet to be cleared.Akash, who has been accused of conspiring with expelled BJD leader and Gopalpur MLA Pradeep Panigrahy and cheating several job seekers of crores of rupees on the pretext of giving jobs at Tata Motors, has been separately charged by the Crime Branch of Odisha Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-fails-to-file-charges-ifs-officer-son-get-bail-in-corruption-case-101611762235043.html

27-01-2021||India||‘Never said doors for dialogue are closed’: Prakash Javadekar on farmers' protest||Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said at a press conference in Delhi that the government had not shut the door on further discussions with farmer leaders on the contentious farm laws."We have never said that the doors for dialogue are closed. Have you heard? Whenever talks are held, we will let you know," Javadekar said.The government has so far held 11 rounds of talks with the farmers who have been protesting since November 26 last year. All the rounds of talks have failed to break the impasse. The farmers are insisting on repeal of the three laws passed in September, which the government has categorically ruled out. It has instead suggested putting their implementation on hold for 18 months, saying this is the "best offer".Meanwhile, the agitating farmers took to the streets on Tuesday, and a faction of them broke away to protest at the historic Red Fort where clashes between the on-duty police personnel and protestors broke out.When reporters asked the minister about his views of yesterday’s clash the minister said, "I feel the same way as you are feeling.", reported news agency PTI.Many opposition parties criticised the violence, but were quick to blame the Centre for not handling the situation maturely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-doors-for-dialogue-are-closed-prakash-javadekar-on-farmers-protest-101611760435044.html
27-01-2021||India||No one will be spared, says Delhi Police commissioner on R-Day violence; lauds personnel for showing restraint||The Delhi Police on Wednesday said that the farmers violated the conditions agreed upon, which led to violence in the national capital. Addressing a press conference, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava said that the police personnel had all the options, but chose to show restraint.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha had said on January 2 that their supporters will hold a tractor rally on January 26. We contacted the farmer leaders and at least five rounds of meetings were held. We had initially told them not to hold rally on Republic Day, but they refused and insisted on holding a rally that day," said Shrivastava.Also Read: Farm leaders postpone February 1 march to ParliamentThe Delhi Police chief said that farmer leaders were given the option to hold the rally at Kundli-Manesar Expressway with an assurance of security and media coverage."But they insisted on holding the rally in Delhi. So, we agreed on three routes - first from Singhu which had a distance of 63 km, second from Tikri border for 74 km and from Ghazipur for allowed 44 km. Yesterday, Delhi was celebrating Republic Day so we laid down terms and conditions with the permission," said Shrivastava.Giving details about the agreement with the protesters, he said that the farmers were told to start the rally after 12 noon and not to carry any firearms or swords. Shrivastava also said that the number of tractors were capped at 5,000."After giving written permission with these conditions, they gave an understanding. But on the evening of January 25, we learnt that they are not agreeing to these conditions," the Delhi Police chief said."Aggressive people took control of their stage. At 7.30 am, farmers at Singhu started the march. Their leader Satnam Singh Pannu made provocative speeches. The farmers then broke barricades," added Shrivastava.The Delhi top cop also lauded the police force for showing restraint during the violence yesterday."We maintained restraint. We had all options but chose to show restraint. We chose restraint because we did not want loss of lives. There was an agreement between us, the violence was a result of them not following rules. All farmers leaders are responsible for it," said Shrivastava.Giving details about the injuries sustained by the cops, he said that 394 police personnel are injured and some of them are in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of various hospitals."We have taken this case seriously. We have video footage of people who carried out violence. We are using facial recognition system to arrest them and take action. So far, 25 criminal cases have been registered.

27-01-2021||India||Day after violence, farm leaders postpone February 1 march to Parliament||A day after tractor rally called by farmers spiralled out of control and led to violence and chaos in the national capital, farmer leaders on Wednesday decided to postpone their proposed February 1 march to Parliament.The farmers had decided to march to Parliament to mark their protest against the three contentious farm laws passed by the government in September last year.The farmers have now said they will hold jan sabhas (public meetings) and a one-day fast on January 30 to mark their condemnation against Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. The protests will be against the forces that killed Gandhi, the farm leaders said.Stating that most of the farmers were peaceful and a government conspiracy was designed to sabotage the rally, the farm leaders said that despite attempts to break it, 99.9% farmers were peaceful."The rally fell prey to government conspiracy. Some incidents took place. The government put the Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee members in front of blockade put for us but there was no blockade for them," Balbir S Rajewal, Bhartiya Kisan Union (R) said minutes after Delhi Poluce held the presser.However, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has maintained that agitation against three farm laws will continue and has not been called off.Carried out peacefully for nearly two months, the protest called by thousands of farmers turned violent after the tractor rally called by them took unapproved routes to enter into the national capital on Republic Day. This, in turn, halted the city-state till evening, crippling several traffic junctions and forcing the government to snap internet connections in parts of Delhi. The protesters also breached India's Mughal-era monument Red Fort and unfurled a flag of their own atop one of the poles, inviting serious flak from citizens and leaders.The Delhi Police on Wednesday filed at least 25 FIRs in cases related to the violence and chaos.A majority of these cases have been registered under sections of rioting, causing hurt by dangerous weapons, obstructing police from doing their duty, police have also filed some cases under heinous sections of attempt to murder and attempt to culpable homicide in clashes reported from the Red Fort, ITO and Ghazipur.

27-01-2021||India||India to send 5 lakh Covid-19 vaccines to Sri Lanka as part of ‘Vaccine Maitri’||India will on Thursday despatch 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Sri Lanka as grant assistance under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, which has already delivered nearly five million doses to seven countries in the neighbourhood.The delivery of vaccines made by the Serum Institute of India will fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa during their virtual summit last September for all possible support to minimise the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.When external affairs minister S Jaishankar made his first foreign visit this year to Sri Lanka during January 5-7, Colombo had reiterated its request for urgent delivery of vaccines.Since the launch of the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative on January 20, India has provided vaccines to Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Bangladesh (two million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Myanmar (1.5 million doses), Seychelles (50,000 doses), and Mauritius (100,000 doses).Commercial supplies of Covishield have been sent to Brazil, Morocco (two million doses each) and Bangladesh (five million doses), and more supplies are planned for South Africa and Saudi Arabia.Nepal rolled out its vaccination drive on Wednesday, using the made-in-India vaccines. Officials said some 430,000 frontline health workers, security personnel, senior citizens in care homes and prisoners will be covered in the first phase of the drive.“This humanitarian gesture amid the pandemic showcases India’s commitment to its Neighbourhood First policy and the SAGAR doctrine, in which Sri Lanka has a prominent position,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.SAGAR or Security and Growth for All in the Region is the doctrine framed by the Indian government for boosting cooperation across the Indo-Pacific.The Sri Lankan government has finalised its priority list of vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and armed forces personnel, who will be first to receive the vaccine. Sri Lanka approved the emergency use of Covishield, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine, on January 23.The delivery of vaccines as grant assistance is in line with India’s role as the first responder in the region and other efforts to help Sri Lanka overcome the impact of the pandemic. Last year, India extended a $400-million currency swap facility to Sri Lanka to ensure financial stability and gifted about 26 tonnes of essential lifesaving medicines and equipment.India also facilitated the repatriation of several hundred Sri Lankan citizens from Indian cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-send-5-lakh-covid-19-vaccines-to-sri-lanka-as-part-of-vaccine-maitri-101611758590625.html

While the other was Inder Sai Mandavi (75), a resident of Kamkheda village who was beaten to death by the Maoists. Both were killed on the suspicion of being police informers,” said D Shravan, SP Rajnandgaon.The police officials claimed that Maoists are under pressure in the Manpur area of Rajnandgaon district because of anti-naxal operations going on in the region.As per intelligence sources, there are about 200 armed cadres of CPI (Maoist) working in this zone since the last three years. Police believe that since the operations in Bastar increased over the last year, the Maoists were moving towards the MMC zone.On Monday, a contractor, who was engaged in construction work in Maoist-affected Bijapur district of Bastar range was killed by unidentified people.On Sunday, a deputy sarpanch was killed allegedly by Maoists in Kondagaon district of Bastar region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-maoists-kill-2-villagers-in-rajnandgaon-101611759236861.html

Since Dhannipur village falls under the jurisdiction of the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA), there is a need to submit the layout and get clearance from the development authority,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the trust set up by UPSCWB to look after the construction of the Dhannipur complex.The complex is coming up on five acres of land allotted to the board in compliance with the Supreme Court directives in the Ayodhya title case in which the apex court paved the way for construction of Ram temple at the disputed site on November 9, 2019.The Dhannipur project includes a mosque, hospital, museum, library, community kitchen, Indo-Islamic Cultural Research Centre and a publication house. Board officials said the trust was also preparing the list of NOCs needed while initiating the layout clearance process.“There are more than a dozen NOCs from fire, environment, administration, education departments and others for which clearance is required,” an official said.On January 26, the Board launched the Dhannipur project by hoisting the national flag and planting saplings to mark Republic Day celebrations.A team of architects also carried out soil testing to assess the nature of the soil and the density. On December 19, 2020, the trust had released the blueprint of the mosque and other structures designed by Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow-based architect and town planner, whom the trust has hired to design the mosque that would come up in Dhannipur in place of the Babri Masjid.

27-01-2021||India||Bihar amps up Covid vaccination drive, enrols close to 2 lakh frontline staff||The Bihar state government has enrolled 1.94 lakh frontline workers for vaccination against coronavirus disease as it stepped up efforts to complete the exercise of inoculating 4.64 lakh healthcare workers by asking medical colleges to vaccinate on all days, except holidays.Frontline workers are those under the ministry of home affairs, ministry of housing and urban affairs and revenue staff of department of health.The health department had earlier fixed four days a week - Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - for vaccination against Covid-19.It also asked government facilities like district hospitals and below to try and saturate the vaccination of its healthcare workers as soon as possible.The change in vaccination days was done because medical colleges had a larger cohort, said a health official.At the same time, the low vaccination footfall at district and sub-divisional hospitals, community and primary health centres (PHCs) had prompted the government to reduce the number of vaccination days to twice a week.The Guru Gobind Singh Hospital, an urban health centre in Patna City, had 33% footfall, Maner primary health centre (PHC) 36%, Phulwarisharif PHC 39%, Masaurhi sub-divisional hospital (SDH) 40%, Dhanarua PHC 43%, Danapur SDH 44% and Fatuha community health centre (CHC) 49% among the 17 session sites (vaccination centres) in Patna on January 23.In contrast, barring the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (33% footfall), other medical colleges in Patna received better response. The Patna Medical College Hospital registered 85% footfall, All India Institute of Medical Sciences 79% and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences 52% footfall the same day. The day’s overall vaccination percentage in Patna was 64%, which was more than on January 21 (50%).Health facilities have now been asked to speed up the process so that inoculation of frontline workers, which is the next priority group for vaccination, can be taken up soon, said the officer.“To speed up vaccination, 12 new government session sites have been identified for vaccination in Patna. Besides, 22 private healthcare facilities have also been shortlisted where smaller private health facilities will be tagged for vaccination of its healthcare workers,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh.Only three private facilities in Patna - Paras HMRI, Ruban Memorial Hospital and BIG Apollo Hospital - have so far been chosen as session sites for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-amps-up-covid-vaccination-drive-enrols-close-to-2-lakh-frontline-staff-101611757992841.html

Air travel was being allowed as of now under the Air Bubble agreements with various countries and the Vande Bharat scheme.The government also removed the capping on the number of people who could be part of a social, cultural, religious, and political or sports gathering, which until now were limited to a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity, with a ceiling of 200 people in closed spaces; and keeping of the size of the ground/ space in view. The states and union territories have been given freedom to prepare their own SOPs in this regard.Similarly, the government said that now all kind of exhibitions can be held anywhere for which the department of commerce will issue new procedures. Earlier, only B2B exhibitions were given permission by the government.“The main focus of the guidelines (to remain in force till February 28) is to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19 which is visible in the steady decline in the number of active and new cases in the country over the last four months. It is, therefore, emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy focussed on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/SOPs issued by MHA and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW),” the MHA said.The previous guidelines, issued in December and currently in force, had asked all the authorities to be cautious in view of a global surge in the number of infections and emergence of a new variant in the UK.In a letter to all the states and UTs, Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said “As you are aware, the number of active cases in the country has been declining steadily over the past four months. However, there is a need for maintaining caution and strict surveillance so as to fully overcome the pandemic”.He further said, “All activities have already been permitted except for a few which have been permitted with certain restrictions. In view of the improved situation in the country and requests from various stakeholders, those restrictions in the new guidelines are being removed subject to revised SOPs”.Activities like - movement by trains, metro trains, schools, higher educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks, yoga centres and gymnasiums, etc were already allowed by the Centre last year. The states were also given freedom to make rules on any night curfew or other restrictions.Swimming pools had been kept closed for the public due to the fear of the spread of Covid-19 cases. “Now swimming pools will be permitted for use of all, for which a revised SOP will be issued by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports (MoYA&S) in consultation with MHA,” the order said on Wednesday.The cinema halls, facing huge losses, had also been demanding that the number of seats be increased. The government has said that they can have more people watching the shows for which revised SOPs will be issued by information and broadcasting ministry.Bhalla said, “The essence behind the graded re-opening and progressive resumption of activities is to move ahead.”Containment zones will continue to be monitored carefully and state governments have been asked to take all necessary measures to promote Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and ensure wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.There will be no restriction on any inter-state and intra-state movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mha-s-new-guidelines-swimming-pools-open-for-all-more-people-in-theatres-101611757319448.html

The air force had ordered a total of 36 warplanes at a cost of ₹59,000 crore from France in September 2016. This delivery will take the number of Rafales in the IAF’s inventory to 11.The second batch of the IAF’s three Rafale fighter jets had reached the Jamnagar airbase in early November last year before they flew to their homebase in Ambala. The first batch of five Rafale jets had reached the Ambala air base on July 29 after which they were formally inducted into the IAF in an event attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, French defence minister Florence, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and air force chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.Watch: 'IAF pilots able to adapt quickly to new Rafale jets': CDS Gen RawatAfter the Russsian Sukhoi Su-30MKI that entered service in June 1997, the Rafale fighters are the first imported jets to join the IAF in 23 years. The jets are capable of carrying out ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. They can carry almost 10 tonnes of weapons. The India-specific enhancements on the Rafales include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-muscle-to-iaf-with-3-more-rafales-landing-today-101611754867932.html
27-01-2021||India||India sticking to S-400 deal with Russia despite threat of possible US sanctions||India is sticking to its guns on the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems despite reports of possible US sanctions, an issue with the potential for becoming an early irritant with the new Biden administration.India’s decision to acquire the S-400, instead of other air defence systems offered by the West, was based on a thorough evaluation and national security requirements, including already delayed plans to create a ballistic missile defence shield over key cities, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The lingering standoff with China in Ladakh has seen India deploy a raft of weapons and systems in the sector, including hardware bought from the US, Russia and France, to strengthen its military deployments.“India’s strategic interests are supreme and it is for us to decide what weapons we buy and from whom to pursue those interests. If the US has concerns about procurements from Russia, the latter is also upset over military equipment we are importing from the US,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.“We buy platforms factoring in the security threats we face,” the official said, adding the US and Russia understand India’s complex security challenges.A second official, who too declined to be named, acknowledged India is walking a fine line in defence cooperation with Russia and the US, which are both strategic partners.“But the more important point is the country’s independent foreign policy and strategic autonomy to decide defence purchases in line with national security interests,” the second official said.Though India has been procuring US military hardware in growing numbers, including Apache and Chinook helicopters and P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft, about 60% of the inventory of the three services continues to be of Russian-origin.The US has sanctioned its NATO ally Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for taking delivery of the S-400, and this was mainly due to concerns that Western platforms operating in the same environment as the S-400 would provide Russia valuable data on how to defeat those systems, said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“The fact that Turkey didn’t escape CAATSA sanctions suggests the US is very concerned about the S-400 system, and it's probably not just junk. India's insistence to take delivery of its first S-400 batteries later this year therefore sets the Biden administration potentially on a collision course on the sanctions question with India,” Narang said.Russia is set to train the first group of Indian military specialists in operating the S-400 and the first batteries are expected by September.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur of the Centre for Airpower Studies said no other country, no matter how friendly, can have a veto on India’s defence purchases. “The US is a valued partner and would, rather should, understand India's interests. Washington's geo-political necessities cannot override India's imperatives and one is sure no action would be taken that hurts New Delhi's position,” he said.There are also concerns that US sanctions, even if seen as a slap on the wrist, will revive old concerns about America’s reliability as a defence partner and bring back memories of punitive sanctions after India’s 1998 nuclear tests that set back several defence programmes, including one to develop the light combat aircraft (LCA). The US had then held back engines to power the LCA.Narang said it may be “very hard” for the US to apply different standards to India than it did to Turkey, which hosts American nuclear weapons. “If India does not receive a waiver, it is possible the basket of sanctions – over which there is some leeway – may be simply symbolic, and not painful,” he said.“Applying even symbolic sanctions, it seems to me, would be counterproductive. It would not only fail to deter India from purchasing Russian military equipment, it would likely accelerate it and empower those in Delhi who have been sceptical of the reliability of the US as a defence partner,” Narang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sticking-to-s-400-deal-with-russia-despite-threat-of-possible-us-sanctions-101611754305999.html

27-01-2021||India||Telangana may raise retirement age of government employees to 60||The retirement age of all government employees will be raised to 60 years from 58, if the Telangana government implements the recommendations of the Pay Revision Commission.The three-member PRC headed by retired IAS officer CR Biswal, constituted by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government in May 2018 to look into the revision of salaries of employees and pensioners, submitted its report to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the first week of January, but it was made available to the employees only on Wednesday.Incidentally, it is the first PRC constituted by the Telangana government after the formation of the state in June 2014. The earlier pay revision was done in 2015, based on the recommendations of the PRC constituted during the combined Andhra Pradesh government in 2013.In his party’s election manifesto, KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known, promised to the employees that he would enhance the age of superannuation of the state government employees from 58 to 61 years.After coming to power, the chief minister entrusted the issue to the PRC. The panel has recommended that the retirement age could be raised to 60 years, on par with the Central government employees.The PRC also recommended a fitment of 7.5 per cent on basic pay. Since the DA had been merged with effect from July 1, 2018, the revised pay scales come into operation from the same day. “The government may take a view on the date from which the financial benefit would accrue keeping in view its resource position and the various demands thereon,” the report said.While continuing the existing practice of following the Central government in sanctioning DA twice a year, the PRC recommended that the release of DA instalments would also be done along the lines of the Centre.“For every one per cent increase in DA sanctioned by the Central government, the DA to be sanctioned by the state to its employees would be 0.910 % for the DA starting from January, 2019,” the panel said.The PRC, however, suggested a decrease in the percentage of house rent allowance from 30%, 20%, 14.5% and 12% in case of four categories of places of posting (based on population) to 24%, 17%, 13% and 11%, respectively.The body recommended that the Child Care Leave (CCL) be enhanced from 90 days to 120 days in the case of normal children. In case of disabled children, the CCL will be enhanced from 90 days to two years, on par with the Central government. This leave will be granted with 100 per cent of the salary for the first 365 days and 80 per cent of the salary for the next 365 days.For cashless treatment under EHS,it has recommended collecting 1% of basic pay from employees and 1% of basic pension from the pensioners and creating a ‘separate reserve’. The expenditure shall be met from the above reserve initially and the same shall be recouped from the reimbursement by the Government, after scrutiny of bills as per the existing rules, it said.The panel also recommended removal of the facility for reimbursement of tuition fee to the children of the employees. However, an incentive amount of ₹2000 per annum per pupil, subject to a maximum of two children only be allowed to the employees who have admitted their children in government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-may-raise-retirement-age-of-government-employees-to-60-101611754205249.html

The father of the accused was also arrested for allegedly feigning ignorance about his son’s act and subsequently pressurising the victim to opt for religious conversion.A relative of the victim alleged that one Abdul Rahman aka Golu, 22, had raped the girl when she was alone at her house on January 11 and also filmed the act. The following day, the accused allegedly blackmailed the victim into having physical relations by threatening to upload the video clip on social media if she didn’t agree, police said.According to the police the girl told her parents about the incident a few days ago after which they filed a complaint against Abdul as well as his father Mohammad Kalim on January 25.The survivor’s parents alleged that the father of the accused tried to save his son and also tried to convert their daughter.In his complaint, the father of the girl alleged that when they requested Kalim to ask his son (accused) to delete the video clip, he reportedly told him that his son would marry the girl after her religious conversion.Additional superintendent of police, Ballia, Sanjay Kumar said that a case against accused Abdul Rahman had been registered under section 452 (trespass), section 376 (rape) of IPC and 3/4/17/18 Protection of children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance.“He has also been booked along with his father under section 3 and 5 of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance.

27-01-2021||India||Tractor rally violence: Rakesh Tikait, 6 other farmer leaders named in FIR||At least seven farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, VM Singh, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, Tejender Singh Virk and Rishipal Singh Ambawat, have been named in a first information report (FIR) registered at the Ghazipur police station on Wednesday in connection with Tuesday’s violence near the Ghazipur-border during the “Kisan Tractor Parade”.The FIR has been registered under 11 different Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), two Sections of Prevention to Damage to Public Property Act, two sections of Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act. The charges in the FIR pertain to rioting with deadly weapons, attempt to murder, stopping public servant from performing their duties and criminal conspiracy apart from violations of Covid-19 guidelines. A sub-inspector (SI) of the Ghazipur police station, Sanjeev Kumar, is the complainant in the case.According to Kumar’s complaint, farmers under the leadership of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait, Tejender Singh Virk, VM Singh, national organiser of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samnvaya Samiti, BKU’s Jagrat Singh Bajwa, Rishipal Singh Ambawat, Harpal Singh, Vinod Kumar, president of Jat Mahasabha, and other were protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border since November 26. To stop them from moving into Delhi, barricading was done at the Delhi border and Delhi Police personnel along with paramilitary forces staff remained deployed round-the-clock, he has said in the FIR.“These people (leaders) along with their supporters were involved in pushing and shoving, sloganeering and forcibly entering Delhi. However, we maintained patience and controlled the situation by urging them to remain calm. Whenever Rakesh Tikait used to go for meetings with the government, the police staff of the Ghazipur police station escorted him,” the FIR says.According to the FIR, the farmer unions declared that they will carry out a tractor rally on January 26 in Delhi if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. They had also asked their supporters in nearby states to reach Delhi and because of that the number of protesting farmers was increasing every day. The number of those involved in ruckus was more, the FIR said.“Farmer unions were given conditional permission for their proposed tractor rally. The conditions included a specific number of tractors and farmers, routes to follow, timing and that they will not carry weapons and damage public property. The agreed timing was between 12 pm and 5 pm,” the sub-inspector has said in the FIR.SI Kumar further says in the FIR that his duty was at Ghazipur chicken market from 6 am on January 26 and senior officers sent him and other police staff onto the flyover at 9 pm. The protesters in a well-thought out conspiracy began breaking the barricades on the road with their tractors from 9 am, much before the scheduled time, in order to enter Delhi. Some barricades were damaged, he said.“The protesters on the tractors were carrying sticks, iron pipes and swords, and shouting slogans. Station House Officer (SHO), Ghazipur, through loudspeaker made announcements but the farmers ignored his directions and started moving ahead by breaking the barricades with their tractors. The deployed security personnel tried to stop them but the farmers with intent to kill us rammed the barricades and in the process some personnel suffered injuries. As per their conspiracy, the protesters had pasted papers on the registration numbers of their vehicles,” Kumar has said in the FIR.“The protesting farmers on the directions of their leaders, and in a well-planned conspiracy deliberately defied the conditions of the tractor rally permission, and tried to kill me and other police staff by ramming the barricades with their tractors and entered Delhi with deadly weapons. A legal action should be taken against the hooligans and the farmer leaders. They also violated the Covid-19 guidelines by not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing,” it further says in the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tractor-rally-violence-rakesh-tikait-6-other-farmer-leaders-named-in-fir-101611751451652.html

The protestors were not Khalistanis and Pakistanis, they were government officials selected by Amit Shah.”“One of the accused was found to be close to BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Sunny Deol and has pictures with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a sponsored programme of the Central government to derail the farmers’ protest in Delhi,” said Singh.The ruling BJP hit back at Singh and accused him of playing politics with Tuesday’s events.“Anti-social elements created havoc in the name of farmers. Police personnel were beaten up brutally. They insulted our country. Rather condemning the act of protestors, Digvijaya Singh is doing dirty politics,” Madhya Pradesh’s medical education department minister Vishwas Sarang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-of-orchestrated-violence-in-delhi-s-tractor-rally-says-digvijaya-singh-101611751089561.html
27-01-2021||India||BJP planted stooge Deep Sidhu to create chaos in tractor rally: AAP||in The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday alleged that the BJP planted its "stooge" actor Deep Sidhu to create "chaos" in farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day.The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal the three new agriculture laws descended into anarchy as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.Clashes broke out in multiple places, leading to violence in well-known landmarks of Delhi and its suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the Republic Day.Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu has been blamed by the farmer union leaders and politicians for inciting violence during the tractor rally.At a press conference, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha, while questioning the connection between Sidhu and BJP, showed several photos purportedly of the actor with various BJP leaders."The BJP planted their stooge Deep Sidhu to create chaos in farmers' tractor parade," Chadha said.Sidhu was among protesters at the Red Fort where flags were put up.He was an aide of Deol when the latter contested from the Gurdaspur seat in Punjab during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Deol, who is now a BJP MP, had distanced himself from Sidhu in December last year after he joined the farmers' agitation.Amid a massive outrage over protesters hoisting a religious flag at the Red Fort during the tractor rally on Republic Day, Sidhu defended their action, saying they did not remove the national flag and had put up the 'Nishan Sahib' as a symbolic protest.The 'Nishan Sahib' flag, a symbol of Sikh religion, is seen at all gurdwara complexes.In a video posted on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Sidhu had claimed that it was not a planned move and that they should not be given any communal colour or dubbed as fundamentalists or hardliners.He had also stated that the national flag was not removed from the flagpole at the Red Fort and that nobody raised a question over the country's unity and integrity.Sidhu, who had been associated with the farmers' agitation for the last many months, said "anger flares up" in a mass movement like this when the genuine rights of people are ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-planted-stooge-deep-sidhu-to-create-chaos-in-tractor-rally-aap-101611750072576.html

27-01-2021||India||Withdrawing support from farmers' stir, says farmer leader; he doesn't have authority, says AIKSCC||A day after the violence in Delhi by protesting farmers, a leading group spearheading the farmers’ agitation, has said that it is withdrawing from the stir."We can't carry forward a protest with someone whose direction is something else. So, I wish them the best but Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan is withdrawing from this protest right away," said Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (RKMS) and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) leader VM Singh, according to news agency ANI."I have nothing to do with the protest which is being led by them and over here being represented by Rakesh Tikait on their behalf," added Singh.He also said that the protest will continue, but not in this form. "We have not come here to get people martyred or beaten up," said the RKMS leader.However, minutes after Singh's announcement, AIKSCC national secretary Avik Saha said that the organisation has not withdrawn support from farmers' stir."AIKSCC has not withdrawn support to the farmers’ agitation as stated by AIKSCC ex-convenor VM Singh to a section the media. VM Singh has no authority to issue such a statement," said Saha.The farmers who had the permission from Delhi Police to take out a tractor rally deviated from the approved route of the parade and marched towards central Delhi from various border points. Hundreds of tractors were seen on the roads of Delhi, with farmers riding them clashing with the police deployed in the area due to Republic Day.The farmers broke the police barricades, attacked the cops with sticks and damaged the buses parked on the street. According to Delhi Police, 86 cops were injured in Tuesday's violence. The police have registered 25 FIRs which have names of various farmer leaders.Leaders cutting across political spectrum had condemned the violence, but many of them blamed the central government for not listening to the farmers, who have been protesting near Delhi for more than two months now.Punjab chief minister Amarinder appealed to the farmers on Tuesday to return to their sit-ins at border areas. He also said that the violence will "negate the goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers".Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) - the umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting at the Delhi border - had also regretted the "undesirable and unacceptable events" and dissociated ourselves from the violence. It had also said that some "anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement".The farmers have been protesting against three central farm laws since November 26. The farmers say that the laws, which have been projected as historic by the Centre, will prove to be detrimental for them.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-here-to-get-people-martyred-farmer-body-rkms-leader-withdraws-from-stir-101611747436293.html

27-01-2021||India||No need to assess Mollem projects’ cumulative impact: Goa minister||Goa Minister for Environment Nilesh Cabral has said that there is no provision to cumulatively assess the potentially damaging effects of the three linear infrastructure projects that are cutting through the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park as the projects are “independent” in nature. Replying to a question by legislator Rohan Khaunte, Cabral also said that there was no question of reviewing the projects because the projects were being proposed and admitted “by following all rules and guidelines of [the] Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.”“There is no provision to assess the cumulative impact of the projects, as they are independent in nature and proposed by different user Agencies at different time intervals,” Cabral said in his reply before the Goa Legislative Assembly. Also Read: Goa infra projects: Members of wildlife board allege incorrect minutesCabral’s reply comes even as environmentalists and activists, including the independent non-official expert members of the Goa State Wildlife Board, demanded that the impact of the projects be cumulatively assessed rather than individually owing to the concurrent execution.In a letter to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court, the expert members of the Wildlife Board had demanded that the Board review the clearances to the projects since they were dubiously granted clearance without studying the cumulative impact of the projects. “Wildlife clearance was sought for every individual project to dilute the figurative requirement of diversion of forest within the same protected area network. Thus, the impact of these projects, especially the cumulative impact on biodiversity does not find mention. The State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire state,” the members had written in their letter to the CEC. “The three proposed linear projects will further fragment the already fragmented area, most of which is pristine and virgin in nature. The State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire State,” the members had said. In reply to a separate question asked by Khaunte, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, who holds the forest portfolio, has said that the projects were being implemented by following “the complete procedure as prescribed by the MoEF&CC while obtaining the forest clearance and wildlife clearance.”The proposed projects now only need a Forest Clearance under FCA, 1980 which is yet to be realised.“All three proposals for diversion of forest area for non-forestry purposes as per the provisions of Forest Conservation Act, 1980 are still under process. There is no land acquisition in the protected area,” Sawant said. The standing committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests in April last year granted its approval to the diversion of forest land from notified wildlife sanctuaries in Mollem along Goa’s eastern frontier with Karnataka for three projects -- the doubling of an existing railway line between Hubli in Karnataka and Vasco da Gama in Goa, the expansion of the national highway 4A between Belgaum in north Karnataka and Goa and a power line. The approvals were met with protests demanding that the projects be scrapped for environmental reasons and because it is believed that the completion of the projects will facilitate the transport of more coal. These clearances have been challenged before the Bombay high court and the Central Empowered Committee on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich biodiversity of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-to-assess-mollem-projects-cumulative-impact-goa-minister-101611746735424.html

Villagers later found her remains in the forest, 300 metres from the village.This leopard ha previously attacked three women, including two in Almora and one in neighbouring Pauri Garhwal district.

Also, as the lone farmer who died during Tuesday's episode in Delhi hailed from the neighbouring district of Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, we didn't want any law and order situation in US Nagar," said Kumar.He also said that all the district police departments have been asked to take stringent action against anyone found indulging in any violence."There was an incident earlier in US Nagar in which some farmers on tractors tried to crush our personnel. We had then registered a case and nabbed the accused in it without sparing anyone. We will follow the same line if anyone tries to break law and order," he said.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) US Nagar district, Daleep Singh Kunwar warned of strict action against rumours mongers who claimed that the 27-year-old farmer who died in Delhi on Tuesday was from the district.Kunwar issued the warning after some social media posts about the dead farmer, which the officer said posed a threat to the law and order situation in the district.Kunwar said, “Rumours were spreading that the farmer who died during tractor parade hailed from Rudrapur and had been killed in police firing. This kind of rumours could have spoiled the peace of the district, hence we decide to issue an appeal to the public to stay away from such rumours and warning to rumour mongers on social media.”“Apart from this, our social media cell is monitoring the social media platforms round the clock. Any person involved in such crime will be dealt with strictly,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-police-on-alert-in-4-districts-after-violence-in-delhi-tractor-rally-101611744013405.html

27-01-2021||India||All you need to know about Nishan Sahib, the flag hoisted by farmers on Red Fort||Farmers' tractor march on Tuesday took an unexpected turn when a group of agitators entered the Red Fort and unfurled a religious flag 'Nishan Sahib' on the monument causing a major stir. Many farmers leaders and unions have disassociated themselves from the turn of events that took place on the 72nd Republic Day of India. Actor Deep Sidhu has been accused of instigating the farmers for the deviation in the route as well as for hoisting the flag over the Mughal monument that drew flak from politicians across all parties.Regarding the flag that they hoisted, fake news spread like wildfire that the flag was a 'Khalistani flag', which is associated with separatists' demand of Khalistan.Amid all the chaos, what is Nishan Sahib?1. The triangular saffron coloured flag furling outside a Gurdwara on a steel pole covered with saffron-colored cloth is most popularly associated with Guru Hargobind.2. The flag also has an insignia called Khanda in the middle. The Khanda includes two swords and a chakra. The two swords are considered to represent miri-piri.3. The flag and the insignia have appeared to have undergone various changes under Guru Hargobind. The Guru's standard was saffron, 'a colour perhaps borrowed from the Rajputs and one that became identified with self-sacrifice and martyrdom, particularly in the Khalsa panth,' as per the Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies.Also Read | ‘Dirty conspiracy’: Farmers’ leaders accuse Centre of ‘sabotaging’ peaceful stir4. Miri-piri resembles the relation of Akal Takht with the Harmandir. Akal Takht was developed under the supervision of Guru Hargobind. In the early seventeenth century, the Akal Takht was the site where the Guru and his courtiers would meet to discuss issues of justice as well as strategic response to the Mughals. "The Akal Takht was the locus of miri (temporal authority); the Harmandir the epicentre of piri (spiritual authority)". The flag hence resembled the authority of the Guru and marked the place of dharamshala/Gurudwara.5. While the flag has undergone significant changes through the Sikh history, the essential 'Ik Onkar', the opening of 'Mul Mantar', declaring the unity of the Eternal Guru remained intact.6. The nishan sahib transformed into the symbol of sikh sovereignty and identity. The religious flag underwent more changes in the nineteenth century as the flag started resonating the Khalsa slogan degh, tegh and fateh (cooking pot, sword and victory.)7. The nishan sahib often commands the respect and reverence of the Sikhs as the marker of gurudwara, "the sign which leads them towards the Darbar of the historical Gurus and of the Eternal Guru’ in which truth, justice, and sovereignty have been established".(Inputs from Oxford handbook of Sikh Studies by Pashaura Singh and Louis E.

He is doing so because if I resign his government will not be sustained in the state," the Haryana MLA had said.The Haryana MLA has staunchly backed farmers in their protest as he also carried out a tractor rally from Punjab's Ambala earlier this month.The legislator said his party was continuously participating in this protest and had assigned duties to all party workers to help the agitating farmers be it from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra. "Our tents have been set up everywhere to assist farmers," he said.The protests - longest such demonstration in decades of independent India - have entered their third month and are showing no signs of abating. The farmers are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inld-legislator-abhay-singh-chautala-resigns-over-farm-laws-speaker-accepts-101611742587232.html

They were not part of the organisations which jointly undertook the struggle,” the statement further said....against the peaceful struggle of other farmer organizations, who had set up their own separate protest site after 15 days of beginning of this Farmers' agitation. They were not part of the organisations which jointly undertook the struggle: Samyukt Kisan MorchaThe SKM is an umbrella organisation of several farmers’ unions which have been leading protests against the farm laws since last November. The tractor parade on Republic Day was announced on January 2 and, last week, the Delhi Police gave a go ahead after several rounds of talks with farmers’ leaders, who repeatedly assured that the march would be a “peaceful” one. The permission was given with several restrictions, including march from one route each from the three borders - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - which have emerged as the epicentre of these protests.However, the KMSC leaders insisted on carrying out the rally on Delhi's Outer Ring Road, as demanded originally by the SKM. The night before the rally, they decided to march on the Ring Road, despite not getting permission from the police.The SKM has also pointed fingers at actor Deep Sidhu, who was reportedly present at the KMSC meeting on Monday night. Sidhu, once an aide of Bollywood actor and now BJP MP Sunny Deol, was among the protesters who unfurled a religious flag at the Red Fort on Tuesday. His photo with Deol and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also went viral post the Republic Day violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dirty-conspiracy-farmers-leaders-accuse-centre-of-sabotaging-peaceful-stir-101611741514594.html
27-01-2021||India||Gurnam Charuni: The firebrand behind the farmers’ protests||The political challenge to the Modi government on three new agricultural laws would not have been possible without the staunch efforts of one man -- 60-year-old Gurnam Singh Charuni, the leader of the Haryana unit of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a popular farmers’ organisation.The two-month-long agitation by farmers, who say the laws will help corporate giants at the expense of growers, has morphed into a mass movement due to the grit of many well-organised farm unions, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. But Charuni has played an outsized role in it.A firebrand, Charuni organised one of the first meetings in September in Haryana’s Pipli village to protest against the three laws. The next milestone came when the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 200 farmer unions, gave a call for a march to Delhi on November 26-27.The decision to forge a larger alliance took place at a meeting a month earlier, on October 27, at Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, which was attended by several farm union leaders, including VM Singh, a former convenor of the AIKSCC, 78-year-old Balbir Singh Rajewal, a veteran farmer leader from Punjab and Charuni, who was the face of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana.“It was Charuni who went from village to village, day and night, and explained the need to make the agitation bigger and bigger. This was after it was clear that thousands of farmers would move to Delhi,” said Sandeep Topra, an aide to Charuni who leads the BKU’s youth wing.Also read | Akhilesh Yadav accuses BJP of turning resentment of farmers into angerCharuni contested the 2019 Assembly election from Ladwa constituency in Haryana’s Kurukshetra region, campaigning on a mix of farmers’ issues and matters of local development but had lost. His wife Balwinder Kaur had also fought and lost the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as an Aam Aadmi Party candidate.Charuni’s election affidavit, a statutory requirement, described him as a farmer and a commission agent dealing in trade of farm produce.Charuni’s native village, Charuni Jattan, lies in the Shahbad area of the Kurukshetra district. His derives his surname from his native village, a customary practice.Charuni is an iconoclast. In the middle of the march to Delhi on November 25, farm unions had decided unanimously to sit peacefully on the Punjab-Haryana border due to resistance from the government and a harsh crackdown by Haryana police.Charuni gave a war cry, defied the sit-in plan, and instead pulled apart barricades in Ambala to reach Delhi with thousands of followers.On January 18, he broke ranks with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the organiser of the protests, to mobilise political parties in favour of the agitation, much to the chagrin of other unions, who wanted to keep the agitation apolitical.This prompted the Samyukt Kisan Morcha to issue a statement, saying efforts by Charuni to organise an all-party meeting on the farm laws were not “unauthorised” by it and this didn’t figure in its official agenda.Charuni’s spokesperson Sandeep Topra said Charuni had not violated any protocol of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “If political parties reach out and come to Charuni for a meeting, how can he say no? He hasn’t shared any stage with political parties.”The firebrand farm leader had no qualms in breaking away from the consensus, as long as it strengthened the farmers’ cause.Thousands of farmers are demanding that the government scrap three laws to ease restrictions on farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stock for future sales and lay down a national framework on contract farming based on written agreements.“These laws will break the backbone of farmers. They will lead to distress sale of farm produce and make us bow to big corporations,” Charuni said.After thousands of farmers reached the borders of Delhi on November 27, the Union government asked the protestors to move to Burari, a designated site on Delhi’s outskirts before official talks on the farmers’ demands could begin.Charuni staunchly opposed it, likening Burari to an open jail. Charuni is popularly described as a fearless farm leader adept at winning street battles on farmers’ issues. He has been at the forefront of a long agitation for timely payment of cane prices to sugarcane farmers.Charuni was responsible for bringing Haryana’s farmers into the ongoing agitation, without which the protests could not have moved out of Punjab and grow into a mass uprising. The agitation has put to test the Modi government’s ability to push through economic reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gurnam-chaduni-the-firebrand-behind-the-farmers-protests-101611741694846.html

I think no one should do politics and it is not right to do politics on this kind of violence," Fadnavis said just before meeting Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.He was responding to a query on NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar blaming the Centre for violence during the farmers' tractor rally in Delhi.Asked if the farmers' protest has lost its credibility after the violence witnessed in Delhi here, the senior BJP leader said, "Those who are leading the protest should introspect why such an incident happened."Fadnavis called on Tomar and discussed Maharashtra-related issues.Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary was also present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-should-do-politics-over-violence-fadnavis-on-r-day-farmers-protest-101611738469721.html
27-01-2021||India||Farmer unions blame KMSC for digressing from route, taking rally to Red Fort||The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which has a considerable hold in Punjab’s Majha region and some districts of Malwa and Doaba regions, has been under fire for choosing Delhi’s Outer Ring Road to conduct its tractor march on Republic Day. KMSC is the only farmer union which remained adamant on holding the march on the Outer Ring Road despite the agreement of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)—the umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting at the Delhi border—with the Delhi Police to take out the marches on four other routes. SKM blamed the KMSC for misguiding the farmers and resorting to violence. SKM’s founding member Darshan Pal said the KMSC was responsible for the chaos. Several leaders of other farmer organisations, which have been protesting at the Delhi borders, have also condemned the KMSC. Also Read: Many Delhi routes restricted day after farmers’ tractor rally violence“Only KMSC was responsible for diverging from the route. It was this organisation’s announcement to go inside the national capital. This organisation is not a part of 32 unions belonging to Punjab. They came to protest at the Delhi border several days after our agitation started,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) President Balbir Singh Rajewal. KMSC’s president is Satnam Singh Pannu. A group of farmers led by Pannu had parted its way from Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC) around one-and-a-half decades ago. Pannu along with other members of Communist Party of India (Marxist) had formed KSC. Pannu formed KMSC after his differences emerged with KSC’s state convener Kawalpreet Singh Pannu in 2007.Kawalpreet Singh Pannu said, “KMSC, Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana have left no stone unturned to defame the peaceful agitation of farmers. KMSC deliberately diverted the route and allowed the protestors to reach the Red Fort. Two farmers have died at the Red Fort and we hold KMSC responsible for this.”The KMSC has also been flayed on social media for distancing itself from the decision of the other farmer unions. A mob which stormed the Red Fort and hoisted two flags—one of a farmer union and another of saffron colour—was reportedly diverted from the march held by the KMSC at the Outer Ring Road. KMSC’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “When we went towards the Ring Road, we broke three or four barricades. Tear gas was used by the police. We are thankful to Delhi’s people who spent lakhs of rupees to serve food to the protestors. We are also thankful to those who have returned to the Delhi borders after the march.”He said, “Through video messages, we had already been creating awareness that some outsiders would do mischief. Our organisation had no intention to move towards the Red Fort. It was our programme to hold the march peacefully on the Ring Road. Some of the farmers were coaxed by some anti-social elements. But, if they had gone there, what have they done? Our national flag was unfurling there and they didn’t disrespect it. Only Nishan Sahib (Sikh triangular flag that is hoisted outside most gurdwaras) was installed there. When we came to know that some of our farmers had gone there, we appealed to them and ensured their return. The small thing is being exaggerated to defame the agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-blame-kmsc-for-digressing-from-route-taking-rally-to-red-fort-101611737434692.html
27-01-2021||India||BJP MLA blames Sonia Gandhi, Rahul for tractor parade violence, Cong hits back||BJP MLA Surendra Singh has alleged that violence during the farmers' tractors parade in the national capital had taken place on the directions of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and demanded that a case of sedition be lodged against those involved in the violence.Hitting back, Uttar Pradesh Congress media coordinator Lalan Kumar charged that the BJP government was responsible for the violence and said the BJP MLA's statement shows his "mental bankruptcy".The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.Speaking with reporters on Tuesday night, the BJP MLA said, "The act of violence during tractor parade is condemnable. A case of sedition should be lodged and strict action should be taken against those involved in the act".Asking the party leadership to take strict action against those involved, Singh alleged, "There is foreign hand behind the violence. The incident had taken place on directions of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Congress leaders not expressing any regret over the incident proves that."Reacting strongly to the allegation, Kumar charged "The BJP government, Home Ministry, police and intelligence agencies were responsible for whatever happened during the tractor parade"."For bringing bad name to the agitation some persons intruded in the guise of farmers. Deep Sidhu is an example. Sidhu was representative of BJP MP Sunny Deol...BJP should tell how Sidhu is related with it and what punishment will he be getting for whatever he did at Red Fort," Kumar said.Deol has said he has no link with Sidhu.Expressing anguish over the violence in the national capital during the farmers' tractor parade, the Congress had said on Tuesday that there is no place for such incidents in a democracy, even as it urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "shun arrogance" and repeal the three farm laws.UP Minister for Backward Welfare, Anil Rajbhar had said on Tuesday that "those protesting in Delhi are not farmers but middlemen-type people, who stand exposed after the incident.""The work of farmers is not to protest on roads with their tractors. They always work in their fields. They are protesting laws passed in Parliament," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-blames-sonia-gandhi-rahul-for-tractor-parade-violence-cong-hits-back-101611734729719.html

The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border site that killed 20 Indian troops.TikTok had committed to spend $1 billion in the region. Before the ban it had become one of the fastest-growing social media apps in India, once its largest market in terms of users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-tiktok-ban-bytedance-says-cutting-india-workforce-unsure-of-comeback-101611734497947.html

Let IB's stand be filed on record before this court categorically stating whether any report was prepared by it in 2009 or shortly thereafter (regarding the Mumbai train blasts case) and placed before the then Minister of Home Affairs. Affidavit be filed in four weeks and rejoinder thereto in two weeks thereafter," the court said and listed the matter for hearing on April 13.In the earlier matter, the high court had said the Central Information Commission (CIC) "erroneously" concluded that the information sought by Siddique did not pertain to allegations of corruption or human rights violation and asked it to consider his request afresh.However, before the CIC, the IB stated that there was no such report as claimed by the convict and the commission, thereafter, dismissed his plea on June 11, 2019.Siddique, in his plea filed through advocate Arpit Bhargava, has sought setting aside of the June 11, 2019 order of CIC claiming that the CIC took the decision by "blindly" trusting IB's statement that there was no report of 2009.Bhargava told the court that the IB filed an affidavit in July 2019 before CIC stating no such report existed only after the plea was dismissed.The IB, represented by central government counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate C K Bhatt, opposed the plea saying Siddique's claims were based on news reports.They also told the high court that the CIC had accepted the IB stand that there was no such report.Siddique, presently lodged in the Nagpur Central Jail, has claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case which amounts to violation of his human rights and therefore, he needed the IB report which purportedly called for review of the evidence in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-there-is-no-2009-report-on-2006-mumbai-train-blasts-case-hc-to-ib-101611733699013.html

Attorney General KK Venugopal mentioned the judgment passed by a single judge of Nagpur bench of Bombay HC on January 19. By this order, the court acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year old girl. The HC on appeal acquitted him of this charge and held him guilty only under molestation punishable with one year under IPC Section 354.The three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde issued notice to the accused and Maharashtra government to reply within two weeks. “Meanwhile, we stay the acquittal of accused in regard to Section 8 of POCSO,” said the bench also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Also read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, others on plea against electronic mediaThe AG said, “The order is very disturbing and is likely to set a dangerous precedent.” He requested the court to take suo motu cognizance as he was in the process of filing a petition against the order.The bench permitted the AG to file a petition and stayed the acquittal of the man.The HC had held that no offence under Section 8 of POCSO was made out as there was no physical contact. The man was accused of groping the girl and removing her salwar.The AG said, “It is an unprecedented order as it will mean that if a cloth is touched, no case under Section 8 is made out. This court must take notice of the judgement.”The accused was earlier convicted by a trial court under Section 8 of POCSO and sentenced to three years.

Some important cadres include, Aaytu Muchaki (31), head of Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangthan, Baman Denga Sodhi (40) and Kamli Madkam (32), who were carrying a reward of ₹1 lakh each on their heads,” said the SP.Under the Lon Varratu, which in local Gondi language means, ‘Return Home’, about 50 hypersensitive Maoist villages have been selected, where Maoists were being encouraged to surrender.The drive was launched in June 2020, and till now, 272 Maoists, including senior cadres, have surrendered in the district.Meanwhile, district administration is providing livelihood opportunities to the surrendered under this campaign.“The focus of Lon Varratu to link surrendered cadres directly to some livelihood opportunities and enabling them to earn a decent living has yielded very positive results. The district administration has provided them with tractor, agricultural equipments, construction work, benefits from veterinary and allied departments,” said a senior state official.He added that those who have surrendered are encouraging their former colleagues to join the mainstream.“District administration is committed to ensure that the benefits of the State government's poverty reduction programme for Dantewada, reaches all those who surrender and wish to join the mainstream,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-maoists-surrender-in-chhattisgarh-s-dantewada-district-101611732410618.html

The judgment sets a dangerous precedent, the advocate general has said.The stay order came as attorney general KK Venugopal mentioned the judgment in front of a CJI-led bench on Wednesday. The bench permitted the AG to file an appropriate petition against the order.The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court observed that pressing of the breast of a child does not constitute "sexual assault" under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as there was no skin to skin touch. The verdict drew flak from activists and the National Commission for Women challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court.The verdict was passed on January 19 by Justice Pushpa Ganediwala where it was said that there must be skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent for an act to be considered sexual assault.Here is all you need to know about the order and the controversy surrounding it> The order said as per the definition of sexual assault, a 'physical contact with sexual intent without penetration' is an essential ingredient of the offence.> The order said the act of groping falls under the definition of offence but not a sexual assault as there was no specific data as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast etc.> The National Commission for Women said the judgment will not only have a cascading effect on various provisions involving the safety and security of women in general but will also subject all women to ridicule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-bombay-hc-s-no-skin-touch-no-assault-verdict-101611732122097.html
27-01-2021||India||Sasikala released; AIADMK puts up show of strength at Jayalalithaa’s memorial||Late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide and expelled AIADMK leader VK Sasikala is formally free after serving her four-year prison sentence in the disproportionate assets case in the Bengaluru Parappana Agrahara Central Jail but she remains hospitalised for Covid-19 at the Victoria hospital. Prison authorities were in the hospital on Wednesday morning to complete the formalities of Sasikala’s release. Her family is in Bengaluru and her return to Chennai is yet to be decided based on her health condition. Meanwhile, even as Sasikala completed prison formalities, her party--the AIADMK from which she was expelled in 2017-- put up a huge show of strength in Chennai with a sea of party cadre and senior leaders while chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami inaugurated a 80-crore phoenix-themed memorial for Jayalalithaa on the Marina beach where she is buried. AIADMK has decided not to take Sasikala back and the inauguration was strategically timed with her release. Also read | Stalin accuses AIADMK govt of putting on hold projects brought during DMK ruleIt is being seen as a way to boost cadre morale and send a political message to Sasikala, Opposition parties and the public that the AIADMK is united under the dual leadership of Palaniswami and his deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam with assembly elections slated for April-May. “We have to work hard to win a third term as our tribute to Amma (Jayalalithaa),” Palaniswami said at the inauguration. Incidentally, when Sasikala was on her way to the prison from Chennai to Bengaluru in February 2017, she had stopped at Jayalalithaa’s burial place, thumped her palm on the ground thrice and dramatically taken a vow.Palanisami is the chief minister candidate for the AIADMK-led NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu. He reiterated earlier this month, in Delhi after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that Sasikala has ceased to be an AIADMK member and will not be re-inducted. While a section of Sasikala’s supporters expect her back, another section wants the status quo to remain. Though Sasikala has never campaigned or contested, she was a powerful behind-the-scenes operator during her three-decade association with Jayalalithaa. After the latter’s death, she briefly held the reigns of the party as interim general secretary and was set to become chief minister before she was convicted. Saisikala appointed her then loyalist Palaniswami to be chief minister. But he joined hands with O Paneerselvam who had revolted against her and the two factions under them merged and the AIADMK expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran in 2017.

There will be gaping gaps in the different translations," he claimed and added that even the Constitution does not say that the notification has to be translated in all the languages.The court, however, did not agree with the stand, saying "in modern day it cannot be a factually impossible task", but asked the government to indicate the difficulties it has in translating the draft EIA in all the languages.The bench, during the hearing, also said that the Constitution says the final notification may not be translated in all the languages, but it does not say anything about the draft which is put out for receiving public opinion."We don't understand why the Union government is resisting vehemently an order of this court for translating the draft into all the languages so that everyone can understand it and respond to it," it further said.The court gave the government time till February 25, the next date of hearing, to place on record its difficulties in translating the draft in all the languages.The bench was hearing the government's plea seeking review of its June 30, 2020 direction to the Environment Ministry to translate the draft EIA notification in all the 22 languages within 10 days of the order and had also extended till August 11 the time for receiving remarks from the public.The June 30, 2020 order had come on a PIL by environmental conservationist Vikrant Tongad seeking publication of the notification in all vernacular languages and also extension of the time to receive public comments on it.The June 30 order was initially challenged by the ministry in the Supreme Court which allowed the government to withdraw its appeal and instead file a review before the high court.The apex court also put on hold the proceedings in the contempt plea filed by Tongad for non-compliance of the June 30 direction.Subsequently, the ministry filed a plea seeking review of the June 30 order on grounds that official documents are required to be published only in Hindi and English. During the hearing on Wednesday, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Tongad, told the court that while the draft has been translated in all the languages by the government, it was not publishing the same and wanted to argue on whether such translations was required under the law.The draft EIA 2020, according to Tongad's plea, provides for post facto approval of projects and does away with public consultation in some cases.The petition by Tongad had claimed that the draft EIA 2020 completely supersedes and replaces the existing environmental norms."This draft notification proposes significant changes to the existing regime, including removing public consultation entirely in certain instances, reducing the time for public consultation from 45 days to 40 days, and allowing post facto approvals for projects," it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-questions-centre-s-resistance-to-draft-eia-in-all-vernacular-languages-101611730545971.html

However, other union leaders v passed the blame on to outsiders.Tourism minister Prahlad Patel visit Red Fort, condemns action of farmers'Deep Sidhu-BJP connection'The name of Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who was a former aide of BJP MP Sunny Deol, has cropped up in the aftermath of the violence. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has put the blame on Deep Sidhu. "Deep Sidhu is not a Sikh, he is a worker of the BJP. There is a picture of him with the Prime Minister. This is a movement of farmers and will remain so. Some people will have to leave this place immediately- those who broke barricading will never be a part of the movement," he said.'Unfurling flag not our plan'Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee's SS Pandher said unfurling the flag at the Red Fort was not part of the farmers' programme.

Deep Sidhu's photo with the PM has floated, we had already expressed doubt over him," he said.What is the photo that farmers leaders are referring to? The photo dates back to the time when Deep Sidhu was a close associate of Sunny Deol.

One person died in the incident.Secretary-General Guterres’ spokesman Stephane Dujarric, in his response to a question on the violence in New Delhi during his daily press briefing on Tuesday, said: “As we say in many of these cases, I think it's important to respect peaceful protests, freedom of assembly and non-violence”.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, is leading the protest against the three central farm laws at several border points of Delhi.The Kisan Morcha has disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade and alleged that some "antisocial elements" infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.It has called a meeting later on Wednesday to discuss the violence that broke out during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/important-to-respect-peaceful-protests-un-chief-s-spokesman-on-farmers-stir-101611729591826.html
27-01-2021||India||Security tight at Red Fort after clashes with farmers||Hundreds of police guarded the historic Red Fort in the heart of the Indian capital on Wednesday following violent clashes between farmers and authorities in which one person was killed and at least 80 injured.Tens of thousands of farmers, protesting against reforms of the agriculture sector that they say benefit big private buyers at the expense of growers, have been camped on the outskirts of the city for two months to demand the reforms be scrapped.A protest parade of tractors around the city's fringes to coincide with Tuesday's Republic Day celebrations turned to chaos when some farmers diverged from agreed routes, breaking through barricades and clashing with police, who used tear gas and batons to try to restrain them.Some farmers carrying ceremonial swords reached as far as the Red Fort, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives an annual speech, where they scaled outer walls and hoisted flags.By Tuesday evening police, had removed protesters from the fort complex but a heavy security presence remained on Wednesday.Agriculture employs about half of India's population of 1.3 billion, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest tests Modi has faced since coming to power in 2014.While the protests are beginning to undermine support for Modi in the countryside, he retains a solid majority in parliament and his government has shown no sign of bending to farmers' demands.The government says agriculture reform will open up new opportunities for farmers.Police said they had registered 22 cases against protesters including "rioting, damage to public property and assault on public servants with deadly weapons" in several locations.Roads across the New Delhi remained closed while extra police, including paramilitary were at protest sites on the outskirts.The government blocked the internet in some parts of the capital, and mobile speeds were low.Tuesday's violence was condemned by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the group of farm unions organising the protests, who they have promised to press on with their sit-ins on the outskirts."They have to listen to us," said protester Baljeet Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-tight-at-red-fort-after-clashes-with-farmers-101611728864748.html

27-01-2021||India||India’s unusual Covid vaccine problem: Shots in abundance, but few takers||Most of the world is struggling to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their populations. India has the opposite problem: Plenty of shots, but a shortage of people willing to take them.As India rolls out one of the world’s biggest inoculation programs, some health-care and other frontline workers are hesitating because of safety concerns over a vaccine that has yet to complete phase III trials. As of Monday, only about 56% of people eligible to get the shot have stepped forward in a nation with the world’s second-worst Covid-19 outbreak.Unless the inoculation rate significantly increases, India will fall far short of its target of inoculating 300 million people -- or about a quarter of the population -- by July. That will setback global efforts to contain the virus and snuff out optimism that a recovery is taking root in an economy set for its biggest annual contraction in records going back to 1952.“At least 40% of doctors here are unsure and want to wait,” said Vinod Kumar, a resident doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences of Patna, in the eastern state of Bihar. “Carrying out a vaccine trial on us when India is short of doctors, health-care workers doesn’t make sense.”While vaccine hesitancy has surfaced in places like Japan and Brazil, and China’s candidates have also faced questions over data, the scale of the problem in India is by far the biggest. The major difficulties facing places like the U.S. and Europe are mostly due to scarce supplies rather than vaccine acceptance, and some countries are turning to New Delhi for help: India says it can produce 500 million shots per month for export, and countries such as the U.K., Belgium and Saudi Arabia have sought to buy them.India’s domestic vaccine program administers one of two shots: the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Ltd., or the Covaxin shot developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd., a private company based in Hyderabad. India’s approval of the Bharat Biotech shot, which was developed with government-backed research groups, was met with widespread criticism from scientists because of the lack of complete data.“Many in our institute aren’t comfortable with Covaxin because we don’t know how effective it is,” said Adarsh Pratap Singh, a member of the Resident Doctors Association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. “To build trust among people the government must come out with the data, evidence of the trials, and encourage free and fair discussions.”Both the company and the government have defended the shot. Krishna Ella, Bharat Biotech’s chairman, said earlier this month that the company carried out “200% honest clinical trials” and had a track record of producing 16 safe and effective vaccines. “Indian scientists want to bash on other Indian scientists,” he said while dismissing criticisms in a virtual press briefing on Jan. 4. A spokesperson for Bharat Biotech didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The government, meanwhile, has urged health-care workers to get vaccinated. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has sent tweets imploring “#CoronaWarriors” to take the shot, while dispelling rumors that the vaccine could cause infertility. A federal health ministry spokesperson wasn’t immediately available to comment.“Vaccine hesitancy among health workers should end -- I am pleading on behalf of the government, that please adopt it, because no one knows how this pandemic will take shape in the future,” said V. K. Paul, a member of the planning body Niti Aayog, noting that he’s taken the Covaxin shot without any adverse effects.“These two vaccines are safe,” he said. “We have a system to track it and if there is an unusual signal, it will be responded to the way it should be.”Initial apprehension and doubt at the start of any vaccine rollout is normal, said Preeti Sudan, former secretary at the federal ministry of health and family welfare. India was successful in its polio immunization program, she noted, after launching a massive campaign involving children, mothers and opinion leaders to help dispel vaccine fears.Low Vaccination RatesAs of Monday, India distributed about 2 million shots nationwide. In Madhya Pradesh, the largest state in central India, about 75% of enrolled people turned up for vaccination on Jan. 21, while two days later in Bihar the rate was much lower at 51.6%. On Jan. 19, about 55% of those eligible were vaccinated in Rajasthan and 54% in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, according to state government data.While the hesitation relates to both vaccines, people are most wary about Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. In Tamil Nadu, for example, only 23.5% of those allocated Covaxin received the shots on Jan. 19, compared with 56% for the Serum Institute’s Covishield, the data show.Nirmalya Mohapatra, a doctor at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi, plans to “wait and watch” for more clarity before getting vaccinated with Bharat Biotech’s shot. If given a choice now, he would opt for Covishield, as its efficacy data was reviewed by leading medical journals.“Covaxin could turn out to be a better vaccine in the future,” said Mohapatra, who is also vice president of the resident doctors’ association at the hospital. “But for now there is some apprehension because of the lack of a complete trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-unusual-covid-vaccine-problem-shots-in-abundance-but-few-takers-101611724716011.html

For the last two months, a conspiracy is going on against a particular community. This is not a movement of Sikhs, but farmers," Tikait told news agency ANI.He said uneducated people were driving tractors and they didn't know the routes of Delhi."Administration told them the way towards Delhi. They went to Delhi and returned home. Some of them unknowingly deflected towards Red Fort. Police guided them to return," Tikait added.Tikait said that those who broke barricading will never be a part of the movement."Deep Sidhu is not a Sikh, he is a worker of the Bharatiya Janata Party. There is a picture of him with the Prime Minister. This is a movement of farmers and will remain so. Some people will have to leave this place immediately- those who broke barricading will never be a part of the movement," he said.Talking about the viral video where Tikait was seen appealing to his supporters to be armed with lathis, he said, "We said bring your own sticks. Please show me a flag without a stick, I will accept my mistake."Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body coordinating the farmer protests, called off the 'Kisan Republic Day Parade' yesterday evening and appealed to all the participants to return to their respective protest sites.

She also said that six brands had cancelled the contract with her after her comment. "Today I want to say each and every Indian who is supporting these riots is also a terrorist including anti-national brands," she tweeted.Throughout Wednesday, Kangana shared posters of protesters unleashing violence, climbing atop the Red Fort, and held supporters like Diljit Dosanjh, Priyanka Chopra answerable.CAA is on hold after so much terror I am sure Farmers bill will also be pushed on back burners, we as a democracy have chosen a nationalistic government yet antinationals are winning.

27-01-2021||India||SC to hear plea by ‘Tandav’ actor, makers against FIRs today||The Supreme Court will today hear petitions filed by actor Zeeshan Ayyub, Amazon Prime (India) creative head and the makers of the web series ‘Tandav’, seeking protection from arrest in the seven FIRs registered against them over allegations of hurting religious sentiments and telecasting objectionable content.A bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, will take up three petitions, filed separately by Ayyub, Amazon Prime creative head Aparna Purohit and another one moved jointly by the producer and director of the Over The Top (OTT) series. Other judges on the bench include justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah.The petitions are likely to be argued by a team of senior advocates led by veteran lawyer Fali S Nariman. The petitions have requested the top court to club all the seven FIRs and transfer them to a court in Mumbai. Out of seven FIRs, three FIRs are pending in Uttar Pradesh at Lucknow, Greater Noida and Shahjahanpur – for the alleged inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, deities, and adverse portrayal of a character playing the role of prime minister in the show. Also read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, others on plea against electronic mediaTwo FIRs have been registered in Madhya Pradesh while one FIR each was lodged in Karnataka and Bihar. Apart from the FIRs, at least three other criminal complaints are pending in Maharashtra, Delhi and Chandigarh respectively.The petitions coming up for hearing today have maintained that it would cause severe harassment to those associated with ‘Tandav’ to face prosecution in various states and that it would be just and fair to club all the cases at one place, preferably in Mumbai which is the ordinary place of residence for the petitioners.Seeking protection from arrest till all the FIRs are clubbed and sent to one court, the petitions have added that the apex court should stay all the coercive action against them for the time being. Earlier, the Bombay high court had granted a transit pre-arrest bail to series director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Himanshu Mehra,writer Gaurav Solanki, and Purohit against whom a case was registered in Lucknow for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through the web series. ‘Tandav’, a nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Ayyub, started streaming recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-by-tandav-actor-makers-against-firs-today-101611719553765.html

27-01-2021||India||Centre plans to map and assess anganwadis, shelters for women||The Union women and child development ministry plans to map and assess anganwadis (rural child care centre) and swadhar grehs (shelters for distressed women) to address any functional problems through focused interventions, officials familiar with the matter said.The proposed move comes after the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS) showed an alarming rise in the number of children with stunted growth across 11 states. Meghalaya (46.5%) recorded the steepest rise, followed by Bihar (42.9%). The population of underweight children has also increased.The government is yet to decide which body will conduct the survey. Officials said that organisations affiliated to the UN were earlier considered but the idea was later dropped.According to government data, there are over 1.3 million anganwadis and other child-care centres with a strength of over 1.2 million workers and more than 1.1 million helpers. There are 419 shelters for distressed women with 12,608 workers. These centres are run under centrally sponsored schemes, but the state governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) manage them.“The assessment was approved last November,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “It will help us identify the problem areas and to resolve them.”Also read | Gross enrolment ratio of girls in schools improved from 2014-15 to 2018-19: WCDThe official added that the assessment of the anganwadis could lead to the restructuring of the funding system to focus on the vulnerable areas. “...we can also identify which states and centres need more help.”HT reached out to a ministry spokesperson and the office of women and child development minister Smriti Irani for comments but did not receive any responses immediately.Anganwadis were set up in 1975 to tackle malnutrition. They provide supplementary nutrition, pre-school, non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-ups and referral services to children under six, adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating mothers.Women in distress can stay at swadhar grehs for a maximum of three years or before they turn 60. The ministry’s website cites an over-dependence on NGOs and state governments among the challenges the swadhar grehs face.Enakshi Ganguly, a co-founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights, said anganwadis often face issues related to space and accessibility. “There are proper and mini anganwadi centres. We do not have an idea of how anganwadis centres are run. It would be good to do a 21st-century assessment. The NFHS is a signal for us to look at the anganwadi programme.” Gaguly added it is better if a sort of an audit is done.” How the survey will be conducted will be a challenge as all the centres are run in different ways, with food needs being different for different states. The study must take all of these challenges into account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-to-map-and-assess-anganwadis-shelters-for-women-101611717453575.html
27-01-2021||India||Mumbai locals: Why Maharashtra govt is taking time to resume trains for all||From January 29 onwards, the number of Mumbai local trains in operation will return to its pre-Covid figures, but the services will be limited to only those who have been allowed to travel by the suburban railways during various phases of unlocking.APPEALPassengers as permitted by Ministry of Railways & Govt of Maharashtra are ONLY allowed to travel by the suburban trains.Others are requested not to rush to the Rly stations.Please adhere all norms, SOPs related to COVID19 during boarding, travel & at destination.Here is all you need to know:> From Friday, there will be 2,985 services on Mumbai Suburban network.

Out of these, Central Railway will increase the suburban services from the existing 1,580 to 1,685 services and Western Railway will increase the existing 1,201 suburban services to 1,300 services.> The decision was taken on Monday after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reviewed the situation and gave a go-ahead to the railways.> The augmented service will help in ensuring that there is no crowding.> Who all can travel? There has been no new relaxation in this regard. Emergency staff, women, lawyers who have been allowed to travel by Mumbai metro in the past few months will only travel.> Since the number of passengers is increasing with the gradual unlocking and the ongoing vaccination drive, the move is aimed at ensuring there is no overcrowding.When will Mumbai local trains be open for the general public?> However, the move is being seen as a precursor to open the locals for all in the coming days as the chief minister has also said that the locals will be open for all soon.> The decision to reopen local trains for all rests with the state government which is not rushing though pressure has been mounting from commuters.As the state became an epicentre of Covid-19 infections last year, the state government is taking measured and cautious steps in unlocking. Mumbai locals are the lifeline of the metropolitan and as most of the offices have opened, the number of passengers has been on the rise.Local train services for essential staff resumed on June 15 after it was completely shut in March. From October, Mumbai locals allowed women passengers between 11am to 3pm and after 7pm till the last train. In October, the railway authorities also permitted lawyers to travel in local trains except during morning peak hours between 8am and 11am and from 4pm to 7pm in the evening.

27-01-2021||India||Actor Deep Sidhu blamed for violence||Senior farm leaders and politicians on Tuesday evening blamed 36-year-old Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu for inciting violence during the Republic Day tractor rally in Delhi.Sidhu was summoned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) two weeks ago in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice.Farm leaders alleged Sidhu — who earlier publicly aired his differences with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha — tried to defame the farmers’ stir. “We condemn this act of Deep Sidhu in strong words and we think that he was working as a government agent. We didn’t have any plans to go to Red Fort but he did not follow our guidelines and even misled some youth,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni.Other leaders said Sidhu attempted to wrest back the limelight after being sidelined by farm unions. “He [Sidhu] posted a video claiming responsibility and justifying the act. Those who hoisted the flag at Red Fort were allowed a free passage as part of a conspiracy,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan.The controversy began with a Facebook video posted from the actor’s account around 2pm in which Sidhu could be seen along with his supporters at the Red Fort. Many of them held the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and a young man could be seen climbing a flagstaff in the background, with the ‘kesari’ flag in hand.“He is the front face of Khalistan and the role he played on Republic day has made it clear,” said Ravneet Singh Bittu, Congress parliamentarian from Ludhiana.Sidhu posted another video on Facebook at 5.40pm, where he admitted to hoisting the Nishan Sahib flag but said that he had done nothing wrong.But farm leaders were not convinced. “Deep Sidhu, who was the election agent of Bharatiya Janta Party candidate Sunny Deol and whose picture with Narendra Modi went viral on social media, led the charge at Red Fort [on Tuesday], according to TV visuals. This clearly points to an element of sabotage,” said Hannan Mollah, the leader of All India Kisan Sabha and a member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha.In 2019, Sidhu campaigned for BJP candidate Sunny Deol, who went on to win the Gurdaspur constituency. He was very close to Deol’s family, but later, Deol dissociated himself from Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-deep-sidhu-blamed-for-violence-101611704249786.html
27-01-2021||India||Law student writes to CJI to take cognisance of Red Fort violence||A law student on Tuesday wrote a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde urging him to take suo motu cognisance of the violence that took place at the Red Fort during the farmers’ protest in the national capital on Republic DayHundreds of farmers climbed the ramparts of Red Fort and hoisted religious flags (the Nishan Sahib of Sikhs), vandalised almost anything they could lay their hands on, fought a pitched battle with the police, throwing some of them into trenches, and tried to ram tractors into others.Requesting a Special Investigation Committee inquiry, Mumbai University student Ashish Rai said in the letter:“The way the flag of another community has been waved in place of the national flag of India, hurting the honour and dignity of the country, is a shameful event. And the whole country is also hurt by this incident, as the national flag has been insulted.”Rai stated that the incident has hurt the “country’s devotional spirit” and an inquiry is essential to determine how anti-social elements managed to enter the tractor rally.“It is, therefore, a humble request to the Supreme Court that a Special Investigation Committee be formed on this entire matter to conduct a rigorous inquiry against the anti-social elements involved in this unconstitutional activity so as to punish the accused,” Rai stated in his letter.It will be open for the Court to take note of the letter and convert it into a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) or take suo moto cognisance of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-student-writes-to-cji-to-take-cognisance-of-red-fort-violence-101611702807349.html
27-01-2021||India||Home minister takes stock of situation in urgent meet||As groups of stick-wielding farmers on Tuesday clashed with the police and forced their way inside the iconic Red Fort to hoist a flag, Union home minister Amit Shah convened an urgent review meeting with senior officials, including home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar to assess law and order in the National Capital Region.Shah directed that additional central paramilitary forces be deployed in Delhi with immediate effect and individuals and groups behind the Red Fort seize be brought to justice, people familiar with the development said. The home minister was supposed to join his colleagues at the President’s ceremonial At Home event, which is a biannual gathering of ministers, diplomats, top bureaucrats in the lawns of Rashtrapati Bhawan after Republic Day and Independence Day, but had to skip it due to the situation that was unfolding.One of the officials cited above said intelligence agencies as well as the foreign ministry are particularly concerned over farmers hoisting a flag from the staff of Red Fort, from where India’s Prime Minister usually unfurls the national flag every year on Independence Day. In particular, the concerns were triggered by several Pakistani twitter accounts celebrating the incident. One of the handles purportedly belonged to All Pakistan Muslim League (APML), founded by former Pakistan President Pervez Musharaff, which said the flag hoisted by farmers was as a ‘Khalistani flag’. The claim could not be verified but agencies began monitoring social media.The government also decided to suspend internet for 12 hours at the five border points where protesters gathered - Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri, Mukarba Chowk and Nangloi.One of the officials said that additional 1,500 to 2,000 paramilitary forces’ jawans are being deployed in Delhi. Around 4,500 paramilitary personnel were already deployed for law and order duties before the Republic Day along with the Delhi Police.Delhi Police had given permission to the farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws to conduct their tractor rally on some pre-selected routes but several groups deviated, determined to reach the heart of the Capital.The umbrella body of 41 farmers union, protesting against the laws since November 28 at Delhi borders, distanced itself from what they said were acts by anti-social elements.According to a second security official, the challenge for them was to move farmers out of the Red Fort and from their protest points inside the city to acceptable areas of protest. They wanted to achieve this in a manner that would be firm and yet peaceful. When asked if there had been any laxity in security, an official of the Intelligence Bureau said farmers had backed out of undertakings they had given. “This wasn’t the first time that the farmers had resorted to a form of violence. When they were first trying to come to Delhi at the beginning of the agitation, they had broken barriers then too,” said the official, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-minister-takes-stock-of-situation-in-urgent-meet-101611701224423.html
27-01-2021||India||Smaller crowd, masks mark Republic Day celebrations||Mandatory masks, a smaller crowd, fewer participants, shortened route, and contactless formations were some of the changes observed during the 72nd Republic Day held in the wake of Covid-19 on Tuesday.While more than 100,000 people attended the parade during the previous years, with Covid-19 norms in place on Tuesday, the crowd was limited to 25,000.As per the advisory, children below the age of 15 were also not permitted at the parade. The size of the marching contingents from the armed forces and the paramilitary were also smaller. The route of the parade was also shortened and ended at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort.For the first time in at least five decades, the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in India’s diplomatic calendar, did not have a chief guest. The last time the parade did not have a chief guest was in 1966. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson – the dignitary invited this year – had cancelled his planned visit to India to focus on countering a recent surge in Covid-19 infections in Britain.From sanitiser dispensers at multiple entrances to security personnel donning PPE kits, the venue of the parade at Rajpath ensured Covid-19 protocols were followed. Special Covid-19 booths with beds and emergency medical equipment were also present at the spot. Security officials deployed at the spot ensured that people maintained distance while standing in queues or while speaking to one another.Dr Sarath Kumar, 28, who works at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said he had come for the parade for the first time. “They are enforcing Covid-19 protocols like physical distancing strictly and even the seats are stationed at a 6 ft distance. There were multiple entry points to avoid overcrowding and the entire arrangement was good. The interesting part of the parade was the air force formations and the participants exercising precaution,” he said.Another visitor Harshita Malik, 30, a PhD student from Rohtak, said it was important to maintain traditions. “Celebrating the Republic Day was important as it is a part of our tradition. The Covid-19 risk can be mitigated if we follow all protocols. The arrangements here ensured that we sat at a distance from one another so I think it was a good idea to not cancel the parade.”In the absence of the motorcycle stunts, which received the maximum applause from the audience in previous years, the loudest cheers this year were reserved for the National Security Guard (NSG) commandos and the Rafale jets, which participated in the parade for the first time.Ranjan Kumar, 37, whose brother was CRPF personnel who lost his life in the 2017 Sukma attack, said, “Seeing the Rafale jet was the best part of the parade. Experiencing it in person is different from seeing it in videos.”Another popular attraction during this year’s parade was the “Atma-Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan: Covid” tableau put up by the department of biotechnology, which depicted the process of vaccine development through five steps. From virus isolation to vaccine production and clinical trials, the tableau showcased various stages of vaccine development bringing in cheers and applause from the audience.This is also the first time a tableau from the Union Territory of Ladakh was displayed at the parade.The tableau from Uttar Pradesh (which showed Ayodhya and the Ram Mandir) and the one from Delhi (which showed the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk) also received massive cheers from the crowd.Flight lieutenant Bhawana Kanth was the first woman fighter pilot to take part in the Indian Air Force’s (IAF’s) tableau at this year’s Republic Day parade and Captain Preeti Choudhary was the only woman army officer to lead a contingent. She led the upgraded Schilika weapon system, which also featured at the Republic Day Parade for the first time.Meanwhile, Delhi recorded 157 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the fifth time the daily incidences’ count stood below the 200-mark in January, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.24 per cent.The infection tally in the city stood at 6.34 lakh and the death toll mounted to 10,820 with seven new fatalities, the authorities said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smaller-crowd-masks-mark-republic-day-celebrations-101611701009857.html
27-01-2021||India||Leaders condemn violence, Opposition seeks repeal of laws||Opposition parties on Tuesday sought to mount pressure on the Union government after violence erupted during a protest by farmers who are opposing three new agricultural laws, but a section of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) maintained that the chaos on Delhi’s streets hinted at the role of “vested interests”.Senior BJP leaders went into a huddle with party chief JP Nadda, general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and other senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha member and party general secretary Arun Singh, attending a meeting at the BJP headquarters in the Capital, said a person who did not want to be named.No details were shared about the meeting, but the functionary cited above said party leaders found similarities between the Republic Day protests and those against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, or CAA, in late 2019 and early 2020 that turned violent on occasions.A second senior leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the protests “corroborated” what the party had been alleging — that “anti-national elements” infiltrated the demonstrations. This functionary said there was a sense in the party that the protests were being fuelled by those with “vested interests”, and that the government’s outreach efforts were being “stonewalled”.The Opposition, including the Congress, alleges that the government rushed the farm laws without proper discussion in Parliament. The Centre, however, says the reforms will lead to new opportunities in agriculture trade.Former BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao tweeted: “In Indian democracy u can have a mobilisation challenging govt on policies...sometimes it may appear as humiliating for d leaders who’re at helms but u can’t have a situation where its challenging d sovereignty of country n questioning d spirit of Indian Republic.”The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) condemned the violence. In a statement, RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said: “The violence and disturbances unleashed in Delhi today, the sacred Republic Day, are extremely painful and deplorable...RSS appeals to all countrymen to rise above political and ideological differences & to strive for peace as a priority.”In the Opposition camp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was not the solution to any problem, but asked the Centre to meet the demand of the farmers by repealing the laws. “...No matter who gets hurt, the country will suffer a damage. Take back the anti-agricultural laws in national interest,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.A statement by his party said: “The Congress party and the entire country is pained by today’s violence and unruly incidents in Delhi.”Former Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar took a potshot at the Centre.“No one will support such violence, but then the question arises: who forced them to indulge in such acts? It was the responsibility of the central government to talk to the farmers and solve this impasse,” he told the media in Mumbai.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “Deeply disturbed by worrying and painful developments that have unfolded on the streets of Delhi. Centre’s insensitive attitude and indifference towards our farmer brothers and sisters has to be blamed for this situation.”Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tweeted: “Shocking scenes in Delhi. The violence by some elements is unacceptable. It’ll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. Kisan leaders have disassociated themselves & suspended #TractorRally. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi & return to borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-condemn-violence-opposition-seeks-repeal-of-laws-101611700790308.html
27-01-2021||India||House canteen dishes out new menu, hikes prices||A buffet lunch for ₹700 to aloo bonda for ₹10—Indian parliament’s canteen will dish out an elaborate menu this budget session for every palate and budget.The parliament canteen, now run by ITDC will offer as many as 58 items, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, from January 27, an internal circular said. The price tags, however, don’t smell of subsidy. For many years, the parliament canteen had tried to strike a balance between quality and price but for the first time, the food will not be subsidised.While vegetarian biriyani is priced at ₹50, chicken biriyani will cost ₹100. A vegetarian meal (thali) will now be available for ₹100, mutton biriyani at ₹150 and fish and chips at ₹110.The menu is new, and the prices are higher. While the chicken biriyani will cost ₹30 more than the current rate and its mutton counterpart, ₹50 more, the new items include fish and chips, medu vada, mutton cutlet, omelette, masala poori and uttapam. A small plate of green salad, earlier available for ₹10, will now cost ₹25.Last year, the contract with the Northern Railways to run the canteen was scrapped. Top officials indicated that cost control and a better menu were the prime reasons for such a move.“The northern railways people in the parliament canteen were paid nearly ₹1 lakh each monthly by Parliament to run the canteen. We felt that the cost should be reduced,” said a parliament official who asked not to be named. Northern Railway has been serving food in the canteen since 1968.During a normal session, an average 4,500 people eat at Parliament every day. According to data available with officials, out of ₹17 crore annual subsidy, only ₹24 lakh is spent on MPs. The rest goes towards underwriting food for security personnel, officials, even visitors.A Lok Sabha MP, preferring anonymity, welcomed the Speaker’s decision to rationalize food prices and said, “It’s a good move and it will help shed the misconception that we, lawmakers, eat subsidized food in Parliament.” “The fact is most legislators eat at home as they live near the Parliament complex,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-canteen-dishes-out-new-menu-hikes-prices-101611699738629.html
27-01-2021||India||Discussing a possible route for Amarnath via Kargil: Prahlad Patel||Union minister for culture and tourism Prahlad Patel spoke to Deeksha Bhardwaj about the Central government’s plans to address the development imbalance between Leh and Kargil, and talks on mapping a new Amarnath Yatra route via Kargil instead of Srinagar, among other issues. Edited excerpts:There is large gap between development in Leh and Kargil. How does the government plan to address that?You have caught the core issue. The difference in development existed when Jammu & Kashmir was a state. It is true that it has been discriminated against. Ever since it has become a UT, we have addressed many problems such as a weak bureaucracy an easing clearance norms. We are setting up a branch of the Indian Institute of Skiing and mountaineering, Gulmarg, here as well. The institute may be named after Subhas Chandra Bose -- talks are on.Opposition parties have accused BJP of playing vote-bank politics using Bose ahead of the Bengal elections. Your response to that?We celebrated Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary. Those making these allegations, whether it is Congress, TMC or the Left, should answer why they never honoured Bose. It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who spearheaded the move to celebrate his anniversary as Parakram Diwas every year, and inaugurated its first edition. No other PM has become a chairman for any board other than the one set up for Mahatma Gandhi. This is the first time. The Opposition should tell us what they have done so far.The government talks about making Kargil an adventure sports destination, but locals say they face an equipment crunch?The government is addressing the lack of equipment in Kargil. I met Mohammed Mehdi, the 10-year-old who wishes to play in the Winter Olympics. The government will fully sponsor his training. It is true that it will take some time to reach international standards, but we are working in that direction.Are there plans to promote tourism in Kargil?Once the Zojila tunnel is completed, Kargil’s situation will be completely altered. We are also discussing a possible route for the Amarnath pilgrimage via Kargil, instead of Srinagar. It is a more scenic and comfortable route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discussing-a-possible-route-for-amarnath-via-kargil-prahlad-patel-101611698124960.html
27-01-2021||India||Rally to langar: Peaceful stir held across 20 states||Farm bodies and unions across the country carried out protests, including tractor rallies, that were largely peaceful on Tuesday, in contrast to the violence seen in Delhi where farmers deviated from previously agreed-upon routes, broke through barricades, and stormed the Red Fort.Around the country, protests were reported from at least 20 states as farmers took out rallies and held gatherings in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and even Himachal Pradesh, among others, to protest against the three farm laws passed by the Centre in September last year.In Punjab, farmers held a tractor parade in districts such as Patiala and Sangrur, which caused traffic jams , especially on highways leading into and out of Punjab, but there were no reports of violence.According to farmer bodies in Punjab, villages on the route organized food (langar) for the farmers and volunteers provided free medical services.Jang Singh, district president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, said Tuesday would be remembered across the country as a day when a huge number of people took to the streets to fight for their rights.“The farmers are not going to relent till the government repeals these three acts, which will destroy the livelihoods of the farmers if are implemented,” he said.Farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been at the border points of the national capital since November 26, 2020, demanding legal backing for minimum support price (MSP) as well as a complete repeal of the three newly-enacted farm laws — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — which they contend, will allow multinational companies to use the sector to maximise their profits at the expense of the farmers.The Centre has however held that the laws will not be repealed, but the government is willing to sit with the farmers to discuss the problematic clauses. The 11th round of negotiations between the state and farmers took place on January 22 ended in a deadlock.Farmer leaders said at least one person from each of the around 12,000 villages in Punjab was in Delhi to participate in the protests.In Haryana, farmers across the state carried out peaceful tractor marches and raised slogans against the Central government.Except Faridabad, where the police had to baton charge farmers trying to enter Delhi, no untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the state, said director general of police, Manoj Yadava. In many places, there was festive fervour at the tractor parades in which women from villages participated in large numbers, farmer leaders said.In Mumbai, the farmers concluded their protest at Azad Maidan, which began at noon with the unfurling of the flag, which was attended by farmers from across Maharashtra.Farmer leaders described the agitation as successful saying they were able to send a message that the state’s farmers are united against the farm laws.“The Mumbai agitation sent a message to the agitating farmers at Delhi’s borders that we are firmly behind them and will not relent till these regressive farm laws are withdrawn,” said Ajit Navale, convenor, Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) which organised this protest. The protest in Mumbai was supported by the state government.On Tuesday, 73-year old farmer Yamunabai hoisted the tricolor along with Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole. later in the day, farmers started leaving Mumbai for their homes.In Karnataka, protestors managed to enter Bengaluru in support of agitating farmers in Delhi. The Karnataka police on Monday afternoon agreed to allow around 125 tractors to enter the city.Social media was flooded with videos of farmers sloganeering after they were restricted from entering Bengaluru, where protestors planned to carry out a rally . “We are organising vehicles for all those who have gathered here to be taken into Bengaluru by other modes of transport,” said a farmer, who is coordinating efforts on the Mysuru highway.In Tamil Nadu, farmers and workers belonging to labour unions of the DMK and its allies including the Left parties participated in the tractor rally across various districts. While the rallies ended peacefully by afternoon, there were some minor clashes between the police and farmers in a few districts. No injuries were reported.The state’s main opposition party, DMK and its allies have protested and launched hunger strikes in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi in the recent months. However, the ruling AIADMK government, which is allied with the NDA, is in favour of the laws.In West Bengal, farmers and political parties held big rallies at several parts of the poll-bound state to show their strength.The biggest rallies of Left parties were in East Burdwan, Hooghly, Murshidabad and East Midnapore districts. “More than 600 tractors and two thousand motorcycles participated,” said Amal Haldar, senior peasant’s front leader of the CPIM.In Madhya Pradesh, farmer bodies claimed that tractor rallies were organised in at least 20 of the state’s 55 districts. Farmers also took out a 15-km long tractor and motorcycle rally in state capital Bhopal.Jagrut Kisan Sangathan convenor Irfan Jafri said that the Bhopal administration did not allow a tractor rally in urban areas, protestors took out the vehicle parade in the rural areas of Bhopal. In Barwani district, a 16-km bullock-cart parade was carried out.Rallies were also taken out in Raisen, Shivpuri, Bhind, Morena and Gwalior districts. “Farmers took out peaceful rallies even in Vindhya and Chambal regions,” said Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh leader Subhash Pandey.In Jharkhand, the All India Kisan Sabha, Left parties, the Congress and RJD took out tractor and motorcycle rallies in different parts of the state.Farmer leaders also read the preamble of the Constitution and urged the Central government to respect it by withdrawing the three farm laws. Farm leaders said they would continue the protest till January 30.Farmer protests were also reported from Uttarakhand, Himachal, parts of Odisha, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rally-to-langar-peaceful-stir-held-across-20-states-101611696650066.html
27-01-2021||India||At Rajpath, many firsts in the shadow of a pandemic||e participation of a woman fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s tableau, and the appearance of Rafale fighter jets were among several significant firsts in the 72nd Republic Day celebrations on Tuesday as the country showcased its military might and exhibited its cultural hues at festivities held under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Capital.From T-90 tanks and BMP-II infantry combat vehicles rumbling down Rajpath to fighter jets performing some breathtaking manoeuvres in the skies, to indigenous rockets and missiles, India put on display its war machines at a time when the country is locked in a tense border stand-off with China.Besides, 17 tableaus from states and Union Territories (UT) depicted the cultural heritage of the country in curtailed celebrations organised in adherence to strict safety protocols and social distancing norms in view of the pandemic. The tableau of Uttar Pradesh showcased the heritage of the ancient town of Ayodhya, and the replica of the Ram temple that is being built there, as well as stories from the epic Ramayana. The Delhi tableau had an image of the Red Fort and the redevelopment of Shahjahanabad in the Old City.Another highlight was a 122-member contingent of the Bangladesh Armed Forces that took part in the march at Rajpath as part of the celebrations linked to 50 years of that country’s liberation. Also, the tableau of UT Ladakh made its first appearance this year. There was no chief guest at the Republic Day parade this time — a first since 1966. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was to be the chief guest, cancelled his visit to India owing to rising Covid cases in his country.While nine tableaus from different Union ministries and paramilitary forces took part in the Rajpath parade, six from the defence ministry, too, attended the event. Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and MiG-29s — fighters that are part of the IAF’s muscular posture in the Ladakh theatre — were among the 42 aircraft in the fly-past, a key attraction. The Rafale jets took part in the parade for the first time.Other military equipment displayed included the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, Pinaka multi-launcher rocket system, bridge layer tank T-72, Samvijay electronic warfare system and Schilka weapon system.The IAF tableau featured one of India’s first women fighter pilots — another first in the high-profile event. Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth was part of the tableau that showcased mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30. Also, among those who flew the Mi-17 V5 choppers that showered petals at the parade was Flight Lieutenant Swati.This year, the parade was shorter and involved fewer participants because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The shortened route of the parade meant it ended at National Stadium, instead of Red Fort. Only a fourth of the usual number of spectators were allowed at Rajpath — not more than 25,000 spectators, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 and those above 65 were not allowed among the visitors at the venue.Before the parade began, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to India’s fallen heroes by placing a wreath at the National War Memorial at India Gate. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh were present at the memorial.President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and several cabinet ministers were among the dignitaries who witnessed the parade.The parade was led by Lieutenant General Vijay Kumar Mishra, general officer commanding, HQs Delhi Area. The march past included Param Vir Chakra and Ashok Chakra awardees (India’s highest wartime and peacetime gallantry awards, respectively), an army mounted column of 61 Cavalry, and marching contingents of the Jat Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Mahar Regiment, the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles and Bengal Sappers.The Indian Navy’s tableau depicted the navy’s role in the 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Photos of Maha Vir Chakra awardees were displayed on the rear part of the trailer, while the sides showed murals depicting the surrender ceremony.The fly-past featured a vintage Dakota aircraft — used for dropping paratroopers during the 1971 war — that flew in formation with two Mi-17 V5 helicopters, marking the golden jubilee celebrations.The IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, C-130J Super Hercules special operations plane, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission choppers, too, took part in the fly-past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-rajpath-many-firsts-in-the-shadow-of-a-pandemic-101611689502682.html
27-01-2021||India||Farmers' tractor rally violence: Dark day for the Republic||This is how it ends, not in order, but chaos, not peacefully, but violently; and not as a concerted display of farmer power, but a descent into chaos best exemplified by images of tractors being driven at high speed, in circles, at ITO in the centre of the national capital, threatening to run over anyone in the way.This was not how it was supposed to be. The 62-day-long farm protest, seen by many as a fight of the small man against the State, was expected to reach a climax of sorts with a tractor rally through three designated routes in Delhi. Farm unions that hammered out a compromise with Delhi Police that made this possible, promised a display of pageantry that would rival the morning’s Republic Day parade.This was how it actually was: one of the groups from Ghazipur deviated from their agreed-upon route, and reached ITO, where they ran riot; another, from Singhu border, deliberately took a turn they were not meant to, and stormed the Red Fort, where one of the protesters climbed the first available flag post (it was empty and not the one where the national flag always flies) and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and subsequently engaged in a violent clash with policemen who were trying to disperse them.This was how it actually was: one of the groups from Ghazipur deviated from their agreed-upon route, and reached ITO, where they ran riot; another, from Singhu border, deliberately took a turn they were not meant to, and stormed the Red Fort, where one of the protesters climbed the first available flag post (it was empty and not the one where the national flag always flies) and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and subsequently engaged in a violent clash with policemen who were trying to disperse them.As much as the Union government can be blamed for letting things come to such a pass, as much as Delhi Police can be faulted for intelligence failure for not anticipating the events of the day, the ultimate blame has to lie with the farmers, and their leaders, who are now saying how certain unions did not agree with the plans for the tractor rally decided mutually with Delhi Police and took matters into their own hands.Darshan Pal, one of the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body coordinating the protests, condemned the violence, and tried to dissociate himself from it. “Undesirable and unacceptable events have taken place today. We dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts,” he said. But it won’t be easy to blame the rampage on fringe elements or others embedded among the protesters as part of a conspiracy (although theories to this effect are already doing the rounds). This was simply a protest that got horribly out of hand; a march where the leaders were either absent or not able to control the crowd.The protesters may have genuine concerns about the farm laws, but images of tractors being used to ram through buses and barricades, armed men with swords on horses trying to run down policemen, and the police rushing containers, buses and barriers to block key roads in central Delhi meant that the immediate concern was not the laws but law and order.A protesting farmer died after his tractor overturned at ITO during the rally on Tuesday, police said. A video showed the tractor ramming into a police barricade.The police fired tear gas shells and resorted to baton charges at several poiseveral points where clashes broke out. Delhi Police said 83 personnel were injured after being attacked by agitating farmers. “Protesters turned violent at some places. Many police personnel were injured and public property also damaged. I appeal to protesters to return through the designated routes and maintain peace,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal.Some groups of farmers began returning to their respective sit-in sites in the evening after hours of clashes, but thousands could still be seen in several areas including ITO, Nangloi and Mukarba Chowk. Visuals also showed people gathered at the Red Fort. Mobile internet services were suspended in three Haryana districts of Sonipat, Jhajjar and Palwal for 24 hours ending 5pm Wednesday, the state government said on Tuesday evening, as violent protests rocked Delhi. Mobile internet was restricted by the police in some parts of the national capital and several Metro stations were also shut down temporarily through the day.Several questions remain.Will the farmers continue their protest?The Samyukt Kisan Morcha called off the “Kisan Republic Day Parade” in the evening and appealed to all participants to return to their respective protest sites. The organisation announced that the movement will “continue peacefully” and further steps will be discussed and decided soon.Will the government continue to hold out its offer of deferring the laws by 18 months while talks continue?Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday said that farmers should accept the government’s proposal to suspend the laws. Tomar did not speak about the government’s next move on Tuesday evening.Will Delhi Police and the home ministry act against the farm groups?Delhi Police said that legal action will be taken against those who assaulted police personnel during the farmers’ rally. Union home minister Amit Shah held a review meeting with senior officials, including home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar, to assess the law and order situation. The Union home ministry will deploy additional paramilitary forces in the national capital after the clashes, people aware of the developments said.And will the Supreme Court, which has sidestepped the issue thus far, finally deal itself a hand to resolve the crisis?India’s 72nd Republic Day, it was expected, would be a celebration of the soldier in the morning and the farmer in the afternoon, a real-life display of Lal Bahadur Shastri’s popular slogan Jai Jawan; Jai Kisan. Instead, it ended up showcasing ugly scenes of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-tractor-rally-dark-day-for-the-republic-101611688709228.html
27-01-2021||India||Union leaders make appeal, divert blame after anarchy reigns||Leaders of farm unions protesting three new agricultural laws, shaken by the events of the day, took recourse to the cliche of “anti social elements” among the protestors, as they desperately sought to deflect the blame for the violent actions of thousands of protesters, who knocked down barricades, clashed with police, and breached the Red Fort as they drove through the nation’s capital in tractors on Republic Day.The chaos and violence have raised questions about the future of the two-month-long agitation of farm unions. Leaders offered conflicting explanations of what happened. Only at dusk, by which time farmers had run riot through parts of the Capital, did the main organiser of the protests, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, deem it fit to call off the tractor march, asking all farmers to return to their camps on Delhi’s borders.Samyukt Kisan Morcha insisted a majority of the protesters stuck to agreed routes and were peaceful, and dissociated itself with a large section of farmers who broke ranks to unleash chaos in the heart of the Capital.Thousands of farmers drove tractors from the borders of Delhi into the city for a massive tractor rally on Tuesday. Soon, they defied police orders and turned towards important institutions in the centre of Delhi, creating a security nightmare on Republic Day.They hoisted Sikh religious flags atop the Red Fort from where the Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech. Riot police beat protestors with batons and fired tear gas to scatter mobs at several places in Delhi. In return, the protesters tried to run down policemen with their tractors.By noon, top leaders of the farm unions, who repeatedly appealed for a peaceful march, appeared to have lost control over large breakaway factions of farmers as mobs left routes approved for their to march and reached central Delhi, which they were supposed to avoid according to an agreement reached between police and the farm unions. As mobs infiltrated the Red Fort and the ITO area, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha hurriedly issued a statement.“Despite all our efforts, some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts. Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement,” the unions’ statement said, without providing any evidence of such infiltration. The farm unions described the events as “unacceptable”. Their leaders said they “dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts”. Cracks have appeared in the unions over the violence. Some farm leaders blamed one farmers’ organisation, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, for not accepting an agreement between the farm unions and Delhi Police on routes. “The first group that broke the set routes was not part of the Punjab platform, and since yesterday, farmer leaders from Samyukt Kisan Morcha were pleading with them not to do this,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader. Kuruganti was referring to the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, a farmers’ organisation led by SS Pannu and SS Pandher. Pandher blamed police for beating farmers first. Kuruganti blamed the organisation for breaking rules to start the parade two hours earlier than scheduled and breaking routes, leading to the first clashes at Mukarba Chowk, a major junction. “We still don’t know who all went into the Red Fort,” Kuruganti said.HT’s reporting shows that groups from Singhu border and Ghazipur reached Red Fort.Several farmer leaders blamed actor Deep Sidhu for the chaos at Red Fort. Sidhu, who acted in Punjabi films before campaigning for candidates in the 2019 general elections, was summoned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) two weeks ago in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice.Darshan Pal, a key organiser of the protests, admitted some farmer organisations broke ranks. “It is unfortunate. We have appealed to everybody to return to their bases. Those who stay put in the Capital will have to face the law.” A senior farm leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, alleged that the faction that broke away in the Ghazipur area was led by the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Pal said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha would probe the “unexpected” turn of events, which could weaken the farmers’ agitation, but said the peaceful protests would continue.“It is deeply embarrassing and anguishing for us. It has definitely dented our image. We will have to reassess our strategies,” one farm leader said, requesting anonymity. “Peace is our strength. If peace is broken, then our strength is broken,” said Yogendra Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-leaders-make-appeal-divert-blame-after-anarchy-reigns-101611686912418.html
