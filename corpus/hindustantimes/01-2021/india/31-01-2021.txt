The opposition leaders must be coming out of empathy but there's no point for them to look for votes at the protest sites. It is not their protest.""Opposition may raise the issue in parliament," he added.The farmer leader said that the farm issue can only be settled through dialogue. "We will talk to the government as we believe that the issue can only be settled with dialogue," he added.Tikait had earlier said there will not be any agreement "under pressure". They will hold discussions on the farm law issue only after their people are released from jail, he said.The farmer leader had earlier stated that they will honour the dignity of the Prime Minister but also ensure that the self-respect of farmers is protected.So far, several rounds of talks have remained inconclusive between farmer leaders and government representatives on the farm issues.Days after the violent incidents during farmers tractor rally on January 26, PM Modi had on Saturday said that the government's proposal to farmers on suspending the three farm laws for 18 months still stands.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-point-in-opposition-leaders-seeking-votes-at-protest-sites-rakesh-tikait-101612115763613.html

Through the no-confidence motion, the public will know which MLA stands with the government and which MLA is with the farmers," he said.Hooda said the CLP meeting will consider the demands of the farmers and draw out a strategy to take forward their issues.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupinder-hooda-convenes-congress-meeting-to-discuss-farmers-issues-101612114911969.html

No need to visit RTO office any more||People trying to get a learner's license or seeking temporary registration number for their vehicles will no longer have to visit the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for verification. In view of the social distancing norms due to Covid-19, the central government will launch 16 facilities that would allow you to do all that from online portals. The Union transport ministry has stated that Aadhaar will be adopted as an alternative document for authentication and no other paper will be needed.This will allow people to apply for new learners' license, renewal, duplicate driving license and temporary vehicle registration. They will also be able to change the address in their driver’s licence and get an international driving permit, NOC for registration, duplicate registration certificate, vehicle transfer etc. The new rule is scheduled to be implemented by February first week.In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the functioning of the transport sector is being made contactless, HT's sister publication LiveHindustan reported citing a senior official. This will bring transparency in the functioning of RTOs in states, he also said.On January 29, the ministry of road transport and highways also sought suggestions and objections from all states regarding the same notification. The states have 15 days to respond to the notification.The new online system will also restrict people from obtaining multiple driving licenses from different states. The government is also hoping that through this the racket of registration of stolen vehicles in another state will also be closed.The government in recent months have brought several changes to the motor vehicles rules. In October last year, the government mandated that people will no longer need to carry physical copies of their vehicle-related documents including their driving license. It allowed people to save copies of their documents on government portals, MParivahan or Digilocker. They can then show the required documents to the traffic police if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/applying-for-learner-s-license-no-need-to-visit-rto-office-any-more-101612114418783.html

"I bow down to Bihars first Chief Minister Dr Sri Krishna Singh on his death anniversary," Tejashwi tweeted while paying tribute to Bihars first CM. He, however, committed goof-up by posting photograph of Anugrah Narayan Sinha in place of "Shri Babu." Anugraha Narayan Sinha known as 'Bihar Vibhuti' had served as a prominent minister in Dr Sri Krishna Singh's first cabinet after Independence. NDA constituents-JD(U), BJP and HAM(S) latched on the issue to attack Lalu Prasad's younger son. RJD sought to downplay the matter, saying it was a "technical error" which the opponent should not make an issue and go by the spirit of the tweet. Hindustani Awam Morcha(HAM) national president and former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi took a jibe at Tejashwis knowledge about leaders of Bihar, saying "those who do not recognise as who the late Sri Krishna Singh was, now reckons himself as a leader of Bihar. " "@yadavtejashwi babu, if you dont know (recognize) Bihar Vibhutis (legends), then I would send pictures of all these personalities. See photos before making any comments from now onwards. This boy has made a fun of himself," Manjhi said in his tweet. JD(U) spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar questioned Tejashwis knowledge asking, "whether it reflects his hate for knowledge or societal hate as he has posted picture of late Anugrah Babu on the death anniversary of Dr Sri Krishna Singh." "How political tourists will know the great leaders of Bihar. You are corrupt and only know the criminals lodged in jail," JD(U) leader wryly said. BJP too derided Tejashwi, the leader of opposition in Bihar assembly, for his goof-up. "The leader of opposition should exhibit his political- social hatred after first getting himself acquainted with the pictures of Bihar Kesri late Sri Krishna Singh and Bihar Vibhuti late Anugrah Narayan Singh," state BJP spokesman Arvind Kumar Singh said. Downplaying the issue, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary told PTI that "Tejashwi Yadav jee does not himself put up tweets. Its a technical error. The opponents should not make it an issue, rather they should try to understand the spirit behind the tweet."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-goofs-up-by-putting-wrong-picture-while-paying-tribute-to-shri-babu-101612113331013.html

He added that India has always sought exemptions and waivers from sanctions for Chabahar port so that it could be used to access markets in other countries.During the meeting, the two officials of the two sides discussed ways to further develop the infrastructure and capabilities of the port.On Saturday, the Indian team held political consultations in Tehran with an Iranian delegation led by Rasoul Mousavi, assistant to Iran’s foreign minister and director-general for West Asia in the foreign ministry. Recent international and regional developments and bilateral ties were part of the discussions.Singh also met Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, and their discussions focused on regional and global developments and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), according to state-run Irna news agency.

But the picture he posted was not of Singh. It was of another eminent leader of the state and former deputy chief minister Anugrah Singh, popularly called Bihar Vibhuti.The JD(U) was quick to flay Tejaswhi for the slip, and called him a “political tourist”. “You are a political tourist and how will you know about the luminaries of Bihar. You only know corrupt and those lodged in jails,” said Neeraj Kumar, former minister and JD (U) MLCDeputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad of the BJP said the opposition leader’s faux pas reflected how he was only engrossed in the thought of coming to power. “He (Tejashwi) probably keeps thinking of other things and applies less attention on these things,” Prasad said.However, RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary played down his leader’s mistake.“The photograph mismatch on Tejashwi’s Twitter post was a technical error.

She has no basic rights whatsoever in the party. This is illegal,” said AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar.Since her release from prison, the AIADMK has expelled two of its functionaries for putting up posters welcoming Sasikala as the ‘general secretary’.Senior AIADMK leader KP Munusamy, however, indicated a possible reconciliation.Calling Sasikala’s nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief, TTV Dhinakaran an opportunist who tried to break the AIADMK, he said “If he (Dhinakaran) wants, he can submit a written apology seeking forgiveness for all his mistakes and to be accepted as a cadre, the leadership can take a call on his letter,” said Munusamy.Dinakaran, on Sunday, shrugged off the use of the flag, stating that Sasikala is still "the general secretary of the AIADMK."Just two months after Jayalaithaa's death in December 2016, the Sasikala faction of the party got into a bitter power struggle to oust O.Panneerselvam as chief minister.Sasikala's bid for chief ministership was cut short after the Supreme Court convicted her and two others - Ilavarasi and V.K.Sudhakaran in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case on February 14, 2017.Her release from prison after serving a jail term has added to the intensity of the upcoming polls in which the AIADMK is consolidating its resources to take on its main rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).Sasikala had handpicked Edapaddi Palaniswami for the CM’s role, over current deputy CM Paneerselvam, who had officiated in that role through all of Jayalalithaa’s illness.Following Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016, Paneerselvam was swiftly sworn in as CM. Sasikala was elected as general secretary -- the highest post in the AIADMK-- previously held by MGR and Jayalalithaa. After Paneerselvam resigned to make way for Sasikala to be chief minister, in a dramatic turn of events, he rebelled against her.But Pannerselvam and Edapaddi Palaniswami eventually merged their factions and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran. The party abated the general secretary’s post.Sasikala had filed a petition in the Madras high court that the general council meeting held to expel her and appoint new positions were invalid The case is not yet listed, said her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian.“The case is pending in court so she’s put the flag in her car. Chinamma will continue her legal battle. I floated AMMK democratically to reclaim the AIADMK,” Dhinakaran told reporters in Bengaluru.“By using the flag, she is sending a message to the cadre that she belongs to the AIADMK but when the election commission has recognised the Palaniswami-Paneerselavm’s government and party as the true AIADMK, it’s a weak case in a civil court,” Ravindran Duraisamy, a Chennai-based political analyst said.The election commission in 2017 allotted the party name and its symbol of two leaves to the present regime. “The status-quo of the AIADMK will continue. It’s a settled matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-signals-intent-to-fight-back-uses-aiadmk-flag-as-she-exits-hospital-101612109169595.html

'Flagging off the 'Aiswarya Kerala' yatra, led by leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, at Kumbala in northernmost Kasaragod district, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the LDF government had made a lot of claims on its 'achievements' during its tenure. "That is not the truth. The last five years was a waste as neither the people nor the state gained anything during the Left rule. What is the development they are claiming?" Chandy asked. He pointed out that the Kannur airport, Vizhinjam port and Kochi metro projects were started by the previous UDF government. The medical college alloted to Kasaragod did not become a reality due to which people had to suffer during the pandemic, he said. Unemployment was on the rise, he said and alleged that there were efforts to make 'back door appointments'. Chandy also used the platformto slam the Left government on the Sabarimala women entry issue, days after he shot of a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, seeking legal remedies to "heal the wounds" created in society due to its alleged hasty decision to implement the Supreme Court verdict. Addressing the gathering, Chennithala said people are fed up with the five year "misrule" of the LDF government and would not give it a second term. "This scam ridden government has cheated the people", he alleged, alluding to the Gold smuggling, dollar smuggling cases and various other corruption cases. He assured that if the UDF government was voted to power, it would bring in legislation to protect the faith of Sabarimala devotees. Kerala had witnessed massive protests by right-wing outfits and the BJP after the LDF government decided to implement the apex court's September 28 verdict in 2018, lifting the restriction on entry of women of menstruating age into the hill shrine to offer prayers. KPCC President Mullappally Ramachandran said the LDF government has"cheated" the people and was a failure on all fronts and expressed confidence that the UDF would win 100 of the 140 seats and ride to power. AICC General Secretary Tariq Anwar, IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty, UDF convenor M M Hassan and Kerala Congress leader P J Joseph were among those who spoke. 'Clean and good governance' is the slogan of the rally, which will also present the alternate development and welfare model proposed by the UDF to the people. The rally, after passing through the 140 constituencies spread over 14 districts, will reach the state capital on February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hitting-out-at-misrule-of-ldf-govt-udf-launches-state-wide-rally-101612103005072.html

The BJP has tortured the common people," the Samajwadi Party chief said in a tweet in Hindi.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protest took a violent turn during the farmers' tractor rally on January 26.Enacted in September 2020, the central government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers' income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and "mandi" (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and ruled out a repeal of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-deeply-hurt-by-bjp-s-moves-to-defame-them-akhilesh-yadav-101612086693429.html

This is the party which claims to uphold India’s honour and pride! SHAMEFUL! Will @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India apologise for this “Anti-National” Act? #BJPInsultsNationalAnthem,” tweeted Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and nephew of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee.He even uploaded a video on the social networking site of top BJP leaders singing the National Anthem at a rally at Dumurjala in Howrah on Sunday.The TMC and the BJP which will be the main contestants in the upcoming assembly election have been relentlessly attacking at each other for months over a range of issues.While Union home minister Amit Shah had virtually addressed the rally, Union textiles minister Smriti Zubin Irani was present on the dais along with several other top BJP leaders and some former TMC leaders who recently joined the BJP.The BJP rubbished the allegations saying that the TMC had played politics with the name of Lord Ram and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and is now doing politics with the National Anthem.“There were two Union ministers, at least three former ministers who were earlier in the TMC, several eminent personalities. No one would believe that all of them together sang the National Anthem wrongly. The TMC is doing politics with the National Anthem as it had earlier done with the name of Lord Ram and Netaji. People won’t accept such politics,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state.The BJP also came under fire from the Congress"#WrongNationalAnthem On the 46th second of the video "janganamangal dayak" was sung as "janganamangal adhinayak" in BJP's party hopping meet in Howrah today. What action to be taken against this insult to the national anthem? @INCIndia @adhirrcinc @JitinPrasada," the West Bengal Congress Committee tweeted.The Left Front also lashed out at the BJP following the incident.“I had once challenged BJP parliamentarians during the UPA-I tenure. I had said in the Parliament that if any of them (BJP leaders) can sing the first eight lines of Vande Mataram, I would resign. There was silence for two minutes. None accepted the challenge,” said Md Salim, leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist).Soon after the incident, TMC started an online poll on a social networking site. “What is BJP? #Bengal rejects BJP. Shame of the country? Shame of humanity?” it askedThe poll received around 1,100 votes within two hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-accuses-bjp-of-insulting-national-anthem-starts-poll-on-social-media-101612102781228.html

A letter by the principal of the school named Jamia Sirajul Uloom, that was submitted along with the army’s complaint also stated that there was ‘no pressure’ by the army to organize Republic Day celebrations.Police officials said that they have filed the FIR on Saturday under sections 153 and 505 after receiving a complaint from the Company commander of the army’s 44 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) at Imam Sahib in Shopian against online news portals The Kashmir Walla and Kashmiriyat.“Army has said it is fake news and the school authorities have also denied any force by the army. We have filed an FIR against the two portals after the complaint by the army,” Shopian’s superintendent of police (SP), Amritpal Singh said.The Kashmir Walla and Kashmiriyat had carried byline stories on January 27 quoting the chairman of Jamia Sirajul Uloom, a private school in Shopian, that they were allegedly pressured to celebrate the Republic Day event by the army. Attempts to contact the chairman M Yousuf Mantoo on his phone did not succeed.Editor of The Kashmir Walla, Fahad Shah said that they stood by their story. “We stand by our reporting and we have ample evidence to prove that when the time will come. We spoke to the senior most official of the school who said everything on record. Now after three days they have remembered that it was ‘fake news’. The school authorities have also become unreachable,” Shah said.He said that after they broke the story, the other news portal also talked to the school authorities and reported it. He said that they are used to getting calls and summons from the authorities for the work they are doing.News editor of Kashmiriyat, Qazi Shibli said that they were honest in their reporting. We reported what the school authorities said and also attempted to get the reaction of the army officials who were not immediately available for comment. We had even mentioned updating the story in case the army responds but nobody called us from their side,” he said.The school was in news in October last year after three teachers were booked under the Public Safety Act after reports emerged that a few of its students and alumni were found involved in militant activities over a period of time.Inspector General of Police, Vijay Kumar had said that three of the institution's teachers were booked under PSA and action under section 107 CrPC was also taken against six of its teachers.The IG had said that the school was affiliated to Jamaat-e-Islami which was denied by the chairman of the school, M Yousuf who had said that it was an independent institution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-2-kashmir-news-portals-after-army-complains-of-fake-news-101612099960070.html

Our leaders at protest sites and our panch (leaders of the panchayat) will make decisions and we all will follow them,” he added.The two-month-long protest against the farm laws appeared to be losing steam after widespread violence during a tractor parade by farmers on the Republic Day, but an emotional appeal by BKU leader Rakesh Tikait gave it a fresh lease of life with thousands of farmers gathering at the Gazipur protest site and the 'mahapanchayats' from western UP extending support to the stir.The farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP, have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-thousands-converge-for-third-mahapanchayat-in-western-up-101612100175125.html

31-01-2021||India||Delhi Congress passes resolution to make Rahul Gandhi party president||Congress’ Delhi unit on Sunday passed a resolution asking party leader and Wayanad lawmaker Rahul Gandhi to once again take over as the president with immediate effect, days after the organisation announced that a new chief would be elected in June. Delhi unit chief Anil Kumar said in the resolution that the Congress party needs a dynamic and powerful leader like Gandhi at the helm considering the disturbed and dangerous political situation in the country.Congress needs Gandhi to lead the party forcefully, to counter the communal, authoritarian and undemocratic forces, trying to take the country on the path of destruction, the resolution stated. Gandhi had resigned as the Congress president in 2019 after the party suffered a humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and despite several similar calls to return as the chief he has not come back."Rahulji has been waging a determined battle to expose the misdeeds of the Modi Government, and his leading from the front as the Congress President was an urgent need to boost the confidence and morale of the Congress workers," Kumar said.The unit also passed two more resolutions seeking the resignations of Union home minister Amit Shah and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for their failures. Echoing the views of opposition parties on the Republic Day violence, the Delhi unit said that the furore during the farmers' tractor rally was because of infiltration by some anti-social elements.The resolution also alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government passed the three contentious farm laws with ulterior motives and without any discussion with stakeholders — the farmers’ unions and the opposition. Attacking the government at city-state level, the resolution said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led government has ruined Delhi in every possible manner, as time and again. "It has proved that it was incompetent to steer Delhi clear of the difficult situations, like addressing the Covid crisis, pollution, unemployment and general economic distress among the people," the resolution stated.The Delhi unit also observed a two-minute silence to pay homage to the Congress workers and leaders, farmers and frontline workers who died because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the last few months. The homage was paid to former president Pranab Mukherjee, Ahmed Patel, Motilal Vohra, Tarun Gogoi and Shaukat Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-congress-passes-resolution-to-make-rahul-gandhi-party-president-101612099191956.html

31-01-2021||India||India to come out of Covid-19 pandemic as one of the global winners, says Danish envoy||Denmark on Sunday said India is going to come out of the coronavirus pandemic as one of the "global winners", and it was looking forward to majorly expand bilateral cooperation in areas of clean energy, water and food processing under a green strategic partnership.Ambassador of Denmark Freddy Svane said several leading Danish companies were interested in investing in areas like renewable energy, environment, shipping and innovation in India.Svane told PTI that foreign ministers of the two countries are working on an ambitious action plan comprising specific targets to achieve the goals broadly mentioned in the 'India-Denmark Green Strategic Partnership'.The green partnership, finalised at a virtual summit between the prime ministers of the two countries, aims to create a framework for significant expansion of cooperation in areas of renewable energy, environment, economy, climate change and science and technology."It is a partnership of the new age as it is really focusing on a green transition," Svane said.The Danish ambassador said the two countries are also working on another track called 'advanced plan' focusing on the expansion of cooperation with specific targets in areas of water, energy and financing of projects to be implemented under the green partnership.He said Denmark is looking at offering its expertise to India in preserving as well as ensuring judicious use of water besides boosting cooperation in the production of offshore and onshore wind energy.On post-Covid recovery, Denmark was confident that India was going to come out stronger from the pandemic."I think India is going to come out of the pandemic as one of the global winners. The number of Covid-19 cases in India has gone down drastically while in Europe, we have a spike," Svane said."I am pretty sure that India will be able to sustain the actual development and that will help the country in the long-run. India needs to stand on its own feet; needs to pursue its own interest," the envoy added.He said a strong pro-active India is in the interest of the world.Asked whether he was confident of India's post-Covid economic recovery, Svane said he was "pretty optimistic"."India has already proved its capabilities and capacities. India really built the future not only the present by effectively handling the situation (following the pandemic). India also looked at the future. Built some fantastic systems," he added.He also mentioned how India reached out to several countries and supplied medicines initially, and is sending coronavirus vaccines now to help them deal with the pandemic."India will develop whatever happens. India has now really, I think, realised that we should not just keep ourselves for ourselves, it is not India for India but it is India for the world," he said.The Danish envoy said his country was confident of deeper cooperation and collaboration with India in the 'green' initiative as it feels Prime Minister Narendra Modi would like to drive the country's growth and development in a green and sustainable way.Asked about the stalled negotiations between India and the European Union on a free trade agreement, he exuded confidence of forward movement on it.Launched in June 2007, the FTA talks have been stalled since May 2013, when both sides failed to bridge substantial gaps on crucial issues, including data security status for the IT sector.The ambassador also favoured having investment protection pacts between India and European countries."Denmark is a free trade loving nation. In order to ensure that companies doing private investments have proper kind of protection, we think it is highly needed. We would like to see progress on it. We were very happy with the last India-EU summit which added some momentum on it," he said.India's bilateral investment protection treaties with individual European countries have lapsed in the last few years. The EU wanted the pacts to continue until they are replaced by the FTA which will have provisions for investment protection.The India-EU summit last year resolved to move forward on the long-pending FTA talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-come-out-of-covid-19-pandemic-as-one-of-the-global-winners-says-danish-envoy-101612098563959.html

He has himself tried hard to bring the same agriculture reforms earlier," the agriculture minister said.Tomar was referring to Pawar’s position as the Union agriculture minister for 10 years in prime minister Manmohan Singh-led government.On Saturday, Pawar had posted six tweets in he said that the new central laws will adversely affect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and it will also weaken the mandi system. Pawar also said that he is concerned about the amended Essential Commodities Act. "According to the act the Govt will intervene for price control only if rates of horticultural produce are increased by 100% and that of non-perishable items increase by 50%. Stock piling limits have been removed on food grain, pulses, onion, potato, oilseeds etc. It may lead to apprehensions that Corporates may purchase commodities at lower rates and stock pile and sell at higher prices to consumers,” he wrote on Twitter.Also Read | You have a responsibility: AAP’s Raghav Chadha writes to Punjab CM, demands security for protestersHe further said, “Reform is a continuous process and no one would argue against the reforms in the APMCs or Mandi System, a positive argument on the same does not mean that it is done to weaken or demolish the system.” "During my tenure, the draft APMC Rules - 2007 were framed for the setting up of special markets thereby providing alternate platforms for farmers to market their commodities and utmost care was also taken to strengthen the existing Mandi system," Pawar also said.Tends of thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than two months now against the new farm laws. They are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the leaders of the farmers but has failed to bring any resolution to the matter so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-he-will-change-stand-on-farm-laws-agriculture-minister-responds-to-sharad-pawar-s-criticism-101612095292283.html
31-01-2021||India||Healthcare likely to get top priority in Budget 2021: Survey||India's healthcare sector is likely to get the maximum attention of the government in the upcoming Budget to be unveiled on Monday, as it comes in the face of the country braving a once-in-a-century global pandemic, says a survey. The Assocham-Primus Partners survey covered more than 550 industry participants, and 39.7 per cent respondents said healthcare would receive the highest priority in terms of resource allocation and policy support in the Budget. Manufacturing emerged as the second key sector expected to be in focus, with 14.7 per cent respondents expecting it to receive the Finance Minister's attention, followed by MSMEs (11.4 per cent), real estate (10.7 per cent) and infrastructure (9.6 per cent).“The Covid-19 pandemic tested the limits of the global healthcare system. While the government's proactive measures and the frontline workers' tireless efforts have helped tide the way, the pandemic has also brought forth the fragility of the healthcare system," the survey stated. Also read| Why is India called the world’s pharmacy? Here are 160 million reasonsOn measures which can strengthen the healthcare and pharma sector, 67.3 per cent respondents expect the allocation of a fund to modernise existing primary healthcare infrastructure. This was followed by an expectation (by 62.9 per cent) that the government should increase investments in creating new primary healthcare infrastructure.With regard to aspirations of individual taxpayers, 79.3 per cent respondents said they would like to see a cut in personal income tax rates, especially in the wake of pressure on their earnings in the pandemic-hit economy.While corporate tax rates have been reduced, individuals pay taxes at higher rates. Rationalising taxes for the individuals is critical as reducing the tax burden on individuals would enable further spending. According to the survey, this much-needed push to demand would help in creating a multiplier effect in the economy. Also read| What the Union Budget needs to get right"A significant increase in the public expenditure is inevitable. The pandemic has taught us there are no choices other than large scale public investment in building primary health centres, hospitals at the district, state capital level," Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.As has been stated in the Economic Survey, there is a strong feeling within the government to raise public expenditure on healthcare three-fold from 1 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP, he added. Moreover, Sood said, at the same time, to support the economic health of the nation, amidst the rising green shoots of recovery, the upcoming Budget must frontload infrastructure investments. "The Budget's allocation towards infrastructure and housing development will create a much-needed multiplier impact in the economy," he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-likely-to-get-top-priority-in-budget-2021-survey-101612090394007.html

With the Shivalik Arboretum, we have tried to conserve these species while spreading awareness about them,” said Chaturvedi.The arboretum was inaugurated by Ajay Singh Rawat, a noted environmentalist from Uttarakhand.The Shivalik Arboretum has over 210 tree and shrub species, making it one of the biggest arboretum in the state, officials said. Some of the trees preserved include, Kafal (Myrica esculenta), Buransh, (Rhododendron arboretum), Tejpat (Cinnamomum tamala) and Sanjeevani (Sellaginella bryopteris).“Our aim is to ensure proper nature education among people and that they should be able to feel an emotional connect with the trees, making them more active towards conservation. For this, we have tried to place story telling placards, where every tree tells its own stories of origin, importance and significance,” added Chaturvedi.The placards showcase information like scientific information about particular species, cultural significance, medicinal use, country of origin, type of habitat in which it is found and all possible uses including as timber, dyes or any other peculiar use.The forest department has also tried to link poems and other literary pieces written about trees found in the Shivalik ranges.“There are famous poems or couplets written by lyricists like Gulzar or famous poets like Sumitranandan Pant about trees found in the Shivalik ranges. We have put up posters of these literary pieces along with the trees, to make it more engaging for people. This will help people remember about the trees and they can further spread awareness among their peers,” he added.Last year under its biggest conservation initiative to protect Himalayan flora, the forest department’s research wing, following three-year-long fieldwork, had created a repository of 1145 plant species, including 68 threatened, rare and vulnerable species, aimed at their germplasm conservation so that these species remain conserved in case they disappear from the wild due to any reason.Apart from trees, the arboretum also conserves species of cane, moss, lichen and ferns found in the Shivalik range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-sets-up-first-arboretum-for-shivalik-range-with-210-species-of-trees-101612094988675.html

Soon after the forces reached the area, the Maoists opened fire at them. In the ensuing gun battle that last for around 3 hours, a Maoist was killed.“We found the body of a Maoist in the camp along with a pistol and a rifle. There were several other items in the camp. We can identify the deceased through surrendered Maoists,” said inspector general of police(operations) Amitabh Thakur.In a separate development, two of three villagers in Kandhamal district who were abducted by Maoists on suspicion of them being police informers were released.Police said Rauta Majhi and Gobinda Majhi of Gumu village under Belghar police station area were picked up by Maoists on Saturday along with one Debendra Majhi.

We (BJP) would reach the target of winning more than 200 assembly seats set by Shah (home minister Amit Shah) in the coming elections. Today, people of Bengal are frustrated. There is no employment, no industry...law and order has reached the rock-bottom. The government has done nothing for the minority and has just used them as a vote bank,” former TMC heavyweight Banerjee, while floating the slogan “Cholun Paltai (let’s change)”.Six TMC leaders, including a former minister, joined the BJP at Shah’s residence in New Delhi on Saturday evening. They were flown to Delhi in a chartered plane after Shah’s two-day trip to West Bengal had to be cancelled because of a minor blast in the national capital. Smriti Irani began her speech in Bengali. “You (Mamata Banerjee) have deprived the farmers of Bengal for two years from central benefits. It is because in TMC no work is done unless you get cut money. Where there is theft there is TMC. So people of Bengal have decided that this time TMC will go out and BJP will come in,” she added. Top BJP leaders hinted that more TMC leaders from Kolkata and South 24 Parganas, two bastions of the state’s ruling party, could join the BJP over the next three weeks. Several district level leaders of the TMC and Congress joined the BJP in Sunday’s programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-joining-bjp-former-tmc-minister-lashes-out-at-mamata-govt-101612091368138.html

Addressing a rally online at Howrah in south Bengal, Shah said: “I want to ask this rally whether the Mamata Banerjee-government would be able to stop this infiltration. Only the Narendra Modi government can stop this.” Shah was scheduled to visit West Bengal on a two-day visit, but had to cancel the trip after a blast outside the Israeli mission in New Delhi on Friday. “The Trinamool Congress has taken Bengal further down from where the Left had left the state ten years ago. Didi had raised slogans of change. One of the slogans was “Ma, Mati, Manush” (mother, soil and people). But later it vanished and was replaced by dictatorship, nepotism and extortion,” he added. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party will bring about the promised change. Shah assured that he would soon come to Bengal. “The way people are joining the BJP from TMC by the time elections come Mamata Banerjee will be left alone,” he added. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-seat legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-govt-has-given-free-access-to-infiltrators-amit-shah-101612089024341.html

Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Sood's advocate had argued in HC.As per the BMC, the Bollywood actor had carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building ''Shakti Sagar'', and allegedly converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions.The BMC earlier this month also filed a complaint at the Juhu police station, seeking an FIR to be lodged against Sood for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without permission.The complaint letter was sent to the police after the BMC inspected the building and found that Sood had allegedly not complied with the requisitions and was continuing unauthorised construction even after the notice was served to him in October last year. The police is yet to register FIR in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonu-sood-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-illegal-construction-notice-101612086659162.html

The vaccine supplies include about 10 million doses in gifts, which in the first round, focused on India’s extended neighbourhood.India has received formal and informal requests for the vaccine from 60 countries that are home to more than one-fifth of humanity, an external affairs ministry official said.According to available figures, India’s Serum Institute has already dispatched 14.5 million doses of the vaccine to 11 countries. Apart from countries in the neighbourhood, the recipients for the shot developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University include Brazil and Morocco, who were supplied on a commercial basis. The external affairs ministry targets dispatching a total of 33 million doses this month."There are as many as 30 countries who have written to India formally and an equal number who have asked for the vaccine informally. Then there are countries like Afghanistan who have done neither but India is committed to supplying. We are planning to send 10 million doses to Africa alone. The 30 countries that have formally asked India for vaccine include Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Serbia, Guyana (CARICOM), Egypt, Morocco, Maldives, Mauritius, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, Iran, Brazil, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, St Kitts and Nevis, Mongolia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Philippines, Algeria, Tunisia, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini and Kenya," a top government official said.Also read | Now, SII seeks trial approval for Novavax Covid vaccineIn February, according to documents seen by HT, India intends to fly 60 million doses to friendly countries across the world, right from Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, Papua New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific Ocean to Nauru, the world’s smallest island nation near Australia.

31-01-2021||India||Uncertainty over Bombay HC judge behind controversial POCSO rulings||Uncertainty looms over the future of justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court after the Supreme Court collegium, in an unprecedented step, withdrew its proposal to make her a permanent judge in the high court in view of her controversial rulings on sexual assault on children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).Justice Ganediwala’s fate hangs in the balance since her tenure as an additional judge ends on February 12 and if the SC collegium, headed by the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, decides not to extend her term as an additional judge, she will cease to be a judge.Under the constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum period of two years unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium to the Central government, or the tenure can be extended for up to two years, pending review of the judge’s performance.Justice Ganediwala has courted controversies after a series of her judgments on the interpretation of the POCSO Act came under severe criticism. In January 19 ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not a case of sexual assault but only of molestation, since there was no ‘skin to skin’ contact. This judgment was stayed by a Supreme Court bench, led by the CJI, on Wednesday. In another judgment on January 15, the woman judge had ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault.”On Saturday, officials in the law ministry and the Supreme Court confirmed to HT that the collegium has recalled its recommendation to make justice Ganediwala a permanent judge in the Bombay HC. On January 20, the SC collegium had passed a resolution, and the file had reached the law ministry a day later.However, the officials added, on January 25, a missive was sent by the SC collegium requesting for a withdrawal of the proposal to make justice Ganediwala a permanent judge. The note by the SC collegium stated that the proposal regarding the woman judge was to be reviewed again.The law ministry then sent the file back with a short note that the proposal was being returned on a request by the collegium and that if a fresh proposal with respect to justice Ganediwala was to be sent again, the ministry will need around a week to process it.“This is unprecedented. There has been no such instance when after sending a proposal to the government for appointing an additional judge as a permanent judge, the collegium has, in less than a week’s time, withdrawn its recommendation,” said a law ministry official, who didn’t wish to be named.Meanwhile, officials in the top court have said that the CJI, who has Bombay HC as his parent high court, consulted the two other most senior judges in the collegium, justices NV Ramana and Rohinton F Nariman, before taking this unparalleled step.Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, who also hail from Bombay HC as their parent high court, had also drawn the CJI’s attention to the contentious judgments by the woman judge, imploring the CJI to withdraw the proposal.After this move by the collegium, a state of doubt prevails over justice Ganediwala’s continuance as a high court judge. According to the high court rules and the pertinent norms, justice Ganediwala, 42, cannot be sent back to the subordinate judiciary either as a sessions judge or a district judge.There are some other options also available with the SC collegium. It can extend justice Ganediwala’s term for any term between six months and two years for reviewing her performance.Alternatively, the collegium may also choose to send a proposal to the government after February 12 to appoint her as an additional judge, but that would make her appointment as good as a fresh one, and a break in her service will adversely impact justice Ganediwala’s seniority.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan told HT: “It is not a wrong step taken by the chief justice. It is not a simple decision but if there is a judgment which is in flagrant violation of the law, a chief justice is entitled to not make an additional judge a permanent judge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uncertainty-over-bombay-hc-judge-behind-controversial-pocso-rulings-101612087417805.html

The focus would now be on the 114 fighter jets project," government sources told ANI.The IAF has already issued the Request for Information for the tender and would be soon moving a proposal for getting the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) before the Defence Ministry for the multi-billion dollar project which would enable it to acquire 4.5 plus generation aircraft in large numbers to match the capabilities of the omni role Rafale fighters 36 of which have started getting inducted from last year.Also read| What to expect from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2021-22The Request for Information (RFI) has been responded to by several global players including fighter jet manufacturers from the US, France, Russia and Sweden.While the Americans are offering from the F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Super Hornet and an F-16 variant by the name of F-21, the Russians are likely to offer the MiG-35 and a Sukhoi fighter. Sweden's Saab is looking to pitch in with its Gripen fighter aircraft which it says is far more advanced than the one which was offered in 2007 to the Indian Air Force. France would be participating in the tender with the Rafale fighter jets.Recently, Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had termed the Rafale as one of the strong contenders for the 114 fighter acquisition project.Sources said that for selection in the project, the main aspects would be the capabilities of the aircraft on offer along with the price at which it is offered. The Indian Air Force is also developing the parameters on which it will select the fighters which would be both single-engine and double-engine and would create a level-playing field for them in the competition.Also read| First part of Rajya Sabha’s Budget Session to end on Feb 13Whichever aircraft is selected by the Air Force would remain the mainstay of the force for almost next four decades and would be required to be fully integrated with the Su-30MKI fighters which would be the mainstay in terms of numbers as 272 of them would be inducted by next year.The 114 aircraft would also be Made in India and the foreign firms would be required to do a transfer of technology to the Indian partner as part of government's initiative to create a strong domestic defence industry under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme.Lagging behind the neighbours in terms of fighter aircraft inductions, the Indian Air Force has got deals for 119 of them in the last four years. While in September 2016, it signed a deal for 36 Rafale fighters, it would be signing the deal with a Public Sector Undertaking in next few days for 83 LCA Mark 1A Tejas fighters. In recent times, it has also operationalised two squadrons of the LCA Tejas mark 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-to-focus-on-rs-1-3-lakh-crore-deal-for-114-fighter-jets-101612085496300.html

The government is not only suffering revenue loss due to illegal mining but also unnecessarily, the department’s image is tarnished,” the official mentioned above, said.The standing committee has recommended de-notifying the sanctuary area to SBWL. Once the SBWL approves, it will be further recommended to the National Board of Wildlife, said the official.Bharatpur district collector Nathmal Didel said the mining, forest and revenue departments have studied the area of Banshi Pahadpur and found that there was no forest cover or animals for the last three decades. “We are trying to de-notify the area of sanctuary to permit mining. If the mining is legalised, it would not only generate revenue but also create employment,” he said.A recommendation has been made to de-notify around 643ha of 2000-hectare land of Banshi Pahadpur wildlife sanctuary for mining, he said.A retired IFS official, on condition of anonymity, said this would be the second such instance, when a forest land would be de-notified in the state. Earlier in 2017, the Rajasthan government had de-notified 357.23 hectares of Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, falling in Bundi town and adjoining villages, paving the way for the residents of these areas to avail benefits of various development schemes.He said the first instance was for housing, “but today it’s for mining - what precedent are we setting,” he asked.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been sourcing stones from the Banshi Pahadpur hills for the construction of the Ram Temple for the past five years, had approached the Bharatpur district administration over a delay in supply of stones in September-October 2020.Also Read: Rajasthan launches health insurance scheme, 1.10 crore families to benefitThe district administration had then said that the stones were being illegally mined after three trucks, loaded with the pink sandstones, were seized on September 27 in a joint operation of the police, forest and revenue departments.An official of the district administration said, “The pink and yellow sandstone is in high demand. Illegal mining activity in the area feeds processing units in the district. The district administration takes action against illegal mining randomly.”According to the state mines department officials, until December 1996, around 42 legal mines of pink, red and yellow sandstone operated in the Banshi Pahadpur forest area. However, the Supreme Court prohibited non-forest activities in forest areas without diversion under the Forest Act through its order dated December 12, 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-panel-wants-forest-area-supplying-stones-for-ram-temple-denotified-101612086699361.html

Raut, in his weekly column, said the politics is driving the country towards instability.The Sena leader in his column RokhThok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, said that the ill-treatment of the farmers’ from Punjab, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, would spark unrest in the country.On January 26, during the farmers’ tractor rally, groups of farmers deviated from the assigned routes, broke through security barriers and clashed with security personnel in several parts of Delhi. They also vandalised property and entered the Red Fort, where they hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag.Raut said that the events of January 26 could have been avoided by the Centre. He alleged that the ‘infiltration’ at Red Fort was engineered to cause a split among the protesting farmers.Raut also questioned the silence of PM Modi and Amit Shah over the entire issue. “Neither the Prime Minister has spoken, nor has our home minister. Modi and Shah are leading the country by occupying constitutional posts. Such a treatment of Punjab’s farmers is sparking unrest in the country,” the Sena leader wrote.He further added, “The country has once experienced what happens when a spark of revolt is lit in the Sikhs. Therefore, linking the farmer’s stir to Punjab’s issues and causing unrest in Punjab should not happen. The government has engineered a split in the farmers’ protest. The infiltration at Red Fort was done to cause a split. Politics is driving the country toward instability. This needs to be stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-ill-treatment-by-pm-modi-shah-may-trigger-unrest-sanjay-raut-101612085281122.html
31-01-2021||India||India monsoon season likely to be ‘normal’ in 2021: Report||India should experience a “normal” June-September monsoon season as the effects of the La Nina weather pattern ease, according to a report by Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd.“There is sufficient cooling in the Pacific Ocean now and La Nina conditions are at the peak,” the private forecaster said on its website on Sunday, adding that initial readings indicate that there are still risks in some areas.The monsoon season is considered normal when total rains are recorded between 96% and 104% of the national average of just over 88 centimeters (45 inches), according to the weather office.The monsoon season is critical for Indian agriculture as it not only irrigates fields directly, but also fills reservoirs for crops sown in the winter. The season shapes the livelihood of millions and influences food prices. Insufficient rain in the country, the world’s second-largest producer of rice and wheat, often leads to drinking-water shortages, lower crop output and higher imports of commodities such as edible oils.About 60% to 90% of the country’s total annual rainfall occurs during the four-month monsoon season across different states, except the southern state of Tamil Nadu, which gets only about 35% of its annual rainfall during the period, according to the India Meteorological Department.Last year, the monsoon was driven by the La Nina phenomenon -- when the equatorial Pacific cools - which is peaking at present. La Nina will decline during the spring and turn neutral later through the monsoon season, Skymet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-monsoon-season-likely-to-be-normal-in-2021-report-101612083837077.html

The decision has been arrived at to give more time to the standing committees of the House to examine the demand for grants—or individual budget—of different ministries. Before the Union budget is passed by the Lok Sabha, both Houses of Parliament examine the annual budget of select ministries for a better review of the overall budgetary procedure by the lawmakers. “It was decided that instead of the scheduled sitting on the 15th of this month as the last of the first part of the Budget session, the House will sit on the 13th before adjourning to enable the Department Related Parliamentary Committees to examine Demands for Grants of various departments and ministries,” according to a press release issued after the all-party meeting. In the meeting, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu issued an appeal to leaders of various parties and groups in the House for effective functioning during the ongoing Budget session. Despite some major disruptions, the Rajya Sabha has been able to utilize nearly 100% of its time in the last four sessions. According to the officials, various parties have assured there will be full participation in all the debates and discussions in the House. The meeting was attended by at least six ministers and 25 leaders of various parties. As the schedule in the Rajya Sabha will undergo a change, Naidu asked the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Prahlad Joshi, to rework the time schedule for debates on President’s address and the general budget. Naidu observed that these two discussions offer ample opportunities to the members to reflect on a wide range of issues for which more time may be allocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rajya-sabha-first-part-of-budget-session-will-adjourn-on-feb-13-101612084709572.html

31-01-2021||India||Assam, Arunachal CMs will be responsible if abducted oil company employees die:ULFA-I||The banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) has warned that the chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be responsible if two abducted employees of a private oil drilling company die in an “undesired incident”. In a release issued on Saturday, the banned outfit accused CMs of the two states of using “delaying tactics” instead of trying to secure release of the employees of Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company. “Instead of finding ways to end the prisoner exchange conflict between ULFA-I and Quippo, the Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs are using delaying tactics and launched a weeklong effort to secure the release of the two officials through military operation,” the ULFA-I release said. “The nod to initiate the operation was given by Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs. Chiefs of the Unified Command have been entrusted the task of making the operation successful along with defence, military, civil and Assam Police intelligence establishments,” it added. Pranab Kumar Gogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, were abducted by a group of miscreants on December 21 from the company’s drilling location in Diyun in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district. Gogoi is a resident of Sivasagar district in Assam while Kumar hails from Khagaria district in Bihar. The company operates oil and gas drilling sites in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. “In these circumstances, we are sure that instead of getting the officials released alive, the Indian establishment wants to end their operation by killing the two and putting the entire blame on ULFA-I,” the ULFA-I release said. “Therefore, it is certain that in the coming days during the operation launched by Unified Command, the two Quippo employees could die in an undesired incident. If that happens, the entire blame of it would have to be borne by the Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs and the Indian forces,” it added. On January 28, ULFA-I had issued a statement giving a February 16 deadline to Quippo to secure the release of its employees. If the deadline is not met, the outfit warned it would take action against Kumar, who hails from Bihar. On January 20, ULFA-I had released a video of the two abducted employees where they appealed to the chief ministers of Assam and Bihar to secure their release. On January 12, ULFA-I commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told local TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a “victim” if the company didn’t pay the outfit it’s “due share” for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region. Baruah added that Gogoi, who’s an Assamese, won’t be harmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-arunachal-cms-will-be-responsible-if-abducted-oil-company-employees-dieulfai-101612081284033.html

She used the flag despite statements by the AIADMK leadership not to take her back into the party fold.After consultations with an astrologer, Sasikala had decided to get discharged on Sunday just after 12.00 pm.Sasikala was declared fit to be discharged on Saturday by medical authorities at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMRCI, Victoria Hospital) where she was being treated for Covid-19 since January 21.“Sasikala will be staying in a place around 30-35 km from here (hospital) but she will not be going to Tamil Nadu. She has to undergo a week of quarantine and probably, by around the 6th or 7th of February, she may return,” said one person in the know of things.Her nephew and head of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) TTV Dinakaran is likely to announce the details of her return to Tamil Nadu.People aware of the developments said that they are preparing a grand welcome for the 66-year-old leader into her home state which will head to the polls in a few months.A convoy of at least 10 cars left the hospital with Sasikala, who was wearing a mask and gloves and bowed to all her supporters from inside the vehicle.Several of her supporters gathered outside the hospital, screaming “Vazhga chinnamma” or long live Chinnamma (or mother’s sister) as she is fondly known among her supporters who were seen carrying photographs of Sasikala, her nephew and late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa.Traffic came to a standstill as her convoy moved in the streets in a procession-like fashion. The police and her supporters were seen running alongside the car to clear any obstructions even as some people stopped and showered her car with flowers.At least four body guards clung on to the car from the outside as it passed through Bengaluru heavy traffic.Sasikala had completed her four-year prison term on 27 January.Sasikala and two others-- Ilavarasi and VN Sudhakaran--were convicted by the Supreme Court in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case on 14 February 2017, upholding a 27 September 2014 order by a special court in Tamil Nadu that also levied ₹10 crore fine each.Her release comes months ahead of assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, where the AIADMK is expected to face a stiff challenge from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) .Sasikala was convicted by the SC when she was in the middle of a bitter struggle with O Panneerselvam, the deputy chief minister.Sasikala had handpicked Edapaddi Palaniswami for the CM’s role, over current deputy CM O Paneerselvam, who had officiated in that role through all of Jayalalithaa’s illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikalas-car-displays-aiadmk-flag-amid-chinnamma-chant-by-fans-after-discharge-101612078601620.html

The leader was a close confidante of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa. Though Sasikala hasn’t contested or campaigned in elections, she has the backing of a support base within the AIADMK and a breakaway faction- AMMK. Her discharge from hospital, a few days after she was released from jail, has created a flutter in Tamil Nadu politics in the election year. While All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) has firmly stated that Sasikala will not be allowed to return to the party fold, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), floated by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran, has planned an elaborate welcome for her.Sasikala’s life and political career has been full of controversies including the infamous disproportionate assets case, which led to her imprisonment for four years.

The court abated the charges against Jayalalithaa, who died in December 2016.Sasikala had already served six months in jail. The trial court had sentenced Sasikala and her two relatives to four years imprisonment with a fine of Rs10 crore each. Jayalalithaa was sentenced to four years with a fine of Rs100 crore.Also Read: Tamil Nadu's ruling alliance uneasy ahead of VK Sasikala's returnFebruary 15, 2017: Sasikala surrenders before the trial court in Bengaluru.

Addressing the nation on his monthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', the Prime Minister said that Made-in-India vaccines were not only a symbol of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) but also a symbol of the country's self-pride.He reiterated that the world’s largest immunisation drive is underway in India and added, “We are vaccinating our citizens faster than anywhere in the world. In just 15 days, India has vaccinated over 30 lakh corona warriors, whereas an advanced country such as America took 18 days to get the same done; Britain took 36 days.”PM Modi asserted that India is serving the world in times of crisis. “India is capable, self-reliant in the field of medicines, vaccines. The same thought underpins the Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign. The more India is capable, the more will it serve humanity; correspondingly the world will benefit more,” he said.Also Read: 'India was shocked to see insult of Tricolour on Republic Day', says PM ModiThe Prime Minister also spoke about one of the messages he received through the NamoApp from one Kirti in Madurai, who told Modi that many of her foreign friends have been messaging her thanking India for the way India helped the world in the fight against Covid-19. The PM told the Tamil Nadu resident, “These days, I too receive similar messages for India from Presidents and Prime Ministers of different countries of the world." He referred to President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro’s tweet thanking India for helping with export of vaccines. Bolsonaro also tweeted a picture of Lord Hanuman carrying a mountain with vaccines from India to Brazil. The illustration is inspired by the tale in the Ramayana where Lord Hanuman carries an entire mountain to deliver the Sanjeevani herb to Sri Lanka, to save the life of Lakshmana, the brother of Lord Rama, when he was injured in a battle."People residing thousands of kilometres away in remote corners of the world are deeply aware of that context in Ramayan; they are intensely influenced by it. This is a speciality of our culture,” PM Modi said.PM Modi was addressing the first 73rd episode of Mann Ki Baat, which is this year’s first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/made-in-india-covid-19-vaccines-a-symbol-of-nation-s-self-pride-pm-modi-101612076572385.html

The immediate trigger was a video shared by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders which shows Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal speaking in favour of the three laws.The video is doctored, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Sisodia said.Addressing a press conference on the issue, Sisodia said that he felt sad that the BJP had to post an edited version of the Delhi CM’s video in order to establish credibility for the laws.The 18-second clip showed that Kejriwal was listing out the benefits of the new farm laws such as MSP would remain, farmers would be able to sell their produce across India and added that this was a revolutionary step in the agriculture sector in the last 70 years.Y'day BJP & its spokesperson posted a doctored video of Arvind Kejriwal ji stating benefits of farm laws.

31-01-2021||India||Amit Shah to virtually address Bengal rally while BJP placates Matuas||Union home minister Amit Shah, who had to cancel his two-day West Bengal trip in the wake of an explosion outside the Israel embassy in Delhi on Friday, is scheduled to virtually address a rally in Howrah on Sunday to bolster BJP’s campaign in the poll bound eastern state.Union minister Smriti Irani and some former Trinamool Congress leaders, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday, are expected to attack the state’s ruling party from the same platform.Initially, the former TMC leaders were supposed to join the BJP in Shah's presence at the rally at Dumurjala in Howrah on Sunday.Meanwhile, following the cancellation of Shah’s visit to the state, signs of disgruntlement were showing among a section of the Matuas at Thakurnagar in North 24 Parganas district.Top BJP leaders, including the party’s national vice president Mukul Roy and national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, had to rush to Thakurnagar on Saturday to placate the community.Matuas are part of a Hindu Dalit community, headed by their supreme body, All India Matua Mahasangha, which is headquartered at Thakurnagar in North 24-Parganas district. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the sect’s young face, Shantanu Thakur, contested on a BJP ticket and defeated his aunt, TMC’s Mamata Bala Thakur.“The dais is not being dismantled. Shah would come to Thakurnagar any day soon with a few hours’ notice,” said Roy.A few hundred Matuas from across Bengal had gathered at Thakurnagar to listen to Shah’s speech. The Matuas were expecting some statement from the Union home minister over the CAA and the NRC during his now-cancelled rally in Thakurnagar. A sizable chunk of the Hindu refugees belong to backward communities and that adds a caste factor to the political tussle over the amended citizenship law.Also Read: Irani to address Howrah rally in place of Shah, more TMC leader may join BJPThe TMC said that the BJP had insulted the Matua community.“The BJP has nothing to give and has insulted the Matuas. They (the BJP) won’t be able to make any announcement on citizenship and hence cancelled the meeting. The Matua community needs to understand that the BJP is misleading them,” said Mamata Bala Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-virtually-address-bengal-rally-while-bjp-placates-matuas-101612073150866.html

31-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu assembly election: BJP focuses on central schemes to make a mark||BJP president JP Nadda’s formal announcement of fighting the Tamil Nadu assembly elections, expected in April-May this year, in alliance with the state’s ruling AIADMK, has put the focus back on the saffron party’s bid to gain a foothold in a state it has found difficult to penetrate. Nadda, and the party he leads, are hoping to cash in on the Centre’s social welfare and other centrally-sponsored schemes to earn an edge over the opposition in Tamil Nadu, where its presence is nascent.The benefits that it accrued in state elections held recently in Bihar, where the delivery of central schemes, especially those targeted at women, were credited for helping script the National Democratic Alliance’s victory, have raised the party’s hopes of benefitting from the delivery of funds for programmes such as housing in rural and urban areas; PM Kisan Nidhi and urban infrastructure.This is in addition to the women specific schemes that the AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa had introduced in her six terms as chief minister. Tamil Nadu has a history of schemes such as free medicines, health insurance and pension to the needy, which were later replicated nationally. However, the AIADMK has been facing allegations of corruption in implementation of these schemes.A senior BJP functionary, speaking on condition of anonymity, said though the party has opted to contest the 2021 assembly election as an ally of the ruling AIADMK; it will focus on the impact of centrally sponsored schemes on providing livelihood, housing, and improving urban infrastructure.“The opposition created falsehoods about the state being neglected. Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi himself set the record straight (in 2018), when he said that there has been an increase of about 120% in the allocation for the state. When the Congress-led UPA was in power at the centre, Tamil Nadu got just ₹81,000 crore under the 13th Finance Commission, but under the BJP-led NDA regime, it increased to ₹180,000 crore under the 14th Finance Commission,” the functionary said.The assertion that the state has been better-off under the NDA rule was made again in November this year by Union home minister Amit Shah during his visit to Chennai. Shah, who laid foundation stones for various infrastructure projects worth about Rs. 70,000 crore said, “The schemes and funds provided to Tamil Nadu by the Central government are not meant for help, but it is the right of Tamil Nadu that was not being given to it. Modi ji ensured that now Tamil Nadu gets its rights."He cited numbers to buttress the claims. 15% of Tamil Nadu's 1.42 crore rural households had drinking water connections thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme for piped water in every household, he said, adding that by 2024 drinking water will be provided to 1.20 crore families.He also stated that while the previous government had waived off loans of only 60,000 crore in 10 years, the Modi government has transferred ₹95,000 crore directly into the bank account of farmers in three years, of which, about ₹4,404 crore has been directly transferred to 45 lakh farmers of Tamil Nadu.During the party’s month-long Vetrivel Yatra (victorious spear march), the leaders made an effort to highlight several central programmes, including the Ujjwala Yojana and the Individual Household Latrine scheme. However, response to the yatra was tepid.Both the BJP and the AIADMK may have to navigate through the allegations of corruption and leaks in the implementation of some of these schemes.For instance, in September, the Centre was quick to nudge the state government to undertake an enquiry after a scam in the allocation of monies under the PM Kisan scheme was unearthed. This came after the state government said approximately ₹110 crore had been credited to the bank accounts of about 5.5 lakh ineligible people, who had fraudulently registered under the PM Kisan scheme in 13 districts of the state.To counter any negative narrative against the party, the BJP Tamil Nadu president L Murugan launched ‘Farmers’ friend Modi’ campaign in Madurai to explain the three new farm laws across districts alleging the DMK and Congress were misleading the farmers.In the ruling All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s last full-fledged budget, deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam, who handles the finance portfolio, set apart ₹6,500 crore for food subsidy and announced a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to manage the Amma Canteens. “While there are several central schemes spread across all departments which are implemented by the state, most people seem to have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM- KISAN) and Awas Yojana,” said an AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity.But, the focus on the centrally-sponsored schemes is also expected to shield the BJP from any possible anti-incumbency against the AIADMK; to make up for the lack of a structured party cadre on the ground; to alter its image of a Hindi-speaking, upper-caste party.Opposition DMK, however, dismissed notions that there was any traction for BJP government’s schemes on the ground. “There was massive fraud in the PM Kisan scheme. If it is BJP’s pet scheme, serious investigations should have followed, but we don’t know what is happening,” said DMK spokesperson A Saravanan.Saravanan pointed out that there was no toilet in the Kancheepuram agriculture department’s office, where a government employee with disability, S Saranya died after she fell into an open septic tank in December last, as a case of failure of the central government schemes.Also Read: 'BJP, AIADMK will contest together in Tamil Nadu': NaddaPolitical commentator Sumanth C Raman, however, said that banking on the centrally-sponsored schemes for the state elections is unlikely to be rewarding for the BJP, as there is little resonance of their benefits on the ground. “The benefits of these schemes are not talked about. The local media is very hostile to the BJP and they don’t document the schemes or the benefits they have offered to the people in the state,” he said.Raman also said the state leadership has begun to focus on the rural areas, where the party’s presence was weak.In Tamil Nadu, BJP continues to attack the DMK on religious grounds, dynasty politics and the 2G spectrum scam. The party has limited issues to take up since it is in alliance with the ruling AIADMK. In the 2016 assembly elections, BJP was a no-show with a vote share of 2.8%. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP managed one seat but failed to retain it in 2019 but increased its vote share to 3.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-assembly-election-bjp-focuses-on-central-schemes-to-make-a-mark-101612069551913.html

This year’s first 'Mann Ki Baat’ address comes a day before finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the budget for the year 2021-22 in Parliament on Monday.In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, the Prime Minister had reiterated the significance of making the nation self-reliant, urging manufacturers to boost domestic production and make products that have a “zero defect.” “Vocal for local is reverberating in each and every household,” he said, adding, “in such a scenario, it is time to ensure that our products meet global standards. Whatever is the global best; we should make it in India and prove it. For that, our entrepreneur friends have to come forward. Startups too have to come forth.”Modi also reached out to the Sikh community amid the stir over agricultural laws enacted by the government in September last year. The demonstration led by farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have been camping at the borders of the national capital, has been going on for over two months.However, during the address protesters at Delhi’s Singhu and Tikri borders picked up and banged steel plates, used tin cans and canisters and even metal pots used for cooking, in the manner the Prime Minister had asked people to show their gratitude to frontline workers of the Covid-19 battle on March 22 last year, the day of the Janata curfew. “We did not want to hear the prime minister’s Mann ki Baat’. By beating plates, we ensured no one would hear his talk,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dakonda (Punjab) unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.On the Republic Day on Tuesday, farmers’ tractor parade took a violent turn with clashes erupting between them and the Delhi Police as they defied the re-decided routes and entered central Delhi despite cops’ warning. A farmer died and several policemen were injured in the clashes in the Capital.The violence during the rally was condemned, the Prime Minister on Saturday said that the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands.”The Mann Ki Baat programme will air live on All India Radio, Doordarshan and Narendra Modi mobile app at 11am.

31-01-2021||India||Iran link emerges in Israel embassy attack probe despite false flags: Cops||Investigations by Indian security agencies into the improvised explosive device (IED) blast outside the Israeli Embassy on Friday evening are still not conclusive but the needle of suspicion is pointing towards Iran with local involvement.According to counter-terrorism officials in New Delhi, there is enough to suggest the involvement of Tehran in the blast, although investigators are still looking for the people who actually planted the bomb.“Deliberate efforts have been made to firewall the real prepetrators behind the terror incident with false flags and deniability built into the attack that obviously was carried out at the behest of Iran,” said a senior official who asked not to be named.Queries to the Iranian officials went unanswered at the time of going to press.New Delhi has taken the heinous attack against Israel very seriously and its position is that India cannot be used by any other country to target its perceived enemies. India has close ties with both Israel and Iran, although the two countries, in turn, are enemies. “ Once we have concrete evidence we will take up the matter in very serious terms with the country behind the attack,” said a second official in know of the entire investigation who too asked not to be named.The current investigations, counter-terror officials said, are focused on Indian students who have returned after studying at Qom, one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam, in Iran. The focus is on a particular city in south India and a Shia dominated city in Afghanistan, the officials added.Also read: After blast near Israel embassy, bomb threat call for Tehran flightAccording to available evidence, at 3.27 pm, much before the blast at the Israeli embassy, a Telegram (messaging app) entity, VikarUdDeen@Vikar45 claimed responsibility for the blast near the Israeli Embassy on behalf of an unknown group called “ Jaish ul Hind.” This message was posted by Vikar on a Telegram group in the ISIS linked group Qayam Forum (Telegram ID @brownisbest_88). The Jaish ul Hind has a Facebook account (jaish.ulhind), which is currently locked, a private group with 56 members. The message posted by Vikar was forwarded and posted in several other ISIS linked Telegram groups such as Jaag Muslman Jaag, Muslim Groups and Azaadi ki Awaaz Channel of which Vikar is also a member. ISIS is a hard line Sunni organisation, which considers Shias as non-believers. Investigations have shown that the internet protocol address of Vikar is shown to be Herat in Afghanistan, which has considerable Shia Iran influence. But this appears to be a false flag, the officials said.After the IED exploded around 5.11pm, the investigators recovered a letter addressed to Israeli Ambassador to India, Ron Malka.The letter was addressed to “ The Terrorist, Devil of Terrorist Nation Dr Ron Malka” and was written by someone who identified himself as Sarallah India Hezbollah. While Ya Sarallah means one who is dead but has not yet been avenged, Hezbollah is the Shia Islamist political party in Lebanon with a sword arm — a sworn enemy of Israel. The letter swears revenge for the killing of Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone attack in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020. The contradiction is that Al Muhandis was very close to Soleimani and fought against ISIS.The letter reads : “ This is just a trailer presented to you, that we can observe you, from eating to …..Mind it, all the participants and partners of Israelian terrorist ideology will be no more in existence. Now get ready for a big and better revenge of our heros (Soleimani, Muhandis and Fakhrizadeh).”The letter claimed that the group has the capacity to “end your life” anytime and that Israeli terror shelters would be destroyed. It ended by saying : “ All you have to do (is) just count your days now.”Malka said he would not like to comment on the letter and would leave the investigation to India.Despite the letter making such tall claims, the IED itself was very basic in nature with ammonium nitrate-fuel oil as main charge, a non-electrical detonator and bicycle ball bearings as shrapnel. According to the counter-terror officials, it did not appear to be the creation of an expert bomb maker but that of some one who was guided to make a device through a cyber handler.Given that an Iran link was being established through the recovered letter, external affairs minister S Jaishankar talked to his Israeli counterpart, as did the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Doval made a call and briefed the Israelis despite being abroad on a visit.The matter could take a serious diplomatic turn, South Block officials said. This is not the first time Iran has been involved in an attack of this kind in India. Three Quds agents through an Indian conduit targeted the wife of the Israeli Defence Attache on February 13, 2012 with a magnetic bomb. While the agents managed to escape, the then UPA-regime discreetly rapped Iran on its knuckles and told it not to repeat this again in New Delhi.Once it finds concrete evidence, the Narendra Modi government will send a strong message to Tehran, the South Block officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-angle-with-local-connivance-key-line-of-embassy-blast-probe-101612058202614.html

Farmers have come all the way to the doorsteps of Delhi to converse with their elected government and therefore, there is no question of the farmer organisations closing the door on talks with the government," the statement said.It further noted that a one-day fast was observed across the country and farmers paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his martyr day."Learning from the life of Gandhiji, farmers took a pledge to keep fighting this movement peacefully," the statement said, adding that reports of Sadbhavana Diwas were coming in from all over the country, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Hayana, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.The SKM further condemned attempts of the police to weaken the agitation by "unlawful use of security forces."Also Read | ‘Repeal of laws must to resolve impasse’: SAD president Sukbir Singh Badal"The continuous violence by the police and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) goons clearly shows the palpable fear within the government. Police is randomly arresting protesters and journalists at protest sites," the statement said.The farmers' body demanded the immediate release of all peaceful protesters and condemn the attacks on journalists who have been covering the protest.Earlier on Thursday, Delhi witnessed chaotic and violent scenes during the tractor march by farmers on Republic Day to protest against three farm laws.The next round of talks between the farmers and the Centre is scheduled for February 2.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital since November 26, 2020, against the farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

31-01-2021||India||Let govt tell farmers why can’t it repeal farm laws: Rakesh Tikait||BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday asked the Centre to explain to farmers why it does not want to repeal the three farm laws, while promising it that they “will not let the government bow its head” before the world. TIkait appeared to make the conciliatory offer to the government from a position of strength amid swelling support for farmers' stir with hundreds of villagers pouring in at the key protest site, Gazipur’s UP Gate on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. Also Read | ‘Not going to war’: Farmers’ leader calls for peaceful protest“What is the compulsion of the government that it is adamant on not repealing the new farm laws?,” asked Tikait, who has emerged virtually overnight as a potent face of farmers’ stir following his emotional appeal to the farming community against leaving the protest site. “The government can tell its reasons to farmers and we (farmers) are the kind of people who believe in the panchayat system. We will never let the government bow its head in shame in front of the world,” Tikait said, apparently striking a conciliatory note. “We have an ideological fight with the government, something which can neither be fought with sticks and guns nor suppressed by them. The farmers will return home only when the new laws are repealed,” the BKU national spokesperson asserted. The younger son of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s late president Mahendra Singh Tikait, made the assertion with hundreds of villagers, including women and children reaching the protest site at Delhi eastern border, during the day – some with water and homemade food and others with buttermilk -- in a symbolic show of support for protestors. Also Read | ‘Repeal of laws must to resolve impasse’: SAD president Sukbir Singh BadalThe day also saw more politicians throwing in their weight behind the Tikait’s growing strength and meeting him at the protest site. The BKU-led protest against the Centre's new farm laws appeared to be fizzling out following the Republic Day violence in Delhi during the tractor rally, but more protestors joined the stir after a 'mahapanchayat' of farmers on Saturday in Muzaffarnagar. Addressing the protesting farmers, Tkait said farmers believe in the Gandhian principle of non-violence and have full faith in the Constitution and appealed to everyone for maintaining peace. “The farmers won't mind if the police even baton-charged them but if goons of political parties dare touch them, neither the farmers nor their tractors would leave the site,” he asserted. “The tears that I shed the other day were not mine but of all farmers,” he added, imparting an emotional edge to his address. Politicians continued to reach the protest site at UP Gate for a second day, even as Tikait insisted that no political leader would be allowed on the central platform and meetings with them would happen only off stage. The political leaders who met Tkait on Saturday and extended his support to him included Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Chautala and Gujjar leader and former MLA Madan Bbhaiyya. Tikait's spiritual guru and founder of Neelkanth Ashram Amit Maharaj also reached the protest site, carrying Gangajal for him. He gave the holy water to Tikait to consume and blessed him, paying God to give him the strength to transform the stir into a “mega movement” of farmers."The movement was and is strong," BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI. Khatana said there has been continuous support for the "peaceful protest" against the farmers' demand for removal of the new farm laws. Asked about the estimated crowd size at the site, he said, "Farmers are coming in to show the solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd." The Delhi Traffic Police said to-and-fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed. “Three super zonal magistrates, 14 zonal magistrate and 34 sector magistrates from the administration besides senior police officers are on the ground where law and order is under control,” Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told PTI. “Mobile toilets have been stationed at the protest site and water facilities have been restored,” he said, adding the situation was being monitored at the border. Internet services, however, will remain suspended till Sunday night in view of the Centre's order to “maintain public safety and averting public emergency”, the administration said. Around 3,000 security personnel including those from the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, were deployed at the protest site, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-govt-tell-farmers-why-can-t-it-repeal-farm-laws-rakesh-tikait-101612055024581.html
31-01-2021||India||Amid tight security, Elgar Parishad 2nd edition held in Pune||Three years after violence broke out in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village, the second edition of the Elgar Parishad was held in Pune on Saturday with roughly 500 people in attendance and heavy security arrangements.Academic, activists and writers from Dalit, Left, Muslim and other social organisations addressed the event, held at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch in Pune.The first edition of the Elgar Parishad was held on December 31, 2017 in Pune’s historic Shaniwar Wada, and attended by thousands. A day later, caste clashes broke out in Bhima Koregaon, roughly 30km away from Pune, during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war. Tens of thousands of Dalit people from across the country congregate at Bhima Koregaon annually for the event.Saturday’s event was organised by the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella body of 250 Dalit, Left and other social organisations. It was addressed by Booker Prize winning author Arundhati Roy, former bureaucrat Kannan Gopinathan, former Bombay HC judge BG Kolse Patil, journalist Prashant Kanojia and others.The speakers attacked the central government for arresting prominent activists and lawyers in connection with the 2018 violence. The authorities allege that the Elgar Parishad event was part of a broader Maoist conspiracy to foment violence in Bhima Koregaon.Roy also opposed three recently passed farm laws, which thousands of farmers are opposing despite government assuranes on minimum support prices. “ Lakhs of farmers are suffering due to the unjust laws and it has been their demand that the three laws be withdrawn by the government immediately. The farmers have been peacefully protesting for past two months but concerted efforts are being taken by the Centre to defame the farmers agitation ,” she said.Condemning the action against academics, activists and others in the Bhima Koregaon case, she said “Today one has to be careful about every comma and word you speak or write as police cases are lodged at slightest pretext…holding Elgar is the need of the hour for the fight against capitalism, and casteist patriarchy.”Gopinathan said “The central government is foolish as it is branding dissenting intellectuals as urban naxals, addressing Jawaharlal Nehru University students as tukde tukde gang, Sikhs as khalistanis and Muslims as jihadis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-tight-security-elgar-parishad-2nd-edition-held-in-pune-101612051188753.html

India’s consulate in San Francisco in California state separately took up the matter with the city of Davis and local law enforcement authorities, who initiated an investigation. The mayor of Davis “deeply regretted the incident” and said authorities had initiated a probe, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-protests-as-vandals-target-gandhi-statue-in-us-101612052200488.html
31-01-2021||India||‘Bare necessities delivered in 2018 significantly better than 2012 level’: CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian||A day after he presented the Economic Survey, chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian spoke at length about the finer points of his assessment of the economy, India’s response to the Covid pandemic, the farm protests and more with Sunetra Choudhury. Edited excerpts:Did your office work closely in deciding the government response to the pandemic?As part of government process, it is expected that inputs are taken from all of us. The role that my office plays is that we look at research. Early on in the pandemic, we read a lot about the Spanish Flu. The other key part was a Hansen and Sargeant paper which said that when you are faced with an environment of enormous uncertainty, the right policy response is to minimise losses. The Mahabharata says “Saving a life that’s in jeopardy is the origin of dharma”. So we combined elements from economics, epidemiology and scriptures.What do you make of the Opposition’s criticism of your projection of 11% GDP growth?When the estimates of the first quarter were released, we mentioned that there will be a V-shaped recovery. None of us is an astrologer. We track 58 indicators to make our estimation. The 11% projection is certainly achievable. When people say that a decline has happened for the first time in 40 years, we must keep in mind that we have encountered a pandemic. Even if there was no lockdown, we would not have travelled or visited restaurants, and the uncertainty would have impacted discretionary spending, consumption and investment.Much of the government’s response came in the form of easier loans and credit. Many have argued that direct cash transfers would be better. What is your response to that?I think the Indian response was based on foundational economic principles, which is that when there is uncertainty, households do not spend on discretionary items. For instance, there is evidence in the economic survey that the balance of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana increased by 500 rupees. It is in the 400 million households at the bottom of the pyramid that the savings increased, which means that there was no consumption. During the lockdown, people would not have indulged in discretionary spending, it would have wasted fiscal space. Once the unlock was initiated, discretionary spending was focused on.What do you make of Dr Manmohan Singh’s statements that the pandemic has increased inequality?I think we have to look at the strength of the economic argument rather than the person making it. The chapter on inequality and growth in the Economic Survey has a resounding answer to such arguments. I think their commentaries are based on conversations in advanced economies, where there is a conflict between inequality and growth. In India, this kind of tension doesn’t manifest. The stage of India’s development is different. Our potential growth rate is much higher and the opportunity to lift people out of poverty is also different. So, we should be focusing on growth. We have stated in the Economic Survey that about 85% of the reduction in poverty has come from economic growth. Those resources can be used for redistribution.Are you saying that the trickle-down effect will lift the poor out of poverty?No, when you expand the pie, the resources that you get can be used for redistribution. The trickle-down effect does not involve redistribution. Dr Manmohan Singh should note that there has been significant improvement in the bare necessities delivered in 2018 vis-a-vis 2012.Would you look at redistribution of wealth taxes?Given our state of development, we have to be careful. We don’t just want to read the Thomas Pikettys of the world who make good arguments for advanced economies because we can’t cut, paste and implement them here. We should continue to focus on growth so that the pie expands.You praised the new farm laws but the IMF has said that they need safety nets. What kind of safety nets would you propose?I think the PM-Kisan [Yojana] has provided a safety net. It is important the small farmer is provided options. At present, the small farmer is beholden to APMC [system] and the middleman.Why aren’t the farmers accepting the laws?That is the political economy. If you go by the income of farmers in Punjab and Haryana, they are far richer than farmers in other states. There are other dimensions here that are beyond economics which I am not going to comment on. We must also note the number of surveys and the committees that have recommended these reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bare-necessities-delivered-in-2018-significantly-better-than-2012-level-cea-101612050432824.html

The agitation is peaceful today as well,” Rajewal, the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), told reporters here.Stressing on the need to protest peacefully, Rajewal said, “I appeal to people to join the peaceful protest (in Delhi) but don’t do anything even under the sway of emotions if someone tries to instigate you. We should keep in mind that we are not going to war. This is our country and our government.”Rajewal’s comments come against the backdrop of the police and protesters clashing at the Singhu border after a group, claiming to be locals, pelted the protesters with stones.Also read: PM Modi at all-party meeting says offer to farmers standsAsserting that “local people” were with the farmers, Rajewal alleged those behind the Singhu border incident were “BJP and RSS people”. “The government is trying to provoke us for violence. We will not indulge in any violence. We are alert to prevent any violence,” he said.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders for the last 65 days in protest against Centre’s three new farm laws, which, they say, will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri-businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-going-to-war-farmers-leader-calls-for-peaceful-protest-101612050181285.html

He asked the Centre to revoke three farm laws that have prompted widespread protests. Excerpts from an interview with Gurpreet Singh Nibber:After what happened on January 26, what do you think is the way forward for the farmers’ agitation?Peace should be maintained at all costs. I think the Centre, rather than resolving the issue, is creating problems and instigating the farmers for violence.Can anything less than repeal of the farm laws work as a solution?For whom are these laws? It is not the first time that a demand is being raised to withdraw a law. In the past, hundreds of laws were repealed and even the Constitution has been amended. It is such a strong movement but, sadly, the government is adamant. A government is for the betterment of the people and the issue here concerns farmers, who exceed any other section of society in numbers.Also read: Rakesh Tikait says 'let govt tell farmers why can’t it repeal farm laws'What role do you see for yourself as president of the Shiromani Akali Dal — ‘the party of the peasants’?I have no role as such at this stage of the protest when farmers are at the centrestage. As president of the SAD, I appeal to people to get united for the sake of farmers, especially when efforts are being made to divide people on communal lines.Your party is in touch with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. Comments?Sixteen parties boycotted Friday’s address by the President on the opening day of Budget Session, which shows the BJP-led government’s popularity among the political parties. We are in touch with the parties and we will hold a meeting and come out with an action plan.How can the ongoing standoff between farmers and government be resolved?It’s very easy. All three farm laws could be repealed in the current Budget Session and for next 18 months, the Centre can hold talks with the stakeholders. What’s the problem in holding discussions? We are a democracy, or the government should say it’s dictatorship. The government has already offered to keep laws on hold for 18 months..What’s your advice to the protesting farmers?They must maintain peace and communal harmony at all costs. The government on its part should also not blame a section for every agitation, as they have labelled the protesters as “Khalistanis”. Farmers are the biggest nationalists and nation’s backbone. If farmers prosper, India, too, prospers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-of-laws-must-to-resolve-impasse-sad-president-sukbir-singh-badal-101612049802855.html
31-01-2021||India||Collegium recalls nod for permanent posting||Uncertainty looms over future of Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court after the Supreme Court (SC) collegium, in an unprecedented step, has withdrawn its proposal to make her a permanent judge in the high court in view of her controversial rulings on sexual assault on children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.Justice Ganediwala’s fate hangs in the balance since her tenure as an additional judge ends on February 12, and if the SC collegium, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, decides not to extend her term as an additional judge, she will cease to be a judge.Under the constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum period of two years unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium, or the tenure can be extended as an additional judge for up to two years.Justice Ganediwala has courted controversies after her judgments on interpretation of the Pocso Act came under criticism. In a January 19 ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not sexual assault but only molestation under IPC. This judgment was stayed by a Supreme Court bench, led by the CJI. In another judgment on January 15, the judge ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault”.On Saturday, people in the law ministry and the Supreme Court confirmed to HT that the collegium has recalled its recommendation to make Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge. On January 20, the SC collegium passed a resolution, and the file reached law ministry a day later.However, the people added, on January 25, a missive was sent by the SC collegium requesting for a withdrawal of the proposal. The note by the SC collegium stated that the proposal regarding the judge was to be reviewed again.The law ministry then sent back the file with a note that the proposal was being returned on a request by the collegium and if a fresh proposal was to be sent again, the ministry will need around a week to process it.“There has been no such instance when after sending a proposal to the government for appointing an additional judge as a permanent judge, the collegium has withdrawn its recommendation,” said a law ministry official familiar with the matter.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan told HT: “...It is not a simple decision but if there is a judgment which is in flagrant violation of the law, a chief justice is entitled to not make an additional judge a permanent judge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collegium-recalls-nod-for-permanent-posting-101612049038498.html

31-01-2021||India||LJP skips NDA meet on budget session strategy||Differences between the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party led to the latter’s absence from a meeting of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners on Saturday, people aware of the developments said.The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was held to discuss the NDA’s strategy for the Budget Session of Parliament.A person aware of the developement said the JD(U) took umbrage at the invitation sent to LJP chief Chirag Paswan earlier this month to attend the meeting. The two parties have been at loggerheads since the LJP attacked the JD(U) ahead of last year’s assembly election in Bihar and launched a campaign against chief minister Nitish Kumar. The LJP had demanded that the BJP contest the Bihar polls without JD(U) as a partner.“After the JD(U) protested, the BJP leadership conveyed to Paswan that he was not expected at the virtual meeting of the NDA allies,” a functionary aware of the details said on condition of anonymity. Paswan earlier said that while he was invited to attend the meeting, he planned to skip it on health grounds. He also did not attend an all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister earlier in the day.Paswan has been praising PM Modi and even asserted that he would continue to support the BJP at the Centre after pulling out of the coalition in Bihar. A senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity that the LJP cannot be a partner of the NDA at the Centre while it walked out of the alliance in Bihar and targeted the JD(U), with which the BJP runs a coalition government in the state.Paswan could not be reached for a comment. The JD(U)’s KC Tyagi told PTI that his party does not consider the LJP as an NDA ally.At the NDA meeting, PM Modi urged the leaders to use “facts” to counter the “misgivings” created by the Opposition over three farm laws that have triggered farmer protests.According to a person with knowledge of the meeting, the Prime Minister said the opposition parties will try to create misconceptions about the farm laws in the wake of the upcoming assembly elections, but these attempts should be thwarted using facts and data.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the PM pointed out that this decade was a very important one, just like the decade after the Second World War and unlike earlier, we are not going to be a mute spectator. “We will rise to the occasion based on our traditions and ideals of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the prime minister added,” Joshi said.“Addressing the meeting of NDA leaders, Prime Minister Shri @NarendraModi ji today said that after the pandemic, a new world order is about to take shape & India has a big role to play in the emerging new world order,” Joshi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-skips-nda-meet-on-budget-session-strategy-101612047925927.html
31-01-2021||India||Covid-19: After a year of fear and uncertainty, hope floats||January 30, 2020.The day marked a grim yet important milestone for India.A 21-year-old student who returned from China’s Wuhan tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on that day, marking the beginning of what would turn out to be an unprecedented year presenting never-seen-before challenges.While the pandemic gripped India in the first week of March with infections being reported among those who returned to the national capital region (NCR) and other parts of the country from abroad, it was the case of the Kerala student, and two similar incidents in the state almost at the same time, that announced the arrival of Covid-19 in the country of 1.3 billion people exactly a year ago.“I was speechless when I heard my daughter was positive. When she returned home from Wuhan (the place in China where the outbreak is believe to have begun), where she was pursuing her medical studies, we were really relieved. But when she was tested positive four days later, return we were totally shattered,” said the father of India’s first patient.The young woman was immediately shifted to a treatment facility that the government had built in anticipation of an outbreak. There she stayed for 28 days, till recovery. Two more students who returned from Wuhan tested positive two days later, but they had to spend just 14 days each at designated Covid facilities.The three cases in Kerala marked the beginning of the pandemic in India. And in March, the first wave came. What happened next could be exemplified with many grim firsts.The government imposed stringent curbs on activities and travel on March 25, allowing only essential activities. Before that, it had already announced international travel advisories. With the lockdown in place, businesses downed shutters and streets bustling otherwise fell silent. Flights were grounded and trains were stationed. The lockdown triggered a massive humanitarian crisis with migrant workers, who lost their livelihoods, traversing hundreds of kilometers on foot to reach their villages.After 68 days of hard lockdown, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen businesses and bring economic activities, hit hard by the restrictions, back on track in June. It also announced a ₹20 lakh crore economic package to negate the effect of the pandemic.“Several measures were taken even before the first case of Covid-19 was reported from India. India’s travel advisories were issued much before WHO (the World Health Organisation) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (in January-end). Several ministries and departments got together in managing the outbreak from the very beginning that saved time between decision taking and execution. Covid-19 testing was ramped up in a short span of time, with the current capacity of performing at least one million tests in a single day in more than 2,000 ICMR -approved labs. All this has been a commendable feat,” said a senior Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity.On January 16, 2021, the world’s largest inoculation drive began in India with Serum Institute of India’s Covishield --- the company is manufacturing the vaccine by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in the country --- and Bharat Biotech’s indigenously produced Covaxin. India is also supplying vaccine to its neighbours.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the national capital witnessed a very effective Covid-19 management strategy due to the “dedication of the Aam Aadmi Party government and our health care workers”.“Our Covid management is being discussed across the world. Delhi’s Covid circumstances were the worst in the world. On November 11, there were 8,500 corona cases in a single day, which were the highest in any city across the world. From that day to today, we are at a point of very low number of cases and a positivity rate of below 0.5%. This is a victory for the people of Delhi and the honest governance they voted for last year,” he said.Also read: US Covid-19 cases surpass 26 million, toll at 438,239As of Friday, India registered 10.73 million cases and about 154,200 fatalities. The country’s seven-day case average stood at 12,485, down from the peak of 93,617 in mid-September. The active case count stood at 172,000 (1.6% of the total cases).In case count, India stood at second place in the world. With 26.5 million cases, the US tops of the list. India’s per million cases were at 7,739, as compared with the US’s 79,832, according to Worldometers.“We have now reached a very low level of transmission of the infection; technically, the epidemic is over and now we are in an endemic phase (where an infection persists at a low level in a population),” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.Kerala, where it all started, still faces several challenges.On Friday, Kerala accounted for 48% of the new 13,064 cases India recorded on the day. The state’s seven-day average of cases is 5,764, 46.2% of the national average.“Kerala is by no means a success story, but I won’t call it a failure too. In the state, the real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the Middle East. There were telltale signs to community spread, but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread of the epidemic,” said G Pramod Kumar, a former senior advisor to the United National Development Programme.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, put up a brave face, saying the state did whatever it could. “Ups and downs are nature of the pandemic. Even some of the developed countries are still struggling with second and third phase of the pandemic,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-after-a-year-of-fear-and-uncertainty-hope-floats-101612043571842.html
31-01-2021||India||Offer to farmers stands: PM at all-party meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agri laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands” as he told an all-party meeting that his government was “committed to reaching a solution through dialogue”, a remark that appeared to reach out to thousands of protesters who have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders.The Prime Minister, however, stood firm against the violence at the Red Fort and other areas of Delhi during a tractor parade by farmers and said the “law will take its own course.”On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.Addressing the all-party meet ahead of the Union Budget, PM Modi said the government was only a “phone call away” for talks with farmers who have been involved in a two-month-long agitation over the three farm laws.Facing 18 opposition parties adamant on the repeal of the farm laws, the Prime Minister reminded them that smaller parties suffer the most if the House doesn’t run and told representatives of the smaller parties that “you must tell all parties, including the BJP and NDA partners, that the House should run so that we get a chance to speak”.Eighteen opposition parties boycotted President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to both houses of Parliament on Friday, the inaugural day of the Budget Session, to protest against the farm laws. The session will run from January 29 to April 8 with a recess from February 15 to March 7. The budget is to be presented in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. Many opposition parties including the Congress are set to continue their protests in Parliament.As one leader after another spoke about the farm issue, the Prime Minister, who chaired the virtual meeting, referred to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s remarks after the 11th meeting between the government and the farm bodies that he was just a phone call away and will come whenever the farmer leaders want to discuss keeping the laws in abeyance.“The same offer of the Indian government still stands. If you know any protester, tell them that the offer is still there and I am sure everyone here wants a solution through dialogue. The government is continuing efforts to find a solution through dialogue,” the PM told the leaders.The PM also condemned the vandalism of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in California, US.“Nearly everyone spoke about the incidents on January 26. The law will take its own course. But on January 30, some people vandalised Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the US. Everyone must think about what are we giving to the country by creating this atmosphere of hatred?” he added.Modi also welcomed any criticism of public policies as they generate fresh ideas, and maintained that in a Post-Covid-19 world, India can’t afford to lose its opportunities.Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that had the three farm bills been sent to a House panel for review, “the protests happening today throughout the country, particularly in northern India and areas surrounding Delhi, would not have happened”. He “strongly condemned” the “unfortunate” and “shameful incident” at the Red Fort and demanded that the culprits be punished.However, he also hit out at the government and said: “It seems that the government, instead of catching the real culprits, is trying to implicate the farmers’ leaders. I don’t think that any sensible farmer leader was party to that incident at the Red fort.”Azad warned that “if innocent farmer leaders are framed, then this agitation will grow exponentially,” asking the government not to “make the mistake of framing the innocent farmer leaders, and it should not be a prestige issue as farmers are our annadaata, our own people”. He also demanded that a discussion be held on the status of the economy, the fall in GDP and growing unemployment. He also said that the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir must be restored as the situation there is was grave.The Centre has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.All-party meetings such as the one on Saturday are held to discuss legislative agenda for a Parliament session, with leaders of various parties flagging important issues.Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said the opposition parties’ boycott of the President’s address was a “strong message for the Centre to withdraw the farm laws as majoritarianism cannot let farmers suffer”. He demanded an all-party meeting on the farm issue and asked for a threadbare debate on unemployment.The Biju Janata Dal’s Pinaki Misra, who was present at the meeting, said Odisha chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik specifically requested the Union government to have the women’s reservation bill passed in this Budget Session.The Shiv Sena, meanwhile, said it wanted free vaccines for the entire poor population in Maharashtra. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), too, demanded free vaccines, and a debate on Sri Lankan Tamils, while the YSRCP asked for special category status for Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offer-to-farmers-stands-pm-at-all-party-meeting-101612041447381.html
31-01-2021||India||Farm laws like death warrants that must be taken back, says AAP's Sanjay Singh||The newly enacted farm laws like death warrants that must be taken back, said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh on Saturday.While speaking to ANI, Singh said, "Death warrants are taken back, not amended. These new laws are like death-warrant for the farmers."Regarding the suspension of internet services temporarily at the Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri borders and their adjoining areas till January 31, the AAP leader said, "They (government) can suspend the internet...can seize the properties of those protesting...they can do anything but will not be able to make the farmers protest stop as the farmers are determined."Singh further accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of defaming the farmers' protest."There were nine routes pre-decided for the farmer's tractor rally on January 26. There was a peaceful march on the seven routes. BJP was behind the violence at the Red Fort and other areas in Delhi. It was to defame the farmers' protest," he said.There was violence during the tractor march called by farmer unions on January 26 with protestors clashing with police and resorting to vandalism in different parts of Delhi.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-like-death-warrants-that-must-be-taken-back-says-aap-s-sanjay-singh-101612033647503.html
31-01-2021||India||Union minister seeks excavation of site where temple ruins were found in Odisha||Days after the Archaeological Survey of India stumbled upon the remnants of a 10th century temple near the 11th century Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas and steel Dharmendra Pradhan urged Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel for his intervention for a detailed study and thorough scientific excavation of the heritage area of the state capital.In a letter to Patel on Saturday, Pradhan said the discovery of the remains of the 10th century temple floor has proved that there may be more heritage structures that lie buried under the encroachments. “Keeping in mind the immense archaeological, artistic, socio-cultural and religious importance of ancient Odisha's temples, I request your personal intervention in directing the Archaeological Survey of India to send an expert team to Bhubaneswar for carrying out a detailed study and thorough scientific excavation of the Ekamra Kshetra area in Bhubaneswar for unearthing heritage structures,” Pradhan wrote.Earlier this week, a team of ASI's Bhubaneswar circle had found remnants of a 10th century temple of the Somavamshi dynasty near Bhubaneswar's Suka-Sari temple, a 13th century monument under protection of the central body that was completely excavated 4-5 years ago. The ASI discovered two other structures, believed to be the remains of small shrines, and a portion of the Sari temple. These findings have led ASI experts to believe that the Sari temple complex was built on the Panchayatana model where the main temple is surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.The minister said as the Suka-Sari temple complex and Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar are protected by ASI under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR) Act, there is an urgent need to act quickly in order to salvage and preserve what remains of this priceless ancient Odishan architecture,Pradhan's letter to the culture minister came amid allegations of ASI that the BMC and BDA did not consult it while undertaking demolitions around the heritage structures over the last 3 months in the name of development of the area around Lingaraj Temple. ASI Bhubaneswar circle's superintendent, Arun Mallick said he is clueless about the heritage structures lost during the demolition drives by BMC-BDA on two acre of land surrounding Suka-Sari temple complex for construction of an open arena to accommodate huge number of devotees ahead of Shivaratri this year.“Most of the demolitions were done at night and there is no trace of the debris. During excavations early this week, we found a number of architectural fragments around north-west and north-east corners of Sari temple. There must be more debris that were removed from the site before we stepped in for excavation. I want to check whether the debris contains anything important from the heritage point of view,” Mallick said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-seeks-excavation-of-site-where-temple-ruins-were-found-in-odisha-101612033307930.html
31-01-2021||India||Kerala's Covid-19 management saved large number of lives: KK Shailaja||Kerala's Covid-19 management strategy saved a large number of lives as it delayed the peak of the epidemic and gave time to improve the health care system of the state, said Health Minister KK Shailaja on Saturday.The minister launched the Health Department's 'Back to Basics' campaign on Saturday here, a year after the first Covid case was reported in Kerala on January 30, 2020.Talking about the campaign she said the aim of Back to Basics is to educate the public about the importance of following Covid-19 related protocols and reducing disease transmission."It's been a year since we have been struggling with Covid-19. But we can say we're in a safe position. There's a bit of increase in cases in Kerala but the mortality rate is 0.4 per cent. We're still following the strict 'trace, isolate and treat' strategy," she said.Shailaja said Kerala can say it saved more lives at a lesser cost, by following a 'very good' strategy from the starting stage itself."We can say we saved more lives at a lesser cost. When the Covid-19 patients came from other hot spots during the lifting of the lockdown, it was very different to trace the patients, but we continued doing that. I think we have succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. The peak occurred in Kerala later even though the pandemic occurred in Kerala first. We tried to delay the peak by applying the 'trace, isolate and treat strategy and also break the chain," she added.The Health Minister said that the delayed peak of pandemic gave time to the state to improve the health care system."During that period we were able to strengthen our health care system, and because of that we never saw the full occupancy of our ventilators. Our ICUs were also occupied below 50 per cent during this time. Our hospitals were never flooded with patients because of our planning. We mobilised more human resources to fight against the pandemic," she stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-management-saved-large-number-of-lives-kk-shailaja-101612031780753.html
