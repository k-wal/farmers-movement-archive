Nadda addressed a “Vijay Sankalpa” (victory pledge) rally in Barak Valley’s Silchar, beginning the party’s campaign for the assembly elections, likely to be held in April-May. The BJP has given due recognition to Assam’s culture, language and identity, since coming to power in the northeastern state in 2016, Nadda said. “The task of protecting Assam’s culture, language and identity has been done well by the BJP governments at the Centre and the state and we will continue that. We have been sensitive about the rights of Assamese people,” said Nadda. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior party leaders including general secretary (organization) BL Santosh and state in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda were also present at the rally. “The BJP has been working peacefully for the development of Assam, taking into consideration the interests of all communities. It has fulfilled their demands without harming others…Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah resolved the 50-year-old Bodo issue by signing a peace accord and bringing the militants to the mainstream. All stakeholders were taken into confidence and the accord ensured that their demands were given due recognition,” he said.Nadda also cited the proposed grant of scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities and the smart fencing of border areas with Bangladesh. At the rally, the BJP chief targeted the Congress, alleging that there had was no progress in the state in the 15 years of Congress rule between 2001 and 2016. “During those 15 years, the state saw killings of 2,155 civilians and 284 security personnel and over 12,000 people were kidnapped. Over 51% area of the state was not covered by electrification and 56% homes didn’t have toilets. All that has changed in the past years,” he said. “During 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre, Assam received ₹50,000 crore in assistance. But since 2014, when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP came to power, the state has got ₹300,000 crore till date,” Nadda said. Reacting to Nadda’s statement, senior Congress leader Debabrata Saikia said, “Most of the development that took in Assam happened during the 15 years of Congress rule. Nadda seems to be unaware of it. He also seems to have no idea that crime rate in Assam hasn’t improved and the state has the highest rate of crimes against women.”The BJP president’s comments come close on the heels of the launch of several new regional parties in the state, which have accused the ruling party of not being sincere in safeguarding Assam’s ‘jaati’ (community), ‘maati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (base). Two student organisations, All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), who were spearheading the anti-Citizenship Ament Act (CAA) protests in the state in December, 2019, have joined hands to form Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP).Another organisation at the forefront of the anti-CAA stir, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), has also formed a political party called Raijor Dal. The organisation’s leader, Akhil Gogoi, who is in jail since December, 2019, for his role in the violent protests, was named president of the new party last week.The BJP president, who arrived here on Monday on a two-day visit, is set to leave later in the day for Guwahati, where he will hold meetings with members of the party’s state unit core committee, election committee and other office bearers.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-win-over-100-seats-nadda-at-assam-rally-101610389597408.html
11-01-2021||India||Poultry sector predicts losses of over ₹1k-cr||A surge in avian influenza or bird flu, an outbreak that has now spread to 10 states, has decimated over three dozen large farms, shut down hundreds of hatcheries and upended supply chains as more poultry farmers confront the pervasive fear of its rapid spread. Even in states free from the avian flu so far, consumption of poultry has plunged, several stakeholders said. Regions where H5N8 cases have been confirmed are spread out across the country, forming a south-to-north arc, raising the threat for other central and eastern states, an official from the department of animal husbandry said. Samples of dead birds are piling up at the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) as the epidemic tears through 10 states: Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. “Our estimate is that business losses are to the tune of ₹1,500 crore. This includes layers, or poultry farms specialising only in egg production,” said Surinder Khanna,a former poultry development officer with the Haryana government and a consultant. Avian flu has significant economic impact. Poultry farmers are counting losses from devastated farms. “My farm is empty now. It is one of the six medium sized layers where 100% culling took place. Nearly 3,000 day-old chicks and 3,000 30-day-old chicken were culled, causing losses of ₹2,40,000,” said P. Suresh of Dynamix Poultry Cooperative in Kerala’s Allapuzha. According to Khanna and other analysts, an estimated half-a-million birds may have been culled so far, although no official figures are available. Industry figures show that a one-day-old chick sells for ₹45, while it costs poultry farmers ₹80-90 to raise a chicken for 30 days. Wholesale prices of chicken and eggs have crashed 80% and 60%, according to figures from the Poultry Federation of India.India’s poultry business runs largely on a contract model, whereby poultry firms enter into written contracts with raisers. “During outbreaks of bird disease, if affected population in a firm is more than 10%, which is usually the case in epidemics, farmers aren’t paid anything in accordance with contract terms,” Khanna said. Union minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday that the Centre was “coordinating with states to implement a national action plan” and there was no need for panic. The flu has a domino effect in related supply chains. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm. Maize is a major feed used for poultry, which consumes 14 million tonnes of corn annually.“Poultry consumption in eastern Indian states, unaffected by bird flu, has fallen by an estimated 70%,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, the editor of industry poultry journal Pashudhan Praharee. According to official data, India’s layer farms produce 250 million eggs a day. The country produces 1.5 billion broilers a year, while 380 million chicken are raised annually for laying eggs. Poultry is one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural sector in the country. While output of crops has seen a decadal rise at a rate of 1.5-2% annually, that of eggs and broilers has been rising at a rate of 8-10% annually, according to agriculture ministry data. India has among the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, showing how difficult it is to prevent poultry diseases in the country. Bird flu epidemics have occurred 24 times in the country since the first outbreak in 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, when the flu infected poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and MP. Kerala and Haryana have completed several rounds of culling in accordance with national animal disease guidelines. Avian flu mostly comes from infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their faeces. In India, the disease mostly is spread by migratory birds, such as geese, ducks and shorebirds. Since 2004, compensation worth ₹400 crore from federal funds were given to poultry farmers who faced the epidemic, aside from financial aid from states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poultry-sector-predicts-losses-of-over-1kcr-101610389536913.html
11-01-2021||India||Bird flu spreads to 10 states, govt says human threat low||New Delhi:Bird flu spread to 10 states on Monday with Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand confirming the viral outbreak, which experts said would be difficult to control because a large number of birds in the wild had been infected. The Central government moved to ease concerns of the infection spreading to humans through contaminated meat or chicken, saying that in India the disease had been spread mainly by migratory birds and added that the secondary spread to poultry birds had occurred only at a few places.“There are no scientific reports on transmission of bird flu to humans and consumers should not be scared,” minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday, asking the states not to close wholesale markets or restrict the sale of poultry products.Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined Himachal Pradesh , where close to 4,000 migratory birds have died in Pong Dam, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana in confirming bird flu cases. While transmission of the virus to humans is rare, it easily spreads among birds through droppings. “The entire water body gets infected with the virus, a reason for so many birds dying in Pong Dam in Himachal. Also, it spreads the disease from one species to another,” said Suresh Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India and migratory bird expert.Migratory birds reach India at wintering sites through the Central Asian flyway, which extends from the Artic in the north to Maldives in the south and from central China in the east to eastern Europe in the west. It is one of the eight major migratory bird flyways and least studied among all, said a report in Birdlife International, a global partnership of non-government organisations devoted to avian conservation. Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said the birds from Central Asia, China, Mongolia and Siberia cover more than 5,000 kms to reach hundreds of wintering sites in the Indian subcontinent and some of them even fly to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Sri Lanka.Close to 90% of the 370 identified species in the CAF reach the Indian subcontinent and spread across the country. “You can find Bar-headed Goose in Kaziranga and Pong Dam. They may enter India through two ends of Tibetan plateau. They are of same species but represent different populations,” Kumar said. Rahmani said that some of these migratory birds may be carriers of bird flu although they may not perish. Not much research has been done on bird diseases, and it would not be possible to say which birds carry which strain of bird flu, he added.Testing by Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) indicates that both the strains of bird flu came from migratory birds. H5N8, a sub-type of avian influenza found in poultry and wild animals, has been found in crows in Rajasthan, Uttarkand and Madhya Prades; the strain came from migratory birds. The other strain is H5N1, found in ducks in Kerala and the Bar-headed Goose in Himachal. While H5N8 transmission to humans is not known, there have been cases of H5N1 transmission to humans, although rare.“There is no way one can control bird flu in wild birds,” Kumar said, noting that it spreads from droppings in water bodies that are impossible to clean. “Poultry bird flu is easier to contain as all birds can be culled and cleaning operations can be completed in 90 days.”That could be a probable reason that Kerala and Haryana, where the virus was reported in poultry, were able to control bird flu and not Rajasthan, Himachal and Madhya Pradesh, where it was present in birds in the wild.On Monday, Madhya Pradesh’s animal husbandry director Dr RK Rokde said the latest reports had confirmed bird flu in pigeons, sparrows and herons, but morbidity was the highest among crows.“As of now, 1,300 birds have died of bird flu in about 35 districts of MP and spread of avian influenza has been confirmed in 18 districts,” said Rokde. In Rajasthan, bird flu reached Jaipur zoo, causing the death of three ducks and a black stork, forcing the authorities to close the bird section. Fowl deaths had earlier been reported from Kanpur zoo in Uttar Pradesh. The total bird deaths because of bird flu in a week doubled to 3,321 on Monday with the spread of aviation influenza to 15 of 33 districts of Rajasthan. Most of the birds that perished were crows.Apart from Sanjay Lake in Delhi, bird flu was confirmed in wild birds, mostly crows, in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. An outbreak of avian influenza was reported among poultry in Parbhani district of Maharashtra while bird flu in crows was confirmed in Mumbai, Thane, Dapoli and Beed, officials said. In Uttarkhand, bird flu in crows has been confirmed from Pauri Gharwal district. In Gujarat, bird flu cases have been confirmed in crows in Surat and Vadodara districts, officials said.Rahmani said the only way to control bird flu infection from migratory birds was through satellite-based monitoring of major bird species and rapid information sharing between 30 countries on the Central Asian Flyway. Kumar said nine flagship migratory species including the Amur Falcon, Common Crane and Black Kite are monitored under an environment ministry’s programme.

11-01-2021||India||Bird flu: Delhi HC to hear PIL for ban on slaughtering chicken at Ghazipur mandi||The Delhi High Court will hear a plea on Tuesday seeking immediate ban on “illegal slaughter of birds” in Ghazipur Murga Mandi or Ghazipur chicken market in east Delhi.The petition claimed that the market is a hub of illegal slaughter after an alert was sounded for bird flu in the city.The plea, which has been filed in a pending Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by animal right activist Gauri Mauleki, has contended that the Ghazipur Murga Mandi near the border with Uttar Pradesh has been an epicenter of avian flu in the past due to the unchecked transportation and slaughter of lakhs of birds coming from various states.The plea filed through advocate Priyanka Bangari has said that the action plan for Prevention, Control & Containment of Avian Influenza (Revised 2015) provides that the live bird markets including wet markets particularly at the border areas is at high risk for Avian Influenza.It said that the Ghazipur Murga Mandi, is the “biggest illegal chicken slaughter hub of Delhi which functions in complete disregard to law and follows no veterinary health check protocols”.“More than 2 lakh birds that are brought into this market daily are not screened for any disease. No ante mortem or post mortem is performed nor are any health records of the birds maintained. No backward or forward linkage of the birds and their carcass is maintained,” the plea read.The petition has also claimed that birds are slaughtered in the livestock market which is meant for trade of live birds, in an unhygienic and appalling manner.“This place is not only an illegal slaughter area but also a breeding ground for pathogens and diseases. That unhygienic conditions in which the Ghazipur Murga Mandi operate in absence of any health check of birds, Avian Influenza can easily spread in this market and could impose severe danger to public health and safety,” it said.The plea has sought implementation of the suggestions of a sub-committee which had inspected the Ghazipur market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-delhi-hc-to-hear-pil-for-ban-on-slaughtering-chicken-at-ghazipur-mandi-101610387620944.html
11-01-2021||India||'I was on top of the world' says Captain Zoya Aggarwal on landing Air India flight with first all-woman crew||"I was on top of the world" said an elated Captain Zoya Aggarwal, who headed the four-member all-woman cockpit crew that flew into Indian aviation history on Monday, landing the San Francisco-Bengaluru AI direct flight after going over the North Pole. As AI-176 landed at the Kempegowda International Airport here and the crew members walked to the lounge, a huge crowd of people gave a rousing reception for scripting history with the about 17-hour journey, the longest flight by the national carrier or any other airline in the country. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said the four-member cockpit crew created history while Governors of various states, leaders, including Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, and social media users lavishly praised the women pilots. Captain Aggarwal, the first pilot, said she felt as if she was on top of the world flying over the North pole, surrounded by Arctic ocean and the northernmost point on earth. "I was on the top of the world. I would rather call it, top of the North Pole because the North Pole was the world for me when I was commanding that Boeing-777 200 LR above 34,000 feet," she told PTI here. The other three women pilots were Captain Papagari Thanmai, Captain Akansha Sonaware and Captain Shivani Manhas and the flight that departed from San Francisco in the USA at around 8.30 pm (local time) on Saturday landed here at around 3.45 am on Monday. The direct distance between the two cities at opposite ends of the world is 13,993 km with a time zone change of around 13.5 hours. Asked if there was any fear flying over the Polar region, Aggarwal said she only felt excitement and her instructors had all along inculcated complete confidence in pilots like her. "I am very motivated...I don't think the word fear exists in Air India. No, not at all," she said. Thanking the ministry of civil aviation and the Air India for reposing faith on her and other crew members, Aggarwal said she was grateful, felt happy and humbled. She also gave credit to the 'weather God' as the weather across the polar region was "immaculate and suitable in order to make a polar flight happen". "In a moment to cherish & celebrate, women professionals of Indian civil aviation create history. Heartiest congratulations to Capt Zoya Aggarwal, Capt Papagari Thanmai, Capt Akansha Sonaware & Capt Shivani for flying over North Pole to land in Bengaluru from San Francisco," Puri tweeted. He hailed it as an embodiment of 'Nari Shakti'. Gandhi said: "Congratulations to the all-women cockpit crew for completing Air India's longest flight from San Francisco to Bengaluru over the North Pole. You have made the country proud," he said in a tweet. Aggarwal, hailing from a conservative family and the only child of her parents, broke the glass ceiling to become an AI pilot and carved a niche for herself by steering the inaugural flight from America. "I am the only child of my parents. So, I grew up in a world where I was taught to walk behind the men and their shadows and to grow up and get married and look after my kids," she recalled. She said when she told her parents her wish to become a pilot, her mother cried out of fear but today her mother's tears were out of joy. The AI flight, after getting airborne from San Francisco under the command of Captain Aggarwal left the polar region at a speed of 940 kmph as Captain Thanmai, the second pilot, steered the aircraft. "...Kudos for making Air India proud. We also congratulate passengers of AI176 for being part of this historic moment," the airline said, describing it as a landmark journey. The flight was operated with a Boeing 777-200LR aircraft with a seating capacity of 238 seats, including eight First Class, 35 Business Class,195 Economy class configuration besides four cockpit and 12 cabin crew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-top-of-the-world-captain-aggarwal-on-landing-ai-flight-with-all-woman-crew-101610386191587.html
11-01-2021||India||A new 'dawn': Serum Covid-19 vaccine shipment to start on Tuesday||Stocks of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, are likely to start moving out of Serum Institute of India's facility here on early Tuesday morning, days ahead of the nationwide inoculation drive, marking India's entry into a decisive phase against the anti-coronavirus fight.A source closely involved in logistical arrangements said the movement of vaccine doses is likely to start from early Tuesday morning through road and air routes amid elaborate police security."Some consignments will go by roadways and some will go by air," said the source.Trucks belonging to Kool-ex Cold Chain Ltd, which will be ferrying vaccine stocks, reached Serum Institute of India's (SII) Manjari facility on Monday evening, where loading of doses will take place, he said.Covishield is co-developed by the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the Pune-based SII.Among the first batch, one consignment is scheduled to be shipped by an Air India cargo flight to Ahmedabad."In the consignment there are 23 pieces weighing 736 kg which will be sent by air cargo," said a source from the airline.On Monday, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel tweeted that his state will receive the first consignment of coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday at 10.45 am at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport in Ahmedabad.Earlier in the day, the Union government placed a purchase order with Serum Institute of India (SII) for 11 million doses of Covishield, each costing ₹210, including GST, official sources said in New Delhi.Covishield vaccine doses would be initially shipped to 60 consignee points from where those would be distributed to various vaccination centres across India, the sources said.The Maharashtra government has already decided to provide police security to trucks carrying vaccine doses up to airports and the state's borders."Kool-ex Cold Chain is the lead vendor for the movement of the vaccine from the SII factory to over 50 primary government locations (depots) in the first leg," the company's co-founder, Rahul Agarwal, had said on Sunday.He had said about 300 GPS-fitted trucks will be used for shipping consignments and if needed 500 more will be roped in for the task.The country will launch its Covid-19 vaccination drive from January 16 in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world's largest inoculation programme with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.India had recently approved two vaccines, SII's Covishield and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, for restricted emergency use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-new-dawn-serum-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-to-start-on-tuesday-101610386184591.html

After maintaining that the National Democratic Alliance leadership would announce the Chief Ministerial candidate, following poll notification, the Saffron party appeared to have made a climbdown. "They are the major partners. In Tamil Nadu state, AIADMK is the major partner. They will decide who their next Chief Ministerial candidate is. They will decide," BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Tamil Nadu C T Ravi said here. Though the BJP had maintained that the CM candidate, would be from the largest constituent (AIADMK), it had said a formal decision and its announcement shall be made by the NDA Coordination Committee. The Tamil Nadu unit chief of the BJP, L Murugan had all along said an announcement on CM candidate would be made by the party top leadership and did not come forward to explicitly endorse the candidture of incumbent Chief Minister and AIADMK CM nominee, K Palaniswami. During the intervening period, when the BJP stuck to its stand, the AIADMK twice (on December 27 at its first poll rally and at its general council meet on January 9) made it clear that Palaniswami was the CM candidate. At its poll rally, the AIADMK said its partners had to accept its choice of CM candidate so as to be part of the alliance led by it in Tamil Nadu. Senior ruling party leader K P Munusamy also had spoken repeatedly that national parties had no sway in state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-admk-will-pick-nda-s-chief-ministerial-candidate-for-tn-assembly-polls-101610385201532.html
11-01-2021||India||At meeting with PM, Mamata Banerjee asks about efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday asked about the efficacy of the two Covid-19 vaccines which the Centre has decided to use during the nationwide inoculation drive and enquired why states were not given any option to choose between the two.During a virtual meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers of various states on the vaccination process starting January 16, Banerjee enquired whether or not the states have to purchase the vaccines for people other than those in the priority category such as health and other frontline workers.According to an official statement, she also asked if "adequate scientific confirmation was available in support of both the vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) that are now being offered by the government of India". Banerjee said that "states have been left with no option to choose or procure between the two vaccines and the Government of India has made a specific decision in favour of both the vaccines". She said that adequate scientific opinions should be obtained before confirming the efficacy of both the vaccines and sought a clarification on whether there was any side effect of the vaccines.Later, she was assured by Niti Aayog member Prof (Dr) Vinod K Paul that both the vaccines are "completely safe based on the scientific evidence" and there is no report of serious side effects.The chief minister also sought "frontline worker" status for transport workers and said that the authorities should provide them with the Covid-19 vaccine.At the meeting, she assured the Prime Minister that the state government is fully prepared for the vaccination exercise and various committees have been formed to handle the process, the statement said.She also informed the Prime Minister that the state has prepared adequate storage capacity for the storage of the vaccine, and all 941 cold chain points have been thoroughly inspected.The chief minister said that the state has identified 44,000 vaccinators and more than 4,000 vaccination sites across West Bengal for the first phase of the exercise.At least 5.8 lakh government and private healthcare workers have been enrolled for the first phase and all the data have been uploaded on Co-WIN portal, an online platform for monitoring Covid-19 vaccine delivery, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-meeting-with-pm-mamata-banerjee-asks-about-efficacy-of-covid-19-vaccines-101610384672718.html
11-01-2021||India||Don't want to appear before any SC-appointed committee: Farmer leaders||New Delhi, Jan 11 (PTI) A joint front of 40 agitating farmer unions on Monday welcomed the suggestion of the Supreme Court for a stay on the agri laws implementation but said they are not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by it.Pulling up the Centre for its handling of the farmers' protest, the apex court on Monday said it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going and will constitute a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India to resolve the impasse.“While all organisations welcome the suggestions of the Supreme Court to stay the implementation of the farm laws, they are collectively and individually not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by it,” a statement issued by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said.“We met our lawyers this evening and after deliberation on the pros and cons of the suggestions, we informed them that we are unanimously not agreeable to go before any committee that may be appointed by the Supreme Court today due to the stubborn attitude of the government,” it read.The umbrella body said the apex court was requested by their lawyers and by other counsel, including Harish Salve, to fix the next hearing on Tuesday to enable them to consult the farmer unions and seek their consent to the suggestion of the SC.“We have been told that no such hearing has been fixed for tomorrow as per the cause list already published for tomorrow till 9 PM and that only the matters are listed for pronouncements for order by the court. These events have deeply disappointed us, our lawyers and also farmers at large,” the Morcha said.Earlier in the day, farmer leaders said they would continue their agitation even if the government or the Supreme Court stays the implementation of the new agri laws.The farmer leaders, who said they were sharing their "personal opinion", were also of the view that a stay is "not a solution" as it is only for a fixed period of time.They were reacting after the Supreme Court indicated that it may stay the implementation of the contentious farm laws and refused to grant more time to the Centre to explore the possibility of an amicable solution saying it has already granted the government a “long rope”."We welcome the Supreme Court observation, but ending the protest is not an option. Any stay is only for a fixed period of time... till the issue is taken up by the court again," Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union President Gurnam Singh Chaduni said.The farmers want the laws to be repealed completely. The protest will continue even if the government or the Supreme Court stays their implementation, he said.National spokesperson of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rakesh Tikait said the Supreme Court's observations were "a slap on the face of the central government" and demanded the resignation of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.He was addressing the national executive committee of BKU at UP-gate -Ghazipur border.Bhog Singh Mansa, president of Indian Farmers Union (Mansa), said a stay on the laws is "no big deal"'."A stay on the laws is not a solution. We are here to get these laws scrapped completely... the government has in a way already agreed to scrap the laws when it said it is willing to incorporate as many amendments as farmers want," he said."We appeal to the Supreme Court to terminate these laws as these are not valid constitutionally," Mansa said, adding the protest will continue till 'the laws are not repealed or the BJP government completes its tenure'.Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa echoed similar sentiments, saying the agitation started with the demand of scrapping the agri laws and "it will end only when we win this fight".Eight rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions have failed to end the deadlock as the Centre ruled out repealing the contentious laws while the farmer leaders said their 'ghar waapsi will happen only after law waapsi'.The apex court had earlier sought the Centre's response on a batch of pleas against the three contentious farm laws -- the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Hundreds of agitating farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping on Delhi's borders since November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-to-appear-before-any-sc-appointed-committee-farmer-leaders-101610384825050.html

11-01-2021||India||China pulls back 10,000 troops from Ladakh theatre||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pulled back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions in the midst of the ongoing border standoff between India and China, officials familiar with the development said on Monday.ALSO WATCH | Indian Army detains Chinese soldier after he crosses LAC in LadakhBut despite withdrawing around 10,000 troops, the PLA’s frontline deployments remain unchanged, said one of the officials cited above. The withdrawal of troops appears to be linked to extreme weather conditions in the sector, said a second official.The Chinese troop withdrawal, experts said, has to be seen against the backdrop of the overall Indian and Chinese military deployments in the theatre --- both armies have deployed a total of 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas.“In winters, large-scale or even limited military operations are ruled out. That’s possibly the reason why the PLA has withdrawn troops from depth areas,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General (retd) DS Hooda.The reduction of 10,000 troops has happened over the last week to 10 days, said a third official. The Indian army is closely monitoring the developments in the Ladakh theatre as a re-induction of troops by the PLA in the sector cannot be ruled out, said a fourth official.The Ladakh standoff is in its ninth month, with soldiers holding forward positions at friction points in extreme weather conditions. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-level officers.Even as the ground situation remains unchanged in the Ladakh sector, chief of defence (CDS) staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday reached Leh for a security review of the sensitive area. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria also visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh on Monday.General Rawat’s two-day tour will also see him visit forward locations in Kashmir.During the Ladakh leg of the tour, the CDS will be briefed by the local military leadership on the prevailing security situation, officials said. He will also visit forward areas in the sector and interact with troops deployed there.The air chief on Monday visited air force stations and advanced landing grounds (ALGs) in the Ladakh sector, the IAF said in a statement.The air chief was briefed on the air force's operational readiness to deal with any contingency in the Ladakh theatre, amid the ongoing border row with China. He also interacted with IAF personnel deployed at forward locations."During his visit to Thoise, he reviewed the ongoing logistics operations for support and sustenance of troops in the winter season. He also visited DBO and Nyoma ALGs where he was given a security overview in the respective sub-sectors," the statement said.The air chief also joined the CDS for a comprehensive discussion on operational matters with senior IAF and Indian Army commanders at the Leh airbase, it added.In a year-end review of major developments published on January 1, the defence ministry said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation in the sensitive theatre by using unorthodox weapons against Indian soldiers and amassing a large number of troops during the ongoing border standoff along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The ministry said the PLA attempted to alter the status quo in the sector by force but the Indian Army was well-entrenched to counter any misadventure by the adversary.In his first official engagement outside the Capital in the New Year, General Rawat visited India’s forward air bases in the eastern sector on January 2-3 and interacted with frontline soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh.“Nothing can deter the Indian armed forces from remaining steadfast in their call of duty,” he said during that visit. While the current border row is confined to the Ladakh theatre, the Indian military is on high alert to deal with any misadventure by the Chinese forces all along the border --- stretching from Ladakh in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east.While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The developments on both banks of Pangong Tso have increased India’s bargaining power during talks with the Chinese side, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pulls-back-10-000-troops-from-ladakh-theatre-101610382216148.html

Today under the protection of police a BJP goon was allowed to splash me with black ink. I want Yogi to come forward & talk to me. Not exhibit 'gunda raj’,” Bharti told ANI.Bharti tweeted that his bail application has been kept pending till January 13 and he has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days. He was arrested for criminal intimidation and promoting enmity between groups, police told news agency PTI, following remarks two days ago allegedly referring to Adityanath and the state's hospitals.The MLA from Delhi's Malviya Nagar also retweeted a video clip in which he can be heard calling Adityanath a “gunda”, while talking about "atrocities on women" in the state.The ink throwing incident and Bharti’s arrest drew a sharp reaction from Delhi chief minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal. "Yogiji, our MLA Somnath Bharti ji was going to see your government school. Ink was thrown at him? Are your schools so bad? If someone goes to see your school then why do you get so scared? Fix the school,” he tweeted, asking him to consult Delhi’s deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia on how to go about it.“Yogi ji, you are ruining the future of crores of children of Uttar Pradesh," he wrote in another post.On the other hand, Shalabh Mani Tripathi, information advisor to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, slammed Bharti for allegedly using “indecent language” for a chief minister and abusing policemen discharging their duties. “This is the language of goons,” he was quoted as saying by PTI."Arvind Kejriwal is himself a chief minister. If he has the slightest idea about the post of a chief minister, then he should tender an apology to the entire country for the statement made by Bharti for UP's popular chief minister," he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aaps-somnath-bharti-wants-yogi-to-come-forward-talk-after-ink-hurled-at-him-in-up-101610379580100.html

11-01-2021||India||What PM Modi, chief ministers discussed at Covid vaccine roll-out meet: 5 points||Prime minister Narendra Modi on Monday held a virtual meeting with the chief ministers of states to review the status and preparedness for the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive that begins on January 16. Modi lauded the constant coordination and communication between the Centre and the states, and timely decision making, which he said, played a big role in the fight against the virus. He also appreciated the state governments for working zealously in the battle against the coronavirus disease.Meanwhile, the government has sent a purchase order of 11 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Serum Institute of India. The cost of the vaccine to the government is Rs200 per vaccine dose for the first 100 million doses.At the meeting, the Prime Minister also discussed the bird flu that has spread to at least 10 states across the nation.Here are the most important points from the meetingWorld’s biggest vaccination campaign: Modi said that the country is in a decisive phase of the Covid-19 fight and is set to kickstart the world’s biggest vaccination campaign from January 16. He underlined that it's a matter of pride that both the vaccines—Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin—for which emergency use authorisation have been given are made in India.He highlighted that both the approved vaccines are highly cost effective in comparison to other vaccines from across the world, adding that India would have faced great difficulty if it would have had to depend on foreign vaccines.Frontline workers to be vaccinated first: In his address, Modi said the priority of vaccination has been decided as per advice of the experts and scientific community after consultation with the states. Health workers, from both government and private sector, will be the first ones to receive the vaccine. Along with them, cleaners and other frontline workers, police and paramilitary forces, home guards, disaster management volunteers and other jawans in civil defence, and revenue officials associated with containment and surveillance, will also receive the vaccine in the first phase.The total number of such personnel is around three crore. Modi announced that state governments will not have to bear any cost towards vaccinating in the first stage and that the Centre will bear the cost. In the second stage, those above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with high risk of infection, will be vaccinated.Co-Win software: The most important factor in the vaccination drive is the identification and monitoring of those who need to be vaccinated, the PM said, adding, for this Co-Win digital platform has been created. With the help of Aadhaar, beneficiaries will be identified and even the timely second dosage will be ensured. He emphasised on the significance of ensuring that real time data related to vaccination is uploaded on Co-Win.After a person receives the first dose of vaccination, Co-Win will immediately generate a digital vaccination certificate. This certificate will also act as a reminder for the second dose, after which, a final certificate will be given.Target of 30 crore in next few months: The Prime Minister said that the vaccination drive in the country is also significant since several other nations are going to follow India. He said that vaccination for Covid-19 has been going on in about 50 countries since past 3-4 weeks, and till now, only about 2.5 crore people have received vaccination. India aims to achieve vaccination for 30 crore people in the next few months, he said.Bird flu challenge: The avian influenza has so far spread in Kerala, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Maharashtra. Modi said that the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has put in place a plan to tackle the problem, in which district magistrates will have a key role. He asked chief ministers of the affected states to guide their DMs for the same. He told other states to make sure they are on constant vigil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-pm-modi-chief-ministers-discussed-at-covid-vaccine-roll-out-meet-5-points-101610375741255.html
11-01-2021||India||After 9 months, CM Naveen Patnaik to address his first political rally||By Debabrata MohantyIn a bid to take the sting out of opposition's criticism that chief minister Naveen Patnaik has kept himself indoors in last nine months, the Biju Janata Dal chief is set to make a major public appearance by inaugurating a mega lift irrigation project in Kalahandi district on January 14.Patnaik, who has been homebound except for a couple of public appearances at Puri and Bhubaneswar, is scheduled to inaugurate the Indravati mega lift irrigation project that would help irrigate at least 26,000 hectares of farmland in Dharmagarh block, Koksara block and Jaipatna block. The 33 kilometre-long irrigation canal would irrigate 90 villages of 33 gram panchayats benefitting over 50,000 people.After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Patnaik has hardly stepped outside and attends routine Cabinet meetings at State Secretariat through video conferencing from his residence Naveen Niwas. He did not even campaign for the Assembly bypolls in November last year, preferring to address the voters of Tirtol and Balasore through virtual mode.Also read: 'Centre to bear expenses for phase 1 of Covid vaccination' - PM Modi"I am aware of your immense love and affection towards me. If I visit, you (people) will come in large numbers which may not be good for the public health during this pandemic situation. Therefore, I preferred to reach you through digital mode," Patnaik had told the voters even as opposition Congress and BJD routinely slammed him for staying indoors.But with Covid-19 numbers on a wane, the public meeting in Kalahandi is being seen as setting the stage for the BJD's launch of the campaign for the forthcoming urban body polls scheduled to be held sometime this year. The party, which celebrated its 23rd-anniversary last month, has made elaborate arrangements for Patnaik's meeting. BJD sources said 65 MLAs and ministers have been asked to put out LED screens in 38 gram panchayats so that people can listen to his address.BJD spokesman Pratap Deb said the Kalahandi meeting was more of an opportunity to break the political lull that has dominated the state's landscape since the beginning of the pandemic. "Not many CMs are going out in public due to the pandemic. So the CM too was indoors. Now Covid numbers are coming down and that's why he decided to come out in the public. The party recently saw a major organisational reshuffle and this would be first public meeting in its aftermath," said Deb.Leader of opposition and BJP leader from Kalahandi, Pradipta Naik said the public meeting may signal break of political lull for the chief minister, but for people of Kalahandi it does not mean anything. "Thousands of people in the district are still waiting to get a pucca house. Nothing gets done in panchayats without greasing the officials even though he professes to run a clean administration," said Naik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-9-months-cm-naveen-patnaik-to-address-his-first-political-rally-101610375790058.html
11-01-2021||India||As protest against IIT garners support, Goa CM offers parley but with condition||By Gerard de SouzaGoa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Monday said he was open to 'discuss' with the villagers protesting against the IIT project but that the government would not withdraw its proposal to build the IIT at the site that has been identified.Speaking to reporters at the state secretariat, Sawant said that the ‘unrest’ in the village needed to settle down“We are open to discuss the issue. The government is ready to discuss it. We want to make the IIT there. We do not want to cause them (the villagers) any trouble. I do not want to cause anybody any trouble or inconvenience but they should support us in the development,” Sawant said.When asked if he would visit the protesting villagers to discuss the issue, Sawant replied in the negative.“They should come and meet me. I have already visited the village once,” he said adding that first, the unrest needs to settle down.Sawant’s statements come even as the villagers protesting against the IIT project have hardened their stance and demanded the release of all those arrested in connection with the clashes. They also seek the withdrawal of cases filed against the villagers for rioting and the suspension of the police inspector Sagar Ekoskar, who they say is responsible for provoking the violence on January 6. Ekoskar is accused of stomping over the protesting villagers who had set up a blockade by sleeping across the entrance of the site in a bid to stop government surveyors.“We are giving the government 10 days to withdraw the decision to build the IIT in our village. We are firm that we do not want the IIT to come up here. Today, people from many villages and the rest of Goa have come to support us,” Shubham Shivolkar, co-convener of the organisation set up to oppose the IIT project, said.Also read: 'No difference!' Mamata Banerjee compares BJP with Donald Trump’s followers“PI Ekoskar should be booked, he should be terminated and legal action should be initiated against him,” Shivolkar said.The villagers have received support from the neighbouring villages of Mauxi, Damashe from where villagers marched in support of their neighbours. Despite the efforts of the police to curtail the procession of villagers from neighbouring villages to the protest site, agitation swelled on Monday.Sawant said that the demarcation work would resume after the issue had settled down.What began as murmurs of discontent against the proposed IIT, the agitation gathered pace after the government decided to fast track the project.In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 10 lakh sq. metres of land in Melaulim village in North Goa for setting up of IIT-Goa. Functional since 2014, IIT Goa has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College.Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub-districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were scrapped in face of protests from residents.Two people arrested by the police for their alleged role in the violence of last week were granted bail by a local court on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-protest-against-iit-garners-support-goa-cm-offers-parley-but-with-condition-101610373946655.html

As per the schedule, the first phase of elections for gram panchayats would be held on February 5, second phase on February 9, third phase on February 13 and fourth phase on February 17.The notifications for these four phases of elections would be issued on January 23, January 27, January 31 and February 4 respectively. He also announced enforcement of model code of conduct with effect from Saturday.The Jagan government, which has been at loggerheads n with Ramesh Kumar ever since the latter kept the local body elections in abeyance in March owing to Coronavirus pandemic, strongly objected to the unilateral announcement of the schedule for the conduct of local body elections by the SEC.“This is nothing but defying the directions of the Supreme Court, which said the state election commission should decide the schedule only after consulting with the state government on its preparedness,” state principal secretary, panchayat raj, Gopala Krishna Dwivedi said in a statement.He said the three-member committee of senior officials headed by chief secretary Adityanath Das, which met Ramesh Kumar, categorically told him that the elections to local bodies could not be conducted due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation and vaccination programme being rolled out by the Government of India from January 16.“The commissioner did not heed to the suggestions given by the state government, which said the conduct of elections was not possible as the entire government machinery would be busy with the vaccination programme. He has announced the schedule with caring for the public health and sought to play with the lives of the people,” Dwivedi said.On Sunday, state government employees’ unions, police officers’ association and representatives of the health department employees’ union issued separate statements announcing that they would not take part in the electioneering, as they could not take risk during the pandemic season.Ramesh Kumar defended his decision to hold the elections in February as the state government’s excuses were untenable. He said near normalcy had returned with the opening up of commercial and educational spheres of activity and political mobilization too was going on at a large scale without visible observance of social distancing.“Now, the government wants deferment of elections on the pretext of vaccination, which is a continuous process. In fact, the phase-III of the vaccination programme will extend up to 2022. Hence, elections cannot be postponed till then,” Ramesh Kumar argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-high-court-suspends-election-schedule-for-local-body-polls-101610373401946.html

Sea Vigil and Tropex together will cover the entire spectrum of maritime security challenges, including transition from peace to conflict,” Commander Madhwal said.While exercises at a smaller scale are conducted in coastal states regularly, Sea Vigil stands out because of its sheer scale and complexity. India revamped its coastal security architecture after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and security drills have been conducted regularly over the years to test the preparedness of security agencies to ward off maritime threats.Sea Vigil-21 will provide an opportunity to assess the country’s preparedness in the maritime security and coastal defence domains, Commander Madhwal said.“It will provide a realistic assessment of our strengths and weaknesses and thus will help in further strengthening maritime and national security,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-kick-off-major-coastal-security-exercise-on-tuesday-101610370907404.html

Kejriwal attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath by questioning the conditions of government schools in his state. He also said that if the chief minister doesn't know how to fix the schools he should ask Manish Sisodia, who is the education minister of Delhi under the AAP rule in the capital."Yogiji, our MLA Somnath Bharti ji was going to see your government school.

Art lovers say tourists line up before the helicopter to take selfies and group photos these days ignoring the sculpture and it was a deliberate move to outshine the art.The octogenarian artist, who was the disciple of legendary artist K C S Paniker, was equally upset and threatened not to attend any government function till the ‘machine’ was removed.“I was really shocked to see the insensitive attitude of the government. The space was my canvass and everything in the background was part of it. I made ‘Jalakanyaka’ (Mermaid) as a tribute to the sea. I don’t know how they placed a machine beside my work of art,” said the angry artist who sculpted many statues, busts and art forms in Kerala, Chennai and the National Gallery of Modern Arts in New Delhi.He said he was not against tourism but it should not be at the cost of an art form and claimed that he was not consulted before the helicopter was placed beside his ‘progeny.’“I really toiled to sculpt ‘Jalakanyaka’ and spent more than a month with fishermen 30 years ago to conceive the idea. Many foreign countries invited me to settle there but I made Kerala my home. Is this reward you give the artist in his twilight years,” he said.Writer and columnist Paul Zacharia was the first to air his concern and many writers and artists soon rallied around him saying it was as good as killing the 30-year-old sculpture. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP leader and former Governor of Mizoram Kummanam Rajasekharan also deplored the move.“It is a painful thing. Travellers and tourists will bemoan such an inhuman act,” said famous travel writer and blogger Santosh George Kulangara. He said the Air Force helicopter should have been kept in a children’s park or museum. Art connoisseurs allege the helicopter was installed near the statue during the early stages of lockdown last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic when visitors were not allowed in tourist destinations.But a senior official of the tourism department said the Air Force had chosen the spot after a request for space to place the helicopter to attract youth to join the force. The official said they never thought it would trigger such a protest. He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was aware of the controversy and would take a final decision on the issue soon.Kerala’s tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran was also in a fire-fighting mode.“I will talk to the artist soon,” said state tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran.Art lovers have threatened a sit-in before the ‘Mermaid’ if ‘justice’ was not done in a couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-art-lovers-fume-after-chopper-installation-near-iconic-mermaid-sculpture-101610368777945.html

Our creative industries will play a crucial part in the recovery,” he wrote on the microblogging site.The announcement comes days after theatres in the state reopened on Tuesday with strict Covid-19 restrictions in place. However, not all movie theatres resumed operations as they were waiting for the government’s response on their demands to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the tickets, and exemption from entertainment tax to allow recovery. They had also asked for a waiver on the monthly fixed electricity charge below ₹50,000, allowing cinemas to make up for the losses they have incurred in the past nine months.While other demands have been accepted, as indicated in the chief minister’s tweet, there is no clarity yet on whether the GST on tickets has been reduced or if it will be done in the coming days.Currently, theatres have only been allowed to run on 50% occupancy which has created contention amongst theatre owners who have asked the government to increase seating capacity to 80%.

The central government will bear the cost of vaccination for the initial 30 million individuals (health care and frontline workers). The state governments will not have to shell out money for this group. The Union finance ministry has already approved Rs480 crore for operational cost which is over and above the cost of the Covid-19 vaccine that central government is paying for. Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, SII, had earlier said that the company had offered the Indian government a special price of Rs200 for the first 100 million doses of Covishield, less than the $3 it had quoted earlier.In the private market, SII is likely to sell for a Rs1,000 per dose as MRP. The export price is expected to be between $3-5 depending on the different countries the company signs deals with. According to government sources, India is rolling out the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive across the country on January 16.Close to 300 million high-risk people are on the government’s priority list; they will be vaccinated in the next seven-eight months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-inks-deal-for-11-million-covishield-doses-with-serum-institute-101610366064869.html

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the petition by a woman who has also sought to nullify her marriage which was allegedly performed when she was a minor.The woman has also sought a declaration from the court that every child marriage performed in the state should be null and void right from its onset.The court issued notice to the woman’s father, brother and the man she was allegedly married to, seeking their response to the plea before February 12, the next date of hearing.According to the woman, represented by advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, when her marriage was performed in April 2010, she was in class 10 and could not go against her parents.The woman, who claims to be born on December 10, 1993, said she was residing with her parents till November 19, 2020, when the person to whom she was married, came with his parents to take her to Gujarat with them.When she objected, she was allegedly beaten up by her brother in front of everyone at the behest of the man she was married to.

Earlier this month, the mother had alleged that the government was forced to go slow in the case as some of the accused were connected with the ruling CPI(M). Last week, a division bench of Kerala high court had set aside the verdict of Palakkad special court for Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act (POCSO) acquitting all the accused and ordered a re-trial in the case. The mother’s petition seeking a central agency probe was also pending before the high court. Two Dalit sisters had died by suicide after alleged repeated sexual harassment by the accused in 2017. The 9-year-old and 13 -year-old allegedly hanged themselves in their house when their parents were away at work. But their parents alleged that both were murdered fearing they will disclose the harassment. In October 2019, the POCSO court acquitted all the four accused due to lack of evidence and after several witnesses turned hostile. After setting aside the POCSO court judgment, the high court also rapped the investigating team and prosecution for serious lapses in the probe and the subsequent trial. Fearing further criticism from the court, the government was forced to hand over the case to the CBI as a face-saver, said legal experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walayar-siblings-death-kerala-to-hand-over-case-to-cbi-101610365405189.html

Nadda was addressing a Vijay Sankalpa (Victory Pledge) rally at police parade ground in Barak Valley’s Silchar ahead of the next assembly polls in the state likely to be held in April-May. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and senior party leaders like general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh and state in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda were present at the rally. “The task of protecting Assam’s culture, language and identity has been done well by the BJP governments at the Centre and the state and we will continue that. We have been sensitive about the rights of Assamese people,” said Nadda. Also read | ‘Centre earmarked Rs59,000cr for scholarships to backward classes in Assam’The BJP president’s assurance comes amid launch of several new regional parties in the state which have accused the saffron party of not being sincere in safeguarding Assam’s ‘jaati’ (community), ‘maati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (base) as promised earlier. Nadda mentioned the initiatives taken by Centre and the state governments towards developing Assam and empowering communities. He cited examples of grant of scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities, signing of the third Bodo peace accord and smart fencing of border areas with Bangladesh. “During 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in Centre, Assam received Rs50,000 crore in assistance. But since 2014 when National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP came to power, the state has got Rs300,000 crore,” he said. Nadda targeted the Congress and said that Assam didn’t do well on any front in the 15 years of rule of the party between 2001 and 2016. “During those 15 years, the state saw killings of 2,155 civilians and 284 security personnel and over 12,000 people were kidnapped. Over 51% area of the state was not covered by electrification and 56% homes didn’t have toilets. All that has changed in the recent years,” he said. Nadda said voters were eager to bring back BJP to power and the party, along with its allies, will win over 100 of the 126 total seats in the assembly. From Silchar, Nadda will visit Guwahati and take part in a meeting with party office bearers apart from a few other organisational meetings. He will spend the night in Guwahati and will leave for Delhi on Tuesday after visiting Kamakhya Temple in the morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-protect-assam-s-culture-language-identity-says-nadda-in-silchar-rally-101610364385408.html

This platform will further our efforts by bringing huge investment and creating employment," he said.The home minister said the single-window clearance system will ensure the process of obtaining clearances smooth for operationalisation of coal mines.Shah said this was yet another manifestation of the prime minister's commitment towards bringing the transparency and transformation in India's coal sector.He also congratulated Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi for his efforts to boost the sector. Shah said that the country has reached a position where the coal sector can be the biggest contributor towards the target of India becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.He said despite having the world's fourth-largest coal reserves, India is importing coal and this is not right for the country.Presently, about 19 major approval or clearances are required before starting a coal mine in the country.In the absence of a unified platform for grant of clearances, the companies were required to approach different departments leading to delay in operationalisation of coal mines, Joshi said.Now, the complete process will be facilitated through the single-window clearance portal in a phased way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-in-coal-sector-to-give-fillip-to-india-s-economy-amit-shah-101610363542526.html

The civil court had granted Sood three weeks to approach high court and had restrained the civic body from taking any action of demolition till then.Sood had filed the application in his pending suit before the civil court, challenging two notices issued by BMC -- one for demolition of the additions and alterations made in Shakti Sagar Building, a ground-plus-six storeyed structure at Juhu and the other concerning unauthorised change of use of the building from residential to commercial.The actor moved the high court on January 5 after the civil court rejected his plea for interim relief. His counsel, advocate Amogh Singh, on Monday urged the HC to continue the restraining order passed by the civil court, contending that otherwise the appeal would become infructuous.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare and advocate Joel Karlos, who represented BMC, pointed out that the actor has put up unauthorised partitions across all floors in the building and also converted the residential building into a hotel without taking requisite permissions from the civic authorities for the change of user.Sakhare also pointed out that the illegal additions and alterations were twice demolished earlier by the civic body, once in 2018 and later, on February 14, 2020.Singh, however, maintained that the building was not being used as a hotel, but a residential hotel. He said there is a difference between a hotel and a residential hotel, where flats are rented out to guests for relatively longer period of time.Singh submitted that Sood had in, 2018 itself, filed an application for regularisation of the alterations but the civic body had yet not taken a decision on it. He contended that it was impermissible for BMC to take any action as regards the building when the application was pending.The matter will now come up for further hearing on January 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-construction-case-relief-for-sonu-sood-as-hc-extends-order-against-bmc-action-till-january-13-101610362164452.html

Last month, Lakhipur Congress MLA Rajdeep Goala resigned from the Assembly and joined the saffron party.The main opposition party Congress received a setback after the death of its heavyweight and three-term chief minister Tarun Gogoi.

The research team modelled the breathing frequency in a laboratory and found that low breathing frequency increases the time of residence of the virus and, therefore, it increases chances of deposition and consequently, the infection.Also, the multi-scale lung structure has a significant effect on a person’s susceptibility to Covid-19. The research was led by Prof. Mahesh Panchagnula, department of applied mechanics, IIT Madras, with his research scholars Arnab Kumar Mallik and Soumalya Mukherjee.The findings of this study were published in the international journal ‘Physics of Fluids’.“Covid-19 has opened a gap in our understanding of deep pulmonological systemic diseases. Our study unravels the mystery behind how particles are transported and deposited in the deep lung. The study demonstrates the physical process by which aerosol particles are transported into the deep generations of the lung,” said Panchagnula, while elaborating on the need for such research. In their research, the team reported that holding the breath and having low breathing rate can increase chances of virus deposition in the lungs.Also read | India clocks 16,311 new Covid-19 cases, 161 deaths“The study was conducted to pave the way for developing better therapies and drugs for respiratory infections. Previous work from the group has also highlighted the significant variability in aerosol uptake from individual to individual, suggesting a reason why some people are more susceptible to airborne diseases than others,” the institute said in a statement. Airborne infections such as Covid-19 spread immensely through sneezing and coughing as it instantly releases a large volume of tiny droplets.The team imitated the droplet dynamics in the lung by studying the movement of droplets in the small capillaries which were of similar diameter to bronchioles. They took water mixed with fluorescent particles and generated aerosols from this liquid using a nebulizer. These fluorescent aerosols were used to track the movement and deposition of particles in the capillaries. The researchers studied the movement of the fluorescent aerosol particles in capillaries of size ranging from 0.3 to 2 millimetres which covers the range of bronchiole diameters. They found that the deposition is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of capillaries, which suggests that the droplets are likely to deposit in longer bronchioles. The scientists also studied how the ‘Reynolds Number,’ a parameter that quantifies the nature of flow - steady or turbulent, determines the deposition in the capillaries. They found that when the flow of aerosol movement is steady then the particles deposit via the process of diffusion, however, if the flow is turbulent then the particles deposit via the process of impaction. “In future, the team intends to continue this work to understand how the virus-laden droplets are transported into lungs as the process by which the virus is transported from the nasal cavity to the deep lung is still unknown. An understanding of the physics of this phenomenon could be crucial in mitigating the progression of the disease,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holding-your-breath-may-increase-risk-of-getting-covid-19-say-iit-madras-researchers-101610361024579.html

Last week, the party had engaged farmers in a similar Kisan Ghera.The Yuva Ghera, unlike the farmer connect, will be held in both rural and urban areas of all districts of the state.Kisan Gheras were held in villages only. Yuva Ghera will be held in schools and colleges.Also Read: For BJP, panchayat polls a ‘test’ match before 2022 UP assembly electionsSamajwadi Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, “According to instructions by the national president Akhilesh Yadav, the party’s leaders and workers will hold discussions with youths on their issues—education becoming costlier, unemployment, police implicating them in cases, lack of investments, closing factories, retrenchment, job losses, problems and anomalies in online education and the neglect of students of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.”Chaudhary said that the party will also discuss youth welfare programmes and schemes that the previous Samajwadi Party government implemented—such as free laptops to students.Chaudhary said that Swami Vivekananda, a youth icon, would not just discuss spirituality. He used to connect it with social issues as well and in his nationalism there was an element and spirit of sacrifice and service towards deprived sections. He emphasised tolerance and universal acceptance which constitute the essence of democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-samajwadi-party-s-youth-connect-campaign-to-take-place-tomorrow-101610360295958.html

Only a few people are buying chicken," said Sunny Kumar Sahu, a poultry shop owner.Sanjay Kumar, another shop owner said, "We cannot say anything definitive about the situation except that people are believing in it. Our market has gone down by 50 per cent. But we're fine. We live with the chickens."Bihar poultry business also witnessed a decline amid the spread of the avian influenza cases."The number of customers has reduced. People are sceptical of buying chicken and eating it now," said a poultry shop owner.A similar trend was observed in Hyderabad where common people are avoiding poultry product consumption."The number of customers has declined due to rumours of the bird flu in the state," said Saheed Khan, owner of Khan Poultry in the Nampally market."I urge central and state governments to help us as most of phe Poultry shop ownershere will not be able to pay their rent. We had a major set-back during the lockdown," he added.As bird flu has been confirmed in seven states, the Central government issued an advisory to the affected states in a bid to avoid further spread of the disease.Central teams have been deployed to visit the affected states of Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring. Furthermore, besides increasing surveillance around water bodies, live bird markets, zoos, poultry farms, proper disposal of carcass, and strengthening of bio-security in poultry farms have to be ensured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-scare-causes-loss-in-poultry-businesses-across-india-101610359996268.html

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said that the board had written to all the concerned departments to take prompt action to check release of pollutants in the air. “Enforcement of the plan lies in the hands of various government departments,” Ghosh said.The BSPCB has also recently tied up with the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) to launch a crackdown on brick-kilns not following the newer zigzag technique to reduce emission. “The UNDP would provide real time data on stubble burning also,” said Ghosh.Air quality analyst of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), citing AQI data of the past three years of Patna, claimed that people of the state capital were forced to breathe the worst quality of air in the month of January. “AQI of Patna on January 1 at 4pm was found to be in the severe category, which is considered the worst,” said the CEED official.The CEED analyst said that lack of coordination among rule enforcing departments, burning of solid fuel, unrestrained plying of polluting vehicles, open burning of wastes and poor management of dust at the contraction sites were the major factors responsible for ‘low hanging fruits’ that led to severe degradation of air quality. “Low hanging fruits can be managed with serious intervention of the law enforcing machineries,” he said. Another environmental activist said that dust particles, which is a bane for Gangetic plains, could be managed by regular spraying of water on under construction roads and roads with heavy traffic. “Water shall be sprayed on trees along the road to improve the AQI,” he said. Ghosh said that the board had allotted funds to the Patna municipal corporation (PMC) to purchase water sprinklers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-grapples-with-severe-air-pollution-after-2-years-of-clean-action-plan-101610359045951.html
11-01-2021||India||Police complaint lodged against TMC MP for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments||A police complaint was lodged against Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee on Sunday for allegedly making a controversial statement linking Goddess Sita and Hathras rape victim. While addressing a gathering at Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, Banerjee reportedly said past Saturday, “Sita went up to Ram and said, ‘I am fortunate that I was abducted by Ravan. Had it been your chelas (followers), who wear saffron head bands, my fate would have been the same as that of the rape victim in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh’.” The BJP alleged that the MP’s speech had hurt Hindu sentiments and called it the TMC’s appeasement politics. The party’s IT cell chief, Amit Malviya, tweeted, “TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee used derogatory language against Sita mata. Claims that she told Bhagwaan Ram she was glad , “Thank God, I was abducted by Ravan and not by your chelas or else my fate would have been same as Hathras victim!” Is trampling on Hindu sentiment Pishi’s idea of appeasement?” The complaint against Banerjee was lodged with Golabari police station in Howrah by Bharatiya Janata Youth Morcha leader Ashish Jaiswal. “The language used by MP Kalyan Banerjee has insulted and humiliated religious sentiments of crores of Hindus not only in West Bengal but also in India. World over Hindus worship Goddess Sita,” Jaiswal wrote in his complaint. HT has a copy of Jaiswal’s complaint. Top police officials of Howrah refused to comment. Senior TMC leaders also refused to comment, saying that only Banerjee could comment on the issue as he was the one who made those statements. Banerjee, however, refused to take calls and didn’t respond to messages. Meanwhile, the TMC has accused the BJP of insulting Bengali sentiments over Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s recent statement. Speaking to media persons, the Union minister, who is the state as a part of the BJP’s poll campaign, said, “Whenever there was any injustice or atrocity in the world, the first voice was raised from Bengal. Rallies were brought out when the US attacked Vietnam. There were protests in Kolkata if there was any incident in Delhi. But now, when anyone says Jai Shri Ram in Kolkata and his house is set on fire and innocent workers (BJP workers) are sent to jail, then the neighbour [also] doesn’t say a word. The DNA has changed.” The TMC hit back, saying that those who think Bengali’s DNA has weakened are living in fool’s paradise. “This is highly insulting. Those who think that Bengalis have forgotten to protest and their DNA has weakened are living in fool’s paradise. The people of Bengal are against communalism and hence hate BJP,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister and senior TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-complaint-lodged-against-tmc-mp-for-allegedly-hurting-hindu-sentiments-101610359166683.html

11-01-2021||India||Better air quality, drop in minimum temp likely over parts of northwest India||Air quality over northwest India is likely to improve and minimum temperatures are likely to drop further on Monday due to strong cold northwesterly winds.Minimum temperature had started dropping over many parts of northwest India including Delhi on Sunday following a western disturbance that affected the western Himalayas on January 7 and 8.Bahadurgarh, Ballabhgarh, Bhiwadi, Bhiwani, Gurugram recorded “moderate” air quality this morning while Delhi, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida recorded “poor” air quality.Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 7.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday compared to 10.8 degree Celsius on Saturday. Delhi’s Palam also recorded “cold day” conditions as maximum temperatures dropped significantly below normal on Sunday.On Sunday, Palam recorded a maximum temperature of 14.2 degrees Celsius, 6 degrees below normal while Safdarjung recorded 16.2 degrees Celsius, 4 degrees below normal.Also Read: Heavy snowfall declared as state specific natural calamity under SDRF in J&KDue to the prevalence of dry north or northwesterly winds over most parts of northwest India, minimum temperature is likely to fall gradually by 3-4 degrees Celsius during the next 3-4 days which may cause isolated cold wave conditions over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan on January 12 and 13.Strong surface winds (speed 15-25kmph) are very likely over the plains of northwest India during the next three days according to India Meteorological Department’s Sunday bulletin.“Very cold northwesterly winds are blowing from snow-clad Himalayas towards Delhi so both maximum and minimum temperatures have fallen. Winds are blowing at 20-25kmph so the perception of cold is stronger. They are chilly winds. We are expecting cold day conditions over Delhi for the next few days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to IMD a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or 6.4 degrees below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures is lower than normal.Despite very strong winds Delhi recorded “poor” category air quality with an air quality index of 245 on Sunday. Strong winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail from January 10 to 13. The air quality is likely to remain in “poor” to “moderate” category on January 11 and 12 according to the air quality early warning system for Delhi under ministry of earth sciences.“Air quality was in ‘very poor’ category. It has improved to ‘poor’ category and is improving further. We are likely to see ‘moderate’ air quality for two or three days due to strong winds,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division.Under the influence of a cyclonic circulation over equatorial Indian ocean and adjoining central parts of South Bay of Bengal up to mid tropospheric levels, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next three days. Heavy to very heavy rainfall also likely over south Tamil Nadu during January 11 and 12 and over Kerala and Mahe on January 12.Due to a trough (area of low pressure) in low-level easterlies from southeast Arabian Sea to northwest Madhya Pradesh, scattered rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat and west Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-air-quality-drop-in-minimum-temp-likely-over-parts-of-northwest-india-101610356228415.html
11-01-2021||India||Bombay HC extends relief to Sonu Sood in 'illegal' construction case||The Bombay High Court on Monday extended till January 13 a civil court order granting interim protection to actor Sonu Sood from coercive action by the BMC against the alleged illegal structural changes made by him in a residential building in suburban Juhu without permission.Sood last week approached the HC, challenging a notice issued against him by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in October last year and an order passed by a civil court in December dismissing his suit against the BMC's action.The civil court, while dismissing the suit, had granted three weeks time to Sood to file an appeal and stayed its order, thus granting relief to the actor.On Monday, BMC's counsel Anik Sakhare sought time to respond to the actor's petition.Sood's advocate Amogh Singh then sought interim protection and a direction to the civic body to not take any coercive action.Justice Prithviraj Chavan, while adjourning the petition till January 13, said, "The order passed by the lower court shall continue till then."Sood's advocate Singh told the HC that the actor has not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building."The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrant permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Singh said.BMC's counsel Sakhare, however, argued that the petitioner was illegally converting the residential building into a hotel without procuring license."A hotel with 24 rooms is being run in the six-storey residential building. The BMC has taken demolition action on the property twice...once in 2018 and then in February 2020. But, still the illegal construction is on," Sakhare said.A police complaint has now been filed by the corporation, he added.Justice Chavan then asked Sood's lawyer if the actor was operating a hotel in the building without license."Are you conducting hotel business without license? You should come to the court with clean hands. If not, then you will have to face consequences," Justice Chavan said.To this, Singh said Sood is not conducting a hotel business, but is running "a residential hotel in which flats are rented out to people".Sood's petition has sought the court to quash and set aside the notice issued by the BMC and an interim relief of no coercive action to be initiated against him.Sood, who is known for his roles in films like "Dabangg", "Jodha Akbar" and "Simmba", came into spotlight last year for his philanthropy work in helping migrants reach their homes during the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-extends-relief-to-sonu-sood-in-illegal-construction-case-101610355845523.html

The rally was to be addressed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The ruckus led to Khattar cancelling it. “Yesterday, there was an unsavoury incident of violence at a protest site near Karnal. Now they (farmers) want to march their tractors to Rajpath on January 26,” Venugopal said.“We don’t intend to protect the lawbreakers,” the top court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde responded, asking Dave why will the farmers take their tractors to Rajpath in the national capital.“We will not do that,” Dave replied for farmers' unions. “The farmers have their family members in the security forces. They will not do that. I will not make a statement. There are 400 unions at the protest site. There are 150,000 farmers there.”The Supreme Court had said earlier during the hearing that it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations are being held between the Centre and the farmers on the three farm laws. "What is going on? States are rebelling against your laws," the bench told the Centre. "We are extremely disappointed at the way the government is handling the talks. What consultative process was followed by you before passing the laws? All are up in rebellion against the laws," it added.With multiple rounds of talks with the Centre not yielding any result, the farmers' unions had announced a series of programmes earlier this month to build pressure on the government to repeal the laws. One of the steps announced by them was the said tractor march, which, they said, would see thousands of tractors enter Delhi on January 26 on Republic Day and “march” in the national capital parallel to the official celebrations. As a “trailer,” a tractor march was organised on January 7 on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway.Monday marks Day 47 of the anti-farm law protests. Eight rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmers' unions so far. The next round of talks will next take place on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-do-that-farmers-unions-to-supreme-court-on-jan-26-tractor-march-101610355272965.html

Cultivation of millets requires less water than rice and wheat, which makes them suitable for small growers.In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government had decided to procure seven more forest produce from the tribals of the state.The seven new minor forest produce that were added to the list of forest produce procured at minimum support price by the state government includes Kusmi seed, Reetha fruit (dry), Shikakai, Satavar roots, Kaju Guthli, Malkangani seeds, and Mahul leaves.As per the officials, total 52 forest produce are being procured in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-announce-minimum-support-prices-for-kodo-kutki-millets-101610355182155.html

There are many other cases for you to investigate... Utilise this time for investigating those cases,” said the division bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale.The comments came after public prosecutor Dipak Thakare sought a direction to the actor and her sister to appear before the investigating officer (IO) again for further investigation of the case.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut meets MP CM Shivraj Chouhan; backs anti-conversion lawThakare pointed out the sisters appeared before the IO on January 8, 2021, as ordered by the court earlier, but the actor’s interrogation was not complete yet. He said more than 100 tweets are required to be investigated, and it could be completed if Ranaut and Rangel appear before the IO for three consecutive days.The bench refused to consider the request, reiterating that it had serious doubt about the applicability of Section124-A of the Indian Penal Code (sedition) against the actor and her sister. The bench then placed the petition jointly filed by Ranaut and Chandel for further hearing on January 25, clarifying that it will consider the request on that day.The actor and her sister have moved the high court challenging the October 16, 2020 order of a magistrate court at Bandra on the basis of which an FIR has been registered against them at the Bandra police station for allegedly “creating hatred between Hindus and Muslims, especially those engaged in Bollywood.”The Bandra Police on October 17, 2020, booked the sisters under sections 124(A) (sedition - to bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, race, place of birth, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting it’s religion or religious beliefs) along with section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.The magisterial order came on a complaint lodged by casting director Munawarali aka Sahil Sayyed. The magistrate directed the Bandra Police to take action under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as he felt that a thorough investigation and search and seizure was necessary to be conducted in the matter.Sayyed, in his complaint to the magistrate court, had alleged that Ranaut has, through her tweets and television interviews, continuously defamed the Hindi film industry by portraying Bollywood as a hub of nepotism, favouritism, drug addicts, communally biased persons and murderers, etc.Sayyed has alleged that this has “even created bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and created a communal divide and rift between people of two communities.” His complaint added that Ranaut has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets.”The casting director further alleged that Chandel, who also works as Ranaut’s manager, has also tweeted highly objectionable messages, intended to create communal rift.The high court has, however, expressed serious doubts about the applicability of Section 124-A, the charge of sedition, against the actor and her sister, and restrained the police from taking any coercive action against them in connection with the case.The judges said they did understand the application of other section, but felt that it was too harsh.Advocate Rizwan Merchant, who represented the complainant Sahil Sayyed, has, however, maintained that Section 124-A of IPC was relevant to the facts of the case. He submitted that earlier the serious charge was rarely applied, but now whenever there is an attempt to create disaffection or disapprobation about the government, the charge of sedition is applied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-restrains-police-from-issuing-fresh-summons-to-kangana-ranaut-sister-101610349993380.html

They also vandalised the stage and the rally was called off. The incident resulted in a clash between the farmers and police during which the former used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd.Later, the Haryana chief minister accused the farmers' union of attempting to instigate the people. "Today's incident gave a message to people, bigger than what I had intended to give. These people have defamed the farmers because a farmer doesn't have such nature. A farmer can be less educated or simple but he is sensible," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have been demanding a complete withdrawal of the laws which has been refused by the government.

11-01-2021||India||From Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan to White Revolution: Remembering Lal Bahadur Shastri on his death anniversary||January 11 marks the death anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri, one of the greatest Indian statesmen and second prime minister of the country. Shastri was elected to the legislature from the United Provinces, erstwhile Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states, and held key cabinet positions of transport and home ministry. Shastri took over as the second prime minister of the country after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru in May 1964.Here is remembering Lal Bahadur Shastri and the inspiration he was:1. Shastri joined Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement against the British when he was 16. He joined the fight against colonial rule immediately after Gandhi called upon the countrymen to unite and fight for independence.2. As the prime minister, he stopped drawing his salary during the war between India and Pakistan in 1965, when the country was facing a food shortage.3. He played a key role in the White Revolution to make India self-reliant in milk production. Lal Bahadur Shastri created the National Dairy Development Board and backed the Amul milk co-operative in Gujarat's Anand.4.Shastri gave the famous slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' during the 1965 India-Pakistan war to boost the morale of soldiers and the farmers in the backdrop of the crucial war and food paucity.Also Read | India returns Chinese soldier who strayed into Pangong Tso area5. Shastri was deeply concerned for the agriculture of India and was critical of the lack of contact between the peasants and the elites, as per Gilbert Etienne's book Indian Villages. He also promoted the Green Revolution with the aim of farmers' prosperity and to make India self-reliant in foodgrain production. Green Revolution remains the model operation in India that benefited states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.6. Shastri's tenure was the prime minister was only for 19 months as he died in Tashkent on January 11, 1966. He was succeeded by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi.7. "India will have to hang down her head in shame if even one person is left who is said in any way to be untouchable," was one among many inspirational quotes given by him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-to-white-revolution-remembering-lal-bahadur-shastri-on-his-death-anniversary-101610348992598.html

He was returned to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point at 10.10am, the officials said.China had, on Saturday, demanded that soldier be returned immediately. The Chinese authorities said the soldier “went astray” along the India-China border due to “darkness and complicated geography.”Also Read: ‘16 Bihar’ heroes of Galwan skirmish to be honoured at Republic Day paradeThis is the second time a Chinese soldier has been held by the Indian Army after crossing into Indian territory since the border row erupted last May.Heights on both banks of the lake have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries.The PLA soldier was dealt with according to procedures, and circumstances under which he crossed the LAC were investigated.In October 2020, the Indian Army had apprehended a Chinese soldier in the Demchok sector after he strayed across the LAC. The army identified the soldier as Corporal Wang Ya Long. It then said it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.Corporal Wang was provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes. The soldier was returned to the Chinese side after the investigations and formalities were completed.While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and the restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed at strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-returns-chinese-soldier-who-strayed-into-pangong-tso-area-101610347419440.html

January 16 marks the beginning of India’s vaccination drive to end coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and January 13 marks one decade of the country being free of polio, which paralysed around 200,000 children in the country each year till the mid-1980s.Multiple nationwide vaccination drives to inoculate every child under the age of five years against polio led to cases declining within a year from 741 in the end of 2009, to one on January 13, 2011, which was the last recorded case in India.The World Health Organization (WHO) certified India polio-free in 2014 after extensive testing for the wild polio virus through lab analysis of all acute flaccid paralysis cases reported from any cause, and environmental sewage sampling found no new case for three consecutive years.In the final years leading to polio eradication, around 2.3 million vaccinators under the direction of 155,000 supervisors visited 209 million houses to give polio drops to 172 million children on each national immunization day.With two approved vaccines – Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin -- India is kickstarting the world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive with an aim to inoculate 300 million people at most risk of infection and death by August. To do so, it has strengthened and expanded its polio and routine immunization delivery and surveillance network to both vaccinate and track potential side effects.“We began preparations for the Covid-19 vaccine drive in early August last year when the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEG-VAC) was set up to identify financing resources for its procurement and to strengthen delivery platforms, cold chain and associated infrastructure for safe, equitable and transparent delivery of the vaccine,” said Union health and science minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.NEG-VAC first met on August 12 to iron out the creases in the storage, distribution, tracking, administration and monitoring for side-effects of vaccine doses. The first shipments of Covishield have begun, with vaccines ready for distribution from vaccine storage depots across states. Of the 300 million on priority list, around 10 million are health workers in the private and government sectors, including integrated child development services workers. Another 20 million are frontline workers.The ground has been meticulously prepared to scale up delivery, said public health experts. “India has identified priority groups by both occupation and age, which will make it easy to assemble and administer the vaccine. It’s efficient election commission machinery for assembling and verifying people has also been deployed successfully,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.“What also works in favour of India is its strong network of central services, especially the Indian administrative service, which can coordinate well between centre and states and between vaccination centres,” said Dr Reddy.Add to that an extensive primary health care network that is already delivering the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), which reaches around 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women each year.“Mass vaccination led to polio and smallpox eradication in India. We already have a robust UIP programme with district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres and sub-centres are equipped to deliver 12 vaccines, of which nine are given nationally and three sub-nationally. Our healthworkers are experienced in vaccine management and delivery. It’s time-tested, it works. Plus, the gaps identified by NEG-VAC since August have been addressed, and now we have increased the number of vaccine storage depots from 41 to 60, added refrigerated vans, trained vaccinators, and conducted dry runs in every district,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan.As with polio, the last-mile access challenges remain, especially in difficult geographies. Then there is the obviously challenge of the massive scale of the operation, which will need a committed health force to administer two doses by intramuscular injection for several months till enough people are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness will need to be addressed on priority to prevent vaccine hesitancy among the general population with limited access to correct information. “Inadequate vaccine literacy because of limited communication can affect reach, so community networks must be engaged on priority to ensure Covid-19 vaccine uptake remains high,” said Dr Reddy.As I said before, this is a week of beginnings and ends. My column HealthWise, which has appeared every week in Hindustan Times without a break since the summer of 2007, ends today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-decade-after-defeating-polio-india-is-set-to-begin-its-battle-against-covid-101610345733369.html

11-01-2021||India||‘16 Bihar’ heroes of Galwan skirmish to be honoured at Republic Day parade||At least five Indian Army soldiers including Colonel B Santosh Babu of 16 Bihar battalion who blocked Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA) aggression to capture territory in East Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 last year will be posthumously honoured with gallantry medals on Republic Day, people familiar with the matter said.ALSO WATCH | 'World saw soldiers in Ladakh...': PM Modi warns China, PakWhile the Defence Ministry and Indian Army are tight-lipped about the number of medals, Hindustan Times has learnt that at least two officers and three troopers who gallantly fought the Chinese will be honoured.The Indian soldiers had retaliated in full measure when the Chinese troops refused to withdraw from a location near Patrolling Point 14 in line with the agreement reached between the two countries, and triggered the clash. The PLA troops had come prepared with barbed wire sticks and spears. The Indian soldiers were overwhelmed in numbers but managed to evict the Chinese soldiers in the seven-hour conflict along the Line of Actual Control, the first in more than five decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who travelled to Ladakh soon after, had paid glowing tributes to the bravery and courage of soldiers in the frontlines of the stand-off. “Bharat Mata’s enemies have seen your fire and fury,” PM Modi said on this visit that saw him delivering a sharp reminder to China that the “era of expansionism” was over.At its peak, the violent clash involved more than 600 rival soldiers with a majority of casualties on both sides due to hypothermia with the soldiers getting pushed out of the cliff into the freezing Galwan river.Twenty Indian soldiers laid down their lives at Galwan Valley but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese troops. Although the PLA has not disclosed the number of its dead, Indian Army estimates based on intelligence and communication intercepts on that day indicate that more than 50 Chinese troops including the Commanding Officer of the battalion involved in skirmish had died.The names of the 20 soldiers led by Colonel B Santosh Babu, 37, commanding officer of the 16 Bihar battalion, have been inscribed on the National War Memorial. The army has also built a memorial at Post 120 in Leh for the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Galwan Valley conflict, also called “Op Snow Leopard” in army records.China had claimed that it had decided not to publicise the exact casualties because comparisons could trigger antagonism on both sides. But Indian officials underscore that Beijing’s subsequent conduct in the East Ladakh sector does not reflect maintaining peace and tranquillity was a priority for the Chinese side. PLA troops had tried to transgress into Indian territory near the southern bank of Pangong Tso in August but were outflanked by Indian commandos by taking control of a strategic height.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-bihar-heroes-of-galwan-skirmish-to-be-honoured-at-republic-day-parade-101610345018500.html

The former Trinamool Congress (TMC) heavyweight took on the state’s ruling party before making a public appearance after a long time.“The TMC has become like a short blanket. You try to cover your face and your leg shows. If you try to cover your legs, it falls short and your face comes out. TMC was born on January 1, 1998 after getting a green signal from the BJP. But the leaders who were there in its forming years are now with the BJP,” he said.Also Read: BJP-TMC clashes break out in two districts of West BengalThe TMC has hit back saying that till Chatterjee joined the BJP, he was using the same blanket.“Let’s not forget that he was using the same blanket. Actually, TMC leaders who joined the BJP had to sign a deal with the new party. They have to say whatever the party wants them to say,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson.Last week Chatterjee and his Banerjee had skipped the BJP roadshow at the last minute, leaving the party red-faced. Banerjee later said that she had fallen ill. She had initially told mediapersons that she received a call from the BJP office and the caller told her that it was primarily Chatterjee’s show and she need not come. The roadshow was finally led by senior BJP leaders Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and Arjun Singh.Even though Chatterjee joined the BJP in August 2019, he stayed away from active politics. Even during the fag-end of his tenure in the TMC, he had withdrawn himself from active politics. Monday’s rally is being seen as his comeback after hibernation from active politics of almost three years.The roadshow will be held from Golpark to Selimpur in south Kolkata.“We will all attend the roadshow as party workers,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-former-kolkata-mayor-may-end-political-hibernation-with-bjp-roadshow-today-101610342267062.html
11-01-2021||India||Air pollution raises childhood anaemia risk: Research||Meeting air pollution control goals under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) could go a long way in improving child health in India, a new research paper has concluded, finding a strong correlation between high outdoor pollution and prevalence of anaemia among children under the age of five years.A research led by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi and Harvard University’s TH Chan School of Public Health found that on a district level, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metres increase in outdoor PM2.5 exposure, average anaemia prevalence increased by 1.9% and average haemoglobin level decreased by 0.07 g/dL (grams per decilitre) .At an individual level ,for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre increase in ambient PM2.5 exposure, average haemoglobin decreased by 0.14 g/dL among children under the age of five. PM 2.5 are fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters that are generally 2.5 microns, or about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair.Also read | Air pollution raises risk of pregnancy loss in India, south Asia: Lancet studyThe researchers used data from the national family and health survey 2015-16 to examine the association of anaemia with high PM 2.5 levels. “We collected the geo-location of the children covered in the National Family Health Survey data. We derived their exposure to PM 2.5 concentrations based on the year of their birth to the time of the survey. The data was adjusted for diet, maternal anaemia prevalence and body mass index all of which has a bearing on anaemia prevalence,” said Sagnik Dey, coordinator of the Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) and associate faculty at the School of Public Policy, IIT Delhi. The team used satellite data for calculating air pollution concentrations.For the district-level analysis, exposure was derived based on the five-year average ambient PM2.5 exposure per district while individual level analysis was based on the year of birth.“Our analysis reveals that apart from diet and other known causes of anaemia like maternal anaemia, air pollution also plays a significant role in anaemia development and prevalence. We have also discussed the biological mechanism through which air pollution could be a risk factor for anaemia. But that can be only confirmed through a cohort study (studies on groups of people to investigate the causes of a disease),” added Dey.High air pollution levels have been associated with adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and mortality outcomes. For children, it has been associated with low birth weight and stunted growth in past research.As of 2016, nearly 60% of children in India were anaemic. The introduction of the National Iron Plus Initiative in 2011 sought to expand the beneficiaries of the National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme to children aged 6–59 months. “Although anaemia decreased by about 11% between 2006 and 2016, it remains a major issue despite an increase in available food fortified with iron. It is clear that other potential risk factors for childhood anaemia must be identified and understood,” the study observes.The NCAP doesn’t have a legal mandate but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations from the 2017 levels in over 100 cities by 2024.“Chronic inflammation can affect the production of red blood cells. It can also affect the way iron moves inside the body or iron trafficking which is mediated by cytokines. We believe that it is the same mechanism by which air pollution raises the risk of low birthweight and preterm births. Inflammation is the biggest link between air pollution and anaemia. But definitely cohort studies would make this linkage clear,” said Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-raises-childhood-anaemia-riskresearch-101610340325657.html

The park had been declared an “alert zone” on Sunday after 17 more ducks were found dead in the green area. Culling in more areas will follow soon, one of the officials said.As an immediate precautionary measure, a second senior government official said, more parks are likely to be shut in the national Capital, orders for which will be issued by respective authorities later in the day. On Saturday, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which maintains most of the big parks in the city, had shut at least four major district parks in Hauz Khaz, Dwarka Sector 9, Hastsal and Sanjay Lake as a precautionary measure until further orders.Also Read: Amid surge in bird flu cases, scientists say risk of spread to humans lowThe reports arrived from the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, ICAR, Bhopal, on Monday morning.“Eight of the 109 samples sent to various laboratories tested positive for avian influenza on Monday morning. We do not have to wait for more confirmed reports as the protocol comes into force the moment a single case is reported in the city,” said Dr Rakesh Singh of the animal husbandry department.Singh said the eight sample reports which tested positive for bird flu were the ones of dead crows and ducks picked up from Sanjay Lake park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2, Dwarka Sector 9 and Mayur Vihar Phase 3.More than 140 birds, mostly crows, have been found dead across locations in Delhi over the past four days, even as district officials were directed to ensure that unauthorised wholesale poultry markets were closed for 10 days amid concerns of the spread of avian influenza.The move came a day after the Delhi government announced the closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the import of live birds in the Capital as a preventive measure to stop the potential spread of bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-hits-delhi-culling-begins-at-sanjay-lake-park-more-to-be-shut-101610340759524.html

Hence, we have decided to cull all the birds in one-km radius of the place where these deaths took place," the collector said."We have created a prohibitory zone in 10 km radius of the area where the birds died. No birds will be transported from there to any other place. Our medical team is stationed there and it is examining all people of the village," he said.There is no need to be panic and the district administration is taking all precautions.The bird flu outbreak has already been confirmed in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.The central government on Sunday said it has directed zoo managements to submit daily reports to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) till their area is declared free from the disease.The CZA, under the environment ministry, issued an office memorandum saying avian influenza is a scheduled disease under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, and reporting such a disease is obligatory for taking appropriate preventive measures against its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-bird-flu-confirmed-after-900-hens-die-in-parbhani-101610340134480.html
11-01-2021||India||Amid farmers’ protests, govt plans to scale up Kisan e-mart||The Central government is planning to scale up the digital online platform, Kisan e-mart, that allows farmers to directly sell their produce to private buyers, even as the impasse over the three new agricultural laws continues.According to people familiar with the matter, the pilot, which is currently active in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana, will now be extended to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Gujarat and Telangana.The Kisan e-mart is a partnership between Agri10x and the Common Services Centre (CSC) scheme, which operates under the Digital India project of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Nearly 375,000 CSCs are functional at the panchayat-level across India. Farmers are allowed to register at the CSC and after their KYC is completed, they can sell produce online without the hassle of having to transport it.Also Read: SC to hear pleas on farm laws, Delhi protests todayAccording to Pankaj Ghode, CEO of Agri10x, nearly 500,000 farmers are registered on the portal, which provides them access to 5,000 buyers. The buyers include major grocery retailers such as Big Basket, Reliance Fresh, Ninja Kart, Venky’s and Haldiram’s.The online platform provides direct access to buyers, doing away with mandis. This has been a major point of contention for the farmers under the new farm laws. Farmers have been demanding a repeal of the laws as they say the legislations will hurt their livelihoods. While the government has agreed to set up a committee to look into the law, it has stayed firm on not repealing them despite several rounds of talks with the farmers.“The buyers offer the farmers their prices and they can choose who to sell the produce to,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “The farmer gets a chance to assess which is a better and fairer price.”The ambit of the platform, which has been functional for over six months now, was slated to be expanded earlier but was delayed due to the new farm legislations, the official added.Ghode said that the aim is to make Kisan e-mart functional across 28 states over the next three years, but for now expansion would take place in the states mentioned. “It is a simple concept. The farmer can avoid the cost of transportation, effectively allowing him/her to make more money by using the platform,” he said. “The scheme has been a major success.”According to the government official mentioned above, feedback about the functioning of the e-mart has also been reviewed by the government. Among the areas identified for improvement is the need to generate a greater level of trust with the farmers.“The farmers feel that if they use the online platform, there is no guarantee that the buyer will purchase from them again,” the official said on the condition of anonymity. “We are trying to spread more awareness to address this concern.”Another issue is regarding the quality of the produce. While at present, the quality is determined digital using a software to analyse the photographs, a system of physical inspection may be in the offing.“There is a need to put in place a mechanism for sorting and grading the produce,” the official said. “All concerns will be evaluated and addressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-farmers-protests-govt-plans-to-scale-up-kisan-emart-101610337443079.html

The health ministry has said that the number of people infected with the new strain of coronavirus from the UK in India stands at 90.India has been reporting less than 300 deaths for over two weeks now. "India has one of the lowest Deaths per Million population (109). Countries like Russia, Germany, Brazil, France, USA, UK and Italy have much higher deaths per million population," the Union health ministry has said.The dip in numbers comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet chief ministers of states and Union territories virtually at 4pm to discuss the country's vaccination drive, which will start on January 16, and review the pandemic situation in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-clocks-16-311-new-covid-19-cases-161-deaths-101610337654979.html
11-01-2021||India||Amid surge in bird flu cases, scientists say risk of spread to humans low||There has been a surge in avian influenza or bird flu cases in the country as authorities fear the disease may be spreading rapidly beyond the seven states confirmed to have been afflicted so far, after reports of “unusual bird mortality” from new areas.Regions where H1N8 cases have been confirmed are spread out across the country, forming a south-to-north arc, which raises the threat for other central and eastern states, an official said.Scientists have confirmed the current H1 strain is transmissible from birds to humans, although such a risk is currently low.Bird flu epidemics have been confirmed so far by the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD) in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.Avian flu has significant economic impact. Poultry farmers in these states said they were counting losses from decimated farms.The flu has a domino effect in related supply chains. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm. Maize is a major feed used for poultry.Test results are awaited for Delhi and Maharashtra, where “unusual mortality of birds” has been witnessed, according to an official statement.While some samples from Balod in Chhattisgarh tested negative, the state still faces a higher threat level because of more death of birds reported in the past 24 hours, an official of the animal husbandry department said.“The virus involved is zoonotic,” said C. Tosh, a senior scientist from NIHSAD. The term zoonotic refers to any pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans.India has one of the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, showing how difficult it is to prevent poultry diseases in the country.Bird flu epidemics have occurred 24 times in the country since the first outbreak 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, when the flu tore through poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and MP.Kerala and Haryana have completed several rounds of culling in accordance with national animal-disease guidelines.Avian flu mostly comes from infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their faeces. In India, the disease mostly is spread by migratory birds, such as geese, ducks and shorebirds.“I have lost about Rs40,000 worth of new chicks,” said Rohit Mann Singh, the proprietor of Mann Poultry in Rajasthan’s Kota.Since 2004, compensation worth ₹400 crore from federal funds was given to poultry farmers who faced the epidemic, aside from financial aid from states.Fresh positive samples were found from two poultry farms in Panchkula district of Haryana. The state has deployed nine rapid response teams. “Control and containment operation is under way in both the epicentres,” the statement cited above said.Fresh samples of crow and wild birds have been confirmed for bird flu from Surat in Gujarat and Sirohi of Rajasthan. “Further, reports of unusual deaths of 86 crows and two egrets were received from Kangra district (Himachal Pradesh),” the statement said.Besides, reports of unusual mortality of wild birds have also been received from Nahan, Bilaspur and Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and samples have been sent to the designated laboratories for testing.Bird flu is thought to have arrived through the western coast in the first week of January.

11-01-2021||India||Bird flu cases spread, more states||At least seven states have so far confirmed cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, and close to a dozen more are confronting the spectre of the disease that has led to thousands of wild and poultry birds perishing since the last week of December, when it spread to India after wreaking havoc in Europe, China and Japan, officials said on Sunday.While the outbreak seems to be under control in Himachal Pradesh, where close to 4,000 migratory birds have died, and in Kerala, where 20,000 ducks have perished, its spread appears to be widening in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where bird flu has been confined mainly to the common crow.In Haryana, where close to 437,000 poultry birds have died, hundreds of thousands birds have been culled and there were no reports of spread to new areas other than Barwala, Asia’s biggest poultry belt, with over 100 big farms where they are reared.“It is easier to control bird flu in poultry than in the wild,” said an official in the animal husbandry department of the central government, requesting anonymity. The official also blamed the states for responding late to bring the outbreak under control.He cited the example of Haryana, where the state government was not able to confirm bird flu in poultry for as long as 26 days. It was finally at the Centre’s intervention that samples were sent to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, which confirmed bird flu.Uttar Pradesh was on high alert on Sunday as the first instances of bird flu were reported from a zoo.Two samples of fowls in Kanpur zoo tested positive for the disease, after which the Central Zoo Authority issued an alert to all zoos in the country to be watchful.Ten jungle fowls were found dead in the zoo and a decision has been taken to cull all fowls in the zoo, said a zoo official who requested anonymity, adding that the fowls had most likely been infected by migratory birds.The Bareilly-based Central Avian Research Institute (CARI) has formed a rapid response team and issued guidelines for controlling the spread of the bird flu.In UP’s Sonbhadra district, the administration has banned the entry of poultry from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. In MP, bird flu has been reported from 27 of the 52 districts.About 1,100 crows and wild birds have died, said an official in the state’s animal husbandry department.Madhya Pradesh’s additional chief secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora said: “District collectors and superintendents of police have been asked to prepare an action plan to control and contain the spread of bird flu.”Bird flu spread to MP from Rajasthan, where the death toll of crows and wild birds has risen to 2,950 with the disease spreading to 30 of 33 districts in the state. Chicken have been spared from infection in Rajasthan.On Sunday, the death of 121 crows in Dehradun created a scare, three days after three crows were found dead in Uttarkhand’s capital city||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-cases-spread-more-states-101610332054858.html

SDRF is short for State Disaster Response Fund.The declaration of heavy snowfall as a natural calamity will enable the administration to process claims for ex-gratia payments under the SDRF, bringing relief to the residents of snow-bound areas.The lieutenant governor sought a detailed report on problems being faced by the public because of the heavy winter snowfall.“On being apprised about the shortage of small rescue vehicles for the movement of people requiring medical assistance, particularly, in remote areas and areas having narrow lanes, the lieutenant governor directed that 4x4 rescue vehicles / ambulances be provided to snow-affected districts with immediate effect for helping the people in distress,” the spokesman said in a statement.Sinha asked the administrators and police officers to be more sensitive and responsive to the distress being confronted by the people.“Be visible and take early measures.

It is up to them whether they want to share it or not”.Police named three people — Capt Bhoopendra Singh, Tabish Nazir , a resident of Chowgam, and Bilal Ahmed Lone, a resident of Arabal Nikas, Pulwama — in the 1,400-page charge sheet filed before the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Shopian, on December 26 into the killings of Rajouri residents Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Abrar.The charge sheet, according to the news agency, has statements of four army personnel — Subedar Garu Ram, Lance Naik Ravi Kumar, Sepoys Ashwini Kumar and Yougesh — who were part of Capt Singh’s team at the time of the incident and were asked to cordon off the area from different directions.“…as they were approaching the spot on foot after disembarking from the vehicle they heard a few bursts of live ammunition even before they had laid the cordon,” said the charge sheet.Later Capt Singh told them that he had to fire as the hiding militants were trying to escape. It said the accused captain of 62 Rashtriya Rifles “furnished false information to mislead the senior officer and for getting” an FIR lodged to “tailor fit his motive of grabbing prize money in furtherance of criminal conspiracy”.A police statement on December 27 after the filing of the charge sheet said the investigation revealed the conspiracy was hatched to abduct the victims and stage the encounter.The charge sheet was filed after the army said it had completed its summary of evidence against its men.The three Rajouri residents were killed in an encounter on July 18. While the army initially said that the three were terrorists, later it admitted that the powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded by its men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-officer-staged-shopian-encounter-for-20l-say-police-101610329667615.html
11-01-2021||India||US welcomes Lakhvi conviction, seeks action for 26/11||The US has welcomed the conviction of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi on charges of terror financing but called on Pakistan to prosecute him for his alleged role in masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks.A Pakistani anti-terrorism court convicted and sentenced Lakhvi on Friday, though India dismissed the development as a “farcical” action made with an eye on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).“We are encouraged by the recent conviction of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. However, his crimes go far beyond financing terrorism,” the US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs said on Twitter.“Pakistan should further hold him accountable for his involvement in terrorist attacks, including Mumbai attacks,” it added.Lakhvi was arrested soon after the carnage in Mumbai in November 2008 on charges of planning, supporting and financing the attacks in India’s financial hub that killed 166 people, including six American nationals. There has been little progress in Pakistan’s efforts to prosecute Lakhvi and six other accused in the case despite evidence provided by witnesses.The LeT commander was freed on bail in the Mumbai attacks case in 2015 and reports had suggested that he had been playing an active role in guiding the UN-designated terror group’s operations even from jail.The Pakistani anti-terrorism court found Lakhvi guilty under three sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act for running a dispensary to raise funds for terror financing. This was the first time Lakhvi has been convicted of a terrorism-related offense. However, a spokesman for the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province told media he was arrested for terror financing and not for any “specific militant attack”.The external affairs ministry called for “credible action” by Pakistan against terror groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-lakhvi-conviction-seeks-action-for-2611-101610327972921.html
11-01-2021||India||Union Budget may give fiscal breather to states||The Budget may provide some additional fiscal space to states if they implement certain citizen-centric reforms as a special dispensation in line with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) stimulus package that raised their borrowing limit by 2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2020-21, amounting to over ₹4.27 lakh crore, people familiar with the development said.The role of states is crucial in a rapid recovery of the economy ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. States will require additional resources in achieving faster economic growth, which would mean borrowing beyond the limit of 3% of GSDP, two persons said, requesting anonymity.The Union government is scheduled to present the Budget for fiscal year 2021-22 on February 1, which is expected to focus on reviving economic growth, which was battered by the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. As a result, the Indian economy contracted by 23.9% and 7.5% in the quarters ending June and September, and according to the first advanced estimate by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the country’s GDP is expected to contract by 7.7% in fiscal 2020-21.“One of the options is to allow a special borrowing dispensation beyond the available space for fiscal deficit, which could be conditional and linked with specific reforms that will help to boost growth,” one of the two persons cited above said. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, states are allowed to keep their fiscal deficit at 3% of GSDP.On May 17, 2020, the government raised the borrowing limit by an additional 2% of GSDP in 2020-21, worth over ₹427,300 crore.While the first 0.5% or ₹106,830 crore was unconditional, another 1% was on condition that the states implement four citizen-centric reforms with a 0.25% value each -- put in place a one nation, one ration card system, improve ease of doing business, reform urban local bodies and the power sector. The remaining 0.5% was conditional on states implementing three out of the four reforms. Later, this was relaxed for states if they opted for the first borrowing option of plugging their shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue of ₹1.10 lakh crore.The Union finance ministry on Thursday said 10 states have so far implemented the one nation, one ration card system, seven of them have undertaken measures for ease of doing business and three states have implemented reforms in urban local bodies. They have been permitted additional borrowings of ₹54,190 crore.Experts said that for a rapid economic recovery, states must be allowed to borrow more than usual and money must be spent judiciously. DK Srivastava, chief policy adviser at consulting firm EY India, said, the financial year 2021-22 would be critical for providing a significant growth push to GDP through the central and state budgets.“As such, both central and state governments may have to rely on fiscal deficits that are well above their respective FRBM norms. A continued relaxation of states’ fiscal deficit by a margin of 2% points of GDP in FY22 should be considered a welcome step,” he said.Commenting on the ongoing additional borrowing dispensation in 2020-21, he said states could not avail of the entire fiscal space that had been given to them because of excessive conditionalities attached to the scheme. “The only relevant condition that should be imposed with respect to additional borrowing should relate to ensuring that the additional borrowing is spent fully on additional capital expenditure.This would be prudent in the long run because additional liabilities due to borrowing would be matched by additional assets through infrastructure spending,” he said.“The citizen-centric reforms linked to additional borrowing are not relevant in the context of borrowing.Those incentives should be separately designed and linked to the centrally sponsored schemes. In any case, these reforms are better implemented in a normal year rather than in a Covid affected abnormal year,” he added.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said that although performance-based incentives for state governments “is a tricky issue, going forward, this could become the norm”.He said states are “more inclined towards adhering to the Finance Commission recommended performance parameters since the commission is a constitutional body, independent of the central government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-may-give-fiscal-breather-to-states-101610327215515.html
11-01-2021||India||SC to hear pleas on farm laws, Delhi protests today||As the impasse continues between the government and farm unions on resolving differences over three contentious agricultural laws, all eyes on Monday will be trained on the Supreme Court, which is to take up separate petitions challenging the farms laws and those filed by lawyers and law students to end a protest by farmers who have encircled Delhi since November 26.On January 6, during a hearing in the SC, the Centre said that an “understanding” could be in sight with the farmers’ unions over the contentious agricultural laws, even as the Chief Justice of India lamented that there was “no improvement in the situation”. A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde will take up four petitions filed by four different sets of petitioners who are seeking an end to the protest while some are demanding the provision of facilities farmers who have massed at the protest sites in the chill of winter. The petitions have been filed by advocates Reepak Kansal, GS Mani, law student Rishabh Sharma and a person identified as Janeshwar.The court will also take up a separate set of seven writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September. Farmers say the laws will hurt their livelihoods, reduce their bargaining power and put them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.Among those who have challenged the farm laws in the top court include members of Parliament Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal, lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, the Bhartiya Kisan Party, Madhya Pradesh farmer DP Dhakad, Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice president Rakesh Vaishnav and P Ayyakannu, state president of the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam.On four of these petitions, the SC had issued notice on October 12 and directed the Centre to file its response. On January 6, when the court issued notice on a fresh petition by lawyer ML Sharma, attorney general KK Venugopal informed the Court that since talks between farmers and the government were “healthy”, the government had shelved its plans to file a response on the validity of farm laws. The unions have sought a repeal of the laws. The Centre is open to incorporating modifications, but has ruled out their repeal. The stalemate continues after the eighth round of talks. The next round of talks is slated for January 15.No role of SC in resolving ‘deadlock’: UnionThe government should resolve the “political deadlock” over new farm laws without the involvement of the Supreme Court, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said on Sunday and warned that the protesting farmers “will soon close down all borders” of Delhi if their demand for repeal of the legislations is not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-pleas-on-farm-laws-delhi-protests-today-101610326079924.html
11-01-2021||India||Vaccines to arrive in Capital by Thursday||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday the government has finalised 89 sites for the vaccination drive against the coronavirus, with stocks of the jabs expected to arrive in the Capital between January 12 and January 14, a remark that came a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with chief ministers to take stock of the immunisation exercise that begins on January 16.India’s vaccination drive, the world’s largest such exercise against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), will kick off on January 16 with priority to about 30 million health care and frontline workers, the government has said. India plans to vaccinate 270 million others in six to eight months.“Each centre will be managed by 8-10 staff. Cold storage facilities are ready and security arrangements are in place. The vaccines should arrive in the city between January 12 and 14,” Jain said.The Prime Minister, meanwhile, will interact with CMs to review the arrangements for the drive. This will be Modi’s first interaction with chief ministers since the Drug Controller General of India on January 3 offered emergency use approval to a pair of Covid-19 vaccines – Pune-based Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International’s indigenous candidate Covaxin, which is still in Phase 3 trials.Three dry runs have so far been conducted across the country for the vaccination campaign. The vaccine roll-out will initially target 10 million health care workers and 20 million other front line workers, and will later cover high-risk population such as senior citizens and those with comorbidities numbering about 270 million.Covid-19, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world, has claimed 151,215 lives in India and affected 10,467,429, making it the country worst hit by the viral disease after the United States.On the eve of the meeting with the Prime Minister, the Delhi health minister said that the city-state’s administration had shortlisted 89 vaccination centres. Forty will be in public hospitals and 49 in private hospitals, he said.In the first phase, the vaccine will be administered to health care workers. While the Delhi government had estimated their number at 300,000, around 225,000 of them have registered to receive the vaccine, said a senior government official. Health care workers will be followed by an estimated 600,000 front line workers – employees across government departments, agencies and civic bodies – engaged in Covid-19 management.Next in line would be people aged above 50 years and individuals with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.Their number has been currently pegged at 4.2 million but it is bound to increase as the Delhi government is still updating its database for these groups and creating mechanisms for self-registration to ensure nobody misses the shot, said a government official who requested anonymity. HT had reported on January 5 that the government is working on a plan to grade the last group on the basis of age, number of comorbidities and the type of comorbidities.Delhi’s main vaccine storage centre has been set up at the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Speciality Hospital. There is another centre in Civil Lines as a back-up. The government has also drafted a plan to set up a third centre for bulk storage at the directorate of health services in Karkardooma. Other than that, there are 609 cold chain points and a plan for 1,000 vaccine administration centres for later stages.Jain said at a media briefing earlier on Sunday: “We have urged the central government to make Covid-19 vaccines free for all residents of India. I highlighted the issue in a recent meeting with the Union health minister and yesterday chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to the central government.”On Saturday, Kejriwal posted a tweet urging the central government to consider making Covid-19 vaccines free for all Indians.On the day of the first vaccine dry run on January 2, Jain had said that the Covid-19 vaccine would be free for all residents of Delhi. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan assured free vaccines for health care and frontline workers in the first phase.Asked if the Delhi government would administer the vaccine free to all the residents of the city, Jain said: “We have requested the Union health minister. He has said that he will consider the proposal. We should wait.”Dr Suneela Garg, a professor at the Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and an adviser to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Now that the city has witnessed successful dry runs, the next few days should be spent on revisiting the exercise, especially areas such as crowd management and monitoring of patients after vaccination. Delhi is prepared for the vaccination drive.”A Pune-based executive with a logistics firm that has been hired to transport the vaccine vials said, meanwhile, that it had deployed a fleet of 300 refrigerated trucks at various locations in the country to transport the vaccine. The transport of the vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India will be initially by air and then through road, for which the Pune Police have arranged for two-tier security.Executives from Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions held a meeting with Pune Police chief Amitabh Gupta on Saturday, according to a report in HT’s Sunday edition.“We have a fleet of 300 refrigerated trucks which was upgraded from 200 in the last six months. All are indigenous trucks with refrigeration infrastructure installed locally as well. We carry extra fuel for the road as well. Even we are not sure about the routes and destinations yet but we have 30 branches of our own and our nodal point will be at the cold storage in Bhiwandi, Thane. Our vehicles, however, are on standby,” said Rahul Agarwal, founder of Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions. A logistics official will be appointed by the Serum Institute of India who will assign the number of vials to be carried by each commercial airline. The Indian Air Force will also be in the mix for the transport of the vaccine in remote areas, according to an earlier report published by HT.The Serum Institute of India, which had stockpiled 50 million doses by the first week of January, said that the vials need to be maintained at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The refrigerated trucks are equipped to maintain the required temperature and live-track the location as well, according to Agarwal.The federal ministry of health and family welfare announced on Saturday that the nationwide vaccination drive will commence on January 16.Prime Minister Modi chaired a meeting on Saturday to review the status of the pandemic in the country along with the preparedness of the states and Union territories to begin the vaccination drive. The meeting was attended by the cabinet secretary, principal secretary to the PM, health secretary, and other senior officials.Modi reiterated that India has a global role in the vaccination drive against Covid-19. “Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world’s biggest vaccination programme,” he said at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-to-arrive-in-capital-by-thursday-101610324434580.html

India will launch its Covid-19 vaccination drive from January 16 in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world’s largest inoculation programme with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.As part of preparations for the nationwide rollout of Covid-19 vaccine, the health ministry on Sunday held a video conference with officials from states and Union Territories to discuss feedback on the Co-WIN software and its operational use gathered from the vaccination dry runs.Giving an overall view of the CoWIN software and the principles that shall underpin the technology backup for the vaccination exercise, he said robust, dependable and agile technology shall form both the foundation and the back-up for the country’s Covid-19 vaccination drive. “The process should be citizen-centric and built on an approach that the vaccine shall be available anytime and anywhere,” Sharma was quoted as saying in a statement.About the use of the Aadhaar platform, Sharma advised the states to urge the beneficiaries to seed their current mobile number with Aadhaar for registration and consequent communication through SMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-shall-form-foundation-of-covid-19-inoculation-drive-centre-to-states-uts-101610317435296.html
11-01-2021||India||Two House panels to review vaccination||New DIndia’s Covid vaccine management will come under added scrutiny as two parliamentary panels have decided to review it.Days after the panel on chemical and fertilizers announced it will review the production, the health panel has listed “Vaccine Development, Distribution Management and Mitigation of Pandemic Covid-19” for detailed examination.The chemical and fertilizer ministry is responsible for development and regulation of chemicals including those used for making drugs.The new rounds of parliamentary review into the all-important executive action that is of vital importance are well-justified, according to MPs, as parliamentary committees—an extension of Parliament itself—have supervisory authority over all public activities.India is scheduled to kick-start Covid vaccination on the 16th of this month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet all chief ministers on Monday for what is seen as the final round of preparatory meetings before the vaccination starts nationwide.Covishield, developed by Oxford University and British drugmaker AstraZeneca, will be the lead vaccine in India’s immunisation programme with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as a back-up.Experts have raised questions over what they termed as a hasty approval process by India’s drug regulators for approving Covaxin. A political storm also brewed over the vaccine with Congress leader Manish Tewari last week alleging that the government had “politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety” as he questioned the hasty approval for vaccines.“The BJP government has politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety. The controversy over the vaccine is its latest manifestation. Who is going to get himself vaccinated with a vaccine that has question marks on its reliability,” Tewari was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.The House panels, however, are expected to take a larger view of vaccine management including India’s capacity and also look into the government’s entire plan for administration.The panels will meet the vaccine makers, health ministry officials and other health experts before finalising their reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-house-panels-to-review-vaccination-101610308785323.html
11-01-2021||India||BJP planning to hold awareness campaign to dispel fears on Covid-19 vaccine||New Delhi: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will undertake a countrywide campaign to create awareness about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines that have received regulatory approval and make a concerted effort to clear “misconceptions and fears” about their efficacy, people aware of the plan said.The party will decide whether to enlist senior BJP leaders, including ministers, in the campaign to build confidence among the people in the two vaccines, a party functionary said on condition of anonymity. A nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive will begin on January 16, the Union ministry of health said on Sunday.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has issued emergency use authorization to Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Pl.c., and Bharat Biotech International Ltd’s indigenous Covaxin.A second senior BJP leader said the vaccine awareness campaign will be similar to the public outreach initiatives the party organises on the central government’s policies and social welfare programmes.“There will be groups of party workers who will make contact with people across the country and dispel concerns such as worries about possible side effects...The opposition parties have already politicised the issue and raised doubts...We will see to it that these doubts are cleared,” the second leader added, also requesting anonymityDetails of the outreach programme will be drawn up soon.“So far the details of whether senior leaders including ministers will take the shot have not been firmed up. The protocol for administering the vaccine (for those in the high-risk category) will be followed. Some leaders such as (spokesperson) RP Singh have volunteered to be part of the third phase trials of Covaxin,” said the second functionary..Critics have expressed concern at Covaxin receiving the regulatory nod despite the relatively less amount of data on the efficacy and safety on the vaccine candidate of Bharat Biotech.On Friday, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take the lead and get the first shot of a coronavirus vaccine. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav stoked a controversy with comments that he would not take a “BJP vaccine.” Some Congress leaders have also raised questions over approval for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate, alleging that due process hadn’t been followed.Responding to these allegations by the opposition, BJP chief J P Nadda tweeted that these were “wild theories” to ridicule national achievements.“Time and again we have seen whenever India achieves something commendable - that will further public good - the Congress comes up with wild theories to oppose and ridicule the accomplishments. The more they oppose, the more they are exposed. Latest example is the Covid vaccines,” Nadda tweeted last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-planning-to-hold-awareness-campaign-to-dispel-fears-on-covid-19-vaccine-101610308022611.html
11-01-2021||India||PM Modi to meet chief ministers today over Covid-19 vaccine rollout||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Monday chair a meeting of the chief ministers of states and union territories ahead of the rollout of nationwide Covid-19 vaccination. The Prime Minister will review the Covid-19 situation in states.The meeting is expected to take place at 4 pm on Monday. This will be PM Modi's first interaction with chief ministers following the recent approval of two coronavirus vaccines for restricted emergency use by India's drug regulator.The decision to start the vaccination programme from January 16 was take at a high-level meeting chaired by PM Modi on Saturday. The date was decided keeping in view a number of festivals like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu etc.The government has said that two crore healthcare workers and about one crore frontline workers, engaged in the fight against the pandemic, will be the first to be inoculated.After vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, together numbering around 27 crore, according to a government statement.PM Modi has called it the world's largest inoculation programme. He had earlier said that India is among the nations with the lowest fatality rate and the highest recovery rate."Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world biggest vaccination programme," he said while addressing the 16th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention on Saturday.The Centre has undertaken three rounds of nationwide dry runs to prepare for vaccination. The Union health ministry organised these dry runs in coordination with state health departments and ministries to prepare authorities for vaccination and find out loopholes before the inoculation begins officially.A vital part of the dry run was the Co-WIN application, an online platform for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Lakhs of healthcare officials have uploaded their details on the software, which has not been officially launched yet.The Centre said on Sunday that Co-WIN shall form the foundation for the anti-coronavirus inoculation drive which shall be citizen-centric so that the vaccine is available anytime and anywhere.The health ministry identified the weak areas and asked the state authorities to work on them so that the vaccination can be conducted smoothly. In a virtual meeting on Sunday, the health ministry discussed feedback on the Co-WIN software and its operational use gathered from the vaccination dry runs with state health authorities.India had recently granted emergency use authorisation to two vaccines - Oxford's Covishield being manufactured by Serum Institute in India (SII) and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. Both vaccines, the statement from the health ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-chief-ministers-on-monday-over-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101610294811047.html
11-01-2021||India||Nepal PM Oli pledges to ‘retrieve’ Kalapani region from India through talks||Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Sunday pledged to “retrieve” the territories of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh from India, returning the focus to a border row that had taken relations between the two countries to a low last year.Oli, who has sought to shore up his nationalist credentials after dissolving the House of Representatives, or lower house of Parliament, made the remarks while addressing the National Assembly, or upper house. The comments are unlikely to go down well with the Indian government, which has put considerable effort into improving relations in the past few months.“Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are located east of the Mahakali river belong to Nepal as per the Sugauli Treaty. We will get them back through diplomatic talks with India,” Oli told the National Assembly session, according to Republica news website.Nepal’s rulers never made efforts to reclaim Nepalese territories after Indian military forces were stationed in the region after the India-China war of 1962, he said.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Oli’s comments.Oli triggered a border row last year after his government issued a new political map that showed Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh – all controlled by India – as part of Nepalese territory. The map was issued after India built a new road to the strategic region on the border with China.“Some people are restless because my government issued the new political map incorporating the encroached Nepali territories. In fact, our rulers hesitated to speak against the Indian encroachment. Now, we are working to get back these territories,” Oli told the National Assembly.Over the past few weeks, Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla visited Kathmandu to help put the bilateral relationship back on an even keel. Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali is scheduled to visit India on January 14 for a meeting of the bilateral joint commission with his counterpart.Oli, however, said his government has made sincere efforts to strengthen relations with both India and China, and these ties had reached “new heights”. He also described the recent visits by Indian and Chinese officials as goodwill visits.“We are working to deepen ties with India based on sovereign equality. In fact, we want to deepen the relationship with India in [the] true sense and we should not hesitate to raise our issues of genuine concerns with India,” he said.Referring to the visits of Indian and Chinese officials, Oli said: “They came here to convey their good wishes. There is nothing to worry much about that.”A high-level Chinese delegation led by Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the international department of the Communist Party of China, had recently travelled to Nepal to try to broker a truce between Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, his main rival in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. The growing differences between the two leaders had prompted Oli to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections in April-May.Oli described his act of dissolving Parliament as constitutional. “I was forced to dissolve the House of the Representatives as some people in my party did not allow the government to perform well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-pledges-to-retrieve-kalapani-region-from-india-through-talks-report-101610273428483.html
