But overall, the number is roughly half of what was being targeted, with officials and vaccinators blaming reluctance among selected recipients. There have also been reports of vaccine vials being wasted because enough people were not showing up to get their shots.“Vaccine slots were getting wasted because initially, the Co-WIN system did not allow centres to add beneficiaries to utilise unused time slots. Now the system allows us to add new beneficiaries and expedite the process. Districts are adding beneficiaries who were allotted slots on future dates,” said a district nodal official in Delhi, who asked not to be identified.Experts said that health care workers developing cold feet is a manifestation of hesitancy, and should it persist, India should allow for more people to sign up for jabs.“The gradation for Covid-19 vaccination that government has done is good; and while I agree that priority group should get the vaccine first as they are at higher risk, but if the supplies are good then it can be opened up for regular people also,” said Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.“There is anyway a lot of anxiety among general people, who wants to get the shot and may be willing to go here there and anywhere to get. So sooner we put it out in public space better it will be, and those who can pay should be [asked to pay]; after all why should government shoulder all the burden?” Trehan added, reiterating that this move will depend on the supplies and must be done in a measured manner.An expert who has tracked vaccine roll-outs in other countries, such as the US and the UK, too, said that countries must focus on getting doses out to as many people as quickly as possible. “At first, our recommendation was to do a directed delivery in high priority groups but now forget about all these scenarios - if we have inventory, let’s deliver that inventory to everyone who is older than 65 and anyone who wants to get a vaccine instead of necessarily come up with onerous algorithms,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, the associate dean, of National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in an interview to HT last week.A Union health ministry official confirmed the tweak in the app on Tuesday to allow health care workers not scheduled for jabs on a particular day to get the shots. “The average vaccination sessions allowed per site are 100, and we were told in some centres fewer people were turning up. We have made a provision in the app to also accommodate beneficiaries scheduled to take the jab on other dates. Earlier, the software wasn’t designed to accept beneficiaries outside the day’s list but now they can,” said Dr RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.But a rough estimate based on total number of inoculations and sessions suggested that on average, only 54 people were turning up for vaccinations from among the 100 who are identified every day. These people are part of a matrix of recipients created by the government, which prioritises health care workers for vaccinations in the first stages, followed by essential workers and vulnerable people in the general population.A third expert contended it might be too early to open vaccinations for general public at this stage because of technical glitches. “It is a little early to open for general public as it seems the Co-WIN app is still being tested, and may not be able to take the load on real-time basis. The vaccination process will eventually open up for general public but right now priority should be people who are at maximum risk as vaccines are also in short supply,” said Dr MC Misra, former director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.For now, hospitals will be testing to see if calling in any willing health workers for vaccination will help drive up the numbers.“In addition to the list of beneficiaries sent to us by the Co-WIN platform, we were allowed to vaccinate people who are already registered but were not on the list. On the first two days, we had faced issues like people not being on duty or being out of station when their names came up but today we were able to vaccinate those in the hospital,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman (board of management) at Sir Ganga Ram hospital that vaccinated 100 people on Tuesday. The hospital had 117 lined up to receive the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-tweaks-app-to-allow-walk-ins-experts-want-wider-access-to-shots-101611078712995.html

Her father had earlier lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the youth for allegedly kidnapping his daughter and forcing her to change religion.The man and the woman were brought to Gorakhpur from Bijapur in Karnataka on Monday and were later kept separately with NGOs."The woman told us that she went to Karnataka to meet the man on her own looking for a job. She denied allegations of kidnapping or forceful conversion by the man," said additional superintendent of police of Gorakhpur Manoj Kumar Awasthi.He further said the woman was produced before a magistrate to register her statement on Tuesday and that her medical examination report was awaited.Meanwhile, deputy inspector general of police, Gorakhpur, Jogendra Kumar said, "The woman's father lodged a missing report on January 5 at Chiluatal police station. Fresh charges under Uttar Pradesh’s new anti-conversion ordinance were added after the woman’s call records showed she was in touch with the Karnataka man for over a year. The woman’s father alleged that the man concealed his religious identity to kidnap his daughter.”“I left my daughter to Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in Gorakhpur (where she studies) on January 4 but she did not return home that night. On January 5, I lodged a missing complaint. Later, I found that my daughter was in touch with the Muslim youth on Facebook since November 2019,” the woman’s father said in his complaint.Based on the complaint, the Muslim youth from Karnataka was booked under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, along with charges of kidnapping a woman to compel her for marriage on January 11, said the police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-kidnapping-no-conversion-went-on-my-own-to-karnataka-says-gorakhpur-woman-101611077662707.html

Two other MLAs - Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey, who had also won the elections on JVM (P) ticket but later expelled from the party on disciplinary grounds, joined the Congress.The merger of JVM (P) and shifting of MLAs in different camps, however, have raised a controversy after one camp headed by Marandi and another by Yadav and Tirkey approached the Speaker making almost similar claims.The Speaker, following the February 16, 2020, letter forwarded by Marandi to inform him (Speaker) about JVM-P merger into the BJP, initiated proceedings under the 10th schedule of the constitution.In November 2020, the Speaker issued notices to Marandi and others seeking their replies.Meanwhile, the BJP, which had emerged as the second largest party after the polls, nominated Marandi as its leader of opposition and forwarded a letter to the Speaker to officially designate him as LoP. But, the Speaker is yet to take a decision in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-vacates-stay-as-jharkhand-speaker-ends-babulal-marandi-s-anti-defection-trial-101611074334380.html

Union health secretary Bhushan said Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Punjab needs to improve. "Better performing states in Covid-19 vaccination coverage include Lakshadweep (89.3 per cent), Sikkim (85.7 per cent), Odisha (82.6 per cent), Telangana (81.1 per cent), UP (71.4 per cent), Rajasthan (71.3 per cent)," he said during the press conference.The government said 631,417 people have been vaccinated by the end of the fourth day of its mammoth inoculation drive, with only nine taken to hospitals after complaining of side effects. They have been given two shots, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), and another developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the India Council of Medical Research. The vaccination programme was launched on Saturday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as 30 million healthcare and other front-line workers will be the first to be given the shot.Also read | India 'deeply honoured' to meet the world's healthcare needs: PM Modi"The cumulative number of healthcare workers vaccinated against COVID19 has touched 6,31,417(till 6 pm today) through 11,660 sessions, as per the provisional report. 3,800 sessions were held till 6 pm today," the Union health ministry said in a release. "1,77,368 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6 pm today, the fourth day of nationwide COVID19 vaccination.

Paul said it was sad that "doctors, nurses and healthcare workers are refusing to get vaccinated" and requested the people to get the shots. He said health workers who failed to take vaccine doses that had been set aside for them were not fulfilling their "societal responsibility"."Please understand the whole world is clamouring for vaccines. If our healthcare workers, our doctors and nurses, if they are declining to take it, I feel sorry.

To conserve water, it is essential to measure the quantity of water by installing flow meters," Chadha said.The DJB has initiated projects for the installation of flow meters and the setting up of a SCADA Centre, a high-tech monitoring system which allows the utility to detect where and how much water is being leaked or tapped.It intends to install about 3,200 flow meters for water auditing. A total of 3,192 flow meters have already been installed and their integration with the SCADA Centre is under progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-leader-raghav-chadha-underlines-need-for-monitoring-water-leakages-101611070806487.html
19-01-2021||India||Sasikala to be released from jail on Jan 27, Palaniswami rules out her return||After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on Tuesday, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami reiterated that there is no possibility of AIADMK’s former interim general secretary VK Sasikala returning to the party after her release.“There is no chance of her joining. She is not in the AIADMK party,” Palaniswami told reporters when asked about Sasikala’s release from prison on January 27.Palaniswami dismissed questions of whether the BJP wanted the AIADMK to take back Sasikala. Her supporters are with her nephew TTV Dhinakaran’s party - Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK).“There was no discussion on her... Most of the people across Tamil Nadu have come back to AIADMK. A few are with him (Dinakaran). Amma (Jayalalithaa) had kept him aside for a long time,” Palaniswami said.A few hours after the CM’s statement, the AIADMK government announced that on January 27, Palaniswami would inaugurate Jayalalithaa’s 79-crore memorial at Chennai’s Marina beach where she is laid to rest. Sasikala is expected to be released from Bengaluru Central Jail the same day.Sasikala’s lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian on Tuesday said that he received an official communication from the Bengaluru prison authorities that she will be released in the ‘morning hours’ of January 27 as she completes her jail term and has paid the required ₹10-crore fine.Palaniswami is on a two-day visit to Delhi where he briefly held two meetings, with home minister Amit Shah on January 18 and one with PM Modi on January 19. Palaniswami said that they discussed Tamil Nadu’s developments and it was not political.Also read: Indo-Pacific region guided by norms an article of faith for India - Foreign SecyThe chief minister submitted a memorandum to PM Modi seeking the centre’s intervention and funds for 12 projects and schemes.“Palaniswami says in public that they didn’t discuss politics but he would have most likely met them to understand what is on their mind as the BJP’s state unit has no power to take any decision,” said political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “A section of the BJP’s high command would want a merger between the AIADMK and the AMMK, if possible, before the elections, hoping it would consolidate the votes against the DMK.”Though Sasikala has not contested politically, she has largely been a powerful behind-the-scenes operator. Following Jayalalithaa’s death, she briefly held the reins of the AIADMK and was set to become chief minister before O Paneerselvam revolted against her and she was subsequently convicted in the disproportionate assets case and sent to Bengaluru prison in 2017. Sasikala appointed Palaniswami as the chief minister before she left to prison. But Palaniswami joined hands with Paneerselvam, uniting the two factions of the AIADMK, and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran from the party. “Sasikala’s original support came from the Thevars community in the south-west Tamil Nadu and much of Dhinakaran’s votes come from this region,” said Narayanan. In 2019 parliamentary polls, Dhinakaran’s AMMK had a 4 per cent of vote share and it was primarily from this community. “AIADMK cadre belonging to that community want her (Sasikala) back to ensure they don’t lose out from this bloc,” Narayanan said, adding that Palaniswami inaugurating Jayalalithaa’s memorial on the same day as Sasikala’s likely release was to keep the flock of the entire cadre across caste lines together.A senior AIADMK minister, however, ruled out Sasikala's re-induction. “When public sentiment is also against Sasikala, it will affect the AIADMK if she is brought back,” the minister said. In the three years, the AIADMK has amended the party by-laws to prevent Sasikala’s re-entry. As per the new rule, only an active member for five years can hold a party post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-to-be-released-from-jail-on-jan-27-palaniswami-rules-out-her-return-101611074123315.html
19-01-2021||India||Congress falls back on Oommen Chandy to retrieve party prospects in Kerala||The All India Congress Committee (AICC) has named a ten-member jumbo committee under former Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy to retrieve lost ground in the state and prepare the party ahead of the crucial assembly election which is due in three months.The party was forced to fall back on the 77-year-old reluctant leader after the high command felt that his “inactive role” and “indecisive attitude” of the present leadership affected the party’s prospects in the recent local body elections. Many allies and social organisations have also favoured his return to salvage the prospects of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF).The first state to experiment with coalition politics five decades ago, the state has never given a second chance to the incumbent and tried both fronts, CPI (M)-led LDF and Congress-led UDF, alternately. But the recent local body results forced the overconfident party leadership to sit up and think.PCC president Mullapplly Ramachandran, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, AICC general secretaries K C Venugopal, Tariq Anwar, senior leaders Shashi Thaoor, K Muralidharan, Kodikunnil Suresh, V M Sudheeran and K Sudhakaran are members of the panel. They will devise a fresh poll strategy and oversee election preparations in the state, said the AICC statement.The party leadership had reportedly told three senior leaders (Chandy, Chennithala and Ramachandran) who were summoned to Delhi two days ago that winning the election was top priority and to give more importance to the party than factions. It also asked the state unit to field more youth and women in the election.It has also decided not to project a CM candidate now. Among five states that are going to the polls in April-May, Kerala is the crucial state for the party. In the last general election, the UDF had won 19 out of 20 Lok Sabha seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-falls-back-on-oommen-chandy-to-retrieve-party-prospects-in-kerala-101611070893097.html
19-01-2021||India||Indo-Pacific region guided by norms an article of faith for India: Foreign Secy||India, France and Japan have to work with like-minded countries to ensure the Indo-Pacific region remains open and peaceful even as they focus on economic resilience and post-Covid-19 recovery, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Tuesday.“An Indo-Pacific guided by norms and governed by rules, with freedom of navigation, open connectivity, and respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states, is an article of faith for India,” Shringla told a workshop organised by the Observer Research Foundation and the embassies of France and Japan.Japanese ambassador Satoshi Suzuki, in his address, said his country perceives India as “the indispensable partner” in its efforts to achieve a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. He added this vision can’t be achieved by any single country, and requires collective efforts by like-minded states such as India and France with universal values such as freedom and inclusiveness.French envoy Emmanuel Lenain said the Covid-19 crisis was a “great accelerator of both opportunities and risks” and there had been a “rapid change in the balance of power, including unilateral policies by some countries”. He added, “All this creates uncertainties and triggers the risk of non-cooperative policies.”Against the backdrop of China’s assertive actions amid the Covid-19 pandemic, India has stepped up cooperation with its partners to oppose unilateral actions and protect the freedom of navigation and overflight across the Indo-Pacific. This includes cooperation through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad and trilateral meetings involving Australia, France, Japan and the US.Shringla said India has mainstreamed the expression “Indo-Pacific” and encouraged others to “perceive and define the region in its full extent”. He added, “That is why countries such as Germany and Netherlands, physically distant but economic stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific, have released strategies for the region.”India’s Indo-Pacific strategy was outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech in Singapore in 2018 as the “SAGAR” doctrine or "Security and Growth for All in the Region”. Shringla said this depends on “securing end-to-end supply chains in the region, no disproportionate dependence on a single country, and ensuring prosperity for all stakeholder nations”.New Delhi also has the Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative, which envisages building a rules-based architecture on seven pillars, including maritime security, disaster risk management, and trade connectivity, he said.Shringla also said India and France have a highly developed maritime security partnership, which includes the joint naval exercise Varuna and cooperation to enhance maritime domain awareness in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, India and Japan work together on maritime security, and recently signed an agreement on reciprocal provision of military supplies and services that will promote interoperability between their defence forces, he said.Lenain said a “strategic triangle” is being created between Paris, Tokyo and Delhi that is committed to a rules-based Indo-Pacific order, and the three countries stand as factors of stability and progress.Suzuki said the three countries should also seek a partnership with other like-minded states such as the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) to build on efforts to ensure the region remains free and open.“As the challenges in (maritime security and digital connectivity) go beyond geographical boundaries, international cooperation is essential, and region-wide trilateral cooperation should make a difference,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indopacific-region-guided-by-norms-an-article-of-faith-for-india-foreign-secy-101611070658919.html
19-01-2021||India||Assam Congress to join hands with AIUDF, AGM, 3 Left parties for assembly polls||Ending months of speculation, Congress on Tuesday announced that the party would have a pre-poll alliance with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) for the coming assembly polls in Assam.Newly-formed Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) of journalist-turned-politician and Rajya Sabha MP Ajit Kumar Bhuyan and three Left parties, CPI, CPI-M and CPI-ML, will also be part of this pre-poll tie up.Leaders of the six parties announced formation of this alliance at a press meet in Guwahati in presence of Congress observers for Assam polls, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and senior party leader Mukul Wasnik.“I am thankful to all the parties who came together to form this alliance without any pre-condition just with the aim to save Assam’s culture and identity from the divisive politics of BJP. Our alliance is confident of a win in the assembly polls,” said Jitendra Singh, Congress in-charge for Assam.Assembly polls in Assam are due in April-May and tenure of the present 126-member House expires on May 31.This is the first time Congress and AIUDF, both opposition parties in Assam, have officially announced a pre-poll alliance. In 2016, both parties were said to have a secret understanding on seats.Congress had 20 seats in the assembly while AIUDF has 14. None of the other parties that joined the alliance have seats in the 126-member House.“We have come together to oust the ruling BJP, which has completely destroyed Assam in the past five years. We are confident that our alliance of six parties would be able to overthrow it from power,” Mohammed Aminul Islam, organizational secretary of AIUDF said.Formed in 2005 by perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal, AIUDF has significant hold among the Muslim settlers from erstwhile East Pakistan (present Bangladesh). The party won 10 seats in 2006 and got 18 in 2011.“We are hopeful that in coming days other political parties in the state would also join our alliance. Today is the beginning of the end of BJP’s misrule in Assam,” said Rubul Sarma, state secretary of CPI-ML.The Congress-led alliance would have to take on the BJP-led front which has Asom Gana Parishad and the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL). Two newly formed regional outfits, Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal, are likely to announce a tie-up soon.“The three Cs-Congress, communists and communal (AIUDF)-coming together is an unholy alliance. Congress and AIUDF had secret understandings in previous polls and voters in Assam rejected them. This time too, with them having an official alliance, voters will repose faith in us,” said BJP spokesperson Roopam Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-congress-to-join-hands-with-aiudf-agm-3-left-parties-for-assembly-polls-101611070237381.html
19-01-2021||India||India strongly condemns attacks on UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic||India on Tuesday strongly condemned the recent attacks on UN peacekeepers in the Central African Republic that resulted in the death of two peacekeepers.In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said India strongly condemns the attack on peacekeepers of MINUSCA in the Central African Republic that has resulted in the death of a peacekeeper from Rwanda on January 13 and one from Burundi on January 15."We also remember the three Burundian MINUSCA peacekeepers who had laid down their lives on December 25 last year," the MEA said."We extend our deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the peacekeepers from Rwanda and Burundi, and also wish for the speedy recovery of the injured," it said.At least one peacekeeper was killed and two were injured in two successive attacks by armed rebels near the town of Grimari in Central African Republic.Members from a coalition of armed rebels staged the attacks on Friday while peacekeepers from both Burundi and Bangladesh were carrying out a security operation around Grimari, more than 200 kilometres northeast of the capital, Bangui.The Burundian peacekeeper was killed in the second ambush, and two Bangladeshi peacekeepers were injured during the attacks and are receiving treatment, the UN mission in Central African Republic, known as MINUSCA, said in a statement.On Wednesday, security forces repelled attacks by rebels trying to seize Bangui, after intense fighting on the city's outskirts in a major escalation of violence that has rocked the country since last month. At least one Rwandan peacekeeper was killed and another injured, said the United Nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-strongly-condemns-attacks-on-un-peacekeepers-in-central-african-republic-101611070211986.html
19-01-2021||India||India 'deeply honoured' to meet the world's healthcare needs: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday reiterated India's commitment towards helping the world meet its healthcare needs while announcing that several countries will receive vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from Wednesday. “India is deeply honoured to be a long-trusted partner in meeting the healthcare needs of the global community. Supplies of Covid vaccines to several countries will commence tomorrow, and more will follow in the days ahead,” PM Modi tweeted using the hashtag VaccineMaitri.Bhutan, the Maldives and Bangladesh will be among the first countries in the neighbourhood to receive Covid-19 vaccines from India as grant assistance, with supplies of millions of doses to six nations set to begin on Wednesday. India will send 100,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine to the Maldives on Wednesday under emergency use approvals to vaccinate frontline and health workers and senior citizens, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. A consignment of vaccines is also expected to reach Bhutan on Wednesday, they added.The ministry of external affairs in a statement said that India will continue to supply vaccines to neighbouring countries in a phased manner over the next few months and remains committed to helping the world fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. “In keeping with India’s stated commitment to use India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity to help all of humanity fight the Covid pandemic, supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles will begin from 20 January 2021,” the statement said.PM Modi had on Monday assured leaders of Sri Lanka and the Maldives that India remains committed to helping its neighbours and the world at large in fighting against the pandemic. While replying to a tweet addressed to him by Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Prime Minister said that India will fulfil the promises it had made under its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy. The Sri Lankan president had congratulated PM Modi on India’s successful launch of the Covid-19 vaccination drive.Modi said, “Thank you, President @GotabayaR. We will continue to give due importance to our Neighborhood First policy while collectively fighting the pandemic.”Modi also thanked Maldives president Ibrahim Solih and said that the vaccines developed in India will help in humanity fight against the pandemic which has taken over 2 million lives across the planet.PM Modi has several times assured neighbours and friendly countries that India will live up to its reputation of being the ‘pharmacy of the world’. During his address to the United Nations General Assembly in September last year, the Prime Minister said that India’s vaccine production capability, cold storage chains and distribution systems will be used to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on Monday that India remains committed to equitable distribution of vaccines while addressing the World Health Organization’s (WHO's) executive board session. He said vaccines have brought a ray of hope and now governments across the world have to ensure that the ray of hope reaches everyone.India had extended support to several nations in the early days of the pandemic in 2020 and also supplied hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol tablets to the United States and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deeply-honoured-to-meet-the-world-s-healthcare-needs-pm-modi-101611069212619.html

Tharoor shared the word epicaricacy along with an image of former cricketers who had predicted India’s defeat.“#WordIfTheDay: epicaricacy! I am not the gloating kind but there’s a special pleasure in reading these comments today... When everything else has been said,what remains but “wow”?! #IndvsAus,” Tharoor tweeted.

I am not the gloating kind but there’s a special pleasure in reading these comments today... When everything else has been said,what remains but “wow”?! #IndvsAus pic.twitter.com/ZauqQ2DMP9Tharoor also didn’t spare the explanation of his word-of-the-day to his followers. In a response to his initial tweet, he wrote “epicaricacy is taking pleasure (usually malicious) in the misfortunes of others,” explaining the word.Even as Twitter was abuzz with reactions with wishes pouring in from all corners for Team India, this was not the tweet from Tharoor on the topic. A few minutes later, he shared another similar graphic of the same former Australian players. The graphic showed former Australian captain Clarke with the quote “India can celebrate for a year if they can beat Australia without Virat [Kohli].” Tharoor replied to this saying “Yes, Michael Clarke is right -- let's celebrate for a year... starting with hammering the English from next month!”Also read: India claim top-spot in WTC standingsThe Congress leader is known for often amusing and entertaining his Twitter followers with interesting words such as the one that he shared on Tuesday.

She was rushed to a nearby hospital from where she was referred to Nagpur in a serious condition, said Simala Prasad, superintendent of police, Betul.Police arrested Sushil Verma, a resident of the victim’s village on Tuesday under section 376 (rape) and 307 (attempt to murder) of IPC and under the relevant section of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO)."The victim's father told police that Sushil was a friend of his and was a regular visitor to their house. The girl used to call him uncle,” said the SP“The girl had gone to the family’s agricultural field to switch off a water pump when Sushil, who was working in a nearby field, dragged her and raped her. The accused also beat her up and hit her head with a stone. Sushil buried the girl alive under stone slabs to kill her,” Prasad said.The officer said the girl’s family began searching for her after she failed to return home.“In the night, the family members saw footprints near the agriculture field. When they followed the footprints, they found the girl buried under stone slabs,” said the SP.“The girl’s statement was recorded at the hospital where she named Sushil as the culprit. Police arrested Sushil who confessed his crime,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-rapes-friend-s-minor-daughter-tries-to-bury-her-alive-in-madhya-pradesh-101611068829619.html
19-01-2021||India||Sajad Lone quits Gupkar Alliance 3 months after its formation||Less than three months after the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of Jammu and Kashmir’s mainstream parties demanding restoration of Article 370 was formed ,it received a jolt on Tuesday with Sajad Lone deciding to withdraw his Peoples’ Conference from the group.The six parties in the PAGD had recently fought district development council (DDC) polls together.Lone wrote to PAGD chairperson and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah saying that the party decided to part ways over the issue of fielding proxy candidates by constituent parties against the officially mandated candidates of the alliance during DDC elections.“No party is willing to cede space; no party is willing to sacrifice. We fought against each other in Kashmir province not against the perpetrators of August 5 (2019). And those who perpetrated August 5 and their minions are now vocally gleeful. It is difficult for us to stay on and pretend as if nothing has happened,” Lone wrote.“Trust between allying partners who have been rivals all along can be very elusive and extremely fragile. Proxies have made it perpetually elusive. This alliance needed sacrifice,” he said.The PAGD was formed on October 20, 2020 after six political parties, some of them rivals – National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, CPI(M), Awami National Conference, Peoples’ Conference and Peoples’ Movement came together to fight for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370.that was revoked on August 5, 2019.The alliance fought the District Development Council polls jointly on individual party symbols, which was held in November-December and won an impressive 110 seats of the total 280 constituencies.Lone alleged that in a majority of the places where the party fielded candidates on behalf of PAGD, it was either left to fend for itself or other parties compounded the problem by fielding proxy candidates.“DDC elections per se may not matter institutionally. But… it was less of an election and more of an opportunity to send a strong unanimous political message,” he said.Lone said apart from the number of seats that PAGD won, another important statistical variable in the context of August 5 was the number of votes polled against the PAGD.“We believe that the votes polled against the PAGD are majorly the votes cast by proxies of PAGD constituent parties against official PAGD candidates. And the net outcome of selectively voting for and against PAGD is a very poor vote share. This is certainly not the vote share that people of J and K deserved post August 5,” he said.Lone, however, said that they would continue to support the alliance on the objective for which it was formed.“I would however want to add that we are divorcing from the alliance not its objectives… And the PAGD leadership should be assured that we will extend support on all issues which fall within the ambit of stated objectives. We have issued clear instructions to all party leaders not to issue any statements against PAGD alliance or its leaders,” he said.Sources said Lone was under pressure from two senior leaders of Peoples Conference, vice president Abdul Gani Vakil and party general secretary, Imran Reza Ansari to quit the alliance as this was suicidal for the party, especially in the areas of north Kashmir where the party has a strong presence. Ansari had recently written to Lone asking him to end the alliance for the party’s benefit.Sources said the party was also angry as the National Conference leaders have started meeting Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and for not holding any meeting of the PAGD especially after they won 110 seats. Lone was the spokesman of the alliance.Peoples Conference spokesman Adnan Ashraf said the party quit the alliance to survive. "Many of our party leaders were against this alliance from day one. Also we contested elections on our own and no alliance was visible on the ground. So our party decided to part ways.”NC spokesman Imran Nabi Dar termed the resignation of Sajjad Lone from PAGD unfortunate. "It’s unfortunate and a loss to PAGD. I am sure Farooq Abdullah who is chairman PAGD will meet other leaders of the alliance to devise the future course of action."The PDP declined to comment on Lone’s letter.BJP’s J&K spokesman Altaf Thakur said it was an alliance of self-interested politicians. "They had promised that they will restore Article 370 if they will win and now they know that it can’t happen so the alliance has broken as parties want to save their credibility for future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sajad-lone-quits-gupkar-alliance-3-months-after-its-formation-101611067368002.html

It has come for consideration for phase 1 and phase 2 trials. If it works then it could be a game-changer," said Dr VK Paul, Member, NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog.He also called upon people to end vaccine hesitancy as India was in a comfortable situation, assuring that both the vaccines against Covid-19 were safe."We would like to reassure everyone with the data we have seen that the two Covid-19 vaccines are safe. The vaccine hesitancy should end. How will we defeat the pandemic then?" Paul added.Paul further requested the doctors and nurses to accept the vaccine.He said, "We are not fulfilling our societal responsibility if a vaccine assigned to you is not being taken. The whole world is clamouring for the vaccine. I request the doctors and nurses to accept the vaccine."The health ministry had earlier said that 580 adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) were reported till Monday.The concerns about adverse effects and serious problems, as of now, seem to be insignificant, Paul said. Data show that we are in a comfortable situation and we would like to reassure you that the two Covid-19vaccines are safe, he added.A total of 4,54,049 people have been vaccinated till January 19, the Health Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nasal-vaccine-candidate-against-covid-19-could-be-a-game-changer-dr-vk-paul-101611065568300.html
19-01-2021||India||Maldives, Bangladesh to be among first to get Covid-19 vaccines from India||Bhutan, the Maldives and Bangladesh will be among the first countries in the neighbourhood to receive Covid-19 vaccines from India as grant assistance, with supplies of millions of doses to six nations set to begin on Wednesday.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that 100,000 doses of Covishield vaccine will be sent to the Maldives on Wednesday under emergency use approvals to vaccinate frontline and health workers and senior citizens. Another consignment of 150,000 doses of Covishield will reach Bhutan on Wednesday.Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said on its Facebook page the country will receive two million doses of Covishield, the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, from India as a “gift”. It said: “A special flight of India carrying the consignment will land at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka [on January 21].”The external affairs ministry said supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles will begin from Wednesday in line with India’s commitment to use its vaccine production and delivery capacity to help the world fight Covid-19.The ministry said there were also plans to provide vaccines to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius after "confirmation of necessary regulatory clearances”.“It will be ensured that domestic manufacturers will have adequate stocks to meet domestic requirements while supplying abroad,” it added.Also read: China gives no return date for Indian students stranded homeAlongside the supply of vaccines, a training programme covering administrative and operational aspects is being conducted on January 19 and 20 for immunisation managers, cold chain and communications officers and data managers of recipient countries.The only country in the region unlikely to be an immediate beneficiary of India’s efforts is Pakistan, which has not made any formal request for vaccines.Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League party said on Twitter the two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine would be in addition to 30 million doses that the government had a deal for with the Serum Institute of India in November.Since Maldives has a population of about 500,000, India’s grant will cover the vaccination of a significant percentage of the population. In addition, the Maldives plans to buy 300,000 doses from Serum Institute at commercial rates.India’s grants are part of plans to provide up to 10 million doses of both Covidshield and Covaxin, the vaccine made by Bharat Biotech, to friendly countries, the people cited above said.Also read: 'Past views by members cannot be ground to discredit a committee' - SCBangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives are among the countries in the region that have the closest ties with India and have benefited from connectivity and development projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few months.Decisions on government-to-government sales and commercial sales will take more time as the government is engaged in a complex exercise focused on vaccine production, domestic requirements to vaccinate 270 million people by August, and factors such as commitments to Gavi or the Vaccine Alliance.The Serum Institute has an agreement to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a facility coordinated by Gavi and the World Health Organisation (WHO) to provide vaccines to lower-income countries.“Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout [of the immunisation programme], India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” the external affairs ministry said.India will also “continue to supply countries all over the world with vaccines” and this will be “calibrated against domestic requirements and international demand and obligations, including under Gavi’s Covax facility,” it added.Also read: Tandav creator says changes will be implemented to controversial scenesOn Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to his government’s plans to help the neighbourhood and other regions in replies to tweets from Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Maldivian President Ibrahim Solih who congratulated India on the rollout of the world’s largest vaccination programme.“We will continue to give due importance to our 'Neighbourhood First' policy while collectively fighting the pandemic,” PM Modi tweeted.Officials have repeatedly said the neighbourhood will get priority in the provision of vaccines as grant assistance, as was the case in the supply of hydroxychloroquine to numerous countries amid the pandemic last year.India earlier supplied hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, paracetamol tablets, diagnostic kits, ventilators and medical supplies to several countries during the pandemic. It helped train personnel in neighbouring countries to enhance their clinical capabilities under the Partnerships for Accelerating Clinical Trials (PACT) programme.Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said, “This decision is a manifestation of the Modi government’s policy of ‘Neighbourhood First’. Clearly, as the needs of our own people begin to be met, the first people we think of are our close neighbours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-bangladesh-to-be-among-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccines-from-india-101611065327104.html

The commander-in-chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command (CINCAN) Lieutenant General Manoj Pande inaugurated the vaccination drive.A defence ministry release quoted him as saying that the vaccination drive would not ensure the availability of a “fighting-fit” and “operation-ready” command but would also contribute to the global effort towards controlling the pandemic. He asked personnel not to believe in rumours surrounding the vaccine and trust experts.The armed forces on January 16 kicked off the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccine drive at multiple locations across the country including Ladakh, Delhi, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam where thousands of Covid warriors including military doctors, nurses and paramedics were vaccinated.In the army alone, a total of 3,129 HCWs were vaccinated on the first day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-workers-of-andaman-nicobar-command-get-covid-19-vaccine-jabs-101611063583420.html

19-01-2021||India||'Habitual offender': Centre, Haryana blame Delhi for polluting Yamuna||The Centre and the Haryana government on Tuesday pinned the blame for the high level of pollution in the Yamuna on the Aam Aadmi Party-led Delhi government, with Haryana telling the Supreme Court that the state had released unpolluted water into the river and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) describing the Delhi government as a “habitual offender".All this boiled down to amicus curiae Meenakshi Arora who suggested the Court to call for a report from the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) working under the National Green Tribunal (NGT) since 2018 to get a clear picture on the shortfalls in implementing steps to keep the river clean.On January 13, the Court had initiated suo moto proceedings on the drop in quality of Yamuna river, seeking responses from Centre, the CPCB, Delhi government and states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. On that day, a petition filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) pointed out alarming levels of ammonia in Yamuna, way beyond the permissible limits of 0.5 ppm. If the ammonia level exceeds 0.9 ppm, the water treatment plants in Delhi are not in a position to treat the water. The DJB requested the Court to direct Haryana government not to release ammonia and other pollutants into the water and squarely blamed the non-functional sewage treatment plants in Haryana for the increase in ammonia content in the river.Senior advocate Shyam Divan who represented Haryana informed the Court that the fault was not at their end and contradicted the version given by the DJB. Divan said, “We supply unpolluted water. This projection about ammonia pollution in water is not at our end. The problem is happening not in Haryana, but in Delhi.”The 3-judge bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran allowed two weeks for Haryana to file its response. The statement by Haryana found concurrence from the Centre as well.Also read: China gives no return date for Indian students stranded homeAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati representing the Centre as well as CPCB said, “The affidavit by the CPCB is getting ready. The figures give out a stark picture. Delhi is a habitual offender as far as pollution in river Yamuna is concerned.” The Court also allowed CPCB two weeks to prepare its report as per the last order by identifying the municipalities along the stretch of the river which are yet to install sewage treatment plants (STP) or common effluent treatment plants.Amicus curiae Meenakshi Arora informed the Court that since 2018, the NGT had entrusted the Yamuna Monitoring Committee to monitor pollution in the river. She requested the Court to seek a report on the steps carried out so far by the two-member Committee comprising former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra and former Expert Member of NGT, BS Sajawan.The bench said, “We direct the Yamuna Monitoring Committee to submit its report regarding recommendations made for improvement of water in Yamuna and the extent to which its recommendations were implemented.”Interestingly, this is the second time the apex court is suo moto examining pollution in river Yamuna. In July 1994, the Court took suo moto notice of an HT report, 'And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna', monitored it for 23 years, and transferred it to the NGT on April 24, 2017, to monitor further progress.The Delhi government was also represented by senior advocate Mohan Katarki. He pointed out that in the suo moto proceedings, two other states – Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - also need to be added.Ironically, on a day when the states sparred in the top court over ammonia pollution in the Yamuna, Arora pointed out that as on January 18, water quality was “excellent” with ammonia level dropping to as low as 0.3 ppm. She said, “Where there is a will, there is a way. The Court may observe that low level of ammonia concentration should be maintained.” On December 25 last year, ammonia concentration peaked to 13 ppm as against the permissible limit of 0.5 ppm.The DJB had stated on the last occasion that due to high ammonia content, its water treatment plants at Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla functioned at nearly 50 per cent capacity. It had even accused Haryana of supplying less water than its promised share of 450 cusecs at Wazirabad. Divan, appearing for Haryana, denied the charges and said, “This petition is not maintainable.

It could be due to a problem in storage. The exact reason for that would be known only after a thorough probe, which has been ordered,” said Munindra Nath Ngatey, director, health services (family welfare).He added that the frozen doses would be sent for laboratory tests to know about their efficacy. Action could also be initiated against senior administrative staff for any negligence on their part.According to officials, Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines rolled out as part of the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday needs to be stored at temperatures of 2-8 degrees Celsius.Assam had received 221,500 doses of vaccines-201,500 of them Covishield and 20,000 Covaxin-of the total 380,000 doses needed to vaccinate 190,000 health workers in the first stage.Till Monday, 5,542 people including doctors, nurses, hospital staff, lab technicians and ambulance drivers had got vaccinated across the state.

19-01-2021||India||India to start Covid-19 vaccine exports as soon as this week: Officials||India, one of the world's biggest drugmakers, will start exports of Covid-19 vaccines as early as Wednesday, government sources said, paving the way for many mid- and lower-income countries to secure supplies of the easy-to-store Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.The first batch of exports will be shipped to the tiny nation of Bhutan, said the officials, who asked not to be named as no formal announcement has yet been made in India.Two million doses of the Covishield vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII), will also be despatched to Bangladesh on Thursday, said the officials briefed on the plans.Bangladesh's foreign ministry confirmed the plan, saying a special flight from India carrying the first consignment will land in Dhaka on Thursday."Bangladesh will receive 2 million doses of Oxford-Astrazenca Covid-19 vaccines from India as a gift on Jan. 21," it said in a statement.SII, the world's largest maker of vaccines, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Last week SII told Reuters it soon expected emergency use authorisation from the World Health Organization (WHO) for the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, which it has been licensed to make for dozens of low- and middle-income countries.That would pave the way for SII to begin supplies to the WHO-backed COVAX initiative aimed at fairly distributing Covid-19 shots across the world.The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which can be stored at refrigerator temperature, is widely viewed as a more viable option for many poorer nations than shots from Pfizer and Moderna which need to be stored at very low temperatures.India has received requests from dozens of nations, including urgent appeals from Brazil, to begin exports of the vaccine from the SII centre in the western city of Pune.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, however, wanted to roll out the vaccination drive at home before launching exports, one of the sources said.India began giving shots of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as another developed by Bharat Biotech, to health workers on Saturday.The country plans to start exporting Bharat Biotech's vaccine at a later stage.Another source said landlocked Bhutan would get its Oxford/AstraZeneca shots free. "We will begin from tomorrow, other neighbouring countries will follow soon," the source said.Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and the Maldives have all made requests for early delivery of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-start-covid-19-vaccine-exports-as-soon-as-this-week-officials-101611062192842.html

Now, what about the employees? Will they be sold to Adani as well? What if the employees, who were recruited by the Airports Authority of India are asked to work under Adani and they refuse? " they asked."There is no reason to sell this airport, but just to help the businessman..AAI has been giving crores of tax to the GoI," they said.Delhi and Mumbai were the major source of income for the AAI."However, the private management there, with the backing of a court order, are not sharing their income with the GOI, citing Covid-19 pandemic.. What if other airports alsodo the same?" they asked.Besides the three airports, the Centre had in February 2019 privatised the Lucknow, Ahmedabad and Mangaluru airports.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking the Centre to reconsider its decision.As the state government had rendered assistance to the airport wholeheartedly, including providing land on various stages, the Kerala government had the rightful claim on the management and operation of Trivandrum International Airport,Vijayan had stated in the letter.The state government through its SPV, which participated in the bidding process, had expressed the willingness to match the highest bidder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/employees-protest-at-trivandrum-airport-against-takeover-by-adani-group-101611062068064.html

We gave about 17 suggestions for Uttarakhand in the upcoming budget," Kaushik said after the meeting."Among those, the major demand was to give us green bonus for conserving about 71% of the state's total area which comprises glaciers, forests and rivers. Unlike other states which cleared the forests for industrial development, we didn't do that for which we suggested a green onus. As per a study on green accounting in our state, the conservation has a yearly monetary value of about ₹95,000 crore," said Kaushik.The minister also informed that he also suggested setting up an Ayush corridor in the state."That Ayush corridor should include wellness centres, Yoga university, spiritual centre and herbs unit which will not only benefit the people but also add to the state's economy. Apart from this, we also suggested increasing the central fund for the development of areas of our state bordering China and Nepal," said Kaushik.Citing Uttarakhand as a major tourist destination, he also asked Sitharaman to include the ropeway projects of the state in the Centre's infrastructure development projects."The move will help ease the traffic issue during peak tourist season and also provide a new public transport system," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-bonus-special-ayush-zone-in-uttarakhand-s-wish-list-for-union-budget-101611060718208.html
19-01-2021||India||'Past views by members cannot be ground to discredit a committee': SC||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde on Tuesday hinted that the criticism doing rounds against the three members of an Expert Committee formed by the Supreme Court to hear concerns of farmers over the new farm laws was totally unwarranted.Commenting on a case unrelated to the farmer protests or the farm laws, a bench headed by CJI Bobde on Tuesday remarked, “We are noticing there is some misunderstanding of the law. When we appoint a committee and we find the members have expressed their opinions on the subject, they are still entitled to continue.”Without dropping any names, the CJI was candid to admit that persons appointed to a committee were free to express their views on the subject on which they have been called to consider. “Speaking in general, people are expected to be intelligent and informed. You are entitled to give your view. There is lack of comprehension about the composition of a committee. This is not a situation where somebody alleges bias towards a person whose relative is a beneficiary.”Also read: Budget session - MPs to undergo Covid-19 test; arrangements made for families, staffThe Court’s outburst came in a suo moto proceeding related to address inadequacies and deficiencies in criminal trials following the lockdown. Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra was part of a three-member committee constituted by the Court to examine the rules framed by various High Courts and recommend changes in rules to facilitate early disposal of criminal trials. He had assisted senior advocate R Basanth and advocate K Parmeshwar to this task.Luthra said, “Today we are moving towards a hybrid system and norms must be laid down for having a mix of physical and virtual proceedings for not just hearings but also trial through video-conferencing.”The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran, requested Luthra to assist them as amicus curiae in this regard. But Luthra felt that his comments, openly supporting videoconferencing as against physical court hearings, could go against him in undertaking this responsibility. This provoked the CJI to pass the above observation.Justice Bobde said, “Where is the question of your disqualification? Everybody is entitled to speak their mind.”The comments by the Court seemed to fit well in the context of the four-member committee appointed by it to hear concerns of farmers and submit a report in eight weeks. On January 12, the Court formed a four-member committee comprising Bhupinder Singh Mann (National President, BKU and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (Agricultural Economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati, Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana.Even before the committee could begin its work, news circulated about the pro-farm law comments expressed by the four members as doubts emerged on whether the selection by the Court was fair. On January 14, one of the members, Bhupinder Singh Mann withdrew from the committee leaving just three members to complete the Court-assigned task.Last week, one of the protesting farmer unions, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) - Lokshakti, filed an affidavit in Supreme Court demanding the removal of the three members alleging that they were biased in favour of the farm laws. This affidavit will come up for consideration by the top court on Wednesday along with an application by Delhi Police to restrain protesting farmer organizations from taking out a tractor rally on Republic Day. Meanwhile, the three-member committee has also begun its task and is expected to meet farmer organisations on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/past-views-by-members-cannot-be-a-ground-to-discredit-a-committee-sc-101611060085433.html

Covishield has at least got an interim analysis report. However, Covaxin is still in the phase-III trials, where the trial is being done on healthcare workers. We strongly condemn this. Health workers should be given a choice of the vaccine. We demand that govt should provide a vaccine which has interim analysis."On January 3, India gave emergency use authorisation to two Covid-19 vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - both being manufactured in the country.While Covishield has been developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, Covaxin is an indigenous vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Out of 3.81 lakh health care workers who received Covid-19 vaccine in the three days (from January 16 to January 18), 580 beneficiaries reported adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) and seven of them required hospitalisation, Union Health Ministry said on Monday."So far, cumulative 580 AEFIs have been reported.

Families of the teenager, and Ajaz Maqbool (22) from Pulwama, and Zubair Ahmad (24) from Turkawangam Shopian protested in Bellow Pulwama, also demanding that the bodies be handed over to them.The teenaged boy’s father insisted that the trio was innocent and rejected police chief Kumar’s claim that there was “60%” proof that the deceased were involved in militancy.“Twenty-two days have gone by and they are saying 60% documents are ready. This is a ‘fake’ (claim) and is being done for the public (image). Today this happened with us, tomorrow this fire will engulf the whole of Kashmir,” he said.On Monday, Kumar had said, “According to the meta data we have collected so far, all the three associates who were killed in the encounter were involved in militancy. They were providing logistic support (to militants). We want to take a few more days so that we collect all the evidence which we will show to their parents first to convince them of their children’s involvement.” Also read | Army sets up ‘feedback and grievances’ helpline in KashmirPolice and army have said that the trio was killed in an exchange of fire at Hokersar-Lawaypora in Srinagar after they refused to surrender, but their families insisted they were civilians.

This case should be investigated before that.” Claiming that the police report showed the trio had no FIR against them, he said, “Today they are saying that they were over ground workers of militants, tomorrow they will claim that they were terrorists.” The families demanded that the bodies be returned to them for burial at their respective places. Since Covid-19 pandemic, the authorities have been burying the bodies of militants, allowing only a few family members to be part of the burial.

The second day of the inoculation program saw 11,288 health workers of the 68.7% of targeted beneficiaries, which works out to 5 percentage points less than the first day when 12,258 or 73.8% of health workers were vaccinated.Nearly 15 AEFI (adverse event following immunization) cases surfaced in the state on the second day. A total of 23,546 people have been vaccinated across the state in the first two days, according to official data.A senior doctor on condition of anonymity said the CoWIN application does not work effectively and has several problems. The beneficiaries are not receiving messages of vaccination on time and later were being called over the telephone to reach the vaccination centres.“We have asked the Centre to allow vaccinating through on-the-spot registration as there is some technical snag with the software,” said Dr Sudheer Bhandari, Principal SMS Medical College.He said a number of frontline workers are queuing up but unfortunately as per the directions, offline registration is not yet allowed.

The community is also supportive of conservation.”Biotic interference in Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary has been significantly reduced, zonation has been done in terms of core and buffer zones and it has a duly notified eco-sensitive zone, the report elaborated.Welcoming the recognition, Meghalaya principal chief conservator of forest, Bayar Lyngwa told HT over phone, “It has been a long-drawn effort and collective responsibility of our staff and the community at large. Nothing can be achieved if we don’t work together. We need two hands to clap and the community is definitely the other hand.”Nongkhyllem is an area where annual community hunting had been a tradition, but with sensible intervention of the forest department and conscientious support of the neighboring communities, it is now a pristine sanctuary. “If the forest is left alone to itself, it shall regenerate on its own. We need to appreciate that,” the forest chief said.One of the architects of this turnover, Harish Choudhury, Meghalaya additional principal chief conservator of forests (Wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, said many things are in the offing which will definitely bring more positive change in the sanctuary.“Communities here are sensitive and respectful to nature. Everything is natural on a broad platform and we are so happy that they acknowledge and support our humble efforts. Yes.... some unscrupulous beings exist but we are working hard to prevent them from violating norms and laws with the support of the communities surrounding the protected area,” he said.Responding to the MEE report urging on the need for forest authorities to initiate research in key faunal species, especially in endangered species, Choudhury said a project is already underway to boost the clouded leopard population in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nongkhyllem-wildlife-sanctuary-in-meghalaya-is-northeast-s-best-protected-area-101611054720800.html

19-01-2021||India||Apprehensions after AEFI cases, technical issues may be factors: Experts on low Covid vaccination turnout||People becoming apprehensive after some cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) being reported on day one of the Covid-19 vaccination drive and technical problems encountered initially could be among the factors behind further slump in the turnout on the second day of the exercise, say experts.Nearly 3,600 healthcare workers received the shots in Delhi on Monday, the second day of the drive in the national capital, with sources saying just eight medical staff got the jabs at AIIMS.According to data shared by officials later, the target of the day in Delhi was 8,136, thus only 44 per cent of that could be reached.Cases of AEFI was reported in 26 persons, including two severe ones, and one person was hospitalised, officials said on Monday.On day one, 4,319 healthcare workers -- 53.3 per cent of those registered, had got the shots in Delhi, while one "severe" and 51 "minor" cases of AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) were reported.Various reasons are being attributed to the low turnout, including some technical issues and fears related to adverse events.However, the government has maintained that no case of serious or severe AEFI is attributable to vaccination till date.Experts feel people becoming apprehensive after several cases of AEFI reported on day one could be a major factor.Besides, many adopting a "wait and watch" approach, lack of communication and glitches in Co-Win app are among other reasons for low turnout on day one and even further low on day two."Yes, the AEFI cases reported must have played on minds of people and the apprehension may have resulted in lower turnout. But there are other factors too. And, after all it's a voluntary exercise, so people make their own choice. But, we at our hospital are trying to reach out to healthcare workers through heads of all departments to boost their confidence level," said B L Sherwal, medical director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.At the Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital, only 12 healthcare workers got vaccination on Monday, compared to 32 on day one, as per data shared by officials. No one showed AEFI at this site, a senior official said.At the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, the number of people who got vaccinated on Monday stood at 20 with no AEFI cases. It was nearly half of the figures on day one -- 45, officials said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain, interacting with reporters on Tuesday, reiterated that this is a voluntary exercise and people are making their own decisions, as it is the initial phase.Asked if statements made by a few political leaders raising doubts over its efficacy and safety, could be a factor, he said, "No. Going for vaccination is a personal decision, and has nothing to do with what political statements have been made about it."When asked if AEFI was a factor in low turnout on the second day, the city health minister said, turnout of nearly 50 per cent is "not very low" and coronavirus situation is also under control in Delhi."It's initial days of the drive, and it will take time, but people's confidence will be increased and it will pick up. As a government, we are also taking all the steps to push up their confidence level," he said.Asked if technical issues with CoWIN app, was also a factor, he said, the app is "creating hurdles" at times."Sometimes, it is not working, and it has not stabilised yet," Jain said, adding, no plan to do the job manually.Co-Win is an online platform for monitoring Covid-19 vaccine delivery. "There were some glitches in the app at our hospital. We expect the number to increase during the course of the drive," said Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP Hospital.N K Ganguly, former director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research, said the numbers will increase gradually as people become "well-informed" about the vaccines. On Saturday, the Resident Doctors' Association of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital had requested the hospital to vaccinate them with Serum Institute's Covishield instead of Covaxin.The association wrote a letter and said the doctors were a bit apprehensive about Covaxin due to the lack of a complete trial.Those taking Covaxin are asked to sign a separate consent form, acknowledging that the jab is being administered without the phase-3 trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apprehensions-after-aefi-cases-technical-issues-may-be-factors-experts-on-low-covid-vaccination-turnout-101611054042078.html

Leaders of several political parties said this to a high-level EC team headed by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, which is on a three-day tour to the state to take stock of poll preparedness. Tenure of the 126-member House expires on May 31. “We have asked the EC team to hold the elections in three phases in the state. The first two phases should be held before Bohag Bihu and the last one after it,” Ranjeet Kumar Dass, state president of ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said. “The first phase should be held in assembly seats in upper Assam districts and the second one in central and lower Assam. Election for the seats in the three districts of Barak Valley and the two hill districts should be conducted after Bihu,” he added.

The team insisted that CCTV cameras should be installed in all polling stations in order to ensure there’s no tampering of electronic voting machines. “Polling should be completed before Bohag Bihu so that people of the state can take part in the festival properly. Also, adequate measures should be put in place to ensure compliance of Covid-19 safety protocols during campaigning and voting,” senior CPI-M leader Biren Sarma told a local daily. Apart from political parties, the EC team is also holding meetings with senior bureaucrats and police officers to know about security arrangements. They will also have discussions with poll officials on preparations ahead of the polls.

19-01-2021||India||Petrol rate crosses record ₹85/litre in Delhi; diesel above ₹75/litre||Petrol price on Tuesday crossed ₹85 per litre in Delhi, beating its own record for the fifth time in less than two weeks since January 7 even as India’s average crude oil import price softened a bit, according to official data.Petrol and diesel have become costlier by 25 paise per litre each on Tuesday, raising their pump rates in Delhi to ₹85.20 per litre [all-time high] and ₹75.38 per litre, respectively. Diesel surged to a record ₹82.13 per litre in Mumbai, according to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). Petrol is sold at ₹91.80 per litre in Mumbai. Retail rates of the two auto fuels vary across the country because of differences in local levies.According to IOC, the largest fuel retailer in the country, petrol and diesel rates have been revised upward by ₹1 per litre each after January 7 in four small doses of 25 paise each, on January 13, January 14, January 18 and January 19. Official data shows that India’s average crude oil import price [Indian basket] was ₹3,977.18 per barrel on January 7 this year when petrol price in Delhi had jumped to an all-time high for the first time after about 27 months to ₹84.2 per litre, beating its previous record of ₹84 per litre on October 4, 2018.Even as the current price of Indian basket of crude is ₹3,972.74 a barrel, marginally lower than the January 7 figure, the retail prices of automobile fuels were raised. The price of Indian basket of crude oil represents actual average import cost that also factors in the rupee-dollar exchange rate. India, that imports more than 80% of crude oil it processes, pays the import bill in dollars.Requesting anonymity, a government official said oil marketing companies enjoy pricing freedom. They align pump prices of auto fuels daily with their respective international benchmarks, which may not necessarily move in tandem with international crude oil prices. According to Indian refiners, crude constitute about 90% of the refining costs.State-run oil marketing companies – IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – did not respond to email queries. The three companies enjoy monopoly in fuel retail. International oil prices that had plunged below $20 a barrel on April 21, 2020, because of rapid spread of Covid-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on the global economy, is on a surge especially in the backdrop of vaccination programmes in various economies. Benchmark Brent crude that closed at $55.1 a barrel last week [Friday], was weak on Monday at $54.75 per barrel. Brent crude, however, gained 55 cents in the early trade on Tuesday to $55.30 a barrel on optimism of economic recovery from Covid-19 pandemic. An executive of a state-run oil company said requesting anonymity that the Centre and states must reduce excise duty and value-added tax on the two fuels to provide relief to the people. Petrol in Delhi attracts over 62% taxes that include ₹32.98 per litre central excise and ₹19.55 a litre VAT. Similarly, levies on diesel are in excess to 57% ( ₹31.83 per litre central excise and ₹10.99 per litre VAT).The Opposition hit out at the government for excessive taxes on auto fuels. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet that “petrol and diesel are costliest in 73 years” and accused the government of mopping up “ ₹19 lakh crore in six years” by raising taxes on auto fuels. The ministry of petroleum and natural gas did not comment on this matter.There has been a demand to reduce taxes to provide relief to consumers, but the government is not in a position to forego easy revenues at a time when it needs huge funds to fight the pandemic and revive the economy, one official said requesting anonymity. “Now, there is no pressure of inflation as retail inflation eased to a 15-month low, at 4.59%, hence the government would like to wait till Budget on reducing excise duty on fuel. However, a final decision will be taken by the competent authority,” he added.The retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was a 77-month high at 7.6% in October. Although it had soften a bit to 6.9% in November, it was still above the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) medium-term target of 4%, with a band of plus or minus 2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-rate-crosses-record-rs-85-litre-in-delhi-diesel-above-rs-75litre-101611053311464.html
19-01-2021||India||3 sites in MP selected for hosting cheetah, officials to train in Africa||A Supreme Court-appointed committee has selected four possible sites - three in Madhya Pradesh and one in Rajasthan - for cheetah introduction in the wild even as MP forest department officials plan a visit to Africa to train themselves on handling the fastest animal on the planet."We found Kuno National Park, Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary and Gandhi Sagar-Chittorgarh in Madhya Pradesh and Bhainsrogarh Sanctuary in Rajasthan suitable for translocation of cheetahs because of an appropriate geophysical feature of forests. The areas are well protected and have well-managed grassland,” said Wildlife Institute Director Dhananjay Mohan, a member of the panel.The top court in January 2020 gave its approval to introduce African cheetahs to a suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis. The cheetah was declared extinct from India in 1952.The decision for relocation of the African cheetah, said the apex court, will be taken after a proper survey and the action of introduction of the animal will be left to the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s discretion. The cheetah will be introduced on an experimental basis in the best suitable habitat to see whether it can adapt to Indian conditions, the court had said.Of the three sites in MP, the state forest department has selected Kuno and Nauradehi wildlife sanctuaries as they have good grassland, key for survival of cheetahs.“Madhya Pradesh is planning to develop Kuno National Park in Sheopur and Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary spread in four districts of Bundelkhand of MP, for translocation of cheetah and the forest department is also preparing a special project ‘Cheetah’ to change the physical features of the forest, as suggested by the expert committee," said JS Chauhan, additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF), (wildlife).MP forest department will send a team of forest officials to Africa to gain expertise about Cheetah and to learn management practice of habitat to the fastest land animal, said the officer.Mohan said, “The geophysical feature of MP is suitable for Cheetah as the last Cheetah was seen in undivided MP in 1950s. India lost cheetahs at least 70 years ago. Nobody has any idea about cheetahs so it is necessary for forest officials to go and learn about the habitat of cheetahs."Retired PCCF (wildlife) SK Mandal said, “The state government shouldn’t send a political person and only top officers for training in Africa. It should be vertical training. The government should send top officers to lower staff for training to make the project successful.”The translocation of African Cheetah is a part of Government of India to reintroduce the fastest land animal in India after extinction of the Asiatic cheetah in the 1950s. The expert committee visited four sites in MP and one in Rajasthan to select the suitable habitat for Cheetah. In January first week, the committee submitted its report to the state government."On the basis of the suggestion of the report, the forest department will cut down more than 200 thorny trees in Kuno. The grassland will also be changed. Now, the department will replace tall grass with short grass. In Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary, prey base will be increased, said a second MP forest officer, not willing to be named.In 2010, the central government set up an expert panel for reintroducing the cheetah in India. This panel recommended that the home of the fastest animal in the world could be Kuno Palpur in Madhya Pradesh, Velavadar National Park in Gujarat and Tal Chapar sanctuary in Rajasthan. Kuno Palpur was also the place prepared by Madhya Pradesh to house Asiatic lions from Gujarat, till the latter refused to share its pride. Kuno Palpur was the preferred location for the introduction of the cheetah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-sites-in-mp-selected-for-hosting-cheetah-officials-to-train-in-africa-101611051513469.html

Chidambaram's comments came after he was criticised over the issue of the Tamil new year being proposed to be changed by the DMK.“When I said Chithirai 1 should be Tamil new year, some people criticised me as a Sanghi, BJP. Do they not hear my opinions, interviews? I will always oppose BJP’s Hindi, Hindutva policy. I will never change from secularism, my faith,” he tweeted in Tamil. He also shared two of his speeches about secularism and inclusive politics - one during Christmas celebrations in Chennai last year and an interview from February 2019 - supporting his stance.சித்திரை 1 புத்தாண்டாக கருத வேண்டுமென்று கூறியவுடன் என்னை சிலர் சங்கி,BJP என விமர்சித்தனர்.அவர்கள் எனது பேட்டிகளை, கருத்துக்களை கேட்பதில்லையா?BJP யின் ஹிந்தி,இந்துத்துவா கொள்கையை என்றும் எதிர்ப்பவன்.நான் மதச்சார்பின்மையிலிருந்தும், என் நம்பிக்கையிலிருந்தும் என்றும் மாறமாட்டேன். https://t.co/3scHatVP6IEarlier the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (DMK) lawmaker Kanimozhi had said that the if her party wins the 2021 assembly election in Tamil Nadu, the date of Tamil new year would be changed from the first date of Chithirai month in the April to the first date of Thai month (Pongal festival) in January. “Chithirai 1st is the New Year. All of us who follow the traditional almanac, which is scientific-taking into account the constellations as accepted by astronomy, will only consider Chithirai as the beginning of the new year,” Karti had reacted in a tweet on January 14, 2021.The Congress, the DMK’s poll partner in Tamil Nadu, has not made any comments regarding the matter. “I believe in god, religious practices. Our alliance partner DMK is calling Thai 1 as the Tamil new year. I can’t accept this.

19-01-2021||India||Few people owning country, says Rahul; hails protesting farmers||Lashing out at the Narendra Modi government over the farm protests, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that a handful of people close to the Prime Minister now “own” the country through “massive monopolies” but added that “there are millions of people who do not accept this nonsense that’s going on in this country”. He announced support for farmers and claimed the Congress will provide “the vision for India” as it has the “expertise” to do so. Gandhi also demanded that both journalist Arnab Goswami and the person who provided the information about the Balakot airstrike on Pakistan should be booked as such leaks were against national security. His reference was to transcripts of the journalist’s WhatsApp conversations that seem to suggest he knew the strikes were in the offing. Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here on Tuesday, Gandhi said, “Across the board what we are watching is the development of massive monopoly in this country. Three or four or five people are now owning this country. This country is owned by a small group of people who are close to the PM,” he alleged, comparing the current situation with that of India under the British Raj. He maintained that the farm laws would mean “3-4 people owning the entire agriculture system.” Releasing a book on the farm issues that are plaguing the country, Gandhi alleged that the government wants to ignore the issue and misinform people about it. “The new laws are designed to destroy agriculture, destroy mandi system and ensure no farmer can go to court.” Gandhi hailed the protesting farmers as “patriots protecting the livelihood of 60% of India’s population” and lent his full support for them.The Congress leader also refused to accept that there’s a deadlock while the negotiations between farm organisations and the Centre have rolled over to ninth round. “There is no deadlock. The government believe they can tire out the farmers, but farmers know more about India than the PM. The only solution is to repeal the three farm laws.” Gandhi also hit out at the government over the recent controversy around Arnab Goswami’s WhatsApp messages. “Sharing official secrets with a journalist is a criminal act. There is nothing patriotic at putting our airforce at risk. I want to know who told Arnab Goswami about the airstrike? Only five people, PM, home minister, defence minister and the NSA must have known about it.” Claiming that China has a clear strategic vision to reshape the world and it is watching the weaknesses of India, Gandhi said, “India doesn’t have a strategic vision. China tested us twice: in Doklam and now in Ladakh. If India doesn’t make a clear military, economic and geo-political strategy, then there is a danger.”Union minister Prakash Javadekar hit out at the Congress, saying it does not want a solution to the farmers’ issue. “Today, the farmer is poor because of Congress’ destructive policies,” he said. “The Congress does not want the government and farmer talks to be successful. Therefore, the Congress has adopted obstructive policies.”Javadekar asked why does not Gandhi answer questions on China. “Who gave away land to China? Under whose rule did Aksai Chin go out of India’s hands? Who took money from China for a private trust? Who gave away India’s UNSC permanent seat to China?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-people-owning-country-says-rahul-hails-protesting-farmers-101611050671546.html
19-01-2021||India||Apart from Rafale jets, Indo-French air exercise to feature Su-30s, Mirage 2000s||The air forces of India and France will kick off a five-day joint exercise in Rajasthan on Wednesday, with a raft of aircraft taking part in the drills, including Rafale fighters jets, Mirage 2000s, Sukhoi-30s, mid-air refuellers and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) platforms, the Indian Air Force said in a statement on Tuesday announcing the line-up of aircraft taking part in the wargames. The exercise, codenamed Desert Knight-21 is being held at the Jodhpur air force station. “The exercise marks an important milestone in the series of engagements between the two air forces. As part of Indo-French defence cooperation, the IAF and French Air and Space Force have held six editions of exercises named ‘Garuda’, the latest being in 2019 at Air Force Base Mont-de-Marsan, France,” the IAF said on the eve of the exercise. Both air forces will be fielding their refuellers for the drills. While the IAF’s IL-78 tankers will be seen in action during the exercise, the French side will deploy its Airbus A-330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft during the exercise, officials said. The French air force has also flown its A-400M military transport aircraft to Jodhpur for the exercise, they added. The French contingent taking part in the exercise consists of 175 personnel, the IAF said. “To further the existing cooperation, the two forces have been gainfully utilising available opportunities to conduct ‘hop-exercises’. The French Air and Space Force deployment while ferrying to Australia for Ex Pitchblack in 2018 was hosted by IAF at air force stations Agra and Gwalior for exercise with fighters and MRTT aircraft,” the statement said. Also read | Centre planning scheme to push for production, export of dronesThe French detachment for Ex Desert Knight-21 is deployed in Asia as part of its Skyros Deployment and is transiting through India. The exercise is taking place at a time when India and China are locked in a tense border row in the Ladakh sector. The IAF said as the two sides would “put into practice operational experience gained across terrains and spectrums and endeavour to exchange ideas and best practices to enhance interoperability”. “For sure, air crews imbibe information from each other’s operating procedures from military exercises between nations but they are more a demonstration of strategic relations than one of tactical learning,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. The air exercise in Jodhpur is a continuation of Indo-French ties that go back many decades, he said. “It would be interesting to see whether any live armament work is also undertaken since the Pokhran firing range is close by,” Bahadur said. Hindustan Times reported on January 1 that Rafale fighters of the French air force will land in Rajasthan this month to participate in joint exercises with the IAF’s Golden Arrows Squadron that was resurrected last September with the induction of the Rafale fighter jets. The Rafale jets will be taking part in an exercise with a foreign air force for the first time. The IAF’s solitary Rafale squadron will add more muscle with the arrival of at least three more fighter jets by the month-end. The delivery of the three jets will take the number of Rafales in the IAF’s inventory to 11. India has ordered 36 warplanes from France at a cost of ₹59,000 crore. The IAF is operating its Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on its highest state of alert to deal with any misadventure by China. Its current fleet of eight Rafale fighters is fully operational and ready to undertake any mission, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apart-from-rafale-jets-indo-french-air-exercise-to-feature-su-30s-mirage-2000s-101611049351508.html
19-01-2021||India||Bose family, TMC, Left react sharply to ‘Parakram Diwas’ decision||Members of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s family, the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Left parties in West Bengal on Tuesday reacted sharply to the Centre’s decision to celebrate the icon’s birth anniversary on January 23 as Parakram Diwas (day of valour) and not by the names they had proposed. The news was tweeted on Tuesday morning by Amit Malviya, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national information and technology cell. “In honour of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s indomitable spirit and his selfless service to the nation, Government of India has decided to celebrate his birthday, 23rd January as Parakram Divas. Thank you Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi,” tweeted Malviya. “Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been demanding for years that January 23 be declared a national holiday and celebrated as Desh Nayak Viwas. That is the appropriate name because Rabindranath Tagore called Bose a desh nayak (national hero). The Modi government takes all decisions unilaterally,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. BJP leader and Netaji’s grandnephew, Chandra Kumar Bose said the day should be observed as Desh Prem Diwas (day of patriotism). “#Netaji’s birthday on 23 January is celebrated as #DeshPremDivas across the country by people from all religions, caste & creed as he was the #LiberatorofIndia & their own leader. Govt sponsorship is not required. However its time the GOI officially announce! @narendramodi @PMOIndia,” tweeted Bose. Naren Chatterjee, state general secretary of the Forward Bloc, the party Netaji formed in 1939, also said the day should be declared Desh Prem Diwas. “This was the demand we made when the Left Front was in power in Bengal. The Centre does not bother to care for public sentiment,” said Chatterjee. In January 2010, the then CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat wrote a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding that January 23 be declared Desh Prem Diwas. BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told the media that the Centre named the day Parakram Diwas because Netaji is a symbol of valour and patriotism for the entire nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/designation-of-netaji-s-birth-anniversary-as-parakram-diwas-criticised-101611049051362.html
19-01-2021||India||Supreme Court-appointed panel to meet farmers on Jan 21||A member of the committee appointed by the Supreme Court to examine the three farm laws, which have triggered protests by farmers, said it will meet farmers on Thursday, after holding its first round of internal consultations, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday. The news agency cited Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the committee, as saying that they will hold talks with farmers' organisations which want to meet them in person. "Video conferencing will be held with those who can't come to us," Ghanwat said, according to ANI."If the government wants to come and speak with us, we welcome it. We will hear the government too. The biggest challenge is to convince the agitating farmers to come and speak with us, we will try our level best," he added.Farmers have been protesting since November last year at Delhi's borders to demand the scrapping of three contentious farm laws, which they say will hurt their livelihoods. The Supreme Court had on January 12 suspended the pro-reforms farm laws approved by Parliament in September 2020 and also appointed a committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws. The court had named economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi and farm activists Bhupinder Singh Mann and Ghanwat as members of the panel. Mann opted out of the committee a day later, citing the “interests of farmers”.Also read | After row, key farm leader says will not meet political partiesGhanwat, a member of the now three-member panel, had told HT on Monday that the committee will start deliberations on Tuesday, which will include framing of issues before the committee. “In our first meeting, we will take note of our terms of reference and chalk out processes we will follow,” Ghanwat said. He said it was up to the Supreme Court to appoint a member in place of Mann, who has recused himself but the committee’s work would continue.Ghanwat has said the committee will examine the three farm laws and draw up a list of stakeholders for consultations, including farm unions, representatives of agribusinesses, scholars, scientists and even the government. “Our basic terms of reference are to look into the laws and consult stakeholders with the objective of addressing grievances of farmers,” Ghanwat, who heads the Shetkari Sangathan, a farm organisation from Maharashtra that advocates pro-technology and pro-reform agricultural policies, had said.Also read | Decoding fine print of Supreme Court order on farm lawsThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farm unions leading protests against the laws, has however said its members would not appear before the committee. Farm unions have also said that all members of the top court-appointed committee had previously publicly praised the laws that farmers want to be scrapped.The agriculturists have been protesting against the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-appointed-panel-to-meet-farmers-on-jan-21-101611048447883.html

The ruling Awami League party too posted on Twitter that Bangladesh is set to get two million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which would be in addition to 30 million doses that the government has contracted for with the Serum Institute of India. Also Read: Govt assesses supply of Covid-19 vaccines to neighbours, developing countries“#Bangladesh to receive 2 million doses of #Oxford #Astrazeneca #COVID19 #vaccines from the Indian Govt as gift. This is in addition to the procurement of 30 million #CoronaVaccines from @SerumInstIndia. The gift doses are expected to arrive on 20 Jan: DGHS, Ministry of #Health,” the party said via its official Twitter handle. There was no immediate word from Indian officials on the development. The government had held a virtual meeting with the two Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines – Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech – on Monday to review the supply of vaccines to foreign countries, both as grants and through commercial sales. Also on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi referred to his government’s plans to help the neighbourhood and other regions in replies to tweets from Sri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Maldives President Ibrahim Solih congratulating India on the rollout of the world’s largest vaccination programme. “Thank you, President @GotabayaR. We will continue to give due importance to our Neighbourhood First policy while collectively fighting the pandemic,” Modi tweeted. Officials have repeatedly said that the neighbourhood will get priority in the provision of vaccines as grant assistance, as was the case in the supply of hydroxychloroquine to numerous countries amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year. However, at the same time, the government doesn’t want to be seen as playing favourites within the region. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the only country in the region unlikely to be an immediate beneficiary of India’s efforts is Pakistan, which has not made any formal request for vaccines. A number of countries have either signed agreements or are in talks with Serum Institute or Bharat Biotech, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Morocco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-says-it-will-get-2-million-doses-of-covishield-from-india-as-gift-tomorrow-101611048871073.html

Talking to reporters after the meeting in Delhi - Cardinals George Alancherry, Baslios Cleemis and Oswald Gracias - said the PM agreed to their request and promised to take a decision soon.The meeting was part of the PM’s interaction with various church heads initiated by Mizoram Governor PS Sreedharan Pillai.There is a long pending complaint that central funds for minority welfare were not distributed proportionately between different communities in the country. Similarly, the PM tried to broker peace between two warring Christian communities in Kerala: Jacobite and Orthodox factions.Cardinals said they have been asking for an invite to the Pope for quite some time and expressed hope it will be realised soon. In 2018 there was a growing demand for the Pope to be invited to the country when he visited two Asian neighbours, Bangladesh and Myanmar. “It is overdue. We expect a decision from the PM soon,” said Cardinal George Alancherry. He said they requested the PM about an equitable distribution of the minority funds.He also said they also discussed the two expert committee reports on Western Ghats (Gadgil and Kastuirangan), continued incarceration of Father Stan Swamy, among other issues.Swamy, 83-year-old human rights activists and priest, was held in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case and charged with alleged Maoist links.Politics did not come up during talks, they said adding the PM lauded the church’s contribution in education, social work and health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cardinals-meet-pm-modi-urge-him-to-invite-pope-francis-101611048057329.html

It added the cost includes Goods and Service Tax. SII maintained Covishield is one of the world’s lowest-priced Covid-19 vaccines.The Congress on Sunday accused the Centre of spending more on Covid-19 vaccines. It said Covishield costs ₹200 per dose in India and ₹158 per dose in Belgium, quoting an article of The Guardian that cited a Belgian minister’s tweet about the cost of vaccines being sold to the European Union (EU).“AstraZeneca earlier said that it would supply the vaccine at no profit. Then why is the government of India paying ₹200 for the AstraZeneca vaccine to Serum Institute of India?” asked Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala.Poonawalla said the price being quoted for EU is just 50% of the cost while the other 50% would be paid by the respective member countries.“What they have failed to say is that it is only 50%... balance 50% will get paid by the European Union. So, it is 1.7$ roughly and another 50% will come from the EU. So, it will be more than $3. You can reach out to the Belgian government and they will also confirm this,” said Poonawala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-not-being-sold-under-3-per-dose-anywhere-in-the-world-says-sii-101611048211515.html

The man is a Muslim and got into a relationship with me by posing as a Hindu. He beat me up. He physically exploited me for four years."The case falls under the jurisdiction of the district's Palsud police station and is being transferred there for further action, Yadav said.The Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Ordinance penalises religious conversions through fraudulent means including those for the sake of marriage.There is a provision of three to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine of ₹50,000 in cases of marriage carried out by hiding religion.In cases involving religious conversion of members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minors, a provision has been made for imprisonment of two to 10 years and ₹50,000 fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-under-madhya-pradesh-s-new-anti-conversion-law-101611047562306.html

They understand that there is a massive failure… We used to be a preeminent economy in the world. We are a laughing stock (now), we cannot give jobs to our youngsters and our farmers are out protesting in the cold,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader also said that the nation’s image is being tarnished due to the agitations. “This is something to be ashamed of. The whole world is asking us why are lakh farmers protesting daily,” he said during a press conference.The Congress lawmaker from Wayanad also targeted JP Nadda over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president's tweets where he questioned Gandhi over the promises of reforms made by the Congress in its election manifesto for the Lok Sabha in 2019. While replying to Nadda's criticism Gandhi said that Congress supported farmers by protesting against land acquisition and extending farm loan waivers. “During land acquisition, Congress stood with farmers. Congress also extended farm loan waivers to farmers, JP Nadda was not there during all this,” he said.Nadda had claimed that Gandhi sympathises with farmers only when he is in the opposition. “Rahul Gandhi has been spreading lies that all APMC Mandis will be closed down. But wasn't action against the APMC Act a part of Congress manifesto? Would that not have closed down mandis,” Nadda had questioned him in a tweet on Tuesday. “Why did the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) stall the Swaminathan Commission report for years and did not increase the minimum support price (MSP)? Why did farmers remain poor for decades under Congress Governments? Does he feel sympathy for farmers only in opposition?” he had asked.Farmers’ union representatives will hold the tenth round of discussions on Wednesday over the three farms laws passed in September last year. Farmers have been protesting for almost two months against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 at Delhi’s borders.Farmers say that these laws will not double the incomes for the farmers as the government claims but will pave way for contract farming and allow multinational companies to reap profits off the agricultural sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-were-a-preeminent-economy-now-we-are-a-laughing-stock-rahul-gandhi-targets-govt-over-farm-laws-101611046671649.html
19-01-2021||India||'Tragedy unfolding today in country,' says Rahul Gandhi on protest over farm laws||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of monopolising the agriculture sector as he renewed his attack against the Centre over the contentious farm laws. Gandhi on Tuesday released a booklet to highlight the pitfalls of the legislation enacted in September last year. "There is a tragedy unfolding today in the country, govt wants to ignore the issue and misinform the country," he said while addressing a conference after the release. "I am not going to speak about farmers alone as it is only part of the tragedy. It is important for youngsters. This is not about present but about your future," he added."Today, every industry is under a monopoly of three to five people. Be it airport, telecom or power. Modi government wants to give the agriculture sector as well to those four to five industrialists," he added.The Congress leader also said that the new farm reforms are designed to destroy India's agriculture sector. "The biggest business in this country is agriculture. Sixty per cent of our people are engaged in agriculture and in terms of value, agriculture is by far the biggest hit. Now we are seeing is that the last bastion which was protected from monopoly is now being overrun. Three new laws have been passed. They are designed to destroy agriculture by destroying the mandi, Essential Commodities Act, and by making sure that no Indian farmer can go to court to protect himself," he added."We were a preeminent economy, now we are a laughing stock," Gandhi also said.Farmers are agitating against the farm laws for over 50 days now and the government has held nine round of talks so far. However, it has failed to bring any resolution to the matter. The farmers are adamant on the demand to repeal the laws which the government has refused and is firm on their offer to amend the legislation.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also assured that the government will hear the proposal with an "open mind."The Centre on Monday postponed the tenth round of talks scheduled to be held on Tuesday with the farmers. The meeting will now take place on January 20.Farmers are agitating against Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tragedy-unfolding-today-in-country-says-rahul-gandhi-on-protest-over-farm-laws-101611045338115.html

The minister said that the Centre should take cognisance of the chats as they are directly related to national security.A delegation led by Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant met Deshmukh and demanded action in the leaked chats case. The delegation said the state government has every right to initiate action.Deshmukh said, “We have taken serious note of the 500 pages of leaked WhatsApp messages between Republic channel’s Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) chief Partho Dasgupta. In the messages, Arnab speaks about the Balakot airstrike two days before it actually happened on February 23, 2019. It’s a serious threat to the national security if such sensitive information was leaked to the media house. The Centre should initiate strict action into it. On state level, we are checking if Maharashtra Police can initiate action. I am speaking to senior police officers and have sought legal opinion if action can be initiated under section 5 of Official Secrets Act 1923.” Pointing out another alleged violation by Republic channel, Deshmukh said, “There should have been an agreement in place between Doordarshan and Republic if the latter used the platform owned by the former. Without any such agreement, Republic used Doordarshan’s DTH platform. A formal complaint was made to the Central government, but no action was taken,” he said.Sawant said that the state government can initiate action in both the cases. “We have demanded action by the economic offences wing of Mumbai Police in the alleged DTH platform use case as the Republic operates from Mumbai. Secondly, the state has right to take action under Official Secrets Act and there is precedent of a Delhi case. A journalist was booked by Delhi Police in similar action.

The state intends to inoculate 28,500 people in a day through sessions at 285 centres across the state.The drive resumed amid doubts over the efficiency of CoWIN app which developed technical glitches on January 16, the first day of the drive.

The statement came amid criticism from political leaders including those from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) against the web series streamed on Amazon Prime Video for allegedly depicting Hindu gods in a bad light.The Union information and broadcasting ministry has also cited “a large number of grievances and petitions” on “various facets of the web series”.Also read | After ‘Tandav’, FIR against ‘Mirzapur’ for ‘hurting sentiments, abusive content’Balbeer Azad, the complainant in the Greater Noida case, said the depiction of men in Uttar Pradesh police uniform using abusive language and drinking in their van prompted him to lodge the case. “They have made derogatory comments against lower caste people which is not good for our society. The web series has also depicted Hindu deities in a bad light with an ill intention,” he said.” He added the depiction of the Prime Minister in the web series also amounts to an “attack on the democratic system”.Azad, who said a part of the web series was shot in his native Rabupura area of Greater Noida, has named the series director Ali Abbas Zafar; Aparna Purohit, the head of Amazon’s India original content; writers Himanshu Krishna Mehra and Gaurav Solanki; and actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Sunil Grover in his complaint.Additional deputy police commissioner Vishal Pandey said they have registered the case against seven people named in Azad’s complaint under Indian Penal Sections 153-A(1)(b) (promoting enmity), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings), Section 505 (1)(b) (intent to cause, or which is likely to cause fear or alarm), and under the Information Technology Act. “We have registered a case and investigating the matter. Actions will be taken as per the evidence,” he said.On Sunday, police in Lucknow registered a first information report against Purohit, Abbas, and Mehra, among others, on charges of promoting enmity between different groups and insulting religion.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra has threatened legal action against the makers and Maharashtra BJP lawmaker Ram Kadam has called for a boycott of the series.There was no immediate response from the makers or the Amazon Prime Video to the fresh case registered against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-case-filed-in-greater-noida-against-makers-of-web-series-tandav-101611042090377.html

In a series of tweets, Nadda took potshots at the Congress. “Now that Mr. @RahulGandhi has returned from his monthly vacation, I would like to ask him some questions. I hope he will answer them in his today’s Press Conference,” Nadda tweeted. He went on to say, “When will @RahulGandhi , his dynasty and Congress stop lying on China? Can he deny that thousands of kms, including the one in Arunachal Pradesh he is referring to was gifted by none other than Pandit Nehru to the Chinese? Time and again, why does Congress surrender to China?” The BJP’s leader’s comments come in the wake of the Gandhi’s demand that the government should issue a clarification on the Chinese aggression in Ladakh and whether the Chinese forces continue to occupy Indian territory along the Line of Actual Control. The BJP leader also brought up the issue of a MoU that was signed between the Congress party and the Communist Party of China. “Does @rahulgandhi have any intention to cancel the Congress Party MoU with China and their Communist Party? Does he intend to return the Chinese largesse to trusts controlled by his family? Or will their policies and practices continue to be dictated by Chinese money and MoU?,” Nadda tweeted. The MoU referred to was allegedly signed between the Congress and the Communist Party of China in 2008, and an alleged photograph of the signing was put out on social media last year. The BJP has also targeted the Congress for accepting donations for the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) from the Chinese government. In a separate tweet Nadda targeted the Congress leader for trying to mislead the farmers by claiming that the recently passed farm laws benefit corporates. “When will Congress stop provoking and misleading farmers of India? Why did UPA stall the Swaminathan Commission report for years and did not increase the MSP? Why did farmers remain poor for decades under Congress Governments? Does he feel sympathy for farmers only in opposition?” The BJP leader said Gandhi has been “spreading lies” that all APMC Mandis will be closed down. “…But wasn’t action against the APMC Act a part of Congress manifesto? Would that not have closed down mandis?” he said. Following its opposition to the farm laws, the BJP has accused the Congress of double-speak on the issue. The BJP claims that the Congress in 2013–14 told its own state governments to denotify fruits and vegetables from the APMC and in its manifesto said it will repeal APMC act and make Agriculture produce free from market restrictions. Nadda also took a swipe at Gandhi for attending jallikattu in Tamil Nadu earlier this month even as his party had supported the ban on the annual sport. “Rahul Gandhi enjoyed Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu. Why did his party ban it and insult Tamil culture when they were in power? Is he not proud of India’s culture and ethos?” The BJP president also criticised Gandhi for not acknowledging the efforts of the scientists in coming up with a Covid-19 vaccine in a short span of time. He said, “Rahul Gandhi spared no opportunity to demotivate the nation in the spirited fight against COVID-19. Today when India has one of the lowest cases and our scientists have come up with a vaccine, why hasn’t he congratulated the scientists and lauded 130 crore Indians even once?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-congress-misleading-farmers-surrendering-to-china-nadda-to-rahul-gandhi-101611041370295.html

19-01-2021||India||China’s PLA may ramp up military activity in Ladakh in 2 months||With Indian Army and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) frozen in their positions in East Ladakh sector’s polar winter, national security planners expect China to ramp up military activity at the friction points when the snows melt in late March. There has been no withdrawal of any PLA troops from the contested points and China has used the stand-off to build advanced landing grounds across the Daulet Beg Oldi sector in Tianwendian, humongous shelters to house personnel and a shorter link from Hotan airbase to Karakoram pass. "There could be military pressure north of Depsang bulge," said a senior commander.According to people familiar with the matter, the dates of the ninth round of military talks are expected to be decided soon to top the good progress made by both sides in disengagement and de-escalation plan. This view is in sharp contrast to the view within a section of the government, who believe that the PLA is in no mood to move out of the contested points at least till paramount leader Xi Jinping delivers his address to the celebrations to mark 100 years of Chinese Communist Party’s rule. “This is the unfortunate record,” said a senior official.While the Indian Army is prepared to sit out in East Ladakh for as long as it takes, the Chinese moves may also be influenced by the tone and tenor of the incoming Joe Biden administration towards Beijing. Although many believe that the incoming US administration could strike a balance by its de facto recognition of China as the other superpower, this new G-2 factor will hurt former superpowers like Russia.India, on its part, believes that it is a multi-polar world and New Delhi is not dependent (much to the chagrin of western strategists) on Washington to deal with China to protect its frontiers. And hence, the strategy of Atmanirbhar Bharat in developing indigenous technologies in areas of drones, fighter aircraft and stand-off weapons with the involvement of the public and private sector. The onus lies on DRDO and HAL to roll-out the Tejas Mark I A on April 1, 2024, along with a prototype of the twin-engine indigenous fighter or AMCA as the government has shot down Mark II project.According to senior officials familiar with the national security deliberations, India does hope that the incoming Biden administration will stand by its commitments on China, South China Sea, Taiwan or Indo-Pacific at large but New Delhi is not dependent on the US for handling the PLA. The fact is that the US has indeed increased Indian awareness of the Indo-Pacific by providing access to information, the same cannot be said about the Ladakh stand-off. This approach is contrary to China’s perception that sees India through the prism of the US and as an adversary.With PLA ramping up border infrastructure all along the 3,488 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC), India is alive to the distinct possibility that China could open up fronts in Arunachal Pradesh and around the Sikkim-Bhutan-India tri-junction area. However, after the Galwan flare-up on June 15 and significant casualties on the PLA side, China will engage India with stand-off weapons and not repeat the mistake of engaging Indian Army in hand-to-hand combat in a worst-case scenario.But there is a downside to such an engagement and China is acutely aware of it. Much as China would like to teach a lesson to Indian Army as its state media often warns, Beijing is well aware that the political leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the capacity to retaliate like it did on 29-30 August 2020 on the south bank of Pangong Tso. For a country that sees itself as a contender to the superpower slot now occupied by the US, any military loss of face to India will take the wind out of that claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-preps-for-fresh-chinese-military-activity-in-east-ladakh-from-march-101611038975489.html

They also pointed out that all four members had publicly backed the three laws. Following this, Bhupinder Singh Mann, one of the four members, announced his decision to step down from the panel.Ashok Gulati, PK Joshi and Anil Ghanwat are the other three members of the panel.

19-01-2021||India||BJP MP blames Rajiv Gandhi for Chinese construction in Arunachal Pradesh, slams Cong policies for current situation||Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Arunachal Pradesh Tapir Gao on Tuesday claimed that it was during Congress' regime China occupied Sumdorong Chu Valley in Tawang and added that the then Army Chief planned an operation but former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi denied him permission to push back People's Liberation Army troops.The MP from Arunachal East pointed out that China has been constructing roads in the region since the 1980s.The comments of the BJP leader came after the Opposition questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government over the alleged construction of village in the territory.Gao blamed Congress and its policies for the Chinese construction on and inside the McMahon line, while maintaining that the land where the village has been constructed is already under China's occupation."Since 80s China is constructing roads. They've built Longju to Maza road. During Rajiv Gandhi's regime, China occupied Sumdorong Chu Valley in Tawang. The then Army Chief planned an op but Rajiv Gandhi denied him permission to push back PLA," he said."Since the 80s till today, they (China) are occupying this area and construction of villages is not a new thing. They have already constructed military base between Bisa and Maza which is inside McMahon Line, under Indian territory," Gao added.He pointed out that "There was a wrong policy of government during the Congress regime. They didn't construct roads up to the border which left a buffer zone of 3-4 km which China occupied. Construction of new villages isn't a new thing, it's all inherited from Congress."The BJP MP praised the Modi government for building two-lane roads till the border."This is not a new issue for people of Arunachal Pradesh. The village might have been constructed new but the land was occupied during the Congress regime. It has a mini hydel project on Tsari Su, the actual local name is Lensi, and Army infrastructure. They will keep on constructing if there are no demarcations on basis of McMahon line. Congress should answer why the Chinese have been able to occupy the land," Gao told ANI."Operation Pelican was hatched to flush out the Chinese army. But Rajiv Gandhi quashed the plan and instead went to Beijing in 1986 and came back empty-handed. From the 80s till today, the Chinese have occupied this area and they have constructed a military base on land in the Indian Territory as per McMahon line. I don't know what happened to Indian intelligence reported to the Government of India," stated Gao."I had raised the issue in Parliament in zero-hour how China has occupied the upper Subansiri district," he added.Lashing out at Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for a tweet over the issue, Gao asked if he would make an agreement between Rahul Gandhi and Chinese President Xi Jinping public."I have read a tweet of Shashi Tharoor and Owaisi. I would like to request Tharoor whether he would be able to give an agreement signed by Rahul Gandhi and Xi Jinping and whether Arunachal and Aksai Chin were mentioned in the agreement. Before Opposition questions the PM, they should try to answer this," said Gao.Giving a historical background to the issue, Gao maintained that Indians should use Indian names rather than names given by the Chinese to places and rivers."Local name of this river is Lensi river, Chinese may call it Tsari Su. In 1959 Assam rifle and Sikh regiment were posted in Longzu. In 1962 Assam rifles were martyred by the Chinese and took over the area. Since the 80s, PLA is constructing roads," said Gao.The BJP MP also said that one should not use Line of Actual Control (LAC) in place of the Mcmahon line."We are with LAC in Ladakh but not in Arunachal Pradesh. We have the Mcmahon line in Arunachal. If we call the Mcmahon line as Line of Actual Control, it means we are considering that we have surrendered our area to China," Gao added.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Monday said that it has seen recent reports on China undertaking construction work along with the border areas with India and asserted that the government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India's security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.The MEA said China has undertaken such infrastructure construction in the past several years and the government too has stepped up border infrastructure which has provided much-needed connectivity to the local population.MEA's response came after a media report that China has resorted to construction in the border area in Arunachal Pradesh. There were reports earlier of China having constructed three new villages near Arunachal Pradesh border. India and China are in a standoff in Ladakh for over eight months following actions of the Chinese Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-blames-rajiv-gandhi-for-chinese-construction-in-arunachal-pradesh-slams-cong-policies-for-current-situation-101611038415297.html

"Remember his promise- “मैं देश झुकने नहीं दूँगा।”," Gandhi posted on Twitter along with a newspaper clipping on the issue.The tweet comes against the backdrop of an NDTV report citing satellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US-based imaging company, that shows China built a new village, consisting of 101 homes, in Arunachal Pradesh, about 4.5 km “within Indian territory of the de facto border”.Remember his promise- “मैं देश झुकने नहीं दूँगा।” pic.twitter.com/NdXT4hqkNKThe village is located on the banks of Tsari Chu river in Upper Subansiri district, an area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This was the same area where five people were detained by Chinese troops last September. Comparing two satellite images provided by Planet Labs, NDTV reported the village had been built sometime in the past 15 months.The ministry of external affairs has said that it closely monitors all developments affecting national security and acts to safeguard territorial integrity. The government has stepped up the construction of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges, in response to China’s “construction work along the border areas”, it added.Congress national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also the government over the alleged “Chinese village.” "After Ladakh, #China occupies our territory 4.5 Km inside #Arunachal & builds a whole village.

19-01-2021||India||Amartya Sen asks Visva-Bharati to withdraw allegation of illegal holding of land||Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has written to Visva-Bharati demanding that the university authorities withdraw the allegation that his family is in "illegal" possession of land in its Santiniketan campus and alleged that the accusations are a crude attempt at harassment.Sen had on Monday written the letter to Visva-Bharati Vice-Chancellor Prof Bidyut Chakraborty two days after the authorities of the central university asked the West Bengal government to measure the plot owned by him at Santiniketan as soon as possible to permanently resolve the dispute.The noted economist said in the letter that his father had purchased free-hold land from the market and not from Visva-Bharati - to add to their homestead and he has been paying taxes for them.Sen had also sent a legal notice earlier this year to the VC asking him to withdraw "false" allegation made to the news agencies that a plot of land owned by Visva-Bharati is unlawfully occupied by the economist.While the university was not able to provide any justification for the allegation, it has requested the West Bengal government "to measure the area of our homestead, Pratichi, to compare with the long term lease of land taken by my father in 1940 from Visva-Bharati", Sen said in the letter."This sudden abuse of an 80-year-old document is clearly a crude attempt at harassment or worse," he said."Among other errors it ignores the big fact, which I have stated many times (even in the context of this dispute), that a substantial amount of free-hold land was purchased by my father (in the market -- not from Visva-Bharati) to add to our homestead on which khajna and Panchayat taxes are paid by me yearly," the letter said.Hence the officiating registrar's threat of legal action if the official discovers any additional land beyond the leased land seems hugely mischievous, Sen said.Stating that he is tired of the VC's repeated claims despite emphatic denials on his part about his phone call to Chakraborty in 2019, Sen said that the VC insisted that the call was made either on June 2 or June 14."On being informed that I was abroad for the entire month of June 2019 and came back to India only in July, the story was promptly altered by the V.C.'s office to assert that I had called in June or July but said the same things," the letter said."Rather than inventing new falsities and adding to their culpability, Visva-Bharati should withdraw the false allegations made by them, as my lawyer has asked," Sen said.A controversy had erupted on December 24 last year, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the centenary celebrations of Visva-Bharati, when media reported that the university has written to the West Bengal government alleging dozens of land parcels owned by it were wrongfully recorded in the names of private parties including Sen.Sen, who now lives in the US, has said that the land, on which his house stands is on a long-term lease, which is nowhere near its expiry.Stating that the Visva-Bharati authorities had never complained to him or his family about any irregularity in holding the land, Sen has accused the VC of acting at the behest of the Centre "with its growing control over Bengal".Visva-Bharati officials were not available for comment on the letter.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and several prominent intellectuals of the state have expressed their supports to the economist on the row.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amartya-sen-asks-visva-bharati-to-withdraw-allegation-of-illegal-holding-of-land-101611037280003.html

[the man] concealed his religious identity to kidnap his daughter.”Also read | Transfer pleas on ‘love jihad’ law to Supreme Court: UP govt tells Allahabad HCIn his complaint, the father said his daughter was in touch with the man on Facebook since November 2019. An Uttar Pradesh police team arrested the man from Bijapur in Karnataka last week.Uttar Pradesh has criminalised religious conversion, including through interfaith marriages, amid criticism that the ordinance enacted for it in November was being used to target inter-faith couples. The ordinance was introduced after the Hindu right campaigned against interfaith marriages.Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh have also enacted anti-conversion laws and other Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states such as Haryana, Karnataka, and Assam are planning similar legislation.Critics allege the laws are being used against the Muslim minority and infantilise women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gorakhpur-woman-says-was-not-kidnapped-forced-to-convert-101611036089493.html

19-01-2021||India||Public bike-sharing cheapest mode for last-mile connectivity in Mumbai: Survey||Cycling could turn out to be the cheapest mode of transport for the last-mile connectivity in Mumbai, shows a recent survey.The analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India shows that while public bike-sharing (introduced at two Mumbai Metro stations) costs ₹2 for a five km ride, the same distance costs ₹5 in a BEST bus and local train (second class), ₹50 in first class and ₹20 in Metro.It gets more expensive if one opts for an auto ( ₹60.67), a black and yellow taxi ( ₹74) or an app-based cab ( ₹115). The analysis has assessed the cycling speed to be around 6km per hour. The newly-introduced public bike-sharing scheme at the Versova and Jagruti Nagar Metro station costs ₹2 per hour. For trains, the report looks at the pricing between the Churchgate and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) stations. First- and last-mile connectivity refers to the beginning and end of a commute made using public transportation and has been a huge issue in the city.Prateek Diwan, senior project associate - urban innovative and integrated transport, WRI India said, “Public transportation becomes effective when commuters have a range of last-mile connectivity options, which is usually at a distance of about 2-5 kms. Apart from being a low-cost mode of travel, cycling also allows commuters flexibility to change routes and is the most sustainable transport option.” Almost 35% of vehicular trips in India are short trips (less than 5 kms). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) development plan 2032 also states that 60% of the start and end of public transport trips are by walking and more than 80% of it is for less than 15 minutes, which effectively means that these trips, in conducive weather, can also translate into cycling trips.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is implementing a 337km-Metro network in Mumbai and its adjoining areas, is also giving a lot of importance to cycling as an attractive last-mile option. Apart from introducing cycling in two Metro stations, it has introduced e-scooters in Bandra-Kurla Complex. MMRDA has also planned cycle bays across all upcoming 200+ Metro stations as part of its larger multimodal integration plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cycling-cheapest-mode-for-last-mile-connectivity-in-mumbai-survey-101611034348598.html

Following the inoculation, 580 cases of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) have been reported so far. Out of these, seven required hospitalisation.Officials said concerns over the vaccines’ safety appear to have deterred many people as side-effects of the jabs were being highlighted.Two vaccines-Serum Institute of India’s Oxford-AstraZeneca called Covidshield, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which is still in the third phase of trials- are being administered to the beneficiaries across all states.In the first phase of the vaccination drive, nearly 30 million health and frontline workers are being given the dose and in the second phase, those above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with a high risk of infection, will be vaccinated.The health ministry has also released fact sheets for both the vaccines that are approved for use in India, warning against use of these vaccines in immuno-compromised persons or in persons taking medicines that can affect the immune system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-daily-covid-19-cases-drop-to-10-064-recoveries-surpass-10-22-million-101611033011391.html

A fact sheet released by the Union health ministry doesn’t specifically mention these conditions as contraindications for Covid-19 vaccines. “You should not get the Bharat Biotech Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, if you are immune-compromised, or are on a medicine that affects your medicine, have any history of allergies, have fever, have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have received another Covid-19 vaccine, or any other serious health related issues, as determined by the vaccinator/officer supervising vaccination,” says Bharat Biotech’s fact sheet on Covaxin that the company has put out in compliance with the national drugs controller’s regulatory approval conditions under clinical trial mode. Also Read: Vaccine drive expands as Covid-19 probe criticises global responseSerum Institute of India (SII), that is locally manufacturing Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine that it calls Covishield, has also put out a fact sheet enlisting contraindications and precautions that need to be taken while administering the vaccine. “What should you mention to your health care provider before you get Covishield vaccine? Tell the health care provider about all your medical conditions, including: if you are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system, ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after any drug, food, any vaccine, or any ingredients of Covishield vaccine, have fever, have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, are breast feeding or received another Covid-19 vaccine. You should consult your health care provider before deciding to take the vaccine…,” says SII fact sheet on Covishield. The Covaxin fact sheet was released last week, and for Covishield, SII released the fact sheet earlier this month. The health ministry’s guidance document for States on precautions and contraindications for Covid-19 vaccine released two days before the launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 16, however, did not mention a recipient’s immune status as a contraindication for taking these vaccines. “Following conditions are not contraindicated for Covid vaccines: immune-deficiency, HIV, patients on immune-suppression due to any condition (the response to the Covid-19 vaccines may be less in these individuals); history of chronic diseases and morbidities (cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, malignancies); Persons with a past history of Sars-CoV-2 infection (sero-positivity), and or RT-PCR positive illness,” read the health ministry document sent to states by Manohar Agnani, additional secretary (health). Agnani’s letter to states also mentioned certain conditions for which giving the vaccine should be deferred by four to eight weeks after recovery, and that include having active symptoms of Covid-19 infection, hospitalized patients who were given convalescent plasma therapy or monoclonal antibodies, and those who are acutely unwell and hospitalized (with or without intensive care) due to any illnesses. “Special precautions need to be taken while giving the vaccine to persons with history of any bleeding or coagulation disorder such as clotting factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder,” it said. India has so far seen 0.15% adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) since it launched the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday, January 16.Experts say it is a minuscule number in comparison to the benefits that vaccinating country’s high-risk population will achieve.“Acceptable level of AEFI would ideally be zero, but that is not the case. I think it is around 0.2% and yet we are focussing on that and not the 99.8% benefit,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccines-fact-sheets-warn-against-use-among-people-with-medical-conditions-101611031888505.html

The move has come as a big relief to the poultry traders in the state. The order to lift the ban was issued after chief minister Yogi Adityanath approved a proposal to this effect here on Monday, sources said. The UP government had on January 10 issued a circular declaring the whole state as “controlled zone” and banning the import of all kinds of live birds, including poultry, into UP from other states till January 24. Also Read: Bird flu confirmed in 5 states for poultry, culling operations underwayThe ban that was put in view of avian influenza (bird flu) cases being reported from neighbouring states, such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, was to be reviewed after January 24 and a further call taken depending on the situation. “We have withdrawn the earlier ban order midway with immediate effect on the centre’s advice,” principal secretary, animal husbandry, Bhuvnesh Kumar said. The order also quoted a report by the director, animal diseases, to make a case for lifting the ban. According to that report, the department took 2,811 swab and 1,013 serum samples and also examined 43 dead birds during a statewide surveillance till January 15. “But only 11 samples were found to be positive, which is very low at only 0.54%,” the order said. The centre’s advisory, according sources, said that not only there was no evidence of the avian influenza virus spreading from birds to human beings but the virus is also destroyed at 70 degree Celsius temperature and there was no risk from eating well-boiled eggs and meat. “Moreover, while stressing on the need for lifting the ban, the centre also said the virus in UP was mostly affecting wild birds and poultry birds were not hit, barring sporadic cases,” sources said. The centre saw the poultry import prohibition as a knee-jerk reaction to the situation. Sources, however said the ban was lifted mainly due to financial losses it was causing to people engaged in the poultry business in UP as well in states from where poultry birds are imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-lifts-ban-on-import-of-poultry-from-other-states-101611031408845.html

Data released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics put GDP growth in the December quarter at 6.5%. This has catapulted the annual growth figure for 2020 to 2.3%, despite a 6.8% contraction in the quarter ending March 2020, which was when China was dealing with a spike in Covid-19 cases.The 2.3% GDP growth in 2020 is 30 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – more than the 2% projection made by the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects released earlier this month. All major economies, country groups and sub-regions (East Asia and Pacific being the only exception, thanks to China) are expected to experience a contraction in their GDP in 2020.Chinese economy is expected to outperform most major economies even in 2021. This is despite the fact that the others will have a more favourable base effect due to economic contraction this year. The difference in growth performance in 2020 and 2021 is likely to close the gap between the US and Chinese economies significantly. In 2019, China’s GDP was $14.3 trillion in current prices, around two-thirds of the US GDP of $21.4 trillion. With China’s GDP growth exceeding that of the US by 5.9 and 4.4 percentage points in 2020 and 2021 respectively, the US-China GDP gap is expected to come down significantly.To be sure, the Chinese economy has its share of challenges. Chinese economy’s exceptional performance has “been fuelled by a surprisingly resilient export sector” even as “consumption – a key driver of growth – has lagged expectations”, Reuters reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-only-major-economy-with-positive-gdp-growth-in-2020-101611030088272.html

19-01-2021||India||'Advisable to not take vaccine if...': Bharat Biotech issues Covaxin fact sheet||India has launched a massive exercise to inoculate its population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which has claimed more than 1.5 lakh lives in the country.In the vaccination drive that began on January 16, the doctors are using two vaccines - Covishield made by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech.But days into the vaccination programme, Bharat Biotech has come out with a fact sheet about the process involved and who should avoid taking the vaccine.According to the fact sheet posted on Bharat Biotech's website, it is advisable not to take the vaccine if a person has allergies, fever or bleeding disorder or is on a blood thinner.It also said that pregnant and breastfeeding women should also avoid taking Covaxin. Those who are immune-compromised or are on medicine that affects immune system, and those who have received another Covid-19 vaccine should also not get the Bharat Biotech's medicine, the company said.Also Watch | First feeling, side-effects, doubts: Vaccinated doctors share experienceSo who all are eligible to get Covaxin shots? The fact sheet from Bharat Biotech says that CDSCO has authorised the restricted use of its vaccine under clinical trial mode."Individuals who are prioritised under the public health program of the ministry of health and family welfare, will be covered under this endeavour. Informing the individuals about the offer for vaccination with Covaxin will rest with the respective government program officials. Those offered Covaxin at pre-specified booths will have the options to receive or reject administration of the vaccine," the fact sheet said.The company document further described the ingredients in the Covaxin. It contains 64g of whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 antigen (Strain: NIV-2020-770), and the other inactive ingredients such as aluminum hydroxide gel (250 μg), TLR 7/8 agonist (imidazoquinolinone) 15 μg, 2-phenoxyethanol 2.5 mg, and phosphate buffer saline up to 0.5 ml."The vaccine thus has been developed by using inactivated/killed virus along with the aforementioned chemicals," said Bharat Biotech.Covaxin is administered as an injection into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. It is a two-dose series given four weeks apart, Bharat Biotech further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/advisable-to-not-take-vaccine-if-bharat-biotech-issues-covaxin-fact-sheet-101611027834226.html

This comes after a fall in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the state.However, strict Covid-19 protocols have been put into place by school authorities for Class 10 and 12 students.Preparations have been in full swing in all high and higher secondary schools for the reopening. The department of health has prepared a list of measures that will be followed by the schools. The list includes frequent sanitisation of areas, storing vitamins and other immunity boosters for the students.The Centre had, in Unlock 5 guidelines, allowed schools to reopen from October 15. However, the decision was left to states/union territories to decide as to when they would resume physical classes.Schools and colleges have remained shut since March 2020 in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic which has infected more than 10,571,700 people so far.Here is all you need to know about the reopening of schools in Tamil Nadu:1) School authorities have been asked to compulsory screen all students and faculty for Covid-19 within a week of reopening. They will also check for comorbidities.2) The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine mandated cleaning of school premises by school management besides the creation of sufficient hand washing facilities and following the standard operating procedures (SOPs) without any deviation.3) If required, the schools can ask for primary health centre (PHC) teams which will be equipped to handle suspected symptomatic children as per SOPs.4) Mobile medical units will also be made available and the details for the same will be shared with the schools for any emergency.5) Vitamin C, multivitamin tablets and other immuno-boosters will be kept ready for children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-for-class-10-12-resume-in-tamil-nadu-all-you-need-to-know-101611026262448.html
19-01-2021||India||Union budget: Development Finance Institution likely to be announced||The creation of a mega Development Finance Institution (DFI) is likely to be announced in the Union Budget. The institution is expected to be created by merging some existing financial institutions to meet the long-term financing needs of new, stalled, and work-in-progress infrastructure projects worth over ₹100 lakh crore, people aware of the matter said.A large DFI is necessary for rapid infrastructure development and is likely to be one of the key focus areas of Budget 2021-22.Infrastructure development will put India on a higher growth trajectory and impact every sector of the economy, the people cited above added, requesting anonymity.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will on February 1 present the Budget, which is expected to be focussed on reviving the economy hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the 68-day-long nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 to check its spread. The Indian economy contracted by 23.9% in the quarter that ended on June 30. It recovered to contract by 7.5% in the three months that ended on September 30. According to the first advanced estimate by the National Statistical Office, GDP is expected to contract by 7.7% in fiscal 2020-21.There is a need for a mega DFI as commercial banks are not suited for long-term financing of infrastructure projects with long gestation periods, the people cited above said. They added that apart from funding new projects, such an institution could also help revive stalled projects worth at least ₹10 lakh crore. “Most of these projects are languishing because of fund crunch,” one of the persons said.The proposed mega DFI may include an existing financial institution and some existing funds. “It will meet the long-term financing need of these projects,” the person said. “The government has already announced its ambitious ₹111 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline, which will require debt financing of at least ₹60-70 lakh crore in the next four-five years.”A second person said although the government has created several funds to finance infrastructure and revive stressed projects, the idea of having a mega DFI is to create a competitive financing option.The Cabinet on November 25 approved a ₹6,000 crore capital infusion in National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, a government-backed entity created to provide long-term capital to the infrastructure sector.The government also set up ₹25,000 crore Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing Fund on November 6, 2019, to help stalled projects in the real estate sector.Niranjan Hiranandani, president of the National Real Estate Development Council, said the creation of the fund for the stressed real estate sector was appreciable, but not sufficient as the funds required to complete these projects is in access to ₹1.25 lakh crore.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said funding is the most important aspect of infrastructure projects.“Banks are reeling under the piled-up NPAs [non-performing assets] and in addition to this, funding of greenfield projects by commercial banks leads to asset-liability mismatch which already has left a lasting impact. The government does not have fiscal room to spend. The issues clearly indicate the necessity for a DFI for infrastructure development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-development-finance-institution-likely-to-be-announced-101611026367782.html
19-01-2021||India||Indian American organizations urge Supreme Court to give bail to Sanjiv Bhatt||Several civil rights activists and organizations from India and the US on Monday urged the Supreme Court to give bail to former police officer Sanjiv Bhatt.At a virtual press conference organized by the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and Hindus for Human Rights, the organizations and activists argued that conviction of Bhatt in a murder case was wrong and based on fraudulent evidence.The Supreme Court of India has scheduled a bail hearing for Bhatt on January 22.Senior Congress leader and former minister Shashi Tharoor said he was “outraged by the injustice meted out” to Bhatt, whose “conscientious service to society” and “indomitable capacity for speaking truth to power” had put him in jail.“Sanjiv’s case is a reflection of the grim times that we live in, where constitutional values and fundamental privileges that have been granted by the constitution to all Indians appear in many cases to be diluted and in many cases perhaps even supplanted by illiberal forces,” Tharoor said.“All Indians with a conscience like Sanjiv Bhatt’s must stand up and fight back against such challenges that threaten to undermine the very foundation of our republic,” he said.Renowned documentary filmmaker and human rights defender Anand Patwardhan said Bhatt had been jailed “for no other reason than the fact that he opposed the massacre in 2002” and spoke against it. Patwardhan said the civil society “should build a movement for Bhatt’s release”.Human rights activist, classical dancer and actor Mallika Sarabhai said there was a “definite agenda” not only in Bhatt’s case but in most cases of most critics of the Modi government.“If anyone speaks against the government or asks a question, which is a fundamental right of our democracy, they are somehow punished. Raids are carried out against them, false cases are brought up, fraudulent charges are made, and they are made to silence,” Sarabhai alleged.Rasheed Ahmed, executive director of Indian American Muslim Council, said the Indian government must stop “politically managing Sanjiv Bhatt’s case and let the law take its course under the supervision of independent judges not the judges who are either scared of government or have themselves becomes political”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-american-organizations-urge-supreme-court-to-give-bail-to-sanjiv-bhatt-101611026042793.html
19-01-2021||India||This monsoon, IMD to begin special forecast for rain-fed areas||This monsoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD) will issue a special seasonal forecast for rain-fed areas where there is no irrigation to support agriculture. IMD will also use a multi-model ensemble forecast (a combination of different models) for the first time to predict monsoon rains this year. IMD held a day long brainstorming session on Monday to analyse the features of monsoon in 2020 and forecast plans for 2021. “We were using some models like the Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) which is a dynamic model. Now we may have to use a combination of models to issue probabilistic forecasts and more accurate monsoon forecast. As an experiment we will also try issuing specialised forecasts for rain-fed areas this year,” said M Mohapatra, director general IMD.IMD scientists said monsoon in 2020 was unique with large month-on-month variation and unusual rainfall patterns in four sub-regions of the country. An assessment of the seasonal forecast performance of IMD for monsoon 2020 was not found to be up to the mark. The error limit was breached for certain zones in the regional distribution forecast of IMD. IMD had forecast normal monsoon rain in 2020 at 102% of long period average (LPA) with error margin of +/-4% for the season. But actual rainfall was above normal at 108.7% of LPA. IMD in its zonal monsoon forecast last year predicted 107% of LPA (with model error of +/-8%) monsoon rain over northwest India but the region recorded 84% of LPA; for northeast India it was predicted to be 96% of LPA but recorded 106%; for south peninsula it was predicted 102% but recorded 130% of LPA.To address concerns of inaccurate forecasting of monsoon patterns in some years, IMD has decided to use a multi-model ensemble forecast.Mohapatra said the reason monsoon 2020 was unique and difficult to forecast is because of intra-seasonal variability and formation of several low pressure systems which couldn’t be captured. Deficient rain or excess rain spells also couldn’t be predicted well. “There is need therefore to quantify the uncertainty in the monsoon forecast so that forecast can be used for various applications like energy, health, agriculture etc,” Mohapatra added.IMD is also likely to revisit the monsoon withdrawal criteria this year. For the past ten years, withdrawal of monsoon has been significantly delayed compared to the normal withdrawal dates. IMD scientists will assess whether this is because of IMD’s strict monsoon withdrawal criteria, like no rain in the region for at least five days, establishment of anticyclonic wind pattern, considerable reduction in moisture content, or is it because monsoon withdrawal has actually delayed significantly in the past decade.IMD’s modelling groups have been asked to improve their forecasts for river catchments as a new feature of providing five-day forecast (instead of three day) for sub-river catchments in the country is likely to be started this year. New forecasting models will also be deployed for forecasting of urban flooding in Chennai and Mumbai.DS Pai, senior scientist, IMD Pune, said operational forecast error was highest between 1998 and 2002—over 10% with 1998 recording a forecast error of 21% and 2002 recording an error of 22%. But forecast error has improved in the past 13 (2008 to 2020) years to an average of 5.82% after an ensemble model was implemented. “But we need further improvement in models. IMD is now planning to use both Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecasting System (MMCFS) and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCRMWF)’s models this year to generate monsoon forecast for better accuracy.”Pai also highlighted that in a few years, India may be entering an epoch of above average monsoon rains. From 1945 to 1985 was also an above average rain epoch but from 1985 onwards, it has been a below average rain epoch.“In a few years, we are likely to transition to an epoch of above average monsoon rains because monsoon follows epochs of around 31 years in these transitions. An above average epoch will be good for the country and agriculture but would mean more extreme rainfall events for which we should prepare,” added Mohapatra.Monsoon rains are a lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which have no irrigation.The monsoon impacts inflation, jobs and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and spending, helping inject demand into the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-monsoon-imd-to-begin-special-forecast-for-rain-fed-areas-101611025287359.html

19-01-2021||India||Supreme Court-appointed panel on farm laws to hold first meeting on Tuesday||The Supreme Court-appointed committee to scrutinise three new farm laws is scheduled to hold its first meeting with members on Tuesday. The meeting will take place at Pusa campus in New Delhi, its member Anil Ghanwat said on Monday."We are going to meet tomorrow. Only members will meet to discuss the terms of reference and decide the future course of action," Ghanwat told news agency PTI before boarding a flight to Delhi yesterday.Ghanwat leads the Shetkari Sangathan, a farm organisation from Maharashtra that advocates pro-technology and pro-reform agricultural policies.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three laws, against which farmers are protesting at Delhi borders for over 50 days now, till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Bhupinder Singh Mann, however, recused himself from the four-member committee last week. Ghanwat said it was up to the Supreme Court to appoint a member in place of Mann.Apart from Ghanwat, agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi are the other members of the panel.The panel will hear views of farmers across the country, both who support and oppose the new farm laws, and submit a report within two months to the apex court.According to the Supreme Court’s instructions, the committee had to meet within 10 days of its constitution and submit a report to the apex court in two months.The protesting farmers have said that they won't appear before the committee as all its members had previously publicly praised the laws that they want scrapped.So far, nine rounds of talks have been held between the government and the protesters, but no solution has emerged to end the impasse. The 10th round of talks was on Monday pushed back by a day to January 20, with the Centre saying both sides want to resolve the stalemate at the earliest but it was getting delayed due to involvement of people of other ideologies.Farmers want the three farm laws repealed but the government has rejected the demand. The farmers say that the pro-reform farm laws will hurt their livelihoods, but the government has asserted that the new laws are in the interest of the farming community.The laws in question are the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-to-hold-first-meeting-on-tuesday-101611022304429.html

The sexual abuse came to light during a counseling session at a Nirbhaya centre recently, the officials said.The minor girl was first raped in 2016, when she was 13, the officials said. A case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was filed and the girl was moved to a shelter home in the district, the officials said. She was allowed to go home in 2017, but soon she filed another complaint accusing a neighbour of sexual assault, police officials said. She was then shifted to the Nirbhaya centre, they said. The authorities at the centre allowed her to go home to live with her mother and brother during the lockdown early last year, the officials said. The girl went missing after her release from the centre and was traced to Palakkad in December last year, investigating officer Mohammad Haneefa said. Authorities at the child shelter home said that they track survivors after their release but could not conduct proper follow-ups with the girl amid Covid-19 restrictions.“We have started an inquiry against the care home to find out any lapse on its part,” a senior official of the social welfare ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minor-rape-survivor-reveals-she-was-sexually-abused-by-38-men-101611016767876.html
19-01-2021||India||Reservations: SC rejects ad hoc promotion plea, asks states to apprise AG of matter||The Supreme Court on Monday took up several pleas regarding alleged hurdles over reservation in promotion to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) in various states, asking them to apprise the attorney general about the issues that need examining and submit a list in four weeks.A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, however, turned down the Centre’s request to permit ad hoc promotions to fill over 130,000 vacant posts in public employment across the country. The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran, told the attorney general to finalise the issues and posted 80 petitions for hearing after six weeks.The issues arising in these matters pertained to the application of a decision passed by the apex court in a 2006 case titled M. Nagaraj vs. Union of India where a five-judge Constitution Bench held that for applying reservation in promotions, the government must provide quantifiable data to show the backwardness of a particular class and inadequacy of their representation in public employment. States were finding this yardstick too difficult to achieve. Several high courts even began applying this rule laid down by the top court for carrying out reservation in promotions for SC/ST, thereby forcing states to approach the top court.In 2018, the top court in Jarnail Singh v Lachhmi Narain Gupta case refused to refer the Nagaraj judgment to a higher bench but later altered the decision by saying that states will not be required to present quantifiable data of backwardness of Scheduled Castes or Tribes. However, it made the creamy layer test applicable to reservation in promotions of SC/ST. “The issues are not common in all the cases which have arisen from several states. We therefore consider it appropriate and expedient that the Advocates-on-Record appearing for each state should furnish a note clearly stating the issues within a period of two weeks from today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reservations-sc-rejects-ad-hoc-promotion-plea-asks-states-to-apprise-ag-of-matter-101611016358153.html

He, however, backtracked later on Monday and offered a written assurance not to meet any party in future.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a platform of nearly 400 farm groups leading the stir, said that efforts by Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni to organise an “all-party meeting” on the farm laws were not authorised by it, and did not figure in its official agenda.Just hours later, Chaduni, in a written statement to the SKM, said his meeting with the political leaders was a personal initiative to strengthen the agitation. The SKM accepted his clarification, a statement by the farm unions read.The farm unions are on a strike since November to demand the scrapping of three contentious farm laws. The unions say the laws will hurt their livelihoods. A team of 41 representatives of the SKM has been participating in negotiations with the Union government. Chaduni also has been a part of the delegation.“The Samyukt Kisan Morcha disassociates itself from the activities of Gurnam Singh Chaduni. His decision for an all-party meeting was never approved or authorised. It is his personal activity,” said Hannan Mollah, a key member of the Morcha’s “general body”, earlier in the day.On January 17, Chaduni, an influential farm leader in Haryana and Punjab, met leaders of the opposition parties, including the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal in Delhi in an attempt to forge a larger political alliance against the laws.According to Mollah, farm unions unanimously decided to keep their agitation “apolitical” and therefore Chaduni’s move was “not acceptable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-row-key-farm-leader-says-will-not-meet-political-parties-101611015383643.html

Later, he complained of breathlessness and chest pain, alleged his family members, and was admitted to the district hospital where he died on Sunday.On Monday, Moradabad chief medical officer Dr MC Garg denied the family’s allegations and said the post-mortem report found “cardio pulmonary disease” as the cause of the death. “Mahipal Singh died of cardiac arrest; it has nothing to do with the Covid-19 vaccine. The fact came to light in Singh’s post-mortem report,” said Garg.The CMO said on orders of the district magistrate, he visited Singh’s place and met his family members who said he contracted pneumonia a few weeks ago. “While carrying out the post-mortem, we also observed that the size of his heart was enlarged. We found blood clotting in the heart. It clearly shows that he died of heart attack or septicemic shock,” he addedBut his family said Singh’s health deteriorated after getting the vaccine jab on Saturday. “Initially, we thought it is normal ...By the time we reached emergency, my father was dead,” said Vishal Singh, Singh’s son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-day-after-jab-up-man-dies-officials-say-no-link-to-vaccine-101611013916776.html

But we have yet to decide our programme, including the parade ceremony, to celebrate the day on the border,” said a senior Punjab BSF official, requesting anonymity.The joint parade was held on Independence Day last year.Another BSF official said that while they are yet to receive a programme for Republic Day, it is likely that the parade will be held. Celebrations for the Republic Day may be similar to the beating the retreat ceremony which was held in August without any spectators, the official said.Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March last year, only a flag-lowering ceremony is conducted at sunset on the Indian side of the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-spectators-at-wagah-border-on-jan-26-bsf-yet-to-take-call-on-india-pak-parade-101611013478384.html

A woman fighter pilot will also participate in the parade for the first time.The IAF’s solitary Rafale squadron will add more muscle with the arrival of at least three more fighter jets by the end of the month. The delivery of the three jets will take the number of Rafales in IAF’s inventory to 11.The IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, C-130J Super Hercules special operations plane, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission choppers — platforms that have formed part of the force’s role in the Ladakh sector — will also participate in the flypast, the officials said.As many as 42 aircraft will be a part of different formations during the flypast including 15 fighter jets, five transport aircraft, 21 helicopters and a vintage Dakota aircraft, the IAF said in a briefing on its role in the parade. A Rafale aircraft will fly with two Jaguars and two MiG-29 fighter jets in one of the formations at the flypast, which will wrap up with the Rafale carrying out another manoeuvre.The flypast will see a vintage Dakota aircraft fly in formation with two Mi-17 V5 helicopters, marking the 50 years of the liberation of Bangladesh. A Bangladeshi military contingent is also taking part in the parade. An IAF C-17 heavy-lifter last week flew 122 Bangladeshi military personnel from Dhaka for the parade.The participation of the Bangladeshi soldiers in the parade will mark the second time that foreign soldiers will march down Rajpath, as reported by HT on January 3. The Bangladeshi contingent has been invited to take part in the parade at a time when the two countries are celebrating the golden jubilee of the birth of Bangladesh.Foreign soldiers took part in the parade for the first time in 2016 when a French army contingent of 130 soldiers marched down Rajpath (then French President Francois Hollande was the chief guest that year).Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth, one of the first women fighter pilots in IAF, will be a part of the air force’s tableau that will showcase mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30 fighter plane. The LCA model will be armed with India’s first anti-radiation missile Rudram.The parade will be shorter, involve fewer participants and only a fourth of the usual number of spectators will be allowed at Rajpath, with the ceremonial event being curtailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.The shortened route of the parade will see it end at National Stadium instead of Red Fort. Not more than 25,000 spectators will be allowed at Rajpath, compared to at least 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-jets-to-debut-in-republic-day-flypast-101611013037042.html
19-01-2021||India||‘Keep constant watch’: India amid Chinese breach report||New satellite imagery showing a village built by China in a disputed region of Arunachal Pradesh prompted a cautious response from India on Monday, with the government saying it closely monitors all developments affecting national security and acts to safeguard territorial integrity.The Indian government has stepped up construction of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges, in response to China’s “construction work along the border areas”, the external affairs ministry said.China built a village, consisting of 101 structures, in Arunachal Pradesh, about 4.5km “within Indian territory of the de facto border”, NDTV reported while citing satellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US-based imaging company.The village is located on the banks of Tsari Chu river in Upper Subansiri district, an area along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This was the same region where five people were detained for some time by Chinese troops last September.Comparing two images provided by Planet Labs, NDTV reported the village was built sometime in the past 15 months.The first image, from August 26, 2019, didn’t show any construction activity, while the second, from November 1, 2020, depicted the village with dozens of rows of small and medium-sized structures and roads.The external affairs ministry didn’t address the issue of the particular village referred to in the report, but said: “Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”The ministry said in a statement that India had “seen recent reports on China undertaking construction work along the border areas”.It added, “China has undertaken such infrastructure construction activity in the past several years. In response, our government too has stepped up border infrastructure including the construction of roads, bridges etc, which has provided much needed connectivity to the local population along the border.”The government is committed to creating infrastructure along border areas to improve the livelihood of citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh, the statement said.People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the existence of the village but pointed out that control over Upper Subansiri region has been fluid for decades. The particular area where the village is located has been in China’s possession since 1959, when Chinese troops overran an Assam Rifles camp, the people said.Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security analyst for Force Analysis, said the village in question in Arunachal Pradesh appeared to be part of China’s recent construction activity to bolster its territorial claims all along the LAC.Tack said the village appeared to be several kilometres “inside the Indian claim” and noted China has had a “small presence” in this area in the form of a military outpost since about 2000. “So, the Chinese presence is not necessarily new, but what is new is the building of a village to settle people in the area. It would appear China is applying such infrastructure to strengthen its territorial claims,” Tack said. China claims the whole of Arunachal Pradesh as south Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-constant-watch-india-amid-chinese-breach-report-101611009810663.html
19-01-2021||India||‘Will provide 200 million doses to India for first phase’: Gavi deputy CEO||India received 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses over the weekend from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance’s Covax facility created last year to ensure equity access to Covid-19 vaccines across the world, the deputy CEO of Gavi, Anuradha Gupta, told Rhythma Kaul in an interview. Edited excerpts:In emergency situations, low- and middle-income countries tend to lose out to higher income countries in the vaccine race. Did this fear lead to the creation of Covax?The Covax facility was set-up to ensure that there was equitable access to vaccines against Covid-19, and low- and middle-income countries did not actually lose out to higher income countries in the Covid-19 vaccine race. WHO, Gavi, and Cepi came together with the intention to bring together countries regardless of their financial status. The concept of Covax facility has strengthened the concept of global solidarity.How are rich countries contributing to the facility?The important part is that rich countries that are a part of the Covax facility are paying for their vaccines. The Covax facility has two categories —one is self-financing countries and second is those needing support. There are a total of 190 countries, and 92 low- and middle-income countries will be financed by rich countries. On top of it, Gavi is trying to raise $7 billion from rich countries for about one billion vaccine doses, which will be a part of Gavi’s aim to procure two billion doses by end of 2021.What is the arrangement with India?The first tranche of the vaccine supplies has been released for roll out for India, which is about 10 million doses that will take care of India’s initial 30 million vaccination target of front line workers. India is going to vaccinate 300 million high risk population in the first phase, and 200 million doses out of 600 million doses for that will come from Gavi, which is about one-third of its need. The arrangement is 20% of Gavi’s total support will be provided to India, which comes to about 200 million doses. It will cost Gavi about $1.4 billion. Gavi will also provide $30 million for technical assistance...Will Gavi also use vaccines produced in India for distribution?The arrangement with India is different as India contributes to Covax facility because their vaccine manufacturing base is solid and appropriate for use in lower and middle income countries. It suits these countries in terms of cold chain, training of workers etc., and India will give us products that are cost-effective and easy to use. WHO approval to India products is what we are waiting for.What care do countries need to take to ensure gains aren’t wasted?If the countries are not able to prioritise high risk groups properly, then all this effort will go to waste. The aim should be to make maximum use of limited supplies that we have currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-provide-200mn-doses-to-india-for-first-phase-gavi-deputy-ceo-101611009055054.html
19-01-2021||India||‘Infodemic on side effects has created anxiety’: Dr. Randeep Guleria||An infodemic (overabundance of information, some of which is aimed at deliberately pushing false information to erode the credibility of public health responses) and the barrage of social media posts on adverse events after vaccination has resulted in an increase in vaccine hesitancy, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria told Anonna Dutt in an interview. Edited excerptsWhat is the reason for vaccine hesitancy among health care workers?To be honest, early on, health care workers were very keen to get the vaccine. Then, because of the infodemic, because of the things doing the rounds on social media, because of the side effects being highlighted as more than what they were, it created a lot of anxiety — not only among health care workers but also the public at large. And, therefore, a lot of people have had to work on reassuring others that there have been no short cuts (in vaccine trials and approval). The vaccine has come within a year, but that does not mean that there has been a compromise on safety. That (convincing people) is something we are still working on.Some doctors from one of the Delhi hospitals raised concerns about one of the vaccines — Covaxin — being given without completing the trials.We will need as many vaccine shots as we can get because the number of people we need to vaccinate is humongous. We need to get more and more manufacturers on board; we need to get more and more vaccine platforms on board. We may keep arguing about which one is good, but at the end of the day, any vaccine that is safe and provides efficacy will help in saving lives and bringing down mortality.In the second half of this year, we may get new generation of vaccines — vaccines that may need only one shot, vaccines that may be in the form of a nasal spray. Those things are evolving over a period of time. Therefore, currently we should push what we have because it will really help in saving lives, breaking the chain of transmission, getting our economy back on track, allowing schools and colleges to open up, and people to go on holidays.What were the lessons that we learnt from Covid-19?It has been an experience that has told us that we need to be better prepared for the future. We need to have our infrastructure and plans to be in place so that we do not have such a situation in the coming years.This is the final phase of our fight against Covid-19. The past 10 to 14 months have been a roller-coaster ride. Looking back, there is satisfaction that we managed without going into a chaotic situation, with people running out of beds and oxygen that we hear from some other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infodemic-on-side-effects-has-created-anxiety-dr-randeep-guleria-101611008186050.html
19-01-2021||India||SC hints at avoiding cases with concurrent decisions||“Fifty percent of our orders will also be reversed if there were a higher court,” observed the Supreme Court on Monday, suggesting that the top court refrain from intervening in a matter if all subordinate courts concur in their decision.Justice Sanjay K Kaul, heading a three-judge-bench, made this avowal while asserting that there has to be an end to appeals against every order passed by subordinate courts. The bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, was categorical that the Supreme Court should be wary of interference when subordinate courts at all levels have decided in unison about a certain class of dispute.As a matter of principle, said the bench, the apex court should not interfere when there are concurrent findings by all the subordinate courts.“If we (SC) start looking at every matter with extreme minuteness and subjectivity, we will not be able to perform the duty this court is expected to do. There has to be some consistency in the decision-making and if start making exceptions, then there is a problem,” remarked justice Kaul.The judge added that certain definitive principles should be followed by the Supreme Court and that it cannot be called upon to interfere as the fourth court. “This has to end at some point. We always say it, 50 percent of our orders will also be reversed if there were a court above us,” said justice Kaul. The appeal in the present matter had arisen out of a decision by the Delhi high court on December 2 in a case relating to eviction of a tenant. The additional rent controller and the rent control tribunal issued the order of eviction against the petitioner, Arya Kanya Pathshala, from a tenanted premise in Delhi owing to its default in paying for misuse of the property in question. The high court found no fault with this order of eviction.Senior advocate PS Narasimha, appearing for Pathshala, requested the bench to entertain the appeal on humanitarian grounds as the petitioner taught girl students.But the bench said it will not be proper to interfere with the concurrent findings of three courts.“This court has taken a consistent view in the rent and eviction matters, there should be no interference by this court. There are findings by three courts below. Why should we interfere now? If we do it in one case, this will not be good for the consistency,” added the bench.The bench gave the petitioner time till June 30 to vacate the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-of-our-orders-will-be-reversed-by-a-higher-court-sc-cautions-on-appeals-101611002731998.html

19-01-2021||India||Farmers' protest: SC refuses to step in on Republic Day tractor rally||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to “strengthen the hands” of the Centre in stopping a proposed Republic Day tractor rally in Delhi by farmers protesting against three contentious agricultural laws, and asked why the government was seeking its nod on a law-and-order issue.Declining to pass any order on a plea by Delhi Police, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said it was not for the court to remind the authorities of their policing power by passing an order.“Does the Union of India need Supreme Court to tell what powers it has under the Police Act? Why do you want us to tell what powers you have?” the bench asked Attorney General KK Venugopal, who implored the court to issue a prohibitory order on Delhi Police’s application to injunct farmers’ groups from “disrupting” Republic Day celebrations by taking out a tractor rally or any other processions on January 26.Venugopal, who represented the Centre, said it was an extraordinary situation, adding “one word from this court will strengthen the hands of the government”. The bench remained unmoved. “Does the Supreme Court say as to what are the powers of police and how they will exercise them? We are not going to tell you what to do. All that we can tell you is that you can invoke all your powers under the law to maintain law and order. This is your job.”The bench also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran.It further observed: “We cannot come across an instance where first the court issued an order prohibiting (protests) and then the authorities said something. It is always the other way round. We have told you earlier too that we cannot be the first authority to determine this. You have enough power under the Police Act to determine who should or should not be allowed entry, what terms and conditions are to be enforced, and what should be the numbers.”At this, Venugopal said that the government was seeking for an order on this issue since the apex court has taken the charge of the matter. The bench, however, retorted: “No, no. We have not taken charge of this matter at all. We have dealt with only one issue. The intervention of this court has been grossly misunderstood. We have not taken charge of the entire issue except one. And we will hear that issue sometime later.” The AG endeavoured to persuade the court, but it made its position clear: “We are not going to tell you what is your power. Why should we tell you what you should do?” The bench then clarified that it would focus chiefly on the issues relating to farm laws, and adjourned the matter for a hearing on Wednesday before the same combination of judges, who, on January 12, stayed the implementation of the three laws and formed a four-member committee to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government.Apart from the CJI, justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, comprised that bench.The bench asked all lawyers to be present on Wednesday when it may take a call on filling up the vacancy in its panel, created by the recusal by one of the members — farm leader Bhupinder Singh Mann — last week. The committee is left with three members — agricultural economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati, and Anil Ghanwat, president, Shetkari Sanghatana. The members are scheduled to meet for the first time on Tuesday, though farm unions have said they will not negotiate with the committee. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Delhi police, told the court that when the matter is taken up on Wednesday, the Centre would make detailed arguments on the dignity attached to the constitutional ceremony of Republic Day parade. “But what can be a constitutional question about a parade?” shot back the CJI.The unions are planning a rally on January 26 comprising tens of thousands of farmers to push for the repeal of the three laws. The proposed route covers a 60km stretch and passes through Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, covering areas as Peeragarhi, Janakpuri and Munirka. The unions say their march will commence only after the official military parade on Rajpath ends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-sc-refuses-to-step-in-on-r-day-tractor-rally-101611001634211.html
19-01-2021||India||580 adverse events reported in three days of vaccination||India reported 580 adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) out of 381,305 people vaccinated for Covid-19 till Monday, said data from the Union health ministry, translating to just 0.15% — a rate experts said was key to dispelling hesitancy among recipients that was dogging the inoculation programme.In Delhi, 26 AEFI were recorded on Monday out of 3,593 shots administered, a rate of 0.72%. Overall, 133 adverse reactions, which can be caused by allergies or underlying medical conditions and are not necessarily causally linked to vaccines, were reported among 148,266 jabs given on Monday, which marked the third day of the nationwide immunization drive.“So far, cumulative 580 AEFI have been reported, of which seven needed hospitalisation,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, Union health ministry.Two people died since Saturday, Agnani added. One of them, a hospital employee from Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad town, suffered a cardiac arrest and his death wasn’t related to the vaccine, the authorities declared. A post-mortem examination would be conducted late on Monday to ascertain the reason for the other death, of a 43-year-old man from Ballari in Karnataka. Of the seven people hospitalised, three were from Delhi, said Agnani.One was admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, after complaining of uneasiness, and developed rashes within 15 minutes of getting the shot. The second was admitted for uneasiness to the Northern Railways Hospital. Both were discharged on Sunday. A third person, who fainted, is under observation at a private hospital in east Delhi, said Agnani.Adverse events are observed with most vaccines and can range from pain, mild swelling at injection site and body ache to breathlessness and hospitalisation. Experts said AEFIs needed to be evaluated in the context of risk-and-benefits associated with immunization.“Acceptable level of AEFI would ideally be zero, but that is not the case. I think it is around 0.2% and yet we are focusing on that and not the 99.8% benefit,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.In the case of coronavirus vaccines, the government has said that there can be mild AEFIs, such as pain and swelling at the site of injection, mild fever, nausea, giddiness and mild rashes. Serious AEFIs can be a severe allergic reaction, such as an anaphylactic shock, which could potentially require hospitalisation.India is administering two vaccines as part of the first phase of Covid-19 immunisation covering roughly 30 million health care and other frontline workers. The lead candidate is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India and locally known as Covishield, and the second is Bharat Biotech-made Covaxin, which has spurred some controversy because its efficacy data isn’t publicly known.Uttarakhand reported one case of AEFI, and the health care worker is stable and under observation at AIIMS, Rishikesh. He was admitted to the hospital on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/580-adverse-events-reported-in-three-days-of-vaccination-101611000733824.html
19-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive hit by hesitancy hurdle||In the three days since coronavirus vaccinations began in India, roughly 50 people have been given doses per session –half of the 100 on average expected by the government, data released by the Union health ministry showed on Monday, as reports poured in of people being reluctant to come forward to take the jab.The government said that between Saturday morning and 5pm on Monday, 381,305 people were given doses in 7,704 sessions. Some health workers across the country, who are first in line to get doses, either did not turn up for their appointments, or outages in the digital platform to manage their records meant they were not informed.The Union government has advised states to call and administer doses to 100 people on average during each session. According to figures collated by HT from across India, the total number of vaccinations by the end of Monday was 429,409.The turnout dipped from 4,319 on Saturday to 3,593 on Monday (there were no immunisations on Sunday) in the national capital. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, only eight people were vaccinated on Monday, an official said, while asking not to be named.Officials said concerns over the vaccines’ safety appear to have deterred many people.“Initially, health care workers were very keen to get the vaccine. But then because of the infodemic, because of things doing the rounds on social media, because of side effects being highlighted more than what they were, it created a lot of anxiety not only among healthcare workers but also in public at large,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), in an interview to HT on Monday.Hesitancy was reported among some beneficiaries in the run-up to the January 16 launch of the vaccination drive. Groups of doctors said they were apprehensive or would not prefer to get doses of Covaxin, the vaccine made by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.This dose has not yet been tested entirely in Phase 3 trials, and the manufacturers don’t know how effective it is in preventing Covid-19. The other vaccine, Covishield, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India, has proved its efficacy in human trials.Two interns at Delhi’s RML Hospital, who asked not to be identified, said they were aware they could walk in and get the shots on Monday, but expressed concerns over lack of long-term data.In UP, the state government issued a notice to a government hospital in Kanpur where only 40 people were given doses on Saturday. The state is carrying out immunisations only two days a week, Thursday and Friday from this week onwards.The problem, as suggested by Guleria, appears to have been made worse by reports of some adverse reactions. Manohar Aghnani, additional secretary in the Union health ministry, said 580 cases of adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI) were reported in the three days.The Union health ministry has said that most AEFIs have been mild, with symptoms such as pain at injection site, nausea and mild fever. Of the 580 – who represent just 0.15% of those vaccinated – seven required hospitalisations. For of these people were still under admission.Experts said that these numbers were much below the thresholds for anything that should be worrying and that the risks outweigh the benefits of immunisation. “Acceptable level of AEFI would ideally be zero, but that is not the case. I think it is around 0.2% and yet we are focussing on that and not the 99.8% benefit,” said Dr Shahid Jameel, former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.Officials also reported glitches in the Co-WIN mobile application that vaccinators use to create lists of who will be given doses during a particular session and record their status. “The portal is crashing intermittently, leading to delays. It happened on Saturday and today as well,” said Dr Vidyapati Chaudhary, principal of the Patna Medical College Hospital. “We are not getting the names of beneficiaries on time. As a result, we are unable to contact them telephonically. Some beneficiaries have complained that they did not receive any intimation about their vaccination. Sometimes, midway through the exercise, names of beneficiaries also disappear from the portal.”Similar problems were reported in Delhi, where hospitals allowed health care workers at their facilities to walk in for doses. Their details, an official at one of these centres said while asking not to be named, will be uploaded later.The problem was such that Maharashtra suspended the vaccination drive on Saturday after only less than 2,000 people were vaccinated across the state.A Union health ministry official said glitches in the app were being rectified. “Almost 90% glitches have been addressed. Speed has improved. Session creation and planning has been made more flexible. A lot of the “glitches” are also because of varying degrees of IT awareness of vaccinators,” said this person, asking not to be named.Experts believe vaccine hesitancy may be a bigger challenge in accelerating the drive. “Vaccine hesitancy had a major role to play when it came to the low vaccination rate on Saturday. Many people were comparing the two vaccines, many people wanted to wait and see what happens, and others wondered whether they needed it, having recovered from the infection recently. When people were asked to sign the consent forms, that too led to a lot of anxiety,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College.Recipients who were given Covaxin were required to sign consent sheet that is typically given to people participating in clinical trials – technically, the Bharat Biotech vaccine has been approved under “the clinical trial route”, as per the regulators’ decision on January 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-hit-by-hesitancy-hurdle-101611000038997.html
19-01-2021||India||Probe purported chats between Arnab Goswami and Partho Dasgupta: MVA partners||Ruling allies of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have demanded action and probe in the purported chats between Republic TV editor in chief Arnab Gowami and Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) former head Partho Dasgupta.The NCP on Monday demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into the matter whereas Congress demanded an investigation under the Official Secrets Act. Attacking the Centre over the leaked WhatsApp chat, the Shiv Sena said that it was a breach of the country's internal security and demanded action against Goswami.Meanwhile, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh said next course of action will be decided on Tuesday after a meeting with senior officials of the department.“The WhatsApp chat between the duo (Goswami and Dasgupta) has gone viral. They have found to be discussing very sensitive information, be it Balakot or Pulwama. The question is, how Arnab (Goswami) came to know about all this and that too in advance. We are gathering all the information and a meeting is to be held tomorrow (Tuesday) after which the next course is going to be decided,” Deshmukh told reporters.A political storm is brewing over the transcript of a purported WhatsApp conversation between Goswami and Dasgupta over Balakot air strikes and Article 370 revocation, which has led to allegations of collusion and illegal access to highly classified information. It appears that Goswami was privy to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government’s plan to launch an air strike on Pakistan’s Balakot in retaliation against the Pulwama terror attack, three days before the Indian Air Force took action against a terrorist camp on February 26, 2019. The 500-page plus long transcript of a purported WhatsApp conversation went viral after it was submitted by the Mumbai Police before the court as part of its charge sheet in the case of misuse of TV rating point (TRP).“The Mumbai police has recently exposed the chats between Goswami and Dasgupta. It is extremely shocking and disturbing to know how issues related to national security have been used to gain TRP. The question also arises how Arnab (Goswami) was privy to such sensitive information. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has to identify the source and take action immediately. We want the matter to be probed by a joint parliamentary committee (JPC),” said NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase on Monday.He said that Goswami had been at the forefront to malign the image of the Mumbai police and also the MVA government in Maharashtra. In his TV debates, he tried to give a communal angle to the Palghar incident (in which two Hindu monks were lynched over rumors). Sushant Singh Rajput (Bollywood actor) death case was blown out of proportion and a false narrative was set. “All this seems to have been done with the sole intention to destabilise the state MVA government,” he said.He said that the Narendra Modi government and the BJP seem to have gone completely silent on the case. Union home minister Amit Shah should come forward and laud the investigation of the Mumbai police, he insisted.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that the offence is a part of criminal investigation as it is a violation of section 5 of the Official Secrets Act. “Goswami has received highly classified information which he passed onto someone else (Partho Dasgupta). In fact, we don’t know the information passed to how many more people. We need to know who is the mole in the government,” he said.“In one of his chats, Goswami was found boasting on how national security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval was surprised to know that the former knows about the Centre's decision of revoking Article 370 beforehand. All this needs to be investigated,” Sawant commented.Both Sachin Sawant and Mahesh Tapase are also going to meet the state home minister Anil Deshmukh over their demands on Tuesday.Claiming the chats are a threat to national security, Sena leader and party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “I think this is a threat to the country's internal security. Sometimes, such military secrets are not known to top officials. If a jawan is found to possess any such secrets or documents, he is court-martialled. Here, he [Arnab] knew that Balakot [air strike] will happen. This means there is a breach in national security. What action will the country’s home minister and defence minister take on this? This is a matter concerning defence. We ask them, ‘will you court-martial him?’” Raut said to reporters in Mumbai.The Sena also targeted BJP through its mouthpiece 'Saamana' on Monday and said, “If people from the BJP think that sharing of national secrets is not anti-national and acting on such issues is an emergency-like situation, then their definition of nationalism needs to be examined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/probe-purported-chats-between-arnab-goswami-and-partho-dasgupta-mva-partners-101610996057366.html
19-01-2021||India||MVA gains, but BJP may emerge as largest party in Maha panchayat polls||As counting for gram panchayat elections got underway on Monday, partners in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi — Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — won 58% of the 12,711 seats that went to polls on January 15. However, among all parties individually, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the highest number, with the Sena a close second. Results of all seats were not announced till late on Monday and a clear picture is expected by Tuesday morning.Of the 27,782 gram panchayats (village councils) in the state, 14,432 were due for the elections last year. The elections were deferred owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The BJP won about 2,600 gram panchayats, followed by the Sena, which won 2,570 of the 11,800 panchayats whose results were declared late on Monday evening. The NCP and Congress bagged 2,400 and 1,825 panchayats respectively, while local panels and independents won over 2,335 panchayats.A total of 214,880 candidates were in the fray for 125,709 seats. At least 26,718 members in 1,665 panchayats were elected unopposed. Another 162 panchayats in Gadchiroli will go to polls on January 20.Though the village panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, the parties claim the victory on the basis of the local panels formed by the candidates affiliated to them. Some of the panels at the local level claim their affiliations to more than one party. Three ruling parties, however, had announced to fight the elections separately. While the BJP announced its victory, the MVA parties declared that the number of panchayats won by them together was much higher than the BJP.Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said, “The voters voted in favour of the MVA. Ruling parties fought in cooperation and it resulted in the combined victory. The Sena, NCP and Congress and their key leaders retained the village panchayats in their stronghold. We have been working on a Common Minimum Program under the leadership of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.” Environment minister and Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray said the voters have reaffirmed their trust in the MVA government.However, BJP’s Chandrakant Patil said his party would win more than 6,000 panchayats. “We have won 1,907 of the 7,000 panchayats whose results were declared till 6pm...Voters in the state have defeated the ruling parties as they were angry with the government over its failure on handling Covid-19, poor relief to the farmers in distress and at the same time, they had shown faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and development works,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mva-gains-but-bjp-may-emerge-as-largest-party-in-maha-panchayat-polls-101610994916442.html
19-01-2021||India||Govt assesses supply of Covid-19 vaccines to neighbours, developing countries||The government held a meeting with the two Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines to review the issue of supplying doses of vaccines to foreign countries both as grants and through commercial sales, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The government is currently working out modalities to provide millions of doses as assistance to neighbouring and developing countries and to fulfil commercial contracts inked by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covishield and Covaxin.The virtual meeting between the ministries of health and external affairs and the department of pharmaceuticals looked at factors such as domestic requirements, India’s commitment to supply vaccines to Gavi or the Vaccine Alliance for developing countries and supply of vaccines through commercial sales and government-to-government channels, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Thank you, President @ibusolih. Our scientists and health-warriors have risen to the occasion. The vaccines being developed and manufactured in India will help our people as well as humanity at large in escaping from the pandemic. https://t.co/p3iU34Ba0mOfficials have pointed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated assurances that India’s vaccine manufacturing and delivery capacities will be used to benefit the world, and said the country is committed to fulfilling both commercial contracts and helping developing countries and the neighbourhood.On Monday, PM Modi referred to his government’s plans to help the neighbourhood and other regions in replies to tweets from Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Maldives President Ibrahim Solih. The two leaders congratulated India on the rollout of the world’s largest vaccination programme.Also read: Glitches in Co-WIN portal leads to drop in Covid vaccination percentage in Bihar“Thank you, President @GotabayaR.

Solih referred to the landmark programme to vaccinate India’s population and said, “I’m highly confident that you’ll be successful in this endeavour and that we are finally seeing an end to the Covid-19 scourge.”Last week, the external affairs ministry said that a decision on exports will take some more time, though greater clarity on the issue is expected in the near future, the people said. They added that the commerce ministry too will play a key role in the process as it will have to clear exports.Several countries have either signed agreements or are in talks with Serum Institute or Bharat Biotech, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Morocco.The first beneficiaries of grant assistance are expected to be countries in the immediate neighbourhood, including Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Maldives, the people said. Pakistan recently approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, which is being produced by the Serum Institute. Islamabad, however, hasn’t sought any vaccines from India, the people added.The assistance is expected to be supplied through a state-run entity, as was done when India supplied hydroxychloroquine to numerous countries amid the Covid-19 pandemic last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-assesses-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-to-neighbours-developing-countries-101610994831864.html
19-01-2021||India||Travel portals expecting better year; long-weekends likely to provide traction||By Neha LM TripathiWith the mass inoculation against Covid-19 in India and availability of vaccines in other parts of the world, travel portals are looking forward to a healthier 2021 for the industry. Unlike last year, with over six weekends in the year, portals expect travellers to explore new places as they have already seen a surge in enquiries for short rejuvenation trips for 2021.Long weekends around Republic Day, Good Friday, Holi, Janmashtami, Dussehra and Christmas are expected to see significant interest from travellers.It has been noticed that, over years, multiple short breaks to relax, reconnect and rejuvenate have become the order of the day for leisure travellers. People look to pause and unwind at quaint, tranquil properties in the hills of Himachal or Uttarakhand, or at beaches of Goa and Pondicherry – spending more time with their loved ones and make the most of the hotel and in-room amenities.Also read: 'Masterstroke' - Mamata Banerjee brings Nandigram back in focusVipul Prakash, chief operating officer, MakeMyTrip, said, "Bookings on MakeMyTrip indicate that couples, small groups of friends and families with kids have already started searching, planning and booking staycations for long-weekends in 2021 starting with the Republic Day. As travel sentiment revives, we hope to see more takers for long weekend travel in the coming months."Cleartrip said they saw a revival in the last quarter of 2020, catalyzed by seasonal demand and easing restrictions. “In 2021, we expect the large pent up demand to further convert into bookings. The vaccination plans will significantly aid the recovery in travel volumes, and as nations continue their vaccination drives, we may also see international travel restrictions easing. Travel will also be spurred by the number of long weekends this year, evenly spread out across all quarters," said it's spokesperson.According to Yatra.com, the travel and hospitality industry is gearing up with customized services among others to attract more travellers and quick getaways as a trend has increased exponentially in the past few years with a number of travellers across India packing their bags and setting out on journeys.Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO, corporate travel & head industry relations, Yatra.com said, “ In 2021, we can expect this trend to grow further in demand, as travellers plan their travel before or after the weekends. The vaccine announcement is also expected to push this growth furthermore as we foresee people planning their trips judiciously while taking all precautionary measures in terms of health and safety.""For January, at Yatra.com we have witnessed an increase in demand for two upcoming long weekends of Republic Day and Makar Sankranti where travellers enquired about holiday packages as well as alternate accommodation options largely in 4/5 star properties, homestays and villas among others in offbeat locations as people continue to set out for shorter escapes,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/travel-portals-expecting-better-year-long-weekends-likely-to-provide-traction-101610994526748.html
19-01-2021||India||Malicious reporting on SSR case: Bombay HC directs digital media to follow press council rules||The press must exercise restraint when reporting on suicides, and electronic media should follow Press Council of India (PCI) guidelines until a separate framework for television news channels is created, the Bombay high court said on Monday, criticising media coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing public interest litigation filed by eight former Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from Maharashtra, as well as activists, lawyers and non-government organisations (NGOs). The court accepted their contention that certain news channels violated the programme code while reporting on Rajput, who died by suicide on June 14, and their acts were punishable under the Contempt of Court Act. The bench, however, refrained from taking suo-motu (on its own) action against the channels and left it to the authorities.“No report/discussion/debate/interview should be presented by the press/media which could harm the interests of the accused being investigated or a witness in the case or any such person who may be relevant for any investigation, with a view to satiate the thirst of stealing a march over competitors in the field of reporting,” the bench held.The court also said until there is a mechanism to regulate electronic media, TV channels should follow PCI guidelines on reporting on suicides, and sensitive cases. “Media should observe restraint in discussions about an ongoing investigation so as not to prejudice the rights of the accused and witness,” the high court said.Currently, PCI rules are applicable to print media, while electronic media is regulated by the News Broadcasters Association and News Broadcasting Standards Authority under the guidance of the information and broadcasting ministry. The bench said until the rules are framed, channels should refrain from posting photographs of victims and accused and reconstructing the scene of incident as it would violate the rights of individuals.“Media trial leads to interference and obstruction to administration of justice and violates programme code under the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act,” the bench said. “Any reportage has to be in accordance with the norms of journalistic standards and ethics, else media houses stand to face contempt action,” it added.Rajput was found dead in his Mumbai flat on June 14. His death triggered frenzied media coverage that culminated in several central agencies investigating the case and the arrest of his then girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.The bench said media trials ran counter to the programme code framed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, and said the right of freedom of speech should not violate the right of an individual by resorting to malicious reporting. The petitioners suggested that Mumbai Police appoint an officer to act as a link between the media and investigators. The HC accepted it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malicious-reporting-on-ssr-case-hc-directs-digital-media-to-follow-press-council-rules-101610965032465.html
