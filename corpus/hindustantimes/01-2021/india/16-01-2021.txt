Jaishankar responded by saying a simplistic approach could not be adopted in a multipolar world and, equally significantly, a multipolar continent too, according to the people cited above.“Do you have a clear strategy in mind that could be summarised in three sentences?’’ Gandhi was said to have asked Jaishankar. “The Chinese strategy is to move from the maritime to the terrestrial, to change the old Silk Road to a land route linking China to Europe and through the CPEC to the Gulf and bypass the old centrality of India, making us irrelevant. What will India do to counter it?’’To Gandhi’s concern that China was increasingly turning the world bipolar, the minister said: “We cannot write off Russia, and Japan is a rising power too. We will do our best so that the world is multipolar; we should think of a multipolar continent too.’’Jaishankar said the debate with Gandhi could continue endlessly as both had counterpoints.As the Congress MPs defended the successive UPA regimes in the context of foreign policy, the minister said connectivity with neighbours had improved dramatically over the past six years. He said ties with the Gulf countries, for instance, were limited to the Indian community and energy-related transactions during the UPA years but acquired a deeper character under the Modi government, which, among other things, resulted in better treatment of the Indian diaspora during the pandemic.Jaishankar said Rs.4,600 crore was spent annually on the Chinese border till 2016 but the figure was ramped up to Rs.11,800 crore since then. Past neglect of border infrastructure was part of the current problem, he said.On the Congress MPs’ objection that minutes of the meetings of the consultative committee were not being made available by the government, the ministry said the decision to adopt this practice was taken by the then external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in 2008.After the sharp exchanges, the meeting concluded on a cordial note, with Congress MPs Anand Sharma and Shashi Tharoor thanking the external affairs ministry for arranging safe evacuation of Indians stranded abroad during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-jaishankar-spar-at-panel-meet-101610821322013.html

Mumbaiites also inhaled the cleanest air so far this year with Air Quality Index at 162.The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal. This is the second lowest minimum temperature recorded this season following a mercury drop to 16 degrees Celsius on December 22 last year.Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, which was at par with the normal temperature. The IMD attributed this drop in temperature to the cold westerly winds.“There was a nice chill in the air as westerly winds have started blowing over parts of the state. Since, parts of North West India are under the influence of a cold wave, north-westerly winds from these parts are colder. Minimum temperature in the state is expected to see gradual fall in the state in the coming days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Maximum temperatures also remained low compared to the beginning of the week. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 31.2 degrees Celsius, which was just normal. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 29.6 degrees Celsius which was 1.6 degrees below normal.Meanwhile, air quality improved further on Saturday. An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator-- of 162 (moderate), was recorded on Saturday morning. This is better than Friday’s 190.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.“Winds blowing from the north and west have cleared the air of pollutants. If the wind continues, air quality will remain moderate for the next couple of days, despite a drop in temperatures. However, without the winds, air quality may become worse,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 365 (very poor). Andheri was a distant second among the 10 locations with an AQI of 221.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-year-inhales-cleanest-air-101610819273902.html

Bribes worth around ₹55 lakh paid to two officers has already been identified and efforts are being made to ascertain the payments made to two others.As reported by HT, the racket was being run inside the agency since 2018 and there is a possibility that more officers are involved in diluting the CBI cases in lieu of illegal gratifications.The two DSPs -- RK Rishi and RK Sangwan – mainly played the role of bribe facilitators leaking the information to the companies.All four have been questioned by a team led by a Superintendent of Police (SP) rank officer in Anti-Corruption-4 unit of the agency, which has jurisdiction to investigate cases all over India.HT couldn’t locate the four officers for their comments.However, a senior cadre officer in the CBI, who didn’t want to be named, said, “How is it possible that a stenographer, or an Inspector was leaking case information or documents and the concerned SP wasn’t aware of it? Shouldn’t there be a wider probe rather than restricting it to DSPs only?”CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla, who is due to complete his two-year tenure in February first week, didn’t respond to a text query.The scandal has hit the agency at a time when CBI is investigating a large number of bank fraud cases involving huge public funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bribeforrelief-scam-cbi-suspends-2-officers-recommends-action-against-2-more-101610818175595.html

However, one thing Bihar still lacks is industrialisation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when lakhs of migrants returned to the state, we have told them to stay back and work here. We are exploring possibilities and it is heartening to see Bihar’s diaspora taking such a keen interest in contributing to their roots. Bihar awaits industrialisation,” he added.He was addressing the diaspora from Bihar organized by the Bihar-Jharkhand Association of North America in collaboration with the Consulate General of India, New York. Kumar said that such interaction would now be a regular feature to get feedback and provide a platform for knowledge sharing. Non-resident Indian Alok Kumar also extended an invitation to visit New York and address the diaspora there.The CM said that policies have been simplified and they would be further eased to help those wanting to contribute to Bihar’s progress in different ways. “All the requirements in terms of roads, power and infrastructure have been met. There would be time-bound clearance of proposals. Even land allotment policy through Bihar industrial area development authority (BIADA) has been simplified,” he saidChief secretary Deepak Kumar had earlier said that the government would provide nearly 50% subsidy on land cost and there was around 450-acres of land available at 68 locations for the purpose of industries. He also made an offer to the NRIs to explore the possibility of a tie-up with Bihar government’s public sector undertakings to get things done more easily.Former minister and MLC Sanjay Jha, principal secretary to CM, Chanchal Kumar and additional chief secretary Brajesh Mehrotra were among several officials present during the online interaction.Kumar urged the people from Bihar settled in USA, Canada and other parts to visit the stato see and feel the change for themselves. “With people from Bihar feeling the urge from so far away to do something for the state, I am convinced it will happen and the state government will do whatever it takes to make your plans a success. Bihar needs your expertise and passion,” he added.Earlier, a number of NRIs shared their vision and plans for the state in different fields, be it education, tourism, innovation and incubation, agriculture and food processing, sister-city partnerships and cultural exchange programmes and tie-ups through important festivals like Chhath Puja.JD-U national general secretary Sanjay Jha said that Bihar’s march from a state of hopelessness 16 years ago to an aspirational state was something that had generated a lot of interest among the Bihari people settled abroad to give something back to their state. “This is based not on any government publicity, but on their own feedback from their family members and friends and it is refreshing. With all the ground work done in the last 15 years, this is perhaps the take-off stage for Bihar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contribute-to-bihar-s-industrial-growth-cm-nitish-kumar-to-diaspora-101610817038149.html

The Union health ministry said as many as 191,181 people were given the shot during the first day of the vaccination drive across the country. Sanitation worker Manish Kumar became the first recipient of the Covid-19 shot in the country as he was vaccinated at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the presence of Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and other doctors.During the first phase of the vaccination, which started on Saturday, healthcare workers and people who are working at the forefront of the fight will be vaccinated. In the second phase, people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions will be given priority. The vaccines will be available for the general public after the priority list is covered.Priyanka Maitra Karwk, a doctor at Medical College in Kolkata, was among the people who received the first shot of the vaccine. Karwk said that she was feeling "absolutely fine" and urged others to do the same. "I am feeling absolutely fine after receiving the vaccine shot. Will take another dose after 28 days. I would urge people to come up and take the vaccine," PTI quoted as saying.K Senthil, the president of Tamil Nadu's government association of doctors, said, "We saw agony, pain and many deaths due to coronavirus. We have been waiting for the vaccine for the past 10 months and it arrived sooner than we expected. For me, this is both an opportunity and a luck to get the vaccine".The news agency also cited K Jayamma, a health worker in Telangana, as saying that she got herself vaccinated first to "allay apprehensions if any about the vaccination."

However, his blood pressure did go down for a while but "everything is fine now." "They put me under observation for one hour. Now I am feeling normal and everything is fine," he said as per the PTI report."It's our moment of reckoning, I guess, which is very humbling," Delhi nurse Biji Tomy said, according to PTI.Gujarat paediatrician Naveen Thacker hailed the vaccination drive as "beginning of a final war." "As you can see, I have not felt any adverse effect even an hour after getting inoculated," he said.India, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, plans to vaccinate around 300 million people in the first six to eight months of the year. Some 30 million healthcare and other frontline workers are first in line followed by about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.More than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, including more than 151,000 who have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beginning-of-the-final-war-here-is-what-health-workers-said-after-getting-covid-19-shots-101610813653632.html
16-01-2021||India||In Goa, IFFI’s 51st edition begins with hope of ‘being back to normal’ next year||The 51st edition of the International Film Festival of India kicked off in Goa on Saturday and will witness more than 200 films being screened for the 2,000 odd delegates who have registered for the festival that for the first time is being held in a ‘hybrid’ mode in which films, master classes and interactions with film personalities will be streamed via a specially designed OTT platform for delegates to view online along with physical screenings.The festival was thrown open at a simple ceremony in Goa by Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar and Karnataka-based film star Sudeep Sanjeev known just as Sudeep or Kichcha Sudeep who were the chief guests for the opening ceremony.“In January 2020 the disease came to India, but the strength of humankind, the wisdom, will power is such that we now in 2021 have a vaccine that is testament to this. And I can assure you that when 2021 IFFI starts in November later this year it will be just like before with an auditorium full and resounding with applause,” Javadekar said.IFFI that is usually held in the month of November has been postponed to January in view of the restrictions on travel last year and the risks associated with large gatherings.The organisers have assured that all pandemic protocols will be followed according to the MHA guidelines and that the total seating capacity has been reduced to 902 which is less than half the usual capacity.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant welcomed filmmakers and film lovers from across the world to experience Goa while promising a safe experience.“I'm happy to inform you that we are having the event in a hybrid format -- we will have screening in auditoriums and also via online mode. The registration is more than 2000. We assure you that your health and hygiene has been given the utmost importance and we are following all the health protocols for conducting this event,” Sawant said.Billed as Asia’s oldest and India’s biggest festival, IFFI is being held in Goa since 2004. This year the festival will open with the Indian premiere of the movie ‘Another Round’ by Thomas Vinterberg. The movie starring Cannes Best Actor Award winner Mads Mikkelsen is among the star-studded line up of movies being showcased at IFFI. The movie is also Denmark’s official entry for the Oscars.The festival will have a line-up of famous movies with a total of 224 films from across the globe being screened. This includes 21 non-feature films and 26 feature films under the Indian Panorama films section.15 widely acclaimed films are part of its international competition section and will compete for the Golden Peacock Award. Argentine filmmaker Pablo Cesar will head the 51st IFFI’s international jury panel, while other members include filmmakers Prasanna Vithanage (Sri Lanka), Abu Bakr Shawky (Austria), Priyadarshan (India) and Rubaiyat Hossain (Bangladesh).Javadekar promised that there will be private participation too in organising IFFI from the next edition onwards.“There should be participation of the film industry as well as other industries because the responsibility of the government is to promote an atmosphere of art and culture and ensure that it is well publicized but it does not mean that the government itself does everything. So I invite private participation and I'm confident that in the coming 52nd IFFI there will definitely be private participation,” Javadekar said.Javadekar also announced the ‘Indian personality of the year award’ for actor, producer, director and singer in Hindi and Bengali cinema to Bishwajit Chatterjee while the Lifetime Achievement Award went to Vittorio Storaro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-iffi-s-51st-edition-begins-with-hope-of-being-back-to-normal-next-year-101610813450797.html

16-01-2021||India||Court to hear defamation case against Smriti Irani on January 23||An Uttar Pradesh court on Saturday fixed January 23 as the next date of hearing in the case filed by shooter Vartika Singh against Union minister Smriti Irani and two others for allegedly demanding money to make her a member of the central women's commission.The MP-MLA court has summoned Vartika Singh and witnesses Utkarsh Vikram, Ajit Pratap Singh, Krishna Pratap Singh and Kiran Singh for recording their statements.Vartika Singh had filed a case of defamation against and her aides for maligning her image."I do not have any relationship with any political party," Vartika Singh had said earlier.Irani's legal counsel had in earlier hearings described the case as based on "the most bizarre and mischievous set of falsehoods" and that "political patronage" is written large on the matter.Days after she was herself named in a police complaint, the shooter had alleged that people close to the minister issued her a fake letter, appointing her as a member the central women's commission, a possible reference to the National Commission for Women.Vartika Singh had alleged that Vijay Gupta and Rajnish Singh, the two ''aides'' of the Union minister, initially demanded ₹1 crore from her and then brought the amount down to ₹25 lakh.She also alleged that one of the men talked to her in an obscene manner.On November 23, however, Gupta had lodged a complaint against the shooter and another person at Musafirkhana Police Station in Amethi district, accusing them of levelling unfounded charges against him and trying to spoil his image, following which police had lodged an FIR against her.Vartika Singh, however, claimed that the complaint was lodged after she threatened to expose "corruption".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-to-hear-defamation-case-against-smriti-irani-on-january-23-101610809516862.html
16-01-2021||India||Shot in the arm for health staff: From facing harassment to being first to get Covid-19 vaccine||For Biji Tomy, a nurse who received the very first Covid-19 vaccine shot at the LNJP Hospital here on Saturday, it was a "historic moment" that helped her leave behind the unpleasant memories of her colleagues being harassed and taunted as "potential coronavirus carriers" in the early days of the pandemic.Hailing from Kerala, the 48-year-old healthcare worker at the state-run facility told PTI, "When the pandemic outbreak happened in Delhi in March, everyone was afraid and uncertain about the future, and many doctors and nurses had to face harassment and taunts from neighbours in the initial days as 'potential carriers of infection', and some landlords had threatened to evict them.""But, today, we are getting applause and fellow citizens are hailing the healthcare workers," she said, adding, "It is our moment of reckoning, I guess, which is very humbling."Several hundreds of healthcare workers, from doctors to sanitation workers at hospitals, were given shots of Covid-19 vaccine at 81 centres, after the world's largest vaccination drive was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi across the country."We were only trying to do our job when the virus had just invaded our cities, and our country. We were not criminals that they subjected many of our fellow brothers and sisters to humiliation. But, it feels very relieving today. People have understood we were trying to save lives, putting our own lives at risk," said Tomy, who hails from Idukki district in Kerala.Many doctors, nurses, sanitation workers and other frontline staff have lost their lives in Delhi since the first cases of the pandemic was reported here on March 1.The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital, which was soon converted into a dedicated coronavirus facility and where over 10,000 Covid-19 patients have been treated so far, drew praise from both Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain.Nurse Atmaja was administered a dose of Covishield in the presence of Kejriwal who visited the facility in the afternoon and interacted with a few healthcare workers.At the hospital's vaccination centre, beneficiaries were warmly greeted with a rose after administrating a shot and red carpet had been laid outside the main OPD Block of the facility to welcome them.As they exited the vaccination area post 30-minute mandatory observation, their colleagues and staff of the vaccination team cheered and clapped with a sense of solidarity.Among the doctors, who received the shots on the first day of the roll-out was Farah Husain, an anaesthesia specialist and one of the in-charges of the Covid ICU ward."Pride is quite natural, and tremendous happiness, after all the hardships and deaths we have seen last year, as the city and the country fought the pandemic," she said.Asked if the unfair treatment meted out to several healthcare workers by their landlords or taunts made by neighbours in the beginning phase of the pandemic made her feel vindicated today, she said, "No, not at all.""Yes, it was wrong behaviour by them, but today being chosen as the first in line to get the vaccine shots, we feel humbled and it emphasises our sense of purpose, and of the spirit of servitude for humanity which our profession teaches," she said.Husain, who still recalls a large number of patients dying in ICU at the height of the pandemic, hopes the vaccination drive will help create a veil of protection for the rest of the population, by developing "herd immunity" in the vaccinated people.While nurse Tomy was the first person to get the shot at the LNJP Hospital, Central District Programme Officer Puneet Jaitley was the second person to get the shot at the British-era hospital.Naveen Kumar from LNJP Hospital's administration department who also took the jab said he felt a "sense of blessing"."During the peak COVID time, I worked here wearing a PPE kit, and it was very tough. Society would see us a potential carriers of infection, and my own neighbourhood in Burari was a containment zone for some time," he said."We owe our lives to these doctors and nurses, they are the true corona warriors, and we salute them," Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shot-in-the-arm-for-health-staff-from-facing-harassment-to-being-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101610810301416.html
16-01-2021||India||Some states report hurdle in vaccination as CoWIN app develops glitches||In some areas, the Covid-19 vaccination drive hit a hurdle on the first day after the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) application, developed by the Centre to monitor and track the inoculation process, developed glitches, leading to uploading data of the vaccinated persons manually.Around 3,00,000 frontline workers were expected to get vaccinated on the first day but only 1,65,714 people got vaccinated, according to an interim health ministry report. This was because of the glitches on the CoWIN app and more than usual time was taken to administer the vaccine at some of the districts centres, officials said.In West Bengal, problems were faced by health workers uploading data on the app about beneficiaries receiving the vaccine across the state as the app slowed down and could not be operated.“There were some technical glitches and the app had slowed since Friday. Not all messages were going to health workers who were supposed to receive the vaccine on Saturday morning. The persons concerned were individually called up and informed over phone,” said a senior official of the state health department.Also read: In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priorityOn Saturday morning too when the vaccination drive took off at 204 centres across the state problems were encountered with the app.“The data of the beneficiaries who received the vaccine were supposed to be uploaded. But it was taking a lot of time as the app was working too slowly. Rest everything went fine,” said a doctor from Kandi sub-divisional hospital in Murshidabad district, around 200 kilometres north of Kolkata. Similar, reports were received from some other districts in the state.In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarkhand, similar glitches were reported from some districts.“The server was slowed down leading to difficulties in uploading the data at many centres in our division. We have now directed the vaccination teams to register the details offline and then upload it subsequently,” said Dr PD Gandal, deputy director, health services, Nashik Division.Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department said the server had slowed down owing to which the messages could not be sent out. “The issue was resolved by 2 am after which the messages were sent to the beneficiaries,” he said.In Uttarkhand, Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, nodal officer of state's extended programme for immunization (nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination), said some technical glitches were reported from some districts as the app had slowed down.“Our technical team is looking into this,” he said. He added that in some places, volunteers reported reaction to the dose, including a health worker at AIIMS, Rishikesh, who reported a burning sensation. Another a person in Haridwar district got unconscious for a minute after the vaccination. “We are investigating the causes,” said Martoliya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-report-hurdle-in-vaccination-as-cowin-app-develops-glitches-101610810101231.html
16-01-2021||India||Launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive marks high point of efforts by SII, Bharat Biotech||With a reputation as the 'pharmacy of the world', India's inoculation drive, dubbed the world's largest and most ambitious, has been anchored on two home-grown vaccine makers who took a huge gamble once the pandemic began to unfold, overhauling assembly line and sacrificing some of the existing products in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.In early May last year, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, received a tiny 1-millilitre vial from Oxford, England, containing the cellular material for the vaccine, which kicked off the work on mass production of the vaccine.As the pandemic began to unfold, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla gambled to strike deals to secure coronavirus vaccine licenses.SII overhauled assembly lines to crank out 5,000 doses of vaccine per minute, even before the clinical trials ended.It had already produced around 40 million doses before the phase-III results of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, named Covishield, were known.A little later, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech started work on a 'desi' or 'Made-in-India' vaccine, Covaxin.As the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the world and India, all eyes were on the country's vaccine manufacturers for large-scale production and supply of coronavirus vaccines as it contributes around 60 per cent of the global vaccine production.More than 1 crore cases and around 1.5 lakh fatalities later, India took its first steps out of the pandemic with shots of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines being administered at medical centres across the country.The journey of the two vaccines started in 2020. In April, SII announced its partnership with Oxford University for Covid-19 vaccine."We have partnered with the Oxford University vaccine project as one of the seven global institutions manufacturing the vaccine," Poonawalla had said in a statement.He said SII had undertaken the decision to initiate manufacturing of vaccine at its own risk.The decision was solely taken to have a jump-start on manufacturing, to have enough doses available, if the clinical trials proved successful.The company also started clinical trials of the vaccine in India and in August said that the phase-III trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were underway.However, the trials hit a roadblock in September, with the company receiving a show-cause notice from the central drug regulator for not informing it about AstraZeneca pausing clinical trials of the Oxford vaccine candidate for COVID-19 in other countries.The company was, however, given permission to resume clinical trials in September itself.In November, AstraZeneca announced that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate was 70 per cent effective on average.During the month, SII also said that it was in the process of applying for an emergency use licensure for AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India in the next two weeks.There were challenges too, with a participant in the clinical trials alleging serious side effects due to the vaccine, a charge that was firmly rejected by the company.The other vaccine maker, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has developed Covaxin indigenously in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The company had received permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting the phase-I and II clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine.In October last year, it applied to the DCGI for conducting phase-III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial of its COVID-19 vaccine.The company was in spotlight in December, when Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij tested positive for coronavirus, days after participating in the trial of Covaxin. He had participated in a trial on November 20, 2020.At that time, Bharat Biotech had said its vaccine was safe and efficacious and had pointed out that Covaxin was based on a two-dose schedule and its efficacy was to be determined 14 days post the second dosage.Similarly, the company had also said that the death of a volunteer in Bhopal, who took a shot of Covaxin as part of the phase-III clinical trials, was not related to the medication.Bharat Biotech has also inked a pact with Precisa Medicamentos, a Brazilian company, to supply the Covid-19 vaccine candidate to the Latin American country.The long wait for regulatory approval finally came to an end for both vaccine manufacturers on January 3, with India's drug regulator approving Covishield and Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive innoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/launch-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-marks-high-point-of-efforts-by-sii-bharat-biotech-101610809745183.html

16-01-2021||India||Bird flu in poultry confirmed in 9 districts of Maharashtra; culling operation on in MP, Chhattisgarh||The Centre on Saturday said bird flu in poultry has been confirmed in nine districts of Maharashtra, while culling operation in poultry is underway in one district each in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Apart from poultry, the viral disease has been confirmed in crow in Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, while in pigeon, brown fish owl and Heron in Delhi.However, the central government requested state governments to "rethink" their decisions to impose ban sale of poultry products and allow sale of poultry items sourced from the non-infected areas/states.In India, bird flu or avian influenza is spread mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months from between September and March. The disease is zoonotic.Releasing latest update on bird flu situation, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said bird flu cases have been confirmed in poultry in Latur, Parbhani, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Raigad districts of Maharashtra till Saturday.Unusual mortality of poultry has been found in a farm as per the report received from the Mumbai-based Central Poultry Development Organisation. The samples have been sent to the designated laboratory for testing, it said.Besides, bird flu in crow has been confirmed in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh, in Surat, Navsari and Narmada districts of Gujarat as well as in Dehradun district of Uttarakhand and Kanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.Additionally in Delhi, Pigeon and brown fish owl in Najafgarh and Heron in Rohini have tested positive for avian influenza, the statement said.On culling operation in poultry, the ministry said it is underway in epicentres of Balod district, Chhattisgarh.Further in Madhya Pradesh also rapid response teams have been deployed. Culling operation of poultry is underway in the epicentre of Harda district, it added.According to the ministry, the central teams formed for monitoring the situation in the affected areas of the country are visiting the affected sites and conducting epistemological studies.On poultry sale and consumption, the ministry asked states to rethink their decisions to impose a ban on sale of poultry and poultry products and allow selling of poultry and poultry products sourced from the non-infected areas/states."It is reiterated that consumption of well cooked chicken and eggs is safe for humans. Consumers should not heed to baseless rumours that are unscientific and often lead to confusion," it said.These adversely affect poultry and egg markets and thereby poultry and maize farmers, who are already affected by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, it noted.Following the central government's advisories, states are undertaking awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements and social media platforms.Also, continued efforts to generate awareness about bird flu and how to deal with the situation are being shared among the general public through various media platforms, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook handles, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-in-poultry-confirmed-in-9-districts-of-maharashtra-culling-operation-on-in-mp-chhattisgarh-101610809141513.html
16-01-2021||India||Never said no to dialogue with govt but do not have much hope: Farm union leader||All India Kisan Sabha leader Hannan Mollah on Saturday said that farmers protesting against three farm laws have never said no to dialogue but did not have much hope as the intention of the government is "anti-farmer"."If the government wants to engage in further dialogue, we will go. But, we don't have much hope. The intention of the government is anti-farmer, negative and there is a mindset to cater to the corporates. Our issue will not be settled by amendments. We are against the objectives of the laws," he said.Mollah said protesting farmers have decided to hold "kisan parade" on January 26 to highlight their issues including demand for repeal for three farm laws and they were holding their protest in a peaceful manner.He took exception to use of term "tractor rally" for their proposed programme on Republic Day and said it should be called "kisan parade"."The farmer unions had declared almost a month-and-a-half ago that if our grievances are not addressed properly, we would take out a kisan parade after the National Parade on the Republic Day. It would be an appeal to people to pay heed to our issues," he said."There is no question of struggle. We have been protesting for two months now and not a single instance of violence has happened and this is proof that we want a peaceful parade. There is a conspiracy to malign the farmers by calling it a struggle," he added.Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi supporting the protest by farmers, he said it is an opinion of a political party."We have never invited any political party to our protests neither have we let a political leader represent us. Farmers are the only leaders of this protest against the farm laws," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting on borders of Delhi against three farm laws and have held nine rounds of talks with the government so far. The next round of talks is scheduled for January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-no-to-dialogue-with-govt-but-do-not-have-much-hope-farm-union-leader-101610809041574.html

An official of the health ministry said no one hospitalised after being given the Covid-19 vaccine.There were 16,755 personnel involved in the vaccination drive across India at 3,351 sessions held across the country with both the vaccines during the drive, the official said. Covishield, the Oxford University-AstraZenexa shot being manufactured by Serum Institute of India, was supplied to all states and Union territories and Bharat Biotech's Covasin was sent to 12 states, he added.Also read | ‘Day of tremendous relief’, says Harsh VardhanThere was a delay in uploading beneficiary list at some session sites and healthcare workers not scheduled for the first day were vaccinated but resolutions were provided for both the issues, the official said.A worker at Delhi's premier All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Manish Kumar, was the first person in India to be vaccinated against Covid-19, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched one of the world's largest immunisation campaigns to bring the pandemic under control.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog's VK Paul were also given the shots in the presence of Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.Also read | More people will turn up to get vaccinated, says defence minister Rajnath SinghAfter the vaccination of some 30 million healthcare and frontline workers, about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions will be given the shot during the country's vaccination drive.More than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, the highest number of infections after the United States, and more than 152,000 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-was-successful-on-day-1-says-union-health-ministry-101610807880788.html
16-01-2021||India||Microbiologist says Covid-19 vaccines made after in-depth study, research||Vaccines are always made with a lot of effort, and Indian Covid-19 vaccines have been made after plenty of study and research, said Dr Nandini Duggal, Head of Microbiology at Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital after taking the Covid-19 vaccine shot on Saturday.Dispelling the misinformation surrounding the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine, Dr Duggal told ANI, "There are certain tolerable reactions (cough and little pain) that people are bound to face. And they are well informed in advance."Speaking about her experience of getting vaccinated, she said, "I felt no pain. It is unlike any other vaccine. For half an hour I was kept under observation. It took barely 10 minutes. First, the verification was done. Then all other procedures were explained to us."Talking about his experience after getting vaccinated, Nitin Choudhary, Assistant Professor (Department of Anesthesia) at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences, said, "Once you come here, they briefly tell you about the vaccination process. Thereafter, they give your consent to tell you what little you might face after the vaccines. Then the vaccine is administered.""I think everybody is a little apprehensive but looking at all those studies done on the vaccination and the information that has been provided to us, it seems pretty safe," he said."Obviously, whenever anything new comes up, there is a bit of anxiety. But since we have been frontline without the vaccine then why not with the vaccine," the Assistant Professor said adding that he is 99 per cent confident.Earlier today, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Singh Guleria along with NITI Aayog member VK Paul were administered the Covid-19 vaccine shot at AIIMS Delhi on the inaugural day of the nationwide roll-out of vaccination.Termed as the world's largest vaccination programme, covering the entire length and breadth of India, the drive aims to first vaccinate millions of its healthcare and frontline workers and then reach an estimated 3 crore people by the end of its first phase.In the first phase, government and private-sector health care workers, including Integrated Child Development Services workers, will receive the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/microbiologist-says-covid-19-vaccines-made-after-in-depth-study-research-101610807535849.html
16-01-2021||India||In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priority||The government is engaged in a complex exercise to meet foreign requirements for Covid-19 vaccines, with the initial focus on the immediate neighbourhood, though a decision on exports could take some weeks, people familiar with developments said on Saturday.As India rolls out the world’s largest Coronavirus vaccination programme that envisages covering 300 million people by July, authorities are closely tracking domestic requirements and production and delivery schedules of the two Indian vaccine manufacturers, and working out the right mix of grants and commercial sales for foreign countries, the people said on condition of anonymity.As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, there is considerable pressure on India, especially from neighbours and developing countries, to supply vaccines. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali, who was in India to co-chair a meeting of the bilateral joint commission, sought “early provision” of vaccines and was assured his country’s needs, will be a “priority consideration”.“Obviously, the priority will be the neighbourhood. A lot depends on the production and delivery capacity of the vaccine manufacturers,” said one of the people cited above.“In case of adequate capacity to meet the immediate needs of the country and neighbours, the possibility of deliveries to developing countries in other regions isn’t ruled out. We also have to work out what portion will be given as grants and what will be commercial sales,” the person added.Several countries, such as Bangladesh, have signed agreements with the Serum Institute of India for millions of doses. The people said in view of these factors, a decision on exports is expected to take a few weeks.The people brushed aside reports that India had set aside 20 million doses for its neighbours. “The figures are all up in the air. These things are still being worked out,” the person cited above said.Even within the neighbourhood, the need of some countries, such as Nepal, is pressing as they have no domestic manufacturing capabilities. Gyawali told reporters on Saturday that Nepal has framed four major criteria to determine purchases – the effectiveness of the vaccine, compatibility with Nepal’s cold storage chains, cost effectiveness, and how promptly the doses can be delivered.However, the rush to acquire Indian vaccines resulted in an embarrassing situation for the Brazilian government. Brazil’s foreign ministry announced on January 13 that an Airbus A330 aircraft was being sent to Mumbai to transport two million doses “purchased” from the Serum Institute.After the external affairs ministry announced on Thursday that decisions on exports will take more time, Brazil’s communications minister Fabio Faria tweeted on Saturday that the “mission [to Mumbai] was rescheduled due to diplomatic issues between Brazil and India and should take place in the coming days”.Besides overseas needs, India also has to meet its commitment to Gavi or the global Vaccine Alliance and its WHO-backed COVAX scheme, which aims to help 92 low and middle-income countries secure access to vaccines in 2021. Gavi has secured a commitment for 200 million does from the Serum Institute with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The people noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s commitment to help the world while launching the country’s vaccination programme on Saturday.“Today, when we have made our vaccine, the world is looking at India with hope. As our immunisation campaign progresses, many countries of the world will benefit from our experience. India's vaccines and our production capacity will benefit the whole of humanity – this is our commitment,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bid-to-meet-vaccine-needs-of-other-nations-india-s-neighbours-to-be-priority-101610804917977.html

Vardhan said a small section is spreading rumours about the vaccines, their utility and safety but a large number of people, including eminent doctors, received the shot with great joy and enthusiasm.“A debate has started that why are health ministers or people's representatives not taking the vaccine. I was asked why I am not taking the vaccine? I told them that I will wait for my turn, which will come when people above 50 years of age will be administered the vaccine,” Vardhan said.He was referring to the second stage of the immunisation drive, in which those above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with a high risk of infection, will be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease.The health minister's remark comes after a war of words between him and Congress leader Manish Tewari on Twitter. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?" Tewari had asked earlier.Following this, the health minister tweeted photos of health workers being administered the jab and accused the Congress leader and his party of being passionate about spreading distrust and rumours.Shortly after the Union health minister’s post, Tewari replied. “Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined. It is not fear Mongering.Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism. Expected better of you Sir,” he tweeted.He was referring to the death of at least 23 people shortly after receiving their first dose of a vaccine in Norway. Of them, 13 have been autopsied, with the results suggesting that common side effects may have contributed to severe reactions in frail, elderly people, Norwegian Medicines Agency was quoted as saying by news agency Bloomberg.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Covid-19 immunisation drive on Saturday. Two shots manufactured in India, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by Bharat Biotech, are being administered during the drive. Nearly 30 million health and frontline workers will be inoculated in the first phase. As many as 191,181 people received the shot on the first day, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ill-wait-for-my-turn-harsh-vardhan-s-comeback-on-why-he-is-not-taking-vaccine-101610805227726.html

So were many other doctors and nurses."As you can see, I have not felt any adverse effect even an hour after getting inoculated. I am blessed to be the first recipient...The vaccine is totally safe, effective, and we can defeat coronavirus only when all of us get vaccinated," Dr Thacker said."This is the beginningof a final war," he said, adding that misleading rumours have always dogged vaccines when they appeared two centuries ago, but one should not fall prey to them.Nurse Jalpa Gandhi has been on what she calls "Covid- 19 duty" from March 22, 2020, when the first coronavirus patient in the state was admitted to the civil hospital."I wore PPE kits when attending to patients, but there was always this apprehension that I might get infected and would end up infecting my family members. This caused me a lot of anxiety."I feel relieved after vaccination," she said.A majority of around 50 nurses who were given the vaccine shot on the first day at the civil hospital were working in Covid-19 wards, she said.Infection specialist Dr Atul Patel, another member of the state's task force on Covid-19, said feeling apprehension is normal as the vaccine on coronavirus is new, but there is no reason to worry."We know that side effects among almost half of beneficiaries (during trials) are very mild, like body pain and headache. Nearly 30 per cent may even get a fever. A fifth of the beneficiaries may even get joint and abdominal pain."But these side-effects are very mild and we should not worry too much about them as they can be easily resolved," Dr Patel said."It is the most safe and secure vaccine, which has passed through several trials and experiments," said Dr Ketan Desai, a former president of the Medical Council of India who was also among the first to get inoculated here.Of 100 health workers who were administered Covid-19 vaccine at the civil hospital, nearly half were doctors, including critical care specialist Dr Maharshi Desai, public health expert Dr Dileep Mavalankar, immunology expert Dr Sapan Pandya, and many doctors attached to the hospital itself.Medical Superintendent of the civil hospital Dr J V Modi was also vaccinated.Over 16,000 healthcare workers are set to be vaccinated on the first day across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-is-completely-safe-says-doctor-who-got-first-jab-in-gujarat-101610800019725.html

We never compare our relations with each other and we never accept interference in our domestic politics or internal affairs,” he told a group of reporters at the Nepalese embassy.“We are able to settle our problems ourselves. As a close neighbour, there may be some concerns or questions but we never accept interference,” he said, replying to a question about China’s efforts to resolve differences between factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Also read: AIIMS worker, 34, is first in India to get Covid-19 vaccineGyawali skirted a question about remarks by NCP leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had split the ruling party and dissolved Parliament on the “direction of India”, and said he also represented Prachanda and it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to comment.He defended Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives and call early elections by saying this was the outcome of long-standing “internal problems”.Gyawali added, “In a parliamentary system, if the prime minister feels the time has come to seek a fresh mandate, it is the universally accepted practice that the government can dissolve Parliament and seek a fresh mandate. By and large, democracy is a system where the public has the final authority to decide the fate of the government and the country.”Nepal was plunged into political uncertainty by Oli's decision to dissolve Parliament after problems within the NCP increased over the past few months. Amid the turmoil, China sent Guo Yezhou, the vice minister of the international department of the Communist Party of China, to Nepal to broker an understanding between the two factions of the NCP.Guo’s visit was preceded by the Chinese ambassador’s unsuccessful efforts for a patch-up between Oli and Prachanda. Guo’s efforts too didn’t yield any result.Against the backdrop of the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India has kept a wary eye on China’s role in Nepal while maintaining a hands-off approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-never-allow-interference-in-domestic-politics-foreign-minister-gyawali-101610797475903.html

After taking the dose, I asked my mother to tell my wife that I am safe," he said, according to news agency PTI.When asked to share his experience after getting the vaccine shot, Kumar said, "I am having no issues like itching or anything. It is a big step for the country. Those who are having apprehensions after reading WhatsApp messages about these vaccines should not fear. After getting the shot, I am feeling better now."The drugs regulatory body of India has currently approved two vaccines to be used in the country.

Tewari once again raised doubts about the efficacy of Covaxin, the indigenously developed vaccine still in the third phase of trial. His remarks drew a sharp response from the health minister as he shared photos of frontline workers receiving the shot and accused the MP and the Congress party of being passionate about spreading distrust and rumours.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here“Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined. It is not fear Mongering.Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism. Expected better of you Sir,” Tewari tweeted in response to Vardhan’s post on Twitter.He was referring to the death of at least 23 people shortly after receiving their first dose of the vaccine in Norway. According to the Norwegian Medicines Agency quoted by news agency Bloomberg, 13 have been autopsied, with the results suggesting that common side effects may have contributed to severe reactions in frail, elderly people.Dear Dr @drharshvardhan Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined. It is not fear Mongering.Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism.

This goes against the entire doctrine of informed consent," he told news agency ANI. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Tewari has been a constant critic of the government’s restricted emergency use approval to Covaxin, which has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the inoculation drive on Saturday. In the first phase, nearly 30 million health and frontline workers will be vaccinated and the second group is of people over the age of 50 years, and the third will be of people under 50 with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney diseases, etc. The central government will bear the expenses on the drive in the first phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-health-minister-s-counter-to-vaccine-criticism-congress-says-concerns-are-real-not-imagined-101610794440010.html
16-01-2021||India||Demand to set new protocols, SOPs for vaccinated travellers||As Covid-19 vaccine roll out began on Saturday with inoculation of healthcare workers in the first phase, the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) appealed to the Central government to urgently set up new travel protocols for those getting vaccinated against Covid-19.In an appeal made by the national office bearers of TAAI on Saturday, Jyoti Mayal, President TAAI, said they have urged ministries of civil aviation and tourism to set guidelines for vaccinated travellers, issue verifiable certificates and set relevant standard operating procedures.The TAAI is the largest and oldest travel and tourism association in India.TAAI said that setting up of SOPs will enable vaccinated travellers to resume their activities to pre-Covid times."Every person vaccinated in India must be granted a certificate and our government should also tie-up with all countries verifying and accepting their Covid vaccine certificates,” Mayal said.TAAI said that many countries have started the process of vaccination and inoculated travellers are willing to travel to India. However, as of now, there is no clarity in terms of how their entry will be permitted. TAAI urged for a uniform policy for setting up the verification process for travel by vaccinated fliers.TAAI suggested that vaccinated people should be certified with the date of their vaccination mentioned and the requirement for a negative RT-PCR test result or quarantine for such passengers should be waived off. Besides, travel insurance should be taken by all travellers coming to India.TAAI suggested that a verifiable confirmation of vaccination, in the form of a certificate, should be issued to every vaccinated citizen and it could be linked to the Aadhar card.Currently travellers from New Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat need to carry a negative RT-PCR test result to be allowed entry into Maharashtra.The association further argued for mandatory health/travel insurance for travellers, which is covered under mediclaim / corporate medical cover policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-to-set-new-protocols-sops-for-vaccinated-travellers-101610794364782.html

16-01-2021||India||Petitions in SC seeking direction for contempt of court proceedings against RBI Governor, others||A number of petitions had been filed before the Supreme Court seeking its direction for initiation of contempt of court proceedings and punishing Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, and others for allegedly and willfully violating the apex court's order/directions of September 3, 2020.The top court had passed the order on the loan moratorium case in September last year and said those accounts that have not been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) as on August 31, 2020, cannot be declared as such until further notice.The petitioners -- Gorakh Pandurang Nawade, Suryakant Prabhakar Pawar, Pritam Sengupta, and Shanti Jewellers -- had filed their respective pleas through lawyer, Vishal Tiwari and Advocate-on-Record (AoR) Abhigya Kushwah, before the Supreme Court in connection with loan moratorium case.The petitioners claimed that the respondent, RBI, and others, allegedly had declared the account of the petitioners as NPA and thus flouted the stay order of the Apex Court of September 3, 2020, and thereby RBI committed contempt of court, and the Supreme Court should initiate the contempt of court proceedings against the RBI.Tiwari told that the apex court's order was flouted by many banks and borrowers suffered a lot.The petitioners also sought a direction from the top court that the contemnors should compensate for the damage caused to the petitioners by their contemptuous act, the petition stated.They also sought a direction from the Supreme Court that the respondents should grant a grace period of 90 days to the petitioner before declaring its account, NPA, the petition claimed.The respondents are duty-bound to promulgate the orders of this apex court throughout the country but they deliberately did not do it. The September 3 order was operational on all lending institutions and banks throughout the country and was passed in the favour of all borrowers' accounts to grant relief from financial stress during Covid-19, the petitioners claimed.The contemptuous act of the respondents has not only disobeyed the court's order but has also caused severe irreparable damage and loss to the petitioners (firm), the petitioners claimed.The contemptuous act of the respondents has shaken the confidence of the public and has degraded the trust of the borrowers. In this pandemic, where all borrowers are passing through the worst scenario that this stay order was operational throughout the nation and was in the public interest, the petitions stated.The stay order was operating as the life-saving drug to the petitioner but the contemptuous act of the respondent has brought a major setback to the firm and its survival has become critical, the petitioners claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petitions-in-sc-seeking-direction-for-contempt-of-court-proceedings-against-rbi-governor-others-101610791071804.html

Two shots manufactured in India, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by Bharat Biotech, are being administered during the drive."Many eminent doctors have raised questions with regard to the efficacy and safety of Covaxin with the government saying that people will not be able to choose as to which vaccine they would like to take. This goes against the entire doctrine of informed consent," Tewari said according to news agency ANI.The member of Parliament from Anandpur Sahib also questioned the reason behind government functionaries not taking the Covid-19 vaccine. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” Tewari asked.This is not the first time the opposition has questioned the Centre over the Covid-19 vaccine. A day after the government said that a recipient cannot choose the Covid-19 vaccine they want to be administered with, Tewari had raised doubts over the efficacy of the indigenously-developed Covaxin.“Covaxin was licensed by the government for emergency use. Now the government is saying that the recipient won't be able to pick and choose the vaccine which he's administered to. When phase 3 trials of Covaxin are not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari had told news agency ANI.As the Prime Minister launched the vaccination drive, he emphasised that “only when our scientists were assured of the power of vaccine, they gave permission for emergency use”, asking people not to pay heed to speculations about the efficacy of the shots. “We have credibility. We have earned this credibility from our track record. India produces 60% of vaccines given to children in the world. Our vaccines are made in tried and tested methods. They will give defining victory in the war against Covid,” PM Modi said in his address to the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-vaccine-is-reliable-why-no-govt-functionary-took-the-shot-congress-manish-tewari-101610786757328.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the program with a speech addressing more than 3,000 centers across India, where the first shots were to be given.“These vaccines will help India win the battle against the virus,” Modi said, adding that Indians should get the shots and not pay heed to any anti-vaccine propaganda.The inoculation campaign across the world’s second-most populous country will showcase whether Covid-19 can be swiftly tamed in nations with disjointed health and transportation networks. Here are the key numbers from India's vaccination drive:30 million First in line to receive the vaccine dose are some 30 million health and other frontline workers, such as those in sanitation and security. This will be followed by about 270 million people who fall in this high-risk category because they are older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.On the first day, around 300,000 people were set to be vaccinated at 3,000 centers. About 150,000 staff in 700 districts have been trained to administer jabs and keep records.The government aims to manage the entire process digitally with its own app, CoWIN, which will link every vaccine dose to its recipient.11 million, 5.5 million The government has already bought 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVISHIELD shot, produced by the Serum Institute of India, and 5.5 million of Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN.72 per centCOVISHIELD is 72% effective, according to the Indian drug regulator, while Bharat Biotech says COVAXIN's last-stage trial results are expected by March.45,000 fridges, 1 bikeTo inoculate millions, India has prepared by coming up with four "mega depots" to take delivery of the vaccines and transport them to state distribution hubs in temperature-controlled vans, keeping the doses colder than 8 degrees Celsius (46.4 Fahrenheit).A total of 29,000 cold-chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers, and 300 solar fridges are at the ready.These will be needed once the Indian summer arrives in the coming months.Three secondsGuarding the vaccine vials, the government has come up with high-security measures with armed police guarding every truck.CCTVs are in place at warehouses with entry subject to fingerprint authentication, news agency AFP reported. Automated data loggers will monitor storage temperature and transfer messages every three seconds to a central unit, AFP reported"Security measures are essential to not only address the issue of logistics and safety but also build confidence in people that the supply chain is intact, unbroken, and safe to the point of delivery," Preeti Kumar, a public health specialist told AFP.  ₹200 per doseIndia logged another feat on Saturday becoming one of the nations to provide the vaccine at a cheaper rate in the initial trial. An initial 11 million doses of Covishield, AstraZeneca's vaccine made by India's Serum Institute, at 200 rupees ($2.74) each, and 5.5 million doses of Covaxin at 206 rupees each.Serum plans later to sell the jab privately to Indian individuals and firms for 1,000 rupees ($14), raising fears that the rich will get inoculated sooner.70 DaysAuthorities say people will be given two doses of one of the vaccines -- and not one of each -- 28 days apart.

There were problems with this project, to be implemented between Maharashtra and Gujarat, that still remain unsolved," the minister said.The industry should mount pressure on the Maharashtra government for this, he added.The association has launched Atmanirbhar Innovation Challenge 20-21 to promote startup ideas and bring them into reality, MAGIC director Ritesh Mishra said.This year, the challenge has received around 210 idea entries from 17 states.CMIA president Kamlesh Dhoot, Secretary Shivprasad Jaju, MAGIC director Prasad Kokil, and Ashish Garde were also present on this occasion.

The ruling TMC said that it was an error, which has been rectified.Chakraborty, a TMC MLA from Alipurduar in north Bengal, holds a PhD degree. His name was the first in the list of health care workers who were to receive the vaccine at Alipurduar district hospital.“There must have been a communication gap on the part of the district health department as I hold a PhD degree and I am also the chairman of Rogi Kalyan Samiti (patient welfare committee) in the district hospital. The moment I came to know that my name figured in the list of health workers, I contacted the district chief medical officer of health (CMOH) and refused to take the vaccine. I am at Alipurduar district hospital overseeing the vaccination programme,” said Chakraborty.But the BJP took potshots at the TMC.“The MLA must have tried to hoodwink people by getting the first vaccine as he holds a doctorate degree and is not a doctor. As the news became public, the ruling TMC and Chakraborty in particular have been ridiculed by common people,” said Ganga Prasad Sharma, BJP Alipurduar district committee president.The chief medical officer for health of Alipurduar, Girish Chandra Bera, could not be contacted.“The MLA’s name figured in the list as the chairman of Rogi Kalyan Samiti and as he also writes his name as Dr Chakraborty. The health department should have cross-checked,” said a doctor of the hospital, who didn’t wish to be named.The TMC leadership downplayed the incident, saying that it was an error that was being blown out of proportion.“To err is human. As if the BJP leaders do not make any mistakes and are always right. The matter has ended because Chakraborty has himself dropped his name. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has strictly directed that only health workers should get the vaccine,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson and minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-after-tmc-mla-s-name-crops-up-in-list-of-covid-vaccine-recipients-101610783165479.html

When the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gave emergency-use authorisation to Covaxin, it was allowed in "clinical trial mode" where the consent of the beneficiaries is must before vaccination.'Defining victory in war against virus': PM Modi launches Covid-19 vaccine drive"In case of any adverse events or serious adverse events, you will be provided medically recognized standard of care in government-designated and authorised centres or hospitals," the form said. If there is any serious adverse event which can be proved to be causally related to the vaccine, then Bharat Biotech will compensate, it says. "The vaccine has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies against Covid-19. However, the clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials. Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to Covid-19 need not be followed," it said.The vaccinator too will have to give a declaration that he or she has reviewed the details of side effects with the vaccine recipient. The vaccinator will also have to confirm that the recipient was allowed to ask questions about the vaccination.The recipient will be asked nine questions, which are included in the consent form:1. Are you feeling sick today?2. Have you had a Covid-19 test in the last 14 days or been told by a healthcare provider to isolate or quarantine at home?3. Have you been treated with antibody therapy in the past 90 days. Details if yes.4. Have you ever had a serious allergic reaction?5. Have you had any vaccines in the past 28 days? Details if yes6. Are you pregnant or considering becoming pregnant?7. Are you a nursing mother?8. Are you on any medication for a long-standing disease?9. Are you taking radiotherapy?The Centre earlier instructed states to not vaccinate pregnant or lactating women or people below 18 years of age.

16-01-2021||India||In Photos: India begins its Covid-19 vaccination drive||India launched one of the world’s largest coronavirus vaccination drives on Saturday, setting in motion a complex deployment plan aimed at stemming the wide spread of infections across a nation of more than 1.3 billion people.At hospitals and vaccination centers across major Indian cities -- from Mumbai to New Delhi -- tens of thousands of key frontline workers began queuing, some to receive the first vaccines while others to administer them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the program with a speech addressing more than 3,000 centers across India where the first shots were to be given.“These vaccines will help India win the battle against the virus,” Modi said, adding that Indians should get the shots and not pay heed to any anti-vaccine propaganda.In a hospital in Mumbai, health workers chanted the name of the Hindu god Ganesha, believed to bless new beginnings, as they moved vials from cold storage to the vaccination sites. Many health workers and hospital staff shortlisted to be inoculated on the first day of the campaign said they were relieved to be on the list.The inoculation campaign across the world’s second-most populous country will showcase whether Covid-19 can be swiftly tamed in nations with disjointed health and transportation networks. Officially, more than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the disease that has also killed at least 150,000 in the country.India has granted emergency licenses to the two-dose vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Serum Institute of India Ltd. The latter partnered with AstraZeneca Plc to make at least one billion doses of their shot. New Delhi already made its first purchase of 11 million Astra shots, as well as 5.5 million vials of Covaxin, the indigenous inoculation produced by Bharat Biotech.Plans drawn up by India’s health ministry outline steps to vaccinate 300 million people in the first stage through August.In an initial round, 30 million health care and front line workers -- such as the police and defense forces -- will receive injections. The second phase is targeted at about 270 million people above the age of 50 and those at particular risk to Covid. The process will draw on existing networks used to vaccinate tens of millions of babies each year against diseases such as polio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-photos-india-begins-its-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101610778099096.html

16-01-2021||India||Punjab CM writes to PM Modi to provide free vaccine to poor of state||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking free vaccine delivery to the poor population of the state.Punjab will kickstart the process of vaccination of 1.74 lakh health workers with 40,000 to be covered every day over the next five days in the first phase.The Chief Minister, while acknowledging the receipt of 2,04,500 doses of Covishield vaccine, thanked the PM Modi for making the vaccine available on priority to the Health Care Workers (HCWs) of the State and Central Government in Punjab.At the same time, he earnestly requested him to consider providing free vaccine to the poor population with a view to lessen the disease burden and also ensuring a check on the further spread of transmission thereby allowing more economic activity.Referring to reports citing some central government sources that apart from the HCWs and Front Line Workers (FLWs), the remaining population may not be provided free vaccine, Captain Amarinder pointed out in his letter that "the people of the State have gone through a very difficult time due to Covid-19 wherein economic activities have nosedived and the economy has still not recovered from this shock.""It would be difficult for the poorer sections of society to pay for the vaccination," he said."All steps are in place to ensure vaccination of HCWs on priority, with FLWs to follow in the next phase. The State has adequate capacity for storing as well as transportation of the vaccine," he wrote.He further added that a sufficient number of vaccination sites have been identified and all logistics tied up. An adequate number of vaccinators have been identified, and trained and sufficient number of teams have been mobilised and trained to manage the vaccination sessions.Pointing out that "the Covid-19 pandemic has been an unparalleled disaster in living memory, and heavy expenditure had to be incurred in our coronavirus response," the Chief Minister further wrote that his government had already requested the Centre that the accumulated balances with the state in the State Disaster Relief Fund may be permitted to be used as necessary for Covid-19 response. "The MHA may kindly approve this to allow pending payments to be cleared," he urged the PM.An official spokesperson meanwhile said that Captain Amarinder will go live on Saturday morning to initiate the process of vaccinating the health workers in the state as part of the nationwide launch of the vaccination programme, shortly after the PM launches it for the country.The Chief Minister will kickstart Punjab's vaccination drive from Mohali at 11.30 am, with a total of 59 vaccination sites to be functional in the first phase. Since a specific number of vaccination doses have been received so far for the health care workers whose details were shared by the state government with the Centre, he himself will now take the vaccine in the next phase, said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-to-provide-free-vaccine-to-poor-of-state-101610779672109.html

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories will conduct phase II and III trials, they added.“This is an important milestone in the progress of this pivotal clinical trial of the vaccine. We expect to commence the phase III study within this month and will continue to fast-track our efforts to bring in a safe and efficacious vaccine for the Indian population,” said GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.The phase III study will involve 1,500 subjects as part of the randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in India.Earlier, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed the safety data from the phase II clinical trial of the vaccine and recommended the phase III recruitment.In its report, the Board concluded that no safety concerns were identified and the study met the primary endpoints of safety.In September, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund to conduct the clinical trials of the vaccine and distribute its rights in India.Sputnik V has been developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. It became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the established human adenoviral vector platform.The vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed at 91.4% based on data analysis of the final control point of clinical trials in Russia.Currently, the vaccine’s clinical trials are underway in the UAE, Egypt, Venezuela, and Belarus. It has been registered in Algeria, Argentina, Belarus, Bolivia, and Serbia for inoculation.The vaccine's data was submitted to DCGI last week. It was examined by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s subject expert committee. On January 13, the committee recommended that phase III trials of Sputnik V can continue based on the submitted data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russian-sputnik-vaccine-gets-phase-3-trials-approval-in-india-101610779138187.html
16-01-2021||India||'Defining victory in war against virus': PM Modi launches Covid-19 vaccine drive||Indian vaccines made through “tried and tested methods” will deliver defining victory in the war against Covid, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, launching the world’s biggest vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease.An estimated 300,000 health care workers across 3,006 vaccination sites will be inoculated on Saturday, setting the tone for immunizing 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase. The first shot was administered in AIIMS, Delhi.Prime Minister Modi emphasised that “only when our scientists are assured of the power of vaccine, they gave permission for emergency use”, asking people not to pay heed to speculations about the efficacy of the shots.“We have credibility. We have earned this credibility from our track record. India produces 60% of vaccines given to children in the world. Our vaccines are made in tried and tested methods. They will give defining victory in the war against covid,” the PM said in his address to the nation.He hailed "atmabiswas and atmanirbharta (self-confidence and self-reliance)" as the engines of India’s vaccination drive. He said: “Indian vaccines are cheaper than foreign vaccines. There are some foreign vaccines with each dose costing ₹5,000, and also require a minus 70 degree Celsius temperature for storage.”The PM described the vaccine allotment formula as humanitarian and, in an emotional tone, described how in the difficult days in the war against Covid, several health care and frontline workers sacrificed their lives.“As we think about those days, we become sad. But in those days of crisis, there were people who put their lives in danger to save us. Our doctors, nurses, paramedic, ambulance drivers, police, Asha, and other frontline workers. They gave priority to their duties. Many of them stayed away from their families, didn’t go home. There are many friends who will never return home. They sacrificed their lives to save us,” Modi said.“India’s vaccination programme is based on humanitarian principles. Our doctors, nurses, medical and para medical staff are eligible to get a vaccine before others,” he added.The PM reminded the beneficiaries to get the second dose of vaccines and described how trials and dry runs were conducted with the help of state governments for a successful launch.“Two doses of the Corona vaccine is absolutely essential. Don’t make the mistake of not taking the second dose. Two weeks after the second dose, you will develop power to combat Corona. The way you remained patient during the war with Covid, you must show the same patience in the vaccination,” he said.He pointed out that over 100 countries have a population of less than 30 million, while India is vaccinating 30 million people in the first stage alone.“That’s why India’s vaccination programme is so big. That’s why the vaccination drive will underline India’s strength,” Modi added.The PM also defended all the measures to tackle Covid and emphasised that the government took the right decisions in right time. He narrated the long journey of forming a committee on January 17, becoming the first country to screen passengers at airports, and how his idea of janta curfew “mentally prepared the country for lockdown.”He admitted that the federal lockdown was a difficult task and said, “We knew it was difficult to keep such a large population inside home. We knew what will be the impact on economy. But we treaded on 'jaan hai to jahan hai' formula.”He also took digs at Pakistan that did little to expatriate its people from China. “We kept examples before the world. When some countries left their citizens in China, India expatriated its own people and also those of other countries. The world recognised the mettle of India. We showed how, states and the Centre can work together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defining-victory-in-war-against-virus-pm-modi-launches-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101610778095384.html

16-01-2021||India||I&B ministry starts work on self-regulation law for OTT platforms, online news||In a move aimed at providing a level-playing field in the media, the Narendra Modi government has decided to bring in an overarching statute that will provide for self-regulation in digital media including Over-the-top (OTT) platforms and news websites to address issues of sensitive video content and fake news, people familiar with the matter said. There are at least 40 OTT platforms including multinationals like Netflix, Amazon Prime and HotStar and hundreds of news content websites.The issue of self-regulation in digital media was taken up at the highest levels this month. Subsequently, the ministry of information and broadcasting decided to frame an overarching statute under which the digital media can self-regulate itself, a senior government official said.“Like the print media has the Press Council of India, films have the Central Board of Film Certification and TV channels are broadly regulated under The Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, the digital media which has been unregulated till now, will soon have an overarching regulation for redressal of complaints on content,” the official said.The market size of OTT platforms in India is close to ₹1,000 crore with around 20 crore users. Some of the OTT platforms are accessed through annual subscription fees, while a large number of them are free in a bid to attract subscribers.A second government official said the I&B ministry was conscious that the proposed legal regime should not curtail the freedom enjoyed by the sector and has been engaging with the Internet and Mobile Association of India for more than a year on self-regulation. The association is representing the interests of the OTT platforms.It is, however, felt that the self-regulating mechanism proposed by the association is tilted too heavily in favour of the OTT platforms. The other issue that the I&B ministry is trying to rectify is that while there is a mechanism to redress grievances involving the print and cable media, there is no such platform available for the digital media.The I&B ministry has been receiving complaints from the public over the adult content and language shown in OTT platforms that sometimes borders on soft porn. There have also been complaints against single-shop digital news websites for creating discontent in society by indulging in fake news without any redressal or retraction.The government is also examining the Australian model where multinational tech platforms such as Google and Facebook have been asked to pay for local news content. However, tech platforms like YouTube have explained to the government that they or other platforms only upload content from parties with which they have an agreement or are subscribers of the platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ib-ministry-works-on-self-regulation-law-for-ott-platforms-and-digital-media-101610774195596.html

Many other institutions have opted for a hybrid model of online and in-person teaching.Razdan said she got in touch with Harvard because of the anomalies, which she said she had initially dismissed as a manifestation of the “new normal” caused by the pandemic.Razdan said she provided Harvard some of the “correspondence” she had been sent in relation to the employment offer. “After hearing from the University, I have now learnt that I have been a victim of a sophisticated and coordinated phishing attack,” she wrote in her statement on the issue.Phishing is a cyber-crime in which fraudsters pose as someone trustworthy to lure victims into sharing personal information.Razdan said in her statement she has lodged a complaint with the police and requested “immediate steps to identify, apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of this abominable attack”.Razdan’s statement was not clear which Harvard school or faculty made her the purported offer. The Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences does not have a department of journalism. In fact, the university does not have a professional school of journalism.It is understood that names referenced as members of human resources in the documents shared by Razdan were not found on Harvard’s employee rolls and a number of irregularities are understood to have been found by Harvard in the agreement document, which would have formalized the purported employment offer.For one, Harvard faculty appointments are not graded as might have been the case in Razdan’s documents, shared with the university.Two, many of the provisions in the agreement do not apply to Harvard faculty members. It could not be immediately ascertained what those provisions were.Third, and lastly, two of the claimed signatories of the agreement are believed to have indicated that they did not execute the attached agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nidhi-razdan-phishing-attack-harvard-doesn-t-have-journalism-department-101610774388925.html

A total of 3,006 session sites across all states and union territories have been virtually connected during the launch of the vaccine.Billed as the world's largest vaccination program, covering the entire length and breadth of the country, the drive aims to first inoculate millions of its healthcare and frontline workers and reach an estimated 3 crore people by the end of its first phase.Around 100 beneficiaries will be vaccinated at each session site on the inaugural day, the union health ministry has said.In the first phase government and private sector health care workers, including Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers, will receive the vaccine.The drive will be held daily from 9 am to 5 pm, except on the days earmarked for routine immunisation programmes.In the next phases of the vaccination drive, people aged over 50, and those who are below 50 years but have serious health conditions or co-morbidities will be vaccinated, according to the health ministry.Dry-runs at vaccination centres across the country have been held with lakhs of healthcare staff across districts being trained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-make-mistake-of-taking-off-mask-after-getting-1st-dose-of-vaccine-pm-modi-101610773678446.html
16-01-2021||India||'People should stay away from rumours, propaganda,' PM Modi at vaccine launch||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the biggest vaccination drive of the world and congratulated India and its scientists on the achievement. "It takes years to prepare vaccines. But in the shortest span of time, we have not only one but two India-made vaccines," PM Modi said heaping praises on scientists."There are 100 countries which do not have a population of 3 crore but India in the first phase will inoculate 3 crore healthcare workers. In the next step, we will take this number to 30 crore. There are only three countries in the world with more than 30 crore population: India, the US and China. Hence, this is going to be the biggest vaccination drive," PM Modi said.Allaying fears regarding made-in-India vaccines, PM Modi said India enjoys scientific credibility in the world. "Around 60% children of the world get vaccines that are manufactured in India. The world puts trust in India's vaccine science and research."India begins the world’s #LargestVaccineDrive. This is a day of pride, a celebration of the prowess of our scientists and hardwork of our medical fraternity, nursing staff, police personnel and sanitation workers.May everyone be healthy and free from illness. pic.twitter.com/AEpMMEAyzRIn his speech, PM Modi talked about the affordability and the user-friendly nature of Indian vaccines. "Some foreign-made vaccines need to be stored at minus 70-degree Celsius temperature. One dose of some vaccines costs over ₹5,000. Compared to that, Indian vaccines are cheaper and are also easy to use," PM Modi said. It may be noted Pfizer vaccine, which also applied for emergency use authorisation in India, requires minus 70-degree Celsius for long-term preservation.PM Modi also cautioned beneficiaries against lowering their guards after getting the vaccine shot. "Remember, these vaccines comprise two shots. And taking both the shots is necessary. It will also take some time after the second shot to show some effects. So, don't be impatient," PM Modi said.It was an honour for me to join our courageous Corona Warriors at AIIMS, Delhi on this momentous occasion.As a fitting tribute to their selfless service, our healthcare workers & frontline workers will be the 1st to be inoculated #COVID19 vaccine. pic.twitter.com/HCRCVEy7sXWhy India chose healthcare workers as the first beneficiaries? "The country owes this to our healthcare workers, their tireless efforts throughout the pandemic," PM Modi said.Elaborating on how India was prepared at every stage of the pandemic, PM Modi said, "The first case in India was detected on January 30, 2020. But an expert group was formed before that. Then Janta curfew prepared us for the lockdown that was to come. It was not an easy decision to make sure that this huge population remains where they were.""There are certain areas in the country which did not lose one single person to Covid-19," PM Modi said commenting on the present Covid-19 situation of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-vaccine-drive-watch-live-vaccine-india-news-developments-101610772751327.html

Delhi's air quality index this morning is 441, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida also recorded 'severe' air quality which negatively impacts even the healthy.This is mainly due to low wind speed not allowing dispersal of pollutants in the air. Due to dry north/north westerly winds, minimum temperatures are likely to fall by 2-4 degree Celsius over most parts of northwest India during the next two days, according to the India Meteorological Department.Dense to very dense fog at isolated pockets are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar during the next 3 days.Cold wave or 'severe’ cold wave conditions are also very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and east Madhya Pradesh during the next two days. Cold day conditions at isolated pockets are also very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during the next two-three days, as per the weather department.According to IMD, a cold day or a severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees C and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degree C below normal, respectively.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains.A cyclonic circulation is lying over southwest Bay of Bengal off Tamil Nadu coast in mid tropospheric levels and a trough runs over central parts of south Arabian Sea and adjoining equatorial Indian Ocean to the Comorin area.The condition is likely to result in scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala, Mahe and Lakshadweep area during the next two days and a reduction in rainfall activities thereafter, as per IMD bulletin.Conditions are becoming favourable for the cessation of northeast monsoon rains over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala and Mahe and adjoining areas of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema and interiors of south Karnataka around January 19, IMD's Friday bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-ncr-air-in-severe-category-temperatures-to-dip-in-northwest-india-101610766346143.html
16-01-2021||India||Rapid blood test to identify patients at highest risk of severe Covid-19||Scientists have developed a rapid blood test that can predict within a day of hospitalisation which patients with Covid-19 are at the highest risk of severe complications or death, an advance that may help identify those who may best benefit from specific investigational treatments.The test, described in the journal JCI Insight, measures levels of mitochondrial DNA -- a unique type of genetic material that normally resides inside the energy factories of cells.According to the researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine at St. Louis in the US, mitochondrial DNA spilling out of cells and into the bloodstream indicates that a type of violent cell death is taking place in the body."Doctors need better tools to evaluate the status of Covid-19 patients as early as possible because many of the treatments are in short supply, and we know that some patients will get better without intensive treatments," said study co-author Andrew E. Gelman."We need to understand why some patients, irrespective of their ages or underlying health in some cases, go into this hyperinflammatory death spiral. Our study suggests that tissue damage may be one cause of this spiral, since the mitochondrial DNA that is released is itself an inflammatory molecule," Gelman added.Viruses are known to cause a type of tissue damage called necrosis that is a violent, inflammatory response to the infection, the researchers said, adding that this may lead to cells breaking open and releasing their contents including mitochondrial DNA."In Covid-19 patients, there has been anecdotal evidence of this type of cell and tissue damage in the lung, heart and kidney. We think it's possible that measures of mitochondrial DNA in the blood may be an early sign of this type of cell death in vital organs," Gelman explained.The scientists believe the new test could help predict disease severity and also act as a tool to better design clinical trials -- identifying patients who might benefit from specific investigational treatments."We will need larger trials to verify what we found in this study, but if we could determine in the first 24 hours of admission whether a patient is likely to need dialysis or intubation or medication to keep their blood pressure from dropping too low," said Hrishikesh S. Kulkarni, another co-author of the research.In the study, the researchers assessed 97 patients with Covid-19, measuring their mitochondrial DNA levels on the first day of their hospital stays.They found that mitochondrial DNA levels were much higher in patients who eventually were admitted to the ICU, intubated or died.According to the study, this association held independently of a patient's age, sex and underlying health conditions.It noted that mitochondrial DNA levels were about tenfold higher in patients with Covid-19 who developed severe lung dysfunction or eventually died.Those with elevated levels were almost six times more likely to be intubated, three times more likely to be admitted to the ICU and almost twice as likely to die compared with those with lower levels, the scientists said.They said the test could also predict outcomes as well as, or better than, existing markers of inflammation currently measured in patients hospitalised with Covid-19.According to the scientists, the test is quick to perform, returning results in less than an hour, and uses the same machinery that processes the standard PCR test for Covid-19.They said the method allows mitochondrial DNA levels to be quantified directly from patient blood samples without requiring intermediate steps to extract the DNA from the blood.The researchers hope to verify that the test is accurate in a larger multi-center trial before applying for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-blood-test-to-identify-patients-at-highest-risk-of-severe-covid19-101610764975487.html
16-01-2021||India||Covid-19: Nationwide vaccination drive to start today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday launch the world’s biggest Covid vaccination programme in India, covering 300,000 recipients across 3,006 sites in the country on the opening day, according to the official schedule drawn up by the government.In several parts of the country, eminent persons and doctors will be among the first to take a jab, apart from nurses, sanitation and anganwadi workers, driving home the message that the vaccine is safe.Modi is expected to address the nation and interact with some of the beneficiaries in various states. According to officials across India, video conferencing arrangements have been made for the interaction and a webcast of the PM’s address would be done at almost all vaccination centres in the country.Each centre will deploy vaccines from a single manufacturer to avoid mixing of doses in recipients, which is not permitted, said officials involved in the delivery programme that will be launched at 10.30am.“If you consider a vaccination booth as a single unit then that unit will get vaccine supplies of a single Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer only. It will be either Covaxin or Covisheld so that there is no mixing of vaccines. As per the current plan, both the doses given to an individual will be from the same manufacturer. This will be to avoid any confusion,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.States have been given a free hand to increase the number of session sites, if needed, as a single site cannot administer the vaccine to more than 100 beneficiaries in a day. District administrators can create additional session sites at any location by entering the pin code, followed by specifying the locality or village, and subsequently assigning a vaccinator.“We have to engage with people at many levels as part of the confidence building drive with regard to the Covid-19 vaccines. The objective is to assure them about their safety concerns in a scientific manner, put a rest to all unscientific fears and build confidence among large sections of people,” said Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev.On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to the people to stay alert against “misinformation” on the vaccine and focus on scientific expertise behind its making.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan reviewed preparedness for the vaccination drive on Friday and also visited the ministry’s Covid control room to have a look at last-minute arrangements.The main purpose of the review was to check the working of the CoWIN app, the digital platform that is the backbone of the delivery management system. The app will facilitate real-time information of vaccine stocks, storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries, besides assisting programme managers across national, state, and district levels. It will help track beneficiary coverage, dropouts, sessions planned versus those held and vaccine utilisation by volume.“The platform enables national and state administrators to view and sort data of beneficiaries as per their gender, age and co-morbidity. They can also view the metadata of vaccinations and adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) reported from constituent districts across states and Union territories,” the health ministry said in a statement.The ministry started the control room in April last year to monitor and analyse district-wise Covid-19 data from across the country and to interpret and evaluate the status of the pandemic.In Delhi, 8,100 recipients will get the vaccine at 81 centres across the Capital. All health and sanitation workers getting the vaccine have been registered on CoWIN and each vaccination is expected to take 10-15 minutes.Vaccines reached the states by Thursday, and have been kept in refrigerated rooms. Each beneficiary will receive a text message about the time of their vaccination to prevent rush at the centres. States have formed committees having a cardiologist and neurologist to monitor cases of adverse effects of the vaccine, if any.In Tamil Nadu, Dr K Vinay Kumar, joint director (immunisation), directorate of public health and preventive medicine, said the vaccine will be administered on intramuscular parts such as in the arm, leg or back. Tamil Nadu has identified 10 prominent personalities in the medical field to take the vaccine to allay fears, state health minister C Vijayabhaskar said.Dr Arun Sharma, 53, medical superintendent of the government super-specialty hospital in Jammu, would be among the first receivers. “I eagerly look forward to get the first jab on Saturday,” Sharma said.In Assam, Dr Umesh Chandra Sarma, retired vice-chancellor, Srimanta Sankardeva University of Health Sciences, who would receive the first vaccine, said he was not apprehensive as he was a specialist in preventive medicine.“I would request all to get vaccinated without any fear or apprehension so that we are able to defeat Covid-19,” he said. The Assam health department has invited 12 eminent persons to get the first doses of the vaccine including Sharma and Dr Dhrubajyoti Borah, former president of Assam Sahitya Sabha, the state’s biggest literary body, said health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Principal, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, Dr Sudheer Bhandari will be the first person in Rajasthan to be vaccinated with Covishield. “I have no inhibition in taking the vaccine as it is scientific and like any other flu shot. I am very comfortable,” he said. PK Kundu, former head of the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata, who would be the first to take the vaccine shot in Kolkata, said, “My family members, especially my wife, were a bit wary as I am going to take the vaccine in the first lot. But, there is nothing to worry about.”In Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will inaugurate the vaccination drive at Mohali. Among the first to receive the shots will be health workers and safai karamcharis (sanitation staff).

All vaccine sites have three marked areas for waiting, vaccination and observation. After one gets the jab, it has been advised to not leave the site immediately as the effects of the shot, if any, will be monitored. In all these areas, where the presence of more than one person is possible, Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, including the wearing of masks and social distancing, is to be followed.Though India has been carrying out large-scale vaccination drives for decades, since this is going to be the world's largest vaccination against the deadly Covid-19, precautionary measures are being taken.Sanitation workers, Padma awardee doctor, MP: List of 1st vaccine beneficiariesThe Centre has already specified age, medical, physical conditions which are not suitable for vaccination.Vaccinators and officials have also been trained on how to respond if there is any AEFI (adverse event following immunisation).Click here for live updates of Covid-19 vaccination driveAs the ministry has listed, Covishield, the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India, can lead to tenderness and pain at the part of the body injected with the vaccine, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia, chills and arthralgia, nausea.Paracetamol may be used to provide symptomatic relief from post-vaccination adverse reactions.Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech, may lead to injection site pain, headache, fatigue, fever, body ache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting, dizziness-giddiness, tremor, sweating, cold, cough and injection site swelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rest-for-at-least-half-an-hour-centre-s-guideline-ahead-of-vaccination-day-1-101610765113706.html
16-01-2021||India||Number Theory: How much does an average Indian earn?||India’s per capita annual income in 2019-20 was ₹1,26,968, according to provisional estimates published on January 7. This average, given India’s large income inequality, is not representative of the earnings of average Indians. Because India does not publish income statistics, and because consumption estimates, which are the next best proxy, have not been published since 2011-12, there is a debate around average incomes of Indians across class and social groups.To be sure, private surveys such as the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) have published income statistics. However, they do not enjoy the sanctity of official data. The report on the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), which was undertaken under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in 2017-18, is the first to given an idea about average incomes of Indians.To be sure, LASI is based on a relatively small sample (42,249 households), and its reference frame is confined to households which had at least one person aged 45 years or higher.Also, unit level data for LASI is yet to be released. These caveats notwithstanding, the results offer some interesting insights.2. Even the top 20% earn less than a lakh per yearThe LASI report gives a quintile-wise (bottom to top 20%) distribution on income statistics. It shows that even the top 20% of households earn less than .1 lakh per annum per capita. The bottom 20% of households earn just ₹25,825 per year per capita.LASI also gives quintile-wise per capita incomes for different professions. It shows that intra-class income inequality is the largest among non-agricultural businesses and the self-employed, while it is the smallest among those employed in agriculture. This is a trend which holds for caste-wise and rural-urban inequality as well.3. The rich seem to be gaining more from govt subsidies6% of India’s central budget was spent on subsidies according to the 2020-21 Budget. There has always been a debate on whether or not they benefit those at the bottom of the pyramid. The LASI report has tried to answer this question by estimating per capita income from government/-public transfers. This has been defined as income received from a list of 13 kinds of government transfers such as agricultural subsidies or subsidies on LPG cylinders. The statistics present an interesting challenge for the government. India does well when it comes to social and spatial targeting of subsidies, but the rich still end up gaining more from them. Households living in villages or belonging to Scheduled Tribes (STs), Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) report higher per capita incomes from subsidies than the ones living in cities or not belonging to these social groups. Despite this, top 20% of households get ₹1.43 of government support for every rupee which goes to the poorest households from such spending.4. Most Indians are a content lot, but it could be a result of economic ghettoisationEven at such low income levels, almost half of Indians think of themselves as being at par with their peers. What is even more surprising is the fact that this feeling hardly changes whether one looks at the poorest or the richest households. To be sure, these statistics could be a reflection of an entrenched economic ghettoisation in India. This is because respondents were asked to choose options on how they perceived their financial condition compared to other households in the same geographic community. On average, perceived destitution (financial condition being well below average) is 3.4 times more widespread than perceived opulence (financial condition being well above average) in India. This divide is greater in rural areas compared to urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-much-does-an-average-indian-earn-101610760612856.html

We are not afraid of going to jail. No matter how many times we put into the jail, the government cannot stop us," Hooda said.Speaking to media persons, Hooda said that that stopping the march towards the Raj Bhawan shows the dictatorship of the government. "They want to suppress the farmers and those who come in support of them," alleged Hooda.The Congress leader also demanded the special Assembly session and said that being public representatives we should raise the voice of the country's farmers."We tried to meet Governor and demand for the special Assembly session to raise our voice for the farmers.

16-01-2021||India||‘We are not in the game of greed for power’: Kumari Selja||Haryana Congress president, Kumari Selja said on Friday that she sincerely hopes that Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) MLAs and Independents supporting the Manohar Lal Khattar regime in Haryana would vote against the government in the state assembly. In an interview, the former Union minister said that many of these MLAs have openly opposed the three farm laws and people hope they will support the no confidence motion in the assembly. ExcerptsQ: What’s your reading of the farmers versus government standoff over the farm laws?Ans: The government has led the farmers up the garden path. While the patience of the farmers is laudable and they have maintained peace, the Central government has refused to understand their pain and pay heed to their demands. The government has decided to go ahead with the three farm laws and this will only lead to cartelization. These laws only favour big business houses and not the farming community.Q: Assuming you were to take a decision to resolve the standoff and pacify protesting farmers, what would’ve been your action plan?A: My action plan would have been to repeal the three laws. The Congress would have never enacted such anti-farmer legislation. We listen to the people first and give them what they want. The decisions taken by the BJP-led NDA government always work to the advantage of the big business houses. In fact, their actions are autocratic rather than democratic.Q: A number of JJP MLAs and Independents supporting the state government have spoken against the three farm laws. Do you think they would vote against the state government in case there’s a trust vote in the assembly?Ans: We would urge upon them to listen to their conscience and the woes of the farmers. I hope they would vote against the government in the assembly.Q: Does the Congress see any hope of forming the government with the support of disgruntled MLAs?Ans: We are not in the game of greed for power. But there can never be a vacuum in the political space. However, whatever happens has to happen in tune with the Constitution. Whenever a situation arises, the Congress will act as per the Constitution.Q: Who is the bigger loser in the entire episode – the BJP or the JJP?Ans: Unfortunately, kisan and mazdoor have been the biggest losers during the BJP-JJP rule. This is an opportunistic alliance formed merely to grab power. The JJP contested assembly elections against the BJP but in their hunger for power, the two came together. People will hold them accountable. They are already facing opposition from the public across the state. People will extract political price from them during the elections. Any government that does not have its ears to the ground and is insensitive to the people’s concerns will face consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-not-in-the-game-of-greed-for-power-kumari-selja-101610762819896.html

She was later given the impression that this was delayed, and that classes would begin in January 2021.“Along with this, I noticed a number of administrative anomalies,” she wrote in her statement posted on Twitter. “At first, I had dismissed these anomalies as part of being reflective of the new normal being dictated by the pandemic, but recently the representations being made to me were of an even more disquieting nature.”After that, she said, without giving a timeline, she reached out to senior authorities at the university and found out that the offer was fraudulent. “The perpetrators of this attack used clever forgeries and misrepresentations to obtain access to my personal data and communication, and may have also gained access to my devices and email/ social media accounts,” Razdan, who worked at NDTV for 21 years, said.The journalist said on Friday that she has filed a complaint with the Jammu & Kashmir Police cyber cell. “I hope that the police are able to get to the bottom of the attack on me at the earliest,” Razdan said, adding in another post that she was “overwhelmed” by the support she had received on social media.Joshua Benton, a former journalist who founded the university’s news website, Nieman Lab, said there is no journalism department or journalism professors at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.“She (Razan) was apparently under the impression she was joining the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), which is the main faculty [for Harvard College and the Graduate School]. FAS definitely doesn’t have any journalism professors or offer any journalism degree,” he tweeted.Till the time of going to print, there was no official response from Harvard University.

16-01-2021||India||Will march in strength to Delhi, say farmers||Farmer groups camped at Singhu border said more agitators were joining them daily to strengthen their protests and their plan to march to Delhi in tractors on January 26.Farmers said on Friday, the ninth round of talks also failed with the government and every failed negotiation had only further strengthened their spirit and has fuelled the ongoing agitation. Nothing less than repeal of the three contentious farm laws were acceptable to them, they said.Dr Darshan Pal, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said farmers are coming in large numbers to all the border points of Delhi.“In Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, there are frequent tractor marches and a large number of farmers are reaching Delhi. The enthusiasm of farmers has increased due to the huge support we have received…this movement is fanning out across the nation. Under the banner of ‘Mumbai for Farmers’, the Maharashtra farmers’ organization, along with other progressive groups, are organizing a huge rally,” he said.Pal said, farmers in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are continuing with an indefinite sit-in strike. “Kisan Delhi Chalo Yatra started from Odisha on January 15. The march will reach farmers at Delhi borders on January 21 after travelling via West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Kisan Jyoti March was started from Pune on January 12 and will reach Delhi on January 26,” the farmer leader said, adding that more than 500 farmers from Kerala have already reached the Shahjahanpur border.On Thursday, protest at Singhu border continued to be peaceful with farmer groups raising slogans, carrying out marches, cooking and distributing food at langars and delivering speeches.Manmeet Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar, who has spent almost ten days camping at Singhu border, said more people known to him have joined the protest since he left home.“Whoever I talk to, back home, say they are ready to come. Some, who had come left for their homes in December are again planning to come with more ration and cloths. They all plan to be here before Republic Day. Not everyone will march. We plan to support them from here by continuing the movement,” Singh said.Delhi Police continued to maintain their usual deployment with senior police officer ensuring round the clock presence at the posts that have been set up temporarily since the protests began. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said the deployment remained same as usual and will be stepped up as and when required. “The situation is being monitored continuously. We are also using drones for surveillance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-march-in-strength-to-delhi-say-farmers-101610754493435.html

16-01-2021||India||Build confidence in Covid vaccines, govt tells districts||As Delhi prepares to deliver the first jabs to its health care workers, officials of all the districts of the capital have been directed by the administration to build confidence among the masses regarding Covid-19 vaccines.The officials, according to orders of the administration, are required to address safety concerns of citizens through awareness drives, ongoing door-to-door health surveys and speak over phone with people registered for the vaccination.“We have to engage with people at many levels as part of the confidence building drive with regard to the Covid-19 vaccines. The objective is to assure them about their safety concerns in a scientific manner, put a rest to all unscientific fears and build confidence among large sections of people,” said Delhi chief secretary, Vijay Dev.On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to the people to stay alert against “misinformation” on the vaccine and focus on scientific expertise behind its making.Earlier this month, the health department of the government had already deployed accredited social health activists and anganwadi workers in a confidence-building drive, focusing on low-income group localities to address issues related to vaccine hesitancy”.This week, the revenue districts have been directed to systematically launch awareness programmes focused on confidence-building and addressing vaccine hesitancy. “They have also been asked to develop a system under which people registered for vaccination in their districts would get phone calls, reminding them of date, time, venue. The caller would also try to address hesitancies, if any, and help in confidence building. Right now, the government already has a system in place to help give reminders for the second dose of the vaccine. That too can be used,” said a second senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.Starting Saturday, Covid vaccine will be administered to health care workers, their numbers estimated at 300,000 in Delhi. This will be followed by vaccination of an estimated 600,000 front line workers. Registration for front line workers – which includes the police, sanitation workers, teachers, and officials from departments directly engaged in Covid-19 management — is currently in progress. The next in line for vaccination will be an estimated 4.2 million people aged more than 50 years and individuals with co-morbidities, whose numbers are yet to be ascertained.Experts have called for greater dialogue to increase vaccine acceptance.“Everything is ready. Now, we have to ensure that the beneficiaries actually take the vaccine,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College.She said, the health care workers who understand the science, are the ones asking the most questions.“The health care workers are the ones to be immunised first and they understand the science; that is the reason many of them have doubts and questions. The drug regulator has approved the vaccines, they are safe. People should take it because it is better than getting the disease, which can also have long-lasting sequelae (conditions following the disease, such as lung fibrosis in Covid-19),” said Garg.Promila Pargayi, a nurse at GTB hospital vaccination, said, “I do want to get the vaccine but I will wait for a few days to see what kind of adverse reactions people are getting. After all, most of us have been working in Covid-19 wards and have already had the infection. It protects us for some time at least.”Rekha Sharma, another health care worker based in Delhi, too said that she would rather wait and watch for some time. “I have diabetes and hypertension, so I am at a high risk . That is the reason I want to take the vaccine, but I want to wait a couple of days before getting it,” she said.A senior doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said, “There are some who are extremely excited about the vaccination drive. However, there are others who would like to wait and see what happens for sometime and those who would like to avoid getting immunised at the moment. In the first phase, medical professionals and those who work in the medical facilities will be vaccinated. Most of them are aware about Covid and to an extent about the vaccine. Large scale communication campaigns would be necessary for when the government starts roll out of the vaccines among the general public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/build-confidence-in-covid-vaccines-govt-tells-districts-101610749222947.html
16-01-2021||India||Delhi HC objects to WhatsApp asking judge not to hear PIL||The Delhi high court on Friday took strong objection to an e-mail sent by WhatsApp to a judge, asking asked her not to hear a plea challenging its new privacy policy.Justice Pratibha M Singh said the e-mail, which was later withdrawn, was completely unwarranted because she was anyway going to recuse herself from hearing the case filed by lawyer Chaitanya Rohilla, who has contended that WhatsApp’s updated policy virtually scrutinises the personal profile of a user 360 degrees, thereby violating the individual’s Right to Privacy.The petition also said that WhatsApp has put a “Damocles sword on its users” to accept its new privacy policy by February 8.When the matter was listed on Friday, justice Singh mentioned the e-mail in open court. “The court has received an e-mail. I take strong objection to that. There was no need to send this e-mail. I was, myself not going to hear this matter,” she said.WhatsApp, through its counsel, had written to the court suggesting that justice Singh should not hear the matter because she appeared as a senior counsel against WhatsApp in a matter in the Supreme Court in 2016. That case also pertained to WhatsApp’s privacy policy, and is still pending in the court. WhatsApp also sent an e-mail to the Registrar General of the Delhi high court, asking that the bench be changed.On Friday, the senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for WhatsApp, acceded that they should not have sent the e-mail. Advocate Tejas Karia, the counsel who had sent the e-mail on behalf of WhatsApp, apologised to the court, and said that he would withdraw it.The court posted the matter for Monday, when it will be heard by some other bench subject to the orders of the chief justice of the Delhi high court.The plea, filed by Rohilla, said that WhatApp’s new norms, which users must mandatorily accept by February 8, jeopardise the national security of the country by sharing, transmitting and storing user data in some another country.It alleged that WhatsApp was integrating people into Facebook so that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram (another subsidiary of Facebook) all become part of one package.Rohilla, through his counsel Manohar Lal, also contended that updated privacy policy essentially takes away the choice to not share their data with other Facebook-owned and third-party apps.He added that WhatsApp, through the policy, is clearly trying to share its user data to the parent company and other companies which will eventually use that data to serve their vested interests.The new privacy policy, which was rolled out by WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, on January 4, includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists. The move has faced backlash globally -- especially in WhatsApp’s biggest market India where it has 400 million users -- with people en masse defecting to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.Experts said that the new policy may damage WhatsApp’s prospects in India. “Legally, there was no choice for customers who were required to either agree to the revised terms, or were to be denied the upgrade. Though WhatsApp has managed to retain its monopoly, next action of this nature, and Indian users are likely to migrate to Signal and Telegram,” said Major Nirvikar Singh (Retd), a Supreme Court lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-objects-to-whatsapp-asking-judge-not-to-hear-pil-101610748572504.html

The biennial elections to 12 seats of the Council will be held on January 28.“The central election committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party has approved the names of Swatantra Dev Singh, Dr Dinesh Sharma, Laxman Prasad Acharya and Arvind Kumar Sharma as candidates for the upcoming biennial election for the Legislative Council in UP,” read a release issued by the BJP, according to news agency ANI.State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and the party’s state unit vice-president Laxaman Prasad Acharya are sitting members of the Council. Their term, along with that of nine other members belonging to other political parties, ends on January 30.On Thursday, Sharma had joined the party after taking voluntary retirement from service earlier this week. He was due to retire in July 2022.“Certainly, the party has some big plans for Sharma. It will be naïve to believe that he sought VRS from the country’s elite service, when he still had about two years to retire, just to become an MLC,” said a senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named.Sharma, a 1988 batch ex-IAS officer, was moved to the Prime Minister’s Office after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-fields-former-ias-officer-as-its-candidate-for-up-mlc-elections-101610747419660.html
16-01-2021||India||Congress won’t relent till Centre repeals ‘black’ laws, says Rahul||Senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra led a protest march towards Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal’s residence on Friday, in solidarity with the farmers protesting against the new legislation.The Congress was observing ‘Kisan Adhikar Divas’ (farmers’ rights day) across the country, where all state units were asked to congregate at Raj Bhavans to protest the new farm laws.Gandhi asserted that the new laws will “destroy” them.“Congress will stand by the farmers in their protest as the three agricultural laws have been passed to destroy them, and help and benefit the big industrialists,” Gandhi said.“Prime Minister Modi doesn’t respect farmers and wants to tire out those protesting against the Centre’s agriculture laws. The BJP government will have to take these black laws back,” news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Reacting to this, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh said: “The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself had promised these reforms and therefore, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying then or are lying now.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national Capital, demanding the repeal of the laws. While several of them marched towards Baijal’s residence, the Delhi Police stopped the protestors by barricading the route. This also led to a face-off between the two sides, during which senior Congress leader Alka Lamba was allegedly injured.However, Anto Alphonse, DCP (north), said that Lamba was not assaulted by the police. “She had a string entwined in her hand. The string was tied to balloons and a placard. In the melee that happened in the crowd, she may have got injured by the string tied to her hand. We have video evidence for this,” he said.Meanwhile, in Chandigarh, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and in Uttar Pradesh, Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and other workers were allegedly taken into custody during the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-won-t-relent-till-centre-repeals-black-laws-says-rahul-101610746892474.html
16-01-2021||India||After protests, Goa CM announces relocation of IIT project from Melaulim, says CM||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday announced that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Goa campus that was to be set up at Melaulim village would be shifted to another place in the state.The decision caps more than six months of protests largely by the residents of Melaulim village who had refused to concede land and had set up a blockade at the entrance to the site refusing to allow government surveyors to enter the village to demarcate the land. On January 6, at least 12 policemen and several villagers were injured when both the groups had clashed as the police attempted to clear the blockade set up by the villagers.“We wanted the IIT project in Sattari so that the region is developed. (Health minister and MLA from Valpoi in Sattari Vishwajit) Rane also tried to explain (to the villagers). We had also invited the villagers for discussion, but they wouldn’t relent,” Sawant told reporters.On Friday, elected representatives from the neighbouring villages in Sattari submitted a formal request to the CM asking him to shift the project elsewhere.“The whole idea to bring the IIT to Sattari was for the development of Sattari and the development of the whole taluka and the neighbouring talukas. But if the people do not want the IIT in Sattari, I would like to make a humble request to please take a decision to shift the IIT out of Sattari and from Shel Melaulim,” the representation signed by around half a dozen district panchayat members, said.Bowing to the request of the elected representatives of the villages, Sawant said, “This government listens to the people. The government has decided to shift the project from Sattari to another place in Goa. We will be informing the IIT officials and a future decision will be taken to honour requests made by the elected representatives. Both me and health Minister had no personal interest in going ahead with the project.”Notably, on Tuesday, in a letter to CM, Rane had urged him to drop the proposal for an IIT campus at the village.“I want to assure the people of Sattari that for as long as I’m in politics and the representative of this area, we will not allow anyone to even put a single stone in place for the IIT because the people don’t want it,” Rane had said.In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 10 lakh sq. mts land in Melaulim village in North Goa, for setting up of IIT-Goa. Functional since 2014, the IIT Goa has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College.Melaulim village falls in an eco-sensitive zone but hasn’t been formally declared so with notifications not being formally issued. The land on which the IIT is scheduled to come up is revenue land belonging to the government, but the villagers have said that situation has persisted only because they did not have the required documentation to prove that they have rights over it.Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were scrapped, in face of protests from local residents.Villagers have opposed the project claiming that they are dependent on the land for their sustenance including cashews, betel nut and other agricultural produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-protests-goa-cm-announces-relocation-of-iit-project-from-melaulim-says-cm-101610745945286.html

All BSP workers must unitedly start preparing for these elections,” she said.The term of the 403-member UP assembly comes to an end in May, 2022 and that of the 70-member Uttarakhand assembly ends in March 2022.The BSP won no seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. It bagged 19 seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls and 10 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when it fought in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party. It parted ways with the SP soon after the results were declared.The BSP leader also urged the Centre to accept all the demands of agitating farmers including repeal of the three farm laws.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, while welcoming the Covid-19 inoculation drive, requested the Centre to provide the vaccine for free to the common man. She said if her party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, it will ensure that everyone gets the vaccine for free.She said if that doesn’t happen, the respective states should ensure that people get the vaccine for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-go-it-alone-in-uttarakhand-up-101610745079399.html
16-01-2021||India||CBI ‘bribe-for-relief’ racket was running since 2018, finds probe||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has found that a “bribe-for-relief” racket was being run in the agency since 2018 by leaking confidential case related information to some companies being investigated for bank fraud, people familiar with the development said.The agency has identified bribes worth ₹55 lakh paid to two of its officers– Deputy Superintendent of Police , R K Rishi ( ₹30 lakh) and Inspector Kapil Dhankad ( ₹25 lakh) – in lieu of favours extended to at least three companies.In all, nine persons have been named in a First Information Report, including four CBI officers: Rishi (deployed at CBI academy); Dhankad (who is posted in Bank Securities and Fraud Cell BS&FC of CBI); DSP R K Sangwan (posted in Special Crimes Unit) and Stenographer in BS&FC , Sameer Kumar Singh.Two advocates, Arvind Kumar Gupta and Manohar Malik have also been named along with Mandeep Kaur Dhillon (additional director of a company, Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd); and Sujai Desai and Udai Desai of Mumbai based company Frost International Pvt Ltd.According to the FIR, reviewed by HT, the four CBI officers, along with the two advocates, and certain other accused have been “compromising the integrity of investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”.Both Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd (SSPBML) and Frost International are being investigated by CBI for defrauding banks. The case against Frost International was registered in August 2020 for cheating 14 banks of over ₹3500 crore.The CBI FIR states that “in the case of SSPNML, R K Sangwan, who was previous investigating officer of the case, offered and paid a bribe of ₹10 lakh in cash on behalf of Mandeep Kaur to Inspector Kapil Dhankad”. “On his part, Dhankad conveyed confidential information relating to the investigation of this case to R K Sangwan, with an intention to favour the accused”.It adds that R K Rishi paid ₹10 lakh bribe to Dhankad on behalf of Desais of Frost International.Rishi himself received ₹15 lakh twice through advocates Malik and Gupta (having their offices in Defence Colony, Delhi), to extend favours to a Chandigarh based company against which a corruption case was being investigated by CBI, the FIR said. “In this matter, Dhankad twice received ₹2.5 lakh from Gupta for having brokered the deal through Rishi.”The agency FIR says that “details of investigation of many other cases including confidential notes and directions have been communicated by (Sameer Kumar) Singh to Sangwan and Rishi on pecuniary considerations to protect the interests of the accused”.The two DSPs , R K Rishi and R K Sangwan, facilitated the bribes by leaking the information to the companies, said an officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.“The leak of sensitive case related information like raids, status of investigation, filing of charge sheet etc helps accused persons in destroying the evidence. There is a possibility that more officers are involved in the scandal as CBI investigations are monitored at various levels and documents are usually kept in respective branches. It is to be seen how Singh was leaking the documents without anyone’s knowledge,” said another CBI officer who didn’t want to be named.CBI is investigating the magnitude of the racket, as it could be much bigger considering large number of bank fraud cases are under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-bribe-for-relief-racket-was-running-since-2018-finds-probe-101610744767412.html
16-01-2021||India||Panel ignored advice on bidder: Officials||Two committees of senior bureaucrats sidestepped a suggestion by a junior official in the public private partnership (PPP) cell of the finance ministry to restrict a bidder from operating more than two airports on the grounds that the bidding clause would restrict private interests in airport privatisation, according to people aware of the matter. The Adani group clinched the six airports — Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru — in a global competitive bid by offering the highest revenue share to the government.The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2018 gave “in-principle” approval for leasing out six airports of the state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) through the public private partnership appraisal committee (PPPAC), chaired by the economic affairs secretary, and the empowered group of secretaries headed by the CEO of Niti Aayog to frame the bidding parameters for the leasing of assets to private entities, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“After elaborate inter-departmental discussions, the committees finally framed and approved the bidding parameters that did not impose any restriction on the number of airports held by one single bidder. Both the finance ministry and the Niti Aayog had apex level of representation [chairpersons of the respective panels] in the two committees,” one of them, a government official, said.The empowered group of secretaries headed by the CEO of Niti Aayog was created by the cabinet on November 8, 2018, a second official said. “It had the highest representation of ministries concerned, with the top official of Niti Aayog as its chairman, and other members included the civil aviation secretary, economic affairs secretary and expenditure secretary. This committee had the cabinet’s mandate to decide on any issue falling beyond the scope of the PPPAC,” he said.Both the economic affairs secretary and the expenditure secretary are top bureaucrats of the Union finance ministry.The Indian Express published a report on Friday saying the finance ministry and the Niti Aayog had raised red flags before Adani’s clean sweep of six airports. In February 2019, the AAI had declared Adani Enterprises Ltd the highest bidder for all six airports.The ministries of finance and civil aviation, the Niti Aayog and the Adani group did not respond to email queries on the matter.The government awarded airports to Adani on merit after evaluating open competitive bids and elaborate interdepartmental consultations. Some departments did raise certain issues, which were suitably addressed before the awarding the projects, the two officials quoted above said.“It was global competitive bidding. Compared to five-six bidders, Adani offered the highest revenue [share] to the government in each projects. There was no bar on number of projects one could bid for. Hence, it emerged the winning bidder,” the first official said.The second official said Adani’s bids were significantly high compared to the next highest bidders.“On average Adani offered about 24% more revenue than the next highest bidders that included existing airport operators and international firms. Any deviation from the bidding condition would have serious legal and audit implications,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-ignored-advice-on-bidder-officials-101610744178353.html
16-01-2021||India||Army displays drone swarming prowess||The Indian Army on Friday demonstrated its new drone swarming capability at the Army Day 2021 parade in Delhi Cantt with 75 locally designed and developed drones hovering in the sky and simulating a raft of missions including offensive operations.“The drones executed an array of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled simulated offensive missions and close support tasks during the parade,” the army said in a statement.Drones within a swarm can carry out a wide range of missions including strikes against tanks, infantry combat vehicles, ammunition holding areas, fuel dumps and terror launch pads, officials said.The army’s drone swarming capability is under development, though it has been tested for HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) roles, which are largely dropping medicines and essential items. The technology is being developed by the army in partnership with a Bengaluru-based start-up NewSpace Research and Technologies.“This demonstration is a recognition of the Indian Army’s steady embrace of emerging and disruptive technologies to transform itself from a manpower- intensive to a technology-enabled force to meet future security challenges,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said. “In a kamikaze mission, the drones can strike at a range of 100km,” the officials added.The Army is investing heavily into AI, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies and robotics to achieve a convergence between its war-fighting philosophies and military attributes of these technologies, the statement said. “One such project is the AI offensive drone operations... This project symbolises the beginning of the Indian Army’s tryst with autonomy in weapon platforms and showcases the army’s commitment towards merging the cutting-edge of digital technologies with its human resource,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-displays-drone-swarming-prowess-101610743692284.html
16-01-2021||India||Don’t test India’s patience, Army chief warns China||In a blunt message to China in the midst of a lingering border standoff in eastern Ladakh, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday said that India was committed to resolving the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) through talks, but no one should test India’s patience.The border standoff is in its ninth month, with multiple rounds on military and diplomatic talks failing to break the deadlock. “We are committed to resolving disputes through talks and political efforts. However, no one should make the mistake of testing India’s patience,” Naravane said during his customary Army Day address at a parade in Delhi Cantt, where the force put up a display of its military might including the maiden demonstration of an underdevelopment drone swarming capability.The army chief added that India had given a fitting response to the [Chinese] conspiracy to unilaterally change the status quo in the Ladakh theatre, where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have deployed more than 100,000 combat-ready soldiers and advanced weaponry.He also assured the country that the sacrifice of the Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan valley on June 15, 2020 would not go in vain -- the Chinese PLA also suffered heavy casualties in the brawl but Beijing has kept the figures under wraps. Naravane said the morale of soldiers deployed in forward areas in the Ladakh sector was higher than the mountains they were defending despite the extreme weather conditions. He said India will continue with its efforts to resolve the prevailing situation on the basis of principles of “mutual and equal security”.The army chief has conveyed to China unequivocally that India is prepared for any eventuality, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). “The message is clear --- if push comes to shove, India will take the necessary actions in the Ladakh sector,” Jaswal added.In a separate message published on army day, Naravane said the Indian Army has been “swift and decisive” in its response to counter the PLA’s attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on LAC.Naravane, in a media briefing on January 12, said the army was prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China to reduce tensions are “prolonged,” even as he described a joint threat from China and Pakistan as “very potent”.On the situation along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan, the army chief said in Friday’s address that 300 to 400 terrorists were present in terror training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and waiting to sneak into India.He said ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army along the LoC increased by 44% in 2020 compared to 2019, exposing the neighbour’s attempts to help terrorists infiltrate into the country. Ceasefire violations are usually a cover to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir.He added that the army’s operations along the LoC not only caused heavy losses to the enemy but also thwarted many infiltration attempts. He said the army killed 200 terrorists at the LoC and in counterterror operations in the hinterland.Speaking about capability building at a time when India faces challenges from China and Pakistan, Naravane said the army invoked emergency and fast-track procedures in 38 cases to buy weapons and systems last year to sharper its combat edge. The army also concluded capital procurements worth ₹13,000 crore last year, he said.On January 12, the army chief said there was no doubt that India faced a collusive threat from China and Pakistan. “There is indeed increased cooperation between China and Pakistan in both military and non-military fields. And a two-front threat is very much something that we have to be prepared for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-test-india-s-patience-army-chief-warns-china-101610743297059.html
16-01-2021||India||Kathmandu requests early provision of vaccines||Nepal on Friday requested the early provision of Covid-19 vaccines by India even as Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali raised an ongoing border row during a one-on-one meeting with his counterpart S Jaishankar to push for an early resolution.Gyawali, in India with a delegation that includes Nepal’s foreign and health secretaries, co-chaired a meeting of the bilateral joint commission with Jaishankar and reviewed all aspects of cooperation, ranging from connectivity and trade to water resources and border management.Both sides have worked closely to combat the pandemic, and the Nepalese side lauded India on its success in the production of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines and “requested for early provision of vaccines to Nepal”, the external affairs ministry said.Nepal is looking to India to provide vaccines as grant assistance for the first phase of its vaccination programme, which requires 12 million doses to cover 20% of its population.During his one-on-one meeting with Jaishankar, Gyawali raised the border row that took ties to a low last year, people familiar with the discussions said. Gyawali pressed for speedy steps, including meetings of bilateral mechanisms that handle the boundary issue, to facilitate a resolution.There was no official word from both sides on these discussions, though Gyawali referred to the border issue during a speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs. He said both sides have shown wisdom by continuing overall engagements despite differences on this issue. “We are also mindful that we should not let any outstanding issue...become [an] irritant in an otherwise friendly relationship,” he said. The row erupted after Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli issued a new map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kathmandu-requests-early-provision-of-vaccines-101610742655793.html
16-01-2021||India||Ladakh personnel may be among first from the force to get vaccine||Military doctors, paramedics and front-line soldiers deployed in eastern Ladakh, where India and China are locked in a tense border standoff, will be among the first set of armed forces personnel to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease, with India all set to kick off an elaborate vaccination campaign on Saturday, officials familiar with the development said on Friday.At least 12,000 doses of the vaccine have reached Ladakh of which around 4,000 have been earmarked for armed forces personnel to protect them from Covid-19, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“The top priority is being given to military doctors and medical staff who have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Front-line soldiers have also been identified for vaccination,” the officials said.The armed forces have been able to keep a check on the spread of the disease within its ranks by adhering to strict protocols, even as army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane described the pandemic and the situation on the northern borders as the main challenges the army confronted last year.Experts said it was critical to protect frontline military personnel from the disease.“It is absolutely critical to vaccinate the military medical staff and front-line soldiers against Covid-19, given the crucial role being discharged by them in harsh conditions. Others who are not directly part of the military set up but play a key role in keeping the system in forward areas up and running should also get the vaccine on priority,” said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services.He said the armed forces would have prioritised the list of personnel who have to be vaccinated ahead of others keeping their roles and service conditions in mind. “I am sure all drills are in place to ensure that people are vaccinated on priority according to the government’s guidelines,” Chopra added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on January 16 to start Covid-19 vaccination in India. As many as 3,006 vaccination centres will be part of this drive.The vaccination campaign, marking the final phase in India’s long battle against the pandemic, will be held daily from 9am to 5pm, barring the days earmarked for routine immunisation programme.Officials involved in the preparations said that all pallets of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccines have reached state capitals and their distribution to the districts and blocks is on. Similarly, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a backup to Covishield, has also arrived in some state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-personnel-may-be-among-first-from-the-force-to-get-vaccine-101610742226683.html

16-01-2021||India||Delhi air in toxic zone, could get worse today||lready in the “severe” category, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated further on Friday with the AQI nearly maxing out at several monitoring stations and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warning that the pollution levels may rise further and enter the “severe plus” or “emergency” category by Saturday.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed the overall air quality index (AQI) in the Capital at 460, deteriorating from Thursday’s 429.The temperatures in Delhi rose slightly on Friday but IMD scientists said the respite was brief, adding mercury will fall again from Saturday before it starts to rise again on January 18.On Friday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, settled at 6.4 degree Celsius, a notch below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 20.8 degree Celsius. On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 2 degree Celsius, five degrees less than what is considered normal for the season.IMD scientists said the minimum temperature would hover around 4-5 degree Celsius on Saturday and Sunday, and would slightly rise from Monday.CPCB’s hourly recordings of particulate matter levels also showed a rising trend. At 6pm on Friday, the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had remained above the 300ug/m3 mark for over 22 hours. The PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) was also inching closer to the 500ug/m3 mark.The acceptable standards of PM 2.5 levels in India is 60ug/m3 and for PM 10 is 100ug/m3.IMD scientists said the pollution levels are expected to get worse through Friday night and the air quality is likely to reach “emergency” levels by Saturday.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that an improvement is likely only from January 18, when the wind direction will change from north-westerly to easterly.“The winds are calm and the ventilation conditions are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. There is a forecast for pollution levels deteriorating even more through Friday night. The levels will stay in the ‘severe plus’ zone even on Saturday,” said Soni.At 7pm on Friday, a number of air quality monitoring stations were nearly maxed out. The hourly average AQI in RK Puram, Mathura Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Rohini, Narela, Okhla phase-II and Chandni Chowk had reached.Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Rohini, Narela, Okhla phase-II and Chandni Chowk had reached above 480. The maximum value on the AQI scale is 500.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the city-state was looking at the “first prolonged extreme air pollution event of 2021”. “Extremely low ventilation and shallow boundary layer height is adding to the severity. Surface winds are calm and the minimum temperature is likely to fall further from Saturday. The AQI is forecasted to deteriorate further and rapidly,” the Safar forecast read.Boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere, which changes according to factors such as temperature. The lower the boundary layer, lesser the space for pollutants to mix with air and disperse. This leads to pollutants being trapped closer to the ground.Despite the warning from the IMD and Safar, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are yet to issue any precautionary directions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).The last order issued by the CAQM had extended the ban on hotmix plants and stone crushers in Delhi till January 2.CAQM head MM Kutty did not respond to HT’s calls or messages to seek a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-in-toxic-zone-could-get-worse-today-101610740696933.html
16-01-2021||India||Ninth round of farm talks inconclusive||The ninth round of discussions between the Union government and farm unions protesting three agricultural laws failed to make any progress on Friday, but both sides agreed to meet again on January 19 despite the stalemate.The farm unions representing tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national capital, are demanding that the government scrap three laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws are aimed at freeing agricultural markets from government restrictions, which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.At Friday’s talks, the government, which has ruled out a repeal of the laws, proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on laws”.“There were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision. We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.There was a discussion on Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader who represents the unions at the talks.At the talks, which were attended by two other Union ministers — Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — Goyal defended the new amendments in the act but signalled the government’s willingness to make changes.Goyal told the unions that “some changes can be made in the Act too without quite saying that (what specific) amendments will be made,” according to Kuruganti.The Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, one of the laws farmers want scrapped, allows traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales. The government argues that the changes were necessary to attract private investment in warehouses and food-processing plants.According to an official, the government suggested that it could review the stock limits proposed under the amended law.“We have said that the amendments should be removed and earlier Act restored because the new changes will allow hoarding and black-marketing of essential items,” said Hanan Mollah, a senior farm leader.The agriculture minister said the government suggested that the farm unions form a smaller, focused group that should evaluate specific issues in the laws and “present them before the government so that these could be discussed”.The government also repeated its proposal that farmers should go through the three laws “section by section” and list their objections. The farmers rejected both the suggestions.The Supreme Court on January 12 kept the three contentious laws in abeyance to “assuage the hurt feelings of farmers” and also formed a committee to look into the farmers’ grievances over the laws.The farmers have rejected the court’s offer, saying they want a full repeal of the laws, not a temporary ban on their implementation.“The government welcomes the Supreme Court’s decisions. We will present our point of view before the committee appointed by the court,” Tomar said.At the opening of today’s talks, the farm unions raised the issue of alleged harassment and arrest of their colleagues on trumped up charges in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “Farmer unions wanted the Centre to address and prevent it,” said Kuruganti, the lone woman representative of the farm unions at the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ninth-round-of-farm-talks-inconclusive-101610739200773.html
16-01-2021||India||Kerala earmarks fund for mental health||A chit fund scheme to refurbish middle-class kitchen, special scheme for the mental health sector, hike in welfare pension, sops for start-ups and three industrial corridors were among some of the measures announced by Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Issac in the state budget for the next fiscal year on Friday.With the assembly elections due in four months, Issac presented the last budget of the Pinarayi Vijayan government for now, assuring that money won’t be a constraint for welfare programmes and some of the new measures will help lift the state’s consumerist economy reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state has earmarked Rs.64 crore for mental health programmes, usually a neglected sector, he said. According to a survey conducted by the state mental health department last year, at least 15% of the youth between 18 and 25 years suffered from depression and other mental health problems.Besides this, 4,000 new posts will be created in the health sector, Issac said.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the state has the fifth highest suicide rate in the country with 24.3 deaths per 100,000 population.“We have given special emphasis on mental health care. Low-income families really struggle with persons with mental disabilities. Rs.50 crore has been earmarked to take care of these families while the rest of the fund will be allocated to modernise existing mental health centres,” the state finance minister said.Another highlight of the budget was the chit fund scheme to modernise middle-class kitchens. The ‘smart kitchen fund’ will help women purchase household items without difficulty and the government will partly fund the Kerala State Financial Enterprises, which is successfully running a number of lending schemes in the state.He also said free food kits which are being distributed in the wake of the pandemic will continue for some time and 5 million families will get additional rice for Rs.15 and Rs.10 per kg, respectively. Political observers said that it was the free kits that played an important role in the Left’s recent victory in the local body election.While the finance minister announced three industrial corridors worth ₹50,000 crore, he did not elaborate on how it will be financed. Similarly, welfare pensions will be hiked from Rs.1,500 to Rs.1,600 and the elderly will get free medicines at their doorsteps without any hassle, he said.The government has also decided to withdraw 1% flood cess on transactions amid demands from several trade bodies. Many sops were also announced for start-ups. In government tenders, these firms will be given preference and the government will bear at least 50% of the loss to encourage innovation, Isaac said.A package was also announced for the ailing hospitality sector with interest-free loans for operators. Pension for expats who returned to the state was hiked to Rs.3,000 per month.The Congress said the budget lacked substance. “It is a futile exercise eying the polls. There is no dearth of announcements but there are no funds. In the ease of doing business, the state is ranked 28,” said Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-earmarks-fund-for-mental-health-101610737270683.html

In the letter, Sangma said that he found illegal coal mining taking place in West Jaintia Hills district during a trip to the area."Coal dumped in a scattered manner in a number of depot(s)/dumping ground were found and the site indicated that recently mined coal, apparently carried by siding trucks or dumper trucks, were dumped in a scattered manner in a number of depot(s)/dumping grounds,” he mentioned in the letter seen by HT.Leader of Opposition Sangma said the mineral, weighing truckloads, which were dumped in a scattered manner, were being tallied jointly by the deputy commissioner, West Jaintia Hills and divisional mining officer, West Jaintia Hills in presence of the team led by him.Also read: Bengal BJP leaders meet Amit Shah in Delhi, discuss poll preparednessThe total quantity counted was 1,064 truckloads and each truckload must be in the range of 12 to 16 MTs, he emphasised.“This reveals the fact that the actual quantity of coal at the site was less than 20,000 MTs, while the inquiry report of the DMO, Jowai, vide letter no. DMO-J/R/23/2019/57, dated: Jowai, June 2, 2020, indicated is 1, 41,000 MT (Approximately) as per the figure available in the copy of the replies to RTI enclosed in the representation submitted to you by SN Marak,” Dr Sangma said.Claiming that he is well-armed with proper facts and figures, Sangma said that illegal coal mining is still taking place in violation of the MMDR Act 1957 (Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act) and a blatant violation of the ban by the NGT on illegal coal mining. “It’s a total slap on the face,” he said.Speaking to HT, Dr Sangma said, “This is just the beginning, we will ensure that everyone responsible for this pillage is addressed accordingly as per provisions of the law,” adding, “It’s not a witchhunt but we will not be ‘Rip Van Winkle’ and pretend to be asleep while our beloved state’s resources are being plundered.”He quipped, “Perhaps everyone, according to this government’s perception, the honourable apex court and NGT are asleep too, so they cannot see the gross violation taking place but I think a surprise is in the offing.”The former CM said a huge quantity of illegally mined coal which was submitted in the inquiry report of the divisional mining officer, Jowai, indicating 1,41,000 MT (Approximately) of coal has disappeared and must have been illegally lifted and transported resulting in a serious loss of government revenue.He further alleged that the scale and magnitude of illegality committed with such ease cannot have happened without well-planned abetment of the offences by those in a position to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excm-accuses-ruling-meghalaya-govt-of-encouraging-illegal-coal-mining-101610735922242.html
16-01-2021||India||Smuggled Nepalese cigarette brand dominates border areas of Uttarakhand||A little-known Nepalese cigarette brand called ‘Khukuri’ has been dominating the markets in border areas of Uttarakhand due to its cheap price despite several Indian brands being available. Though its export is banned, smugglers make it available easily to shopkeepers through the porous Indo-Nepal border.The police have seized two big consignments of Nepalese cigarettes in less than a month in Champawat.Jasveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Tanakpur police station in Champawat said, “We have seized two smuggled consignments of Nepalese cigarette ‘Khukuri’ worth ₹7 lakh in less than a month and handed it over to the Custom department. Smugglers make available these cigarettes after crossing the Sharda river which flows along the border.”‘Khukuri’ a brand of Nepalese cigarette has captured the market in the border areas of US Nagar, Champawat and Pithoragarh. Over 90% of smokers prefer to purchase and smoke this not due to taste but its cheap prices, said an official.Vinod Kala, a social activist of Banbasa Champawat said, “One can find ‘Khukuri’ cigarettes easily in every grocery or Paan shop in border areas. People who smoke prefer to purchase it compared to Indian cigarette brands.”A shopkeeper of Tanakpur, who did not wish to be named, revealed that a packet of ‘Khukuri’ cigarettes costs ₹60 to 62 and contains 20 cigarettes while Indian cigarette packets are rather costly and contain only 10 cigarettes. He said, “We know selling smuggled cigarettes is a crime but smokers demand this particular brand. In such a condition, we have to keep these Nepalese brand cigarettes in the shop.”Nepalese cigarettes dominate Khatima, Banbasa, Tanakpur, Jhulaghat, Jauljibi and Dharchula like the border areas markets and are freely available in every shop. A smoker said, “One ‘Khukuri’ cigarette costs us merely ₹3 while an Indian cigarette costs ₹7 to 10 with the same taste. Therefore, we prefer to smoke this cheaper brand.”Chauhan said, “We are trying to identify those elements who make available Nepalese cigarettes in our area. Action will be taken thereafter to check the smuggling of this particular brand of cigarettes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggled-nepalese-cigarette-brand-dominates-border-areas-of-uttarakhand-101610735143799.html
16-01-2021||India||Construction work on New Parliament begins||Construction work on the foundation of the New Parliament building officially began on Friday, officials aware of the development said adding that some of the work had already begun on an alternative site to make up for the delay in the construction.“As we were scheduled to start construction in December but had to put it on hold due to the Supreme Court’s initial stay we began building the blocks for the new building at a site alloted by the government at Kirti Nagar in New Delhi to save time,” a senior government official directly involved in the matter said requesting anonymity.“It is a process akin to putting Lego blocks together. We were able to make up for the delay on site construction through this process, “ the official added. “Work (at the site itself) began on Friday.” this person added.Construction work could not start earlier because the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court took a call on pending pleas on the issue.On December 10, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a new Parliament House , describing the event as a milestone in India’s democratic history and asserting that the building will become the symbol of a 21st century nation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India. Modi performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the two-storeyed building amid vedic chants by 12 priests.The Supreme Court earlier this month gave its nod to the project that includes construction of a new Parliament Building and a common Central Secretariat.The apex court said that clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work.The Heritage Conversation Committee headed by the Additional Secretary of the ministry of housing and urban affairs cleared the Centre’s proposal for the new Parliament building this week.Tata Projects Limited emerged as the lower bidder for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex by quoting a bid of Rs.861.90 crore when the financial bids for the project opened on September 16 and it was awarded the contract to construct the building on September 29.The plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves having a new Parliament building in place by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the entire project, which includes constructing 11 administrative buildings to house all the government ministries, is slated to be finished by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-work-on-new-parliament-begins-101610734541231.html
16-01-2021||India||CBI arrests Rose Valley chit fund owner’s wife in Kolkata||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday afternoon arrested Subhra Kundu, a former actress and wife of Gautam Kundu, the arrested owner of the chit fund company Rose Valley, from Kolkata in connection with an alleged multi-crore scam that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also investigating.The ₹17,000 crore Rose Valley scam is reportedly the biggest in Bengal in terms of the money involved. In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the scam and the role of influential people in money laundering in West Bengal.Two Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha members, Sudip Bandopadhyay and Tapas Pal, were arrested by the CBI in 2017 in connection with the scam. Pal died last year, months after he was released on bail.Subhra Kundu was arrested from her apartment in an upmarket south Kolkata condominium and brought to the CBI office at the CGO complex at Salt Lake for questioning. She has been interrogated several times by the CBI and ED since 2015 when her husband was arrested by the latter. He has been in judicial custody since.Friday’s arrest came two days after that of former TMC Rajya Sabha MP and businessman KD Singh in Delhi in connection with an alleged money laundering case involving his Alchemist Group.A CBI official said on condition of anonymity that Subhra Kundu was under scanner for a long time as she is the director of two sister companies of Rose Valley. Although these companies are officially closed, some bank transactions have been detected in the accounts by these companies. Subhra Kundu, officials said, could not provide any satisfactory answer regarding the same.Although the CBI and ED are investigating several high-profile scams, such as the Saradha and Rose Valley, trial has not started in these.Last year, Calcutta high court chief justice T B Radhakrishnan constituted a two-judge bench for hearing ponzi scheme cases every Friday. The hearings started on September 25.Formation of a separate bench for ponzi schemes is being viewed in political circles as a significant development since several prominent leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) figure among the accused in the Saradha case.Meanwhile, reacting to Subhra Kundu’s arrest, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “The Supreme Court asked the CBI to conduct the probe. The Central agency is doing its duty.”BJP’s West Bengal vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar welcomed the arrest and said, “All influential people and politicians involved in chit fund cases must be arrested as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-rose-valley-chit-fund-owner-s-wife-in-kolkata-101610710300033.html
