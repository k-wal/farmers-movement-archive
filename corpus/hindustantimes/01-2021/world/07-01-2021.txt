On Monday some of them seized the South Korean-flagged Hankuk Chemi for alleged violations of environmental laws, something its operator has denied.South Korea has already sent its own warship, the ROKS Choi Young, toward waters near the strait, and a diplomatic delegation left for Iran early on Thursday to negotiate the tanker’s release, Yonhap news agency reported.Iran has used its influence over the Persian Gulf to push back against US-led attempts to isolate it economically. A government spokesman this week linked the seizure of the tanker to billions of dollars trapped in South Korea by US sanctions.Thursday’s parade was part of commemoration events for the one-year anniversary of the killing of IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani by the US, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-holds-navy-drills-in-persian-gulf-amid-standoff-over-tanker/story-ap5iadCDqGaO8ODCwNob9L.html

The judge said Tuesday the filing is deficient because it does not include a “certified copy of prisoner’s trust fund statement” and a $402 filing fee.An email seeking comment was left Thursday with the federal Bureau of Prisons.Tsarnaev alleges his cap and bandana were confiscated by prison guards “because, by wearing it, I was ‘disrespecting’ the FBI and the victims” of the April 15, 2013, bombing.During the investigation, Tsarnaev was referred to by law enforcement as “White Hat” when he was seen on surveillance video leaving the scene of the bombings.Three people died and more than 260 people were injured at the scene when two pressure cooker bombs were set off near the marathon’s finish line.Tsarnaev’s older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police three days later.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted and sentenced to death, but the death sentence was overturned last July by a federal appeals court that said the judge who oversaw the case did not adequately screen jurors for potential biases. That decision has been appealed to the US Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boston-marathon-bomber-sues-federal-govt-over-treatment-at-prison/story-2jXOM8Whqfi09etuJ0mvtK.html

Monaco spent almost two decades at the Justice Department and was homeland security adviser in the Obama administration. Gupta headed the department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama.Biden praised the nominees as “among the most accomplished legal minds in our country.”“They will restore the independence of the Department so it serves the interests of the people not a presidency, rebuild public trust in the rule of law, and work tirelessly to ensure a more fair and equitable justice system,” he said.Biden will introduce the nominees at an event later Thursday.Garland, 68, is a veteran of the legal community and Justice Department.He first served in the department as a special assistant in President Jimmy Carter’s administration before going into private practice. He returned to the department for a brief stint in 1989 as an assistant US attorney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-capitol-violence-biden-vows-to-restore-rule-of-law/story-XoOc3fb8P9e0pDps1J6AZK.html
07-01-2021||World||Britain working with Pfizer, AstraZeneca to increase vaccine supplies||The pace of Britain’s rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is being limited by the supply of shots, and the government is working with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase supplies, health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday. The government must quickly ramp up the rate of vaccinations in order to meet an ambitious target to inoculate more than 13 million people who are elderly, vulnerable or frontline workers by mid-February. “The rate limiting step is the supply of vaccine, and we’re working with the companies, both Pfizer and of course AstraZeneca, to increase the supply,” Hancock told broadcasters.“The manufacturers are doing a brilliant job, and they’re delivering to the schedule that’s agreed, but that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have ... we expect to see that amount of vaccine being delivered going up.” Hancock spoke after the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University was rolled out in doctors surgeries from Thursday.More than 1.3 million people in the United Kingdom have received one shot of either AstraZeneca’s or Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, but the government needs to be administering around 2 million doses a week to hit its February target.In a sign of supply constraints, one doctor visited by Hancock on Thursday said she had not received the delivery of AstraZeneca’s vaccine she had been expecting. Birmingham City Council’s leader and local lawmakers also wrote to Hancock saying no AstraZeneca vaccine was available in the central English city and that stocks of the Pfizer shot would run out on Friday.Britain is prioritising the administration of an initial shot to more people, delaying second doses beyond a month after the first. Just 20,000 people received their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine before the guidance was changed. Pfizer has said there is no data for the efficacy of the first shot beyond 21 days.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if the vaccine rollout goes to plan, new lockdown measures introduced this week could start to be eased in February. Johnson, who will give a news conference later on Thursday, has previously cited the time it takes for the regulator to approve batches of AstraZeneca’s vaccine as one limiting factor.AstraZeneca’s vaccine was first deployed in hospitals on Monday. It does not have the ultra-low temperature requirements that Pfizer’s does, making it easier to roll out. Initial boxes of the Pfizer vaccine contained nearly 1,000 doses, but the NHS said smaller boxes had also been approved for use that could be used in settings like care homes without wasting doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-working-with-pfizer-astrazeneca-to-increase-vaccine-supplies/story-GrvW4JYqTh6SedyytvYWBK.html
07-01-2021||World||US human rights lawyer arrested in Hong Kong granted bail||An American human rights lawyer who was detained in Hong Kong with scores of democracy activists and supporters as part of a sweeping crackdown was granted bail, his associate said Thursday.John Clancey, who works at law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners, was one of 53 people arrested Wednesday under the national security law over their participation in an unofficial primary election last year that authorities say was part of a plan to paralyze the government and subvert state power.The mass arrests were the largest move against Hong Kong’s democracy movement since Beijing imposed the law last June to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous territory following months of anti-government protests in 2019.The primaries were held by the pro-democracy camp to determine the best candidates to field as they sought to gain a majority in Hong Kong’s legislature.While most of those arrested were candidates in the primaries, Clancey was a treasurer for political organization Power for Democracy, which was involved in the event.The legislative election that would have followed the unofficial primaries was postponed by a year by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, who cited public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic.The remaining activists will be granted bail without charge, although most had their passports confiscated as evidence, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which cited unnamed sources.The security law criminalizes acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers to intervene in the city’s affairs. Serious offenders could face up a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Authorities pointed to a plan called “10 steps to mutual destruction” allegedly indicating that the primaries were part of a broader push to cause damage to both Hong Kong and mainland China.That plan was published as an opinion piece in Apple Daily newspaper by former law professor and pro-democracy activist Benny Tai, who was also arrested on Wednesday. He said that between 2020 and 2022, there would be 10 steps to “mutual destruction,” including the pro-democracy bloc winning a majority in the legislature, intensifying protests, the forced resignation of Lam due to the budget bill being rejected twice, and international sanctions against the ruling Chinese Communist Party.The arrests drew condemnation from the UN, the US, and Europe.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called them an outrage and said the US would explore further sanctions and restrictions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials and entities.“I am also appalled by the news of the arrest of an American citizen as part of this campaign of political repression,” he said, adding the United States would not tolerate the arbitrary detention or harassment of its citizens.Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said the arrests indicate that “the offence of subversion under the National Security Law is indeed being used to detain individuals for exercising legitimate rights to participate in political and public life.”Kurt Tong, the former U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, saw the arrests as part of a methodical and escalating campaign to eradicate viable opposition politics both among the protesters and elected parties.“The national security law provides the legal foundation to do that,” said Tong, now a partner at The Asia Group consultancy in Washington, D.C.China wants to preserve Hong Kong’s economic vibrancy and free market without what it views as political complications, he said. He didn’t predict a mass exodus by companies, saying the city retains its residual energy and dynamism, but warned there could be a measurable impact over time.“China’s taking a big gamble by picking away at parts of the Hong Kong system that it doesn’t like,” he said. “It really risks damaging parts that it values.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-human-rights-lawyer-arrested-in-hong-kong-granted-bail/story-8xavie0kcO8W2vHzCx5muJ.html
07-01-2021||World||US weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fall||The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dipped last week while staying extremely high, with the labor market recovery appearing to stall as a raging Covid-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the country.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Jan. 2, compared to 790,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week.Elevated claims are in line with other data that have suggested the economy was taking a beating from business restrictions and retrenchment in consumer spending because of the pandemic. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected soaring coronavirus cases “would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months.” Covid-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 21 million, with the death toll exceeding 352,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A report on Wednesday showed private companies shed workers in December for the first time in eight months. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a steep decline in the number of employees working in December compared to November. The reports raised the risk that the economy lost jobs in December, though a survey this week showed factory employment rebounding last month. The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report for December on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.Jobless claims are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The government in late December approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus, including the renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14.Economists expect the unemployment subsidy will push up first-time jobless claims after uncertainty whether it would be renewed contributed to a drop in applications in recent weeks.Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended in the latest pandemic relief package. More fiscal stimulus is likely. Democrats on Wednesday completed a sweep of the two Senate seats up for grabs in runoff elections in Georgia, giving the party control of the chamber and boosting the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda.Congress on Thursday formally certified Biden’s election victory hours after hundreds of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.The economy plunged into recession in February. Though it is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product will likely come from the rebuilding of inventories after they were depleted early in the pandemic. The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-weekly-jobless-claims-unexpectedly-fall/story-enn66NwlzARTEqvnFF5LbI.html

A shortage of vets to issue the forms is causing delays, Buchan said.Buchan said Transports Mesguen, a French trucking company that moves fish, had intended to send four trucks for export Tuesday, but had only managed to send two due to the customs hold-ups.“We’ve been ill-prepared,” Buchan said. “The government hasn’t listened to the warnings the industry has continually been giving.”Britain’s free-trade deal with the EU saw it negotiate a 25% increase in the catch for UK’s boats in British waters over the next five years, followed by annual negotiations. However, being outside the EU’s single market and customs union, fishermen face poorer market access, and must follow rules such as sending their fish through designated border control posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-fishermen-hit-by-brexit-delays-shortage-of-vets/story-MdGsotFBQZH0qr9epOijDI.html
07-01-2021||World||Trump’s comments directly led to violence, says UK’s Priti Patel||British Home Secretary Priti Patel on Thursday condemned the “awful” scenes of riots on the Capitol Hill in Washington DC and blamed US President Donald Trump for the violence that resulted in four deaths in clashes between protesters and American police.The senior Cabinet minister told the BBC that it was the outgoing President’s words that fuelled the violence and accused Trump of doing nothing “de-escalate that”.“His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong,” said Patel.“He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn’t actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we’ve seen is completely unacceptable,” she said.Hundreds of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday – where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Biden’s election victory – and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC after he made several claims of electoral fraud. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released.On Thursday, a White House spokesperson issued a Twitter statement to say there will be an “orderly transition” to Democrat President-elect Joe Biden, whose November 2020 election victory has since been by US lawmakers.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a Twitter statement.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was “no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power”.The condemnation of the scenes in the US capital was cross-party in the UK, with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it was a “direct attack on democracy”, while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the events “utterly horrifying”.A Friend of President Trump and leader of the Brexit Party which has now transformed to Reform UK, Nigel Farage, also tweeted: “Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-comments-directly-led-to-violence-says-uk-s-priti-patel/story-nOXbqg38FAwx0YWVWDA4sI.html

The UAE is also conducting Phase III trials of a vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm). The UAE has approved the vaccine and it is available for free to anybody who wants it, with priority given to more vulnerable individuals, according to the health ministry. Last month, the emirate of Dubai only began inoculating people with the vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTec.Authorities in the UAE, which has a population around 9 million, say 826,301 vaccines had been administered as of Tuesday, without specifying which type. They added the UAE aimed to vaccine more than 50% of the population in the first quarter of this year. In October, Sinopharm’s local partner, G42, said it intended to start manufacturing the vaccine in 2021. A G42 representative told Reuters on Wednesday plans for manufacturing in the UAE were at an advanced stage and more details would be made available soon. The UAE has seen the number of new daily cases more than double in the past ten days. On Wednesday, the health ministry reported 2,067 new infections, a daily record. The UAE does not disclose where in the country infections or deaths take place and has not recently announced new measures to prevent its spread.In total, the Gulf Arab state has recorded 218,766 infections and 689 deaths from the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-starts-trials-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-as-cases-rise/story-7QVIelUqQgwaAEk2H02iTN.html
07-01-2021||World||Nearly 20k second doses of Pfizer vaccine given in England before rule change||Nearly 20,000 second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech were given to people in England before guidelines were changed to prioritise giving out first doses, the National Health Service said on Thursday.The figures showed that 19,981 second vaccinations were given between the Dec. 29 and Jan. 3, out of 1.1 million total administered in England. Across the whole of the United Kingdom, 1.3 million doses have been deployed.The day after second vaccinations began, health officials said they would prioritise giving as many people as possible a first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine to offer some protection over the rollout of booster shots.That means second shots will now be given up to 12 weeks after people receive their first shots, prompting criticism from some scientists, and frustration from people who have seen appointments cancelled.While AstraZeneca’s shot was tested with different intervals between doses, Pfizer has said there is no data to demonstrate the efficacy of its first dose after 21 days.On Tuesday, England’s Chief Medical Officer said that the balance of risk supported the move, adding protection from a single dose would likely be more than 50% even if it did pose a small risk of an “escape mutant” of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes that by giving at least some protection to more than 13 million people in priority groups over the next six weeks, it will be possible to consider easing strict lockdown measures from mid-February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-20k-second-doses-of-pfizer-vaccine-given-in-england-before-rule-change/story-XAuGjlNuGKRNOwCaopIrjN.html
07-01-2021||World||Chinese web firms ‘bullying’ customers with data, algorithms, says China Consumers Association||Chinese internet companies have been violating customers’ rights by misusing personal data and “bullying” people into purchases and promotions, a government-backed consumer association said on Thursday.The statement from the China Consumers Association (CCA) did not name any companies, but comes as Beijing has ramped up scrutiny of technology giants, reversing a once laissez-faire approach towards its vast internet space.“Consumers are being squeezed by data algorithms and becoming the targets of technical bullying,” the association said.Companies must stop using systems to scan through consumers’ personal data and offer them different prices for goods based on that information, the association said.Algorithms that checked people’s internet use and other data, then sent them targeted ads and promotions, deprived customers of choice, it added.Some of the products and services promoted by these automated systems “violated the law and public order and good customs” it said, without going into further detail.Consumers’ “values and moral concepts may even be distorted by algorithms and become ‘playthings’ in the hands of platform operators,” the CCA’s statement said.Beijing issued draft rules in December aimed at preventing monopolistic behaviour by internet companies, marking China’s first serious regulatory move against the sector.China also warned its internet giants to brace for increased scrutiny, as it slapped fines and announced investigations into deals involving Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings .Chinese state media have become increasingly vocal about infringement of consumer rights by tech companies.In September, the state broadcaster published the results of a poll which showed that 75% of respondents believed they had been treated unfairly when they made purchases online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-web-firms-bullying-customers-with-data-algorithms-says-china-consumers-association/story-VLgiAglu6MYMheEp9YPZHL.html
07-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Negative coronavirus test required for air travel to Canada||As the winter surge of the pandemic continues in Canada, the government has made it mandatory for all Canada-bound international travellers to produce a negative Covid-19 test result before being allowed to board a flight to a Canadian destination.Air travel remains restricted to the country as the ban on entry of foreign nationals, first announced in March last year during the initial outbreak of Covid-19, remains in force. However, multiple flights continue to bring passengers into the country, including several each week from India, as part of an air bubble arrangement. Passengers booked on the incoming Vande Bharat Mission flights operated by Air India with a reciprocal arrangement with Air Canada, will be impacted by the new measures that went into force on Thursday.The government will only accept results from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) or transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification or RT-LAMP tests, which will have to be taken within 72 hours before the departure of the Canada-bound flight.The new measures have also resulted from a public backlash against several politicians who went abroad during the Christmas break in December, leading to the resignation of Indo-Canadian MP Kamal Khera from her post of parliamentary secretary to the minister of international development in PM Justin Trudeau’s government, among several others including the finance minister of the province of Ontario.Trudeau has criticised those who had chosen to vacation abroad while the second wave of Covid-19 has seized the country. The total number of confirmed cases in Canada stood at 626,317, a daily increase of over 8,000 new infections, surpassing the numbers witnessed in the spring. The number of fatalities has reached 16,369.More restrictions are coming into place in several Canadian jurisdictions. The hardest hit, the province of Quebec, has announced the first ever curfew in the country, lasting from 8pm to 5am for a month beginning on January 9.Similar negative tests are already required by other countries, including India, but such a step hadn’t been implemented earlier. Explaining the reason for the move, Canada’s transport minister Marc Garneau said during the course of a media interaction, “The Covid-19 pandemic is far from over. We need to continue to be vigilant, and we need to continue to take action to reduce the risks of spreading the virus by air travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-negative-coronavirus-test-required-for-air-travel-to-canada/story-6fY86ip0C7uKtgBfjViOwJ.html
07-01-2021||World||US Capitol violence: Deputy NSA and top China adviser Matt Pottinger resigns||White House deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger has resigned, joining a number of officials who are leaving the administration of President Donald Trump following the storming of Capitol Hill by his supporters.Pottinger, a leading figure in the development of Trump’s China policy, resigned on Wednesday in response to Trump’s reaction to a mob of protesters who breached the U.S. Capitol, a senior administration official told Reuters. Bloomberg first reported the resignation.Pottinger’s boss, national security adviser Robert O’Brien, has no plans to quit, the official said.“A strong national security team remains in place at the State Department, the Department of Defense, Treasury, the intelligence community and the National Security Council.”The official said the team has been making sure there are no foreign threats to the United States prior to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. The team has been coordinating with the Biden transition team for several weeks.The White House had no immediate comment. O’Brien had asked Pottinger to stay on past election day to facilitate the transition to Biden’s new team, the official said.“Pottinger completed those tasks,” the person said.An administration official described Trump as “increasingly isolated” and said that “national security officials who are loyal to their oath to the constitution will be standing watch until Inauguration Day and will then turn over power to the duly elected new president.”Four people died during the chaos - one from gunshot wounds and three from medical emergencies - after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to overturn his election defeat to Democrat Biden.In a video posted to Twitter while the rioters roamed the Capitol, Trump called the protesters “special” and repeated his false claims about election fraud, although he urged protesters to leave.The melee delayed the certification process of Biden’s victory for hours.Two top aides to first lady Melania Trump also resigned on Wednesday. Stephanie Grisham resigned as chief of staff to the first lady.“It has been an honor to serve the country in the White House. I am very proud to have been a part of Mrs. Trump’s mission to help children everywhere, and proud of the many accomplishments of this administration,” Grisham said in a statement.Grisham, who spent a year as White House press secretary before becoming chief of staff to the first lady, did not say whether her resignation was in reaction to the violence, but a source familiar with her decision said it was the last straw.The White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, also resigned, as did a deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews, two sources told Reuters.There was also talk inside the White House that deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell might resign, a source said.Pottinger, a former Reuters and Wall Street Journal reporter who left journalism to join the US Marines after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001, had served in the White House since the beginning of Trump’s presidency in 2017.The departure of the fluent Mandarin speaker comes at a time of high tension with Beijing.Trump’s administration has pursued hardline policies towards China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus and relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when the president ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.Early on Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was considering sanctions and other restrictions on those involved in the arrest of over 50 people, including American lawyer John Clancey, in a new Chinese crackdown in Hong Kong hours before Wednesday’s events in Washington.Pompeo warned that Washington could target Hong Kong’s economic and trade office in the United States, and in a move likely to further rile Beijing, announced that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft would visit Chinese-claimed Taiwan - which is not a U.N. member due to China’s objections.U.S. lawmakers called the action by Trump’s supporters an embarrassment to American democracy that would play into the hands of rivals like China.“I think they’re high-fiving in Beijing,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, told Tucker Carlson on the Fox News channel. “It kind of bolsters their claim that we’re falling apart and they’re the country of the future.”On Wednesday, China’s Washington embassy issued an advisory warning Chinese citizens to strengthen safety precautions in light of the “large-scale demonstration” in the U.S. capital and a curfew announced by the local government.

07-01-2021||World||Justin Trudeau slams US Capitol chaos, calls it ‘an attack on democracy’||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described the violence unleashed by supporters of outgoing US President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday as “an attack on democracy”.As the events in Washington, DC unfolded, Trudeau tweeted, “Canadians are deeply disturbed and saddened by the attack on democracy in the United States, our closest ally and neighbour. Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld - and it will be.”His views were echoed by Canada’s foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, who tweeted, “Canada is deeply shocked by the situation in Washington, DC. The peaceful transition of power is fundamental to democracy - it must continue and it will. We are following developments closely and our thoughts are with the American people.”The statements from Canadian leaders came even as small pro-Trump protests also took place in several cities in the country. A convoy of vehicles driven by those describing themselves as “Canadians for President Trump” drove past the US consulate in Toronto. About a dozen vehicles participated, according to Global News, and they carried “Stop the Steal” flags, reflecting the accusations by Trump that the 2020 election had been lost due to electoral manipulation by supporters of his Democratic Party rival, Joe Biden.A small demonstration was also staged outside the US consulate in Vancouver, while a rally took place outside the City Hall in Calgary in the province of Alberta.However, police in these cities did not report any incidents of violence during the course of the protests.In a separate statement issued by his office, Trudeau said his government was “concerned” over the developments in Washington, DC and was “following the situation minute by minute as it unfolds”.“We certainly hope things will calm down, but we’re going to keep watching carefully,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-slams-us-capitol-chaos-calls-it-an-attack-on-democracy/story-okroV8JJzjrqBT5AcvY2nK.html
07-01-2021||World||Covid-19: China locks down Hebei, 11 million people barred from leaving||The capital and largest city in northern China’s Hebei province barred people from leaving on Thursday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus as the country reported the biggest rise in daily infections in more than five months.Hebei accounted for 51 of the 52 local cases reported by the National Health Commission on Thursday. This compared with 20 cases reported in the province, which surrounds Beijing, a day earlier.Authorities in Shijiazhuang, home to 11 million people, have launched mass testing drives and banned gatherings to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to barring people from leaving the city, people and vehicles from areas of the city considered high-risk were not allowed to leave their district, authorities said.Hebei entered a “wartime mode” on Tuesday, meaning investigation teams would be set up at provincial, city and district levels to trace the close contacts of those who have tested positive.Chinese state television earlier reported that Shijiazhuang had banned passengers from entering its main railway station. The city had previously required travellers to present a negative nucleic acid COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours before boarding a train or a plane in the province.Total new COVID-19 cases for all of mainland China stood at 63, compared with 32 reported a day earlier, marking the biggest rise in daily cases since 127 cases were reported on July 30. The number of asymptomatic carriers, who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but have yet to develop any symptoms, also rose, to 79 from 64 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China since the outbreak first started in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 now stands at 87,278, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. In the city of Dalian in Liaoning province in China’s northeast, which has reported local infections in recent days, residents in medium or high-risk areas have been barred from leaving the city. Residents in other areas were told to refrain from unnecessary trips out of Dalian. Authorities in Guangdong province in southern China late on Wednesday reported a patient infected with a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa.Some scientists worry that COVID-19 vaccines currently being rolled out may not be able to protect against this variant because of certain mutations that have been observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-locks-down-city-11-million-barred-from-leaving-hebei/story-hNk3f79Lfrx2paamJWpesN.html

Qassim Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the court’s media office said. They were killed outside the capital’s airport last January.Al-Muhandis was the deputy leader of the state-sanctioned Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group composed of an array of militias, including Iran-backed groups, formed to fight the Islamic State group.Soleimani headed the expeditionary Quds force of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps.The arrest warrant was for a charge of premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty on conviction. It is unlikely to be carried out but symbolic in the waning days of Trump’s presidency.The decision to issue the warrant “was made after the judge recorded the statements of the claimants from the family of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis,” according to a statement from the Supreme Judicial Council. The investigation into the killings is ongoing, the court said.The killings sparked a diplomatic crisis and strained US-Iraq ties, drawing the ire of Shiite political lawmakers who passed a non-binding resolution to pressure the government to oust foreign troops from the country.Iran-backed groups have since stepped up attacks against the American presence in Iraq, leading to threats by Washington to shutter its Baghdad diplomatic mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/soleimani-death-iraq-court-issues-arrest-warrant-against-donald-trump/story-z4hbG3QPDRayDPeduhLM3O.html

He is facing extradition to India on charges of major financial offences linked to a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).At the last hearing on November 3, citing the December 2018 judgment in the extradition case of businessman Vijay Mallya, the court had rejected objections by Modi’s defence team on admitting evidence submitted by the Indian government.District judge Samuel Goozee said he was bound by the Mallya judgment delivered by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, adding that he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi is the subject of two extradition requests - one lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Charges against Modi involve PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies’ loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs or loan agreements). The ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (“criminal intimidation to cause death”).The magistrates’ court had cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-extradition-case-closing-arguments-in-court-starting-today/story-yL82WXTXygUwcIZXkJ6ECK.html

And if it is needed, of course, then it will be used,” he said, referring to a field hospital that was set up at the start of the pandemic.England began a new national lockdown on Tuesday, with schools closed and citizens under orders to stay at home, as the government sought to contain a surge in infections, partly driven by a highly contagious new coronavirus variant.On Wednesday, the daily number of deaths from Covid-19 across the United Kingdom surpassed 1,000 for the first time since April. The country’s total Covid-19 death toll since the start of the pandemic is over 77,300, the highest in Europe.London and the southeast of England have been the areas worst-hit by the new variant.The Nightingale hospital, based at the ExCel conference centre in east London, was originally set up for Covid-19 critical care, but only 51 patients were treated there before it was mothballed in May.The British Medical Journal reported that it was being repurposed to take non-Covid patients recovering from operations and procedures, in order to relieve the unprecedented demand for beds elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-london-field-hospital-to-reopen-as-shortage-of-critical-beds-looms/story-84g6Q7Ha3zIfPn8yko48BJ.html

US damages totaled at least $95 billion, with $67 billion of that in insured losses, said Munich.The disasters piled up as the world came within 0.01 Celsius of tying the warmest year on record set in 2016, Munich said. While it didn’t draw direct link between 2020’s disasters and climate change, the insurer said the ongoing issues caused by a warming world would raise the potential for more perilous years ahead.“Even if the weather disasters for one year cannot be directly linked to climate change, and a longer period needs to be studied to assess their significance, these extreme values fit with the expected consequences of a decades-long warming trend for the atmosphere and oceans that is influencing risks,” said Ernst Rauch, chief climate and geoscientist at Munich Re.The year’s single worst disaster was flooding across China during its monsoon that amounted to $17 billion, of which only about 2% was insured, Munich said. Globally, 60% of 2020’s losses weren’t insured. The growing Asian economies saw the least number of insured losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-warmest-year-on-record-cost-the-world-210-billion/story-ZZ8rtz7fOOpFdZGfGD7zOK.html
07-01-2021||World||Mike Pence hits breaking point with Trump in blessing Joe Biden’s Win||Donald Trump’s relationship with his most loyal lieutenant, Mike Pence, splintered on Wednesday after the vice president defied the president’s call to overturn his loss in the November election.Trump attacked Pence on Twitter after the vice president announced he lacked the power to throw out Electoral College votes cast for President-elect Joe Biden. Pence, the president tweeted, “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”Desperate to cling to power, Trump turned what is normally a drama-free joint session of Congress to ratify the election results into a loyalty test for Pence. The gambit had catastrophic results, not just for the relationship between the president and vice president but also for the peaceful transition of power.Pro-Trump protesters violently stormed the US Capitol after Trump exhorted them to march to the building to support Republican lawmakers who planned to challenge Electoral College votes in some states. Pence found himself caught up in the chaos and had to evacuate from the Senate chamber after presiding over the joint session.Though Pence’s defiance of Trump’s demands he reject Electoral College votes was rooted in the Constitution, which gives the vice president no such power, it was still by far the vice president’s most serious break with his boss. Pence has been unfailingly loyal to Trump, never publicly criticizing the president or disagreeing with any policy.When the Senate reconvened hours later on Wednesday night, Pence condemned the Trump supporters who committed acts of violence yet did not mention the president by name. He vowed that protesters who breached the Capitol would be prosecuted, separating himself slightly from Trump, who has not suggested they did anything wrong.“To those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win,” the vice president said. “Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people’s House.”Wednesday’s events mark a devastating conclusion to their relationship, and the fallout may have implications for Pence’s political future, which included a possible presidential run of his own in 2024.Trump LoyalistsPence’s conclusion that the Constitution gave him no power to interfere with the count of Electoral College votes triggered criticism of the vice president in Trump’s inner circle, according to people familiar with the matter. Some of Trump’s allies believe Pence doomed his 2024 presidential aspirations by bucking Trump’s demands, and that the president’s loyalists will no longer be supportive of any of Pence’s future political endeavors, one of the people said.If so, Pence’s four years of unstintingly loyal service to the president would go unrewarded.He took on Herculean tasks, like overseeing the White House’s coronavirus response, and was exceedingly deferential to Trump when they appeared together in public. The approach allowed Pence to remain in Trump’s good graces without echoing his most outlandish claims.Tying himself so tightly to Trump could have allowed Pence to appeal to the president’s supporters if he decided to seek the Oval Office. But the blowback from the president over Wednesday’s events may spoil those plans.Signs of a split between Pence and Trump’s hardcore base began to emerge shortly after the election. Pence sought to focus on the coronavirus task force and the Senate runoff election in Georgia, rather than the Trump campaign’s election challenges.In public, the vice president raised concerns about the election and said every legal vote should be counted, but didn’t repeat Trump’s baseless claims the November contest was stolen.But Pence’s role in presiding over Congress’s Electoral College certification, which was completed early Thursday morning, proved to be too big of a challenge for his relationship with Trump to survive unscathed.Trump’s repeated insistence that he won re-election forced Pence into a bind between upholding the Constitution he swore to protect and supporting the president to whom he has shown devotion.Ministerial RoleAs president of the Senate, the vice president’s job is largely ministerial during the Electoral College ratification. Yet Trump for days argued that Pence had the power to refuse to certify electoral votes and send the matter back to states to decide.“If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency,” Trump tweeted on the eve of the vote.After consultations with his legal team and the Senate parliamentarian, Pence ultimately decided he could not do Trump’s bidding.“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence said in a letter to Congress released before the joint session.While Pence said it was within his power to allow lawmakers to challenge the results, the Constitution’s separation of powers prevented one single official from determining an election’s outcome.“Vesting the vice president with unilateral authority to decide presidential contests would be entirely antithetical to that design,” Pence said.In some ways, Trump’s decision to turn on his vice president shows how isolated the president has become in his final days in power. Republican leaders in Congress and some right-leaning news outlets have come to shun Trump’s insistence he won and have urged him to accept defeat. When Trump looked to Pence for his last stand, he was once again denied.During a fiery speech to supporters outside the White House before the joint session of Congress, Trump urged Pence not to join Republicans who had said they wouldn’t challenge the election results, deriding them as “weak” and “pathetic.”“I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do,” Trump said. “And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINO’s and the stupid people,” he added, using an acronym that refers to Republicans in name only.Minutes before Trump uttered that line, Pence had already announced he would not overturn the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-hits-breaking-point-with-trump-in-blessing-joe-biden-s-win/story-cHzYbDDdvlpRQg95axKxzL.html

Wong, who won the primary vote, has been repeatedly detained for his role in organising pro-democracy rallies. He was also among 12 opposition candidates disqualified from running in the legislative election, which has since been postponed with the government citing the coronavirus.Of Wednesday’s arrests, authorities cited the opposition’s campaign to win a majority in the legislative election with the view to pressure the government to enact democratic reforms by blocking its proposals in the city’s assembly.The arrests have raised alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn following the imposition of the new law, which targets what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was considering sanctions and other restrictions on those involved in the arrests.In response, China said the United States will pay a “heavy price” for its wrongdoing.Critics say the security law crushes wide-ranging freedoms unavailable elsewhere in China which were promised on the territory’s return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula.Supporters say it has restored order following months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.Since its imposition, leading activists such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai have been arrested, some democratic lawmakers have been disqualified, activists have fled into exile and protest slogans and songs have been declared illegal.It was unclear who could run for the opposition in any future polls following the mass arrests. Those arrested on Wednesday have yet to be charged and were expected to leave police stations on Thursday or Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-suspected-of-violating-city-s-new-security-law/story-fEmWtXoHR86UYoengmw8CN.html

07-01-2021||World||Donald Trump says his term is ending, transition will be orderly||President Donald Trump said there would be an “orderly transition on January 20th” after Congress concluded the electoral vote count early Thursday certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory hours after he appeared to excuse the violent occupation of the US Capitol by his supporters.Trump acknowledged defeat in the Nov. 3 election for the first time, after a day of chaos and destruction on Capitol Hill perpetrated in his name by supporters that halted business in Congress for more than six hours.“Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,” Trump said in a statement posted to Twitter by aides. His personal account was locked by the social media company for posting messages that appeared to justify the assault on the seat of the nation’s democracy.ALSO WATCH | How media captured the unprecedented storming of US Capitol Trump added, “While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!”Trump on Wednesday had encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol to protest lawmakers’ actions, expressed empathy for the mob, which violently forced its way inside, clashed with police and forced lawmakers into hiding.“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump wrote in a message that was later deleted by Twitter. He added, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”In an earlier video he had praised the protesters as “special” people and said he understood their pain. Twitter later locked his account for the first time as it demanded he remove the tweets and threatened “permanent suspension.”Also Read| US Congress certifies Joe Biden, Kamala Harris victory in US electionsTrump’s response to the violence underscored his monthslong obsession with trying to overturn the results of the election, spending the final days of his presidency angrily stewing and lashing out at Republicans for perceived disloyalty.Trump spent much of Wednesday afternoon watching the insurrection on television from his private dining room off the Oval Office. But aside from sparing appeals for calm issued at the insistence of his staff, he was largely disengaged as the nation’s capital descended into unprecedented scenes of chaos as a mob of thousands tried to halt the peaceful transition of power.Instead, a White House official said, most of Trump’s attention was consumed by his ire at Vice President Mike Pence, who said he would not overturn the will of voters in the congressional electoral count. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke only on the condition of anonymity.The violence, coupled with the president’s tepid response, appeared to drive many Republicans to the breaking point after years of allegiance to Trump. In a sign of growing frustration, a number of White House aides were discussing a potential mass resignation, according to people familiar with the conversation, although some harbored concerns about what Trump might do in his final two weeks in office if they were not there to serve as guardrails when so few remain.After four years with no shortage of fraught moments, Wednesday’s events quickly emerged as the nadir of morale in the Trump White House, as aides looked on in horror at the chaos at the Capitol fomented by Trump.Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s chief of staff and a former White House press secretary, submitted her resignation Wednesday, but declined to say what has prompted her move. Deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, White House social secretary Rickie Niceta and deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews also resigned, according to officials. More departures were expected in the coming days, officials said. But other aides indicated they were staying to help smooth the transition to President-elect Biden’s administration.Trump has been single-mindedly focused on his electoral defeat since Election Day, aides said, at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office, including the fight against the raging coronavirus. Indeed, it was Pence, not Trump, who spoke with the acting defense secretary to discuss mobilizing the D.C National Guard on Wednesday afternoon.Trump only reluctantly issued the tweets and taped a video encouraging an end to the violence. The posts came at the insistence of staff and amid mounting criticism from Republican lawmakers urging him to condemn the violence being perpetrated in his name, according to the official.And even as authorities struggled to take control of Capitol Hill after protesters overwhelmed police, Trump continued to level baseless allegations of mass voter fraud and praised his loyalists as “very special.”Also Read| Trump supporters storm US Capitol, 4 dead, 52 arrested: In photos“I know your pain. I know your hurt. But you have to go home now,” he said in a video posted more than 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated from the House and Senate chambers. “We can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You’re very special.”In a sign of the extraordinary events that had unfolded over the previous 24 hours, Trump’s statement acknowledging that he would leave office on Jan. 20 could not be posted on the president’s Twitter or Facebook feeds because both accounts have been suspended by the companies. Instead, it was released via the Twitter account of Trump’s social media director, Dan Scavino, who frequently tweets on his behalf.Hours earlier, Trump had appeared at a massive rally near the White House, where he continued to urge supporters to fight the election results and encouraged them to march to the Capitol in remarks that were peppered with incendiary language and rife with violent undertones. At one point, he even suggested he might join them — a prospect that was discussed by the White House but eventually abandoned.“We’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue ... and we’re going to the Capitol ... we’re going to try and give our Republicans ... the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country,” he said.Earlier in the rally, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had advocated what he had called “trial by combat.”Trump’s tweets and video also drew the attention of the social media giants he has frequently maligned. The video was removed by Facebook, “because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” said the site’s head of integrity, Guy Rosen. Twitter took a more punitive approach, locking Trump’s account and warning, “Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.”Before Trump released the video, Republican lawmakers and former administration officials had begged the president to intervene as the violence spiraled.“I called him. I think we need to make a statement, make sure that we can calm individuals down,” House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California told Fox News.A Senate ally, Republican Marco Rubio of Florida, appealed directly to the president in a tweet: “Mr. President @realDonaldTrump the men & women of law enforcement are under assault. It is crucial you help restore order by sending resources to assist the police and ask those doing this to stand down.”Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., posted a video message urging Trump to “call it off.”“This is banana republic crap that we’re watching right now,” said Gallagher, who had spoken out against objections from fellow Republicans to certifying the Electoral College vote that Biden won.Former White House staff also issued pleas.Also Watch| Watch how media captured the unprecedented storming of US Capitol“Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump — you are the only one they will listen to,” tweeted former White House communications director Alyssa Farah.Added his former chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney: “The best thing @realDonaldTrump could do right now is to address the nation from the Oval Office and condemn the riots. A peaceful transition of power is essential to the country and needs to take place on 1/20.”Pence, who was ushered out of the Senate chamber to a secure location as protesters breached the building, also called for protesters to disperse.“The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now,” he tweeted. “Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-his-term-is-ending-transition-will-be-orderly/story-EWx2vqDmrrqUhCLU4BvaqI.html

Without it I can’t leave the city,” one young woman at Shijiazhuang train station told state broadcaster CCTV.Three officials from Shijiazhuang’s Gaocheng district -- the epicentre of the latest outbreak -- were reprimanded for their handling of the outbreak, the local disciplinary commission said Thursday.The officials had allowed a woman who had tested positive to leave the area, the commission claimed.Gaocheng district has been declared high risk and sealed off, and authorities said tens of thousands have already been tested for the virus.There were 63 new Covid-19 infections in mainland China on Thursday, including 11 imported cases and one other domestic case in the northeast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-punished-as-china-logs-highest-daily-covid-cases-since-july/story-QekpaXCwxySTOV3Cn0SCWJ.html

Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters multiple times to come to Washington for a rally on the day the US House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled to certify the results of the Electoral College.US President-elect Joe Biden called the scenes at the US Capitol ‘chaotic’ and said they “do not represent who we are”.“Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now,” Biden said on Twitter.The violence, that forced lawmakers to flee the US Capitol, resulted in the death of four people. Among them was a woman who was shot by police. Three others lost their lives to medical emergencies, police of Washington DC said.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” Trump had tweeted on December 20. “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” he had said. After his supporters displayed violence at the US Capitol, he tweeted, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly unfairly treated for so long.” This message was later deleted by Twitter. He added, “Go home with love in peace. Remember this day forever!”Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday. His failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude at the time he threatened arrests to break up protests against racial inequality last year.The mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser, ordered a curfew in the nation’s capital beginning at 6pm Wednesday and later in the day, extended it for 15 days.Lawmakers resumed business after officials said the Capitol premises were safe, hours after the attack. They formally certified the electoral victory of Biden as the next US President and Kamala Harris as the Vice President in the November 3 election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-supporters-storm-us-capitol-4-dead-52-arrested-in-photos/story-36xFvpjUtHxGMpwxw3UzVO.html

07-01-2021||World||Kim vows to bolster North Korea’s military at party meeting||North Korea leader Kim Jong Un vowed to strengthen the country’s military defences in a speech at a major ruling party meeting that provides insights into his priorities amid growing economic challenges and a US presidential transition.Kim made clear his “will to reliably protect the security of the country and people and the peaceful environment of the socialist construction by placing the state defense capabilities on a much higher level, and put forth goals for realizing it,” the Korean Central News Agency said.The state media report Thursday on Kim’s speech to the Workers Party congress the previous day didn’t elaborate. North Korea has previously underscored its need for nuclear weapons and missiles as a deterrent and a pre-emptive strike capability to cope with what it describes as American hostility. Cheong Seong-Chang, a fellow at the Wilson Centers Asia Programme, said Kims speech likely contained “sensitive contents” that can provoke the United States and South Korea.Kim halted his country’s nuclear and long-range missile tests before engaging in high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump in 2018. But with his advancing arsenal on the negotiating table, their diplomacy fell apart due to wrangling over the weapons and US-led sanctions on North Korea.Kim since then has openly pledged to expand his nuclear capability that he says already put the American mainland within its striking range. However, he has not resumed high-profile weapons tests, which some analysts say could completely derail diplomacy with the United States and further diminish prospects for winning sanctions relief.South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in late November that Kim was worried about President-elect Joe Biden’s expected new approach on North Korea. Biden has called Kim a “thug” and criticized his summit diplomacy with Trump.This years congress — the first in five years — comes as Kim faces what appears to be the toughest moment since taking power in late 2011, due to what he calls “multiple crises” caused by an economy battered by pandemic-related border closings, a series of natural disasters and the sanctions. On the first day of the congress Tuesday, Kim admitted his previous economic development plans failed, saying that “almost all sectors fell a long way short of the set objectives.” He said the congress would work out a new five-year development plan. Kim on Wednesday presented goals for developing the North’s transport, construction, commerce and other industries and proposed ways to expand production in agriculture, light industry and fishing to improve public livelihoods, KCNA said.State media didnt provide much details on Kim’s economic review. Cheong said North Korea likely didnt want foreign experts to learn its poor economic performance too easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-vows-to-bolster-north-korea-s-military-at-party-meeting/story-lrIy9wyqGX5nx9jqszceXM.html
07-01-2021||World||Trump summoned supporters to ‘wild’ protest and told them to fight. They did||The chaos in the US Capitol on Wednesday unfolded after President Donald Trump spent weeks whipping up his supporters with false allegations of fraud in the Nov. 3 election, culminating in a call to march to the building that represents US democracy.Trump, who has refused to concede his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, had urged his supporters multiple times to come to Washington for a rally on Wednesday, the day the US House of Representatives and Senate were scheduled to certify the results of the Electoral College.“Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election,” Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Dec. 20. “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!”They turned out in the thousands and heard the president urge them to march on the Capitol building to express their anger at the voting process and to pressure their elected officials to reject the results. Also Read: Capitol Police fail to hold back pro-Trump mob with too few cops“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,” Trump told the crowd, speaking with the White House as a backdrop.Appearing at what could be his last rally as the sitting president, Trump exhorted his supporters “to fight.” “We will never give up, we will never concede,” Trump said, delighting the crowd by calling Democratic victories the product of what he called “explosions of bullshit.”“Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!” people chanted in reply.Trump has sought for weeks to thwart a peaceful transfer of power, aided by groups like “Stop the Steal,” which promoted https://stopthesteal.us the day’s protest and peddled false claims about voter fraud on Facebook and other social media.Wednesday’s events were the culmination of those efforts. About 50 minutes into the speech, some of his supporters, waving Trump flags, began heading toward Capitol Hill, where unprecedented mayhem ensued. Protesters fought through police barricades, stormed the building and entered lawmakers’ chambers. The certification process was stopped and Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress were evacuated.One civilian was shot dead, Washington police said. As night fell, a Capitol official said the building had been cleared, but outside some way from the grounds, scores of protesters remained, including members of militia and far-right groups.‘I KNOW YOU’RE HURT’ Monitoring the scenes of violence on cable news television from the Oval Office, Trump tweeted about an hour after the Capitol was put on lockdown that the protesters should “remain peaceful.” As criticism mounted that he had incited a riot, he was urged to say more by a Trump stalwart, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, and some of the advisers who remain in the White House for his dwindling days in office.Biden had come out forcefully on live television and said the violence was “not a protest, it’s insurrection.” He called on Trump to demand “an end to this siege.”Eventually, Trump posted a recorded video on Twitter.Also Read: Lawmakers vow to investigate police after Capitol breach“I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election,” Trump said, repeating familiar falsehoods. “But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order.”He posted another message that called the mob “great patriots” who were reacting to an election victory “viciously stripped away.” Twitter later hid three tweets and locked Trump’s account.Trump’s failure to rein in his supporters stood in sharp contrast to his attitude last summer when he threatened arrests and the use of force to break up protests against racial inequality.During the Black Lives Matter protests, Trump discussed using the military in response, and an area near the White House was forcibly cleared for him to stage a photo-op in front of a church, holding a Bible. Democrats and some Republicans blamed Trump for inciting the violence on Wednesday.“Today’s violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump,” Jim Mattis, a former defense secretary under Trump, said in a statement.Weeks have passed since the states completed certifying that Biden won by 306 votes in the Electoral College to Trump’s 232, and Trump’s extraordinary challenges to the result have failed in courts across the country.Yet Trump’s rally speech on Wednesday was filled with grievances and voter fraud allegations that have not been backed up with evidence. He singled out several Republican lawmakers for criticism, including Senator Mitt Romney and Representative Liz Cheney, while hailing as heroes those who have sided with him to stop the electoral votes from being certified.Several times he also urged Pence to intervene. But while Trump was still speaking, Pence released a lengthy statement saying he would carry out his constitutional duty to certify the vote.“It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence wrote.About an hour later he was being escorted from the House chamber as a mob tried to break in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-summoned-supporters-to-wild-protest-and-told-them-to-fight-they-did/story-dDmAECeNO9IeixZ1XOhiDI.html
07-01-2021||World||Japan to declare Covid-19 emergency for Tokyo region after record daily infections||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to declare a state of emergency Thursday for Tokyo and adjacent areas, trying to stem Covid-19 infections that hit a daily record in the capital.The declaration will cover the capital and the surrounding prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba, and is likely to be imposed from Friday until Feb. 7, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said. It will be revoked when infections fall below levels laid out by the government, he added.Suga is set to hold a news conference at 6 p.m. to discuss the matter. Tokyo found more than 2,000 cases of coronavirus Thursday, a record, broadcaster NHK reported, citing an unidentified official.Japan’s emergency doesn’t imply the kind of lockdowns seen in some parts of Europe, and the government is seeking far less stringent measures than under its previous emergency last year, which triggered the worst economic contraction on record.Residents will be asked to avoid going out only after 8 p.m. and bars and restaurants will be instructed to close at that time. Authorities can’t enforce compliance for now, though Suga is seeking to amend the law to add penalties for businesses that don’t abide by government measures, and formalize incentives for those that do.Bloomberg Economics’ Yuki Masujima sees the emergency declaration shaving up to 0.7% off the economy for each month it lasts. Tokyo and neighboring areas account for about one-third of the country’s gross domestic product.Ballooning infections have been a blow for Suga, who had sought to restore growth despite the pandemic, including by offering domestic travel incentives to bolster the tourism industry. His public support has slumped, with polls showing most voters favor tougher pandemic measures.“This increases the possibility of an economic contraction,” economist Yoshimasa Maruyama at SMBC Nikko Securities said of the emergency. “Suga wanted to wait until after the New Year’s holiday to make the declaration and that has put him behind the curve to limit the spread of the virus.”Even before Suga first hinted he would declare an emergency, the economic recovery was forecast to slow in the first three months of 2021, with companies scaling back investment and households opting to save more.The restrictions on activities are likely to hamper the effectiveness of the economic stimulus package Suga put together last month, which is to be funded by an extra budget. The package is no longer suitable in the current environment, Nomura Research Institute economist Takahide Kiuchi said in a research note.“The government should change the content of the third extra budget and change the course of economic policy in order to strengthen support for companies and individuals,” Kiuchi said.The emergency declaration decision will be formally announced after a day of consultations with advisers and reports to parliamentary committees. An advisory panel on the pandemic on Thursday approved the emergency proposal, Nishimura said.It will be the second in Japan after a declaration that began in April, but is not expected to cause as much pain as the first, when the virus slammed the brakes on the economy and sent it into its worst downturn.Suga’s signature “Go To” travel campaign, which had already been suspended through Jan. 11, is unlikely to be revived while the state of emergency is in place. The government will press for a return to remote work, aiming to cut the number of commuters in the region by 70%, Nishimura said. Schools, however, will not be asked to close and university entrance exams will go ahead as scheduled.Japan has had by far the lowest infections of any Group of Seven nation, recording fewer cases in the past year than the US has seen in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-declare-covid-19-emergency-for-tokyo-region-after-record-daily-infections/story-cPHgpokQzVF0GgPIYnc3rK.html
07-01-2021||World||Capitol Police fail to hold back pro-Trump mob with too few cops||The US Capitol Police force was caught unprepared by a mob of pro-Trump extremists on Wednesday, in a failure to protect the seat of American democracy unparalleled in modern times.Rioters, many bearing Trump garb, breached the barricades set up by an under-staffed police force and swarmed the Capitol, disrupting the certification of President-Elect Joe Biden’s election and forcing the evacuation of Vice President Mike Pence and other lawmakers.One woman was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer, Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee III told reporters late on Wednesday, without divulging more details about the circumstances of the shooting. He said at least 14 officers were also injured, one seriously, during the disruptions.Calm was eventually restored after the National Guard was called out and more than a dozen people were arrested. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a 6 pm-6 am curfew and later extended an emergency declaration for 15 days, pushing it just past Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.With Washington routinely the scene of large protests, the Capitol Police “should have been preparing for this for years,” said Daniel Schuman, policy director at Demand Progress, an advocacy group. “So the question is, ‘Why did they fail so terribly?”’The failure is all the more remarkable because local authorities were on high alert over the arrival of thousands of Trump supporters as they gathered to hear the defeated president -- who had invited the protests -- bemoan the unfounded allegations of election fraud.“They knew this group was coming, they knew it was going to be enormous but they didn’t do any preparation to control the crowd such as fencing, barricades, and cement structures to prevent traffic and people flow,” said Timothy Dimoff, a former SWAT force member who runs a security consulting company.A spokesperson for the Capitol Police did not respond to a request for comment on criticism surrounding preparations for the day.The mayhem shortly after midday signalled the start of an extraordinary episode that saw District of Columbia police, officers from neighbouring Virginia and Maryland, and the D.C. National Guard join to recover control of the US Capitol from the president’s supporters.“It was clear that the crowd was intent on causing harm to our officers by deploying chemical irritants on police, to force entry into the United States Capitol building,” Contee said in an earlier news conference.“What we witnessed was unlawful and riotous behavior,” Contee said.Protesters flooded the building, with some of them entering the House chamber and sitting at the dais while one man apparently entered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. Video on social media showed one policeman desperately trying to hold back more than a dozen protesters as they ran up the stairs inside the building.Around 3 pm, the District of Columbia’s National Guard called out its entire roster of about 1,100 people to help restore control, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said. The D.C. National Guard is unique among such forces because it reports only to the president.By nightfall, police were using flash-bang devices to disperse crowds around the building. The US Capitol was declared secure on Wednesday evening, about four hours after the mob stormed the building. Debate on certification of the Electoral College soon resumed, with lawmakers clearly shaken by the day’s events.On the floor of the Senate Wednesday evening, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the breakdown at the Capitol “a stain on our country not so easily washed away.” Many Republicans put the blame on Donald Trump, with longtime ally Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas saying it was “past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence.”‘Go Home Now’While Trump eventually told violent protesters who stormed the US Capitol to “go home now,” he earlier egged them on to help stop the transfer of power from taking place.“President Trump doesn’t say go out and attack the Capitol but he is encouraging people to believe that the election was stolen,” said Jessica Stern, a professor on terrorism and white supremacy at Boston University. “The pressure has built up to the point they felt inspired to act now.”The Capitol Police force describes its mission as protecting “Congress, Members of Congress, employees, visitors, and Congressional buildings and grounds from crime, disruption, and terrorism.”The department has an authorized sworn strength of more than 2,000 and an annual budget of $460 million. In addition it has over 350 civilian personnel who provide operational and administrative support.Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking House GOP leader, applauded their efforts.“You saw the Capitol Police do what they do every day. They risked their lives for us,” Scalise said in a statement after the Capitol had been secured. “They keep the Capitol safe — those heroes that we love.”But Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, chairman of the panel responsible for funding the Capitol Police, told reporters that some law enforcement officials should lose their jobs.“It’s pretty clear that there’s going to be a number of people who are going to be without employment very, very soon,” Ryan, of Ohio, said in a digital press conference Wednesday. He criticized “the lack of professional planning and dealing with what we knew was going to occur.”Ryan, chairman of the House Appropriations Legislative Branch subcommittee, said he talked to House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and Capitol Police officials about the long-planned protest as recently as Tuesday, and that it was clear protesters were not supposed to be “anywhere near the Capitol,” instead restricted to a nearby area to “protest and express your view,” Ryan said.House Administration Chairperson Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, promised a review of Capitol security.“The breach today at the US Capitol raises grave security concerns,” Lofgren said in a statement.Republicans Recoil From Trump After Mob Violence Proves Too MuchPeople who went up the Capitol steps should have been immediately arrested, and there should have been reinforcements ready to help, Ryan said.“There were clearly enormous strategic and planning failures by the Capitol Police, by the sergeant at arms, and anybody else who was a part of coordinating this effort here,” Ryan said.The US Capitol Historical Society, a congressionally chartered educational group, posted a message on its website Wednesday under the heading, “Democracy is Stronger Than Terror.”The then unfinished building first housed Congress in 1800 and was famously overrun and burned by British troops in 1814 as part of the War of 1812.“The United States Capitol Historical Society is shocked and heartbroken by today’s violent disregard for American values and our Constitution,” the group said. “The US Capitol is more than a building – it is the embodiment of American democracy and our way of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-fail-to-hold-back-pro-trump-mob-with-too-few-cops/story-ArY40zkR3XdggfthroU1JM.html
07-01-2021||World||Lawmakers vow to investigate police after Capitol breach||Lawmakers are vowing an investigation into how law enforcement handled Wednesday’s violent breach at the Capitol, questioning whether a lack of preparedness allowed a mob to occupy and vandalize the building.US Capitol Police, who are charged with protecting Congress, turned to other law enforcement for help with the mob that overwhelmed the complex and sent lawmakers into hiding. Both law enforcement and Trump supporters deployed chemical irritants during the hours long occupation of the complex before it was cleared Wednesday evening.Four people died, one of them a woman who was shot and killed inside the Capitol. Three other people died after suffering “medical emergencies” related to the breach, said Robert Contee, chief of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department.Police said 52 people were arrested as of Wednesday night, including 26 on the Capitol grounds. Fourteen police officers were injured.Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Administration Committee, said the breach “raises grave security concerns,″ adding that her committee will work with House and Senate leaders to review the police response — and its preparedness.Lawmakers crouched under desks and donned gas masks while police futilely tried to barricade the building when people marched to the Capitol from a rally near the White House in support of President Donald Trump. Washington’s mayor instituted an evening curfew in an attempt to contain the violence.Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a former police chief, said it was “painfully obvious” that Capitol police “were not prepared for today. I certainly thought that we would have had a stronger show of force, that there would have been steps taken in the very beginning to make sure that there was a designated area for the protesters in a safe distance from the Capitol.’‘In an interview with MSNBC Wednesday night, Demings said it appeared police were woefully understaffed, adding that “it did not seem that they had a clear operational plan to really deal with” thousands of protesters who descended on the Capitol following Trump’s complaints of a “rigged election.’‘The rioters were egged on by Trump, who has spent weeks falsely attacking the integrity of the election and had urged his supporters to come to Washington to protest Congress’ formal approval of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. The protests interrupted those proceedings for nearly seven hours.The mob broke windows, entered both the Senate and House chambers and went into the offices of lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Demings said there were “a lot of unanswered questions and I’m damn determined to get answers to those questions about what went wrong today.’‘A police spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said she was outraged to see accounts on social media of a Capitol Police officer posing for a photo with a protester. “Would you take a selfie with someone who was robbing a bank?” she asked. “I can’t imagine if a couple of thousand of (Black Lives Matters) protesters had descended on the Capitol ... that there would be 13 people arrested.”Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, suggested there could be leadership changes at the Capitol police.“I think it’s pretty clear that there’s going to be a number of people who are going to be without employment very, very soon because this is an embarrassment both on behalf of the mob, and the president, and the insurrection, and the attempted coup, but also the lack of professional planning and dealing with what we knew was going to occur,” Ryan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-vow-to-investigate-police-after-capitol-breach/story-GaCKEfePRuACCEjSI3UCPP.html
07-01-2021||World||At least four dead after Trump supporters ransack US Capitol||At least four people have been reported dead, according to latest reports, as supporters of President Donald Trump stormed US Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, overpowered security personnel to reach deep inside the building, forced lawmakers to shelter in place under desks and in rooms, and brought to a halt a key constitutional procedure that had just got under way to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.Clashes broke out between the insurrectionists and security personnel and several people were reported injured apart from the deaths. The injured include law enforcement personnel and dozens have been taken into custody. They had been driven out of the building by late evening. But even though a nighttime curfew came into effect at 6pm, the mobs, though thinned down, continued to loiter around the complex, menacingly, hurling invectives at police.“To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, and to threaten the safety of duly elected officials is not protest,” Biden said in remarks to the nation. “It is insurrection. The world is watching - and like so many other Americans, I am shocked and saddened that our nation, so long a beacon of light, hope, and democracy has come to such a dark moment.”Former President George W Bush, a Republican, also slammed the mob action as an “insurrection”, as did other Republicans such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Mitt Romney, also a 2012 presidential nominee.Calls went up shortly for Trump to be impeached, even if there were just two more weeks left of his term, or be removed from office under the 25th Amendment of US constitution, which empowers the federal cabinet to sideline the president finding him unfit to govern. Leading legal experts such as Lawrence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told CNN that Trump had “engaged in inciting sedition”.The world watched in horror as well. “Distressed to see news about rioting and violence in Washington, DC. Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue. The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests,” said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a close Trump ally, tweeted. Statements of shock and outrage flowed from capitals of other US allies and partners.The rioters had marched to the Capitol from a rally nearby where Trump had railed against his election defeat, attributing it to fraud and cheating. And then he called on them to march on the Capitol, promising to walk with them. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump told his cheering supporters, referring to the certification process. “And we’re probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.” But he did not walk with them. He went back to the White House to watch the mayhem on TV.Men and women carrying Trump campaign flags and the national flag stormed the over 200-year-old Capitol, which was last breached in 1812 by the British in a war, overwhelming security personnel with their sheer numbers. They made it to the well of the Senate and one of them posed for pictures sitting in the Senate president’s seat, which was occupied by Vice-President Pence just a while ago. Another man went into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, took her seat and posed for pictures with his feet up on her desk. One of them left a note for her, “We will not back down.”US congress had just started a joint session at the time to certify Biden’s election victory. And the two chambers had broken up to debate, separately under the rules, the first of the several objections Trump’s allies in congress had planned to raise against the certification. They were soon sheltering in place as rioters took over the building, forcing back Capitol police, some of whom were seen posing for selfies with the rioters. The process resumed later in the evening after the complex had been cleared of Trump’s supporters.Though shocked and outraged, leaders of both parties resolved to put forth a joint front to demonstrate they would not be intimidated and resumed the certification process later in the evening. They planned to continue the process as long as it would take, even if it meant going through the night.As news of the insurrection spread, calls were issued for Trump, as the instigator and inciter, to intervene and call off his supporters. He ignored them for a while and then responded with an insipid tweet saying, “Stay peaceful.”He posted another tweet and then, after a public appeal from Biden to “step up”, Trump posted a long message with a video, in which he reiterated his claim the election was stolen, appealed to the rioters to go home calling them patriots and saying he loved them.Facebook took down that video and so did Twitter, which went a step further and locked the US president’s Twitter account for 12 hours.“This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” said Guy Rosen of Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-four-dead-after-trump-supporters-ransack-us-capitol/story-bQdcE70WtTsGpBWQSu3RNL.html
07-01-2021||World||Former US presidents denounce Capitol violence||Every living former US president on Wednesday denounced the violence of a mob that stormed the Capitol building in Washington, forcing lawmakers to flee to safety and leaving one woman dead.The crowd, made up of supporters of President Donald Trump, opposed the certification underway in Congress of Joe Biden’s presidential election win in November. George W. Bush called out fellow Republicans for fueling the “insurrection,” likening the situation to a “banana republic.”“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement,” Bush’s statement said, in a barely veiled swipe at Trump. Barack Obama also blamed Republicans and Trump, “who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election,” he said in a statement. Also Read: ‘Moment of shame’: Obama calls on Republicans to speak out in response to US Capitol violenceTrump’s most recent predecessor called the incident “a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation.” “But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise,” Obama said, calling the events of the day “the consequences” of Trump and his supporters refusing to accept the results of last year’s election. Bill Clinton denounced the riot as “unprecedented assault” on the US Capitol and the nation itself.“Today we faced an unprecedented assault on our Capitol, our Constitution, and our country,” the Democratic former president said in a statement.“The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers, including many in Congress, to overturn the results of an election he lost.”And the oldest member of the exclusive club, 96-year-old Democrat Jimmy Carter, said he was “troubled” by Wednesday’s scenes, which he called a “national tragedy.” “We join our fellow citizens in praying for a peaceful resolution so our nation can heal and complete the transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries,” he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-presidents-denounce-capitol-violence/story-0H1OCYEKJ3Tpxt2HjN9KvO.html

07-01-2021||World||China goes online to mock ‘beautiful sight’ of US Capitol chaos||China’s internet erupted in mirth at America’s troubled democracy after supporters of President Donald Trump broke into the US Capitol, comparing the chaos to the Hong Kong anti-government protests of 2019.On Thursday morning, state media tabloid Global Times tweeted side-by-side photo comparisons of Hong Kong protesters occupying the city’s Legislative Council Complex in July 2019 with Wednesday’s Washington riots.The latter saw hardcore Trump fans invade the US Capitol to protest the election defeat, taking selfies, scuffling with security and ransacking parts of the building.Also Read: Former US President Obama says Trump incited violence at the Capitol“@SpeakerPelosi once referred to the Hong Kong riots as ‘a beautiful sight to behold’,” the Global Times said in the tweet, referring to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s June 2019 comment about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy demonstrations, which were mostly peaceful at that time.“It remains yet to be seen whether she will say the same about the recent developments in Capitol Hill.”China’s Communist Youth League also described the unrest as a “beautiful sight” on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.The hashtag “Trump supporters storm US Capitol” pinballed across Weibo on Thursday, racking up 230 million views, as users compared the global support for Hong Kong’s protesters with the outpouring of condemnation for the pro-Trump mob.“At present, all European countries’ leaders have shown double standards and condemned it (Washington rioting),” read one Weibo comment which gained over 5,000 likes.Also Read: World leaders are appalled by storming of US Capitol“I don’t know what kind of double-standard reports will be carried by Hong Kong or Taiwan media this time.” “What happened in the Hong Kong Legislative Council last year is being repeated in the US Capitol,” wrote another user in a comment with over 4,500 likes. Hong Kong protesters had stormed the legislature to demand democracy -- a battle they appear to have lost as China smothers the territory with a national security law, sweeping oppositions figures and activists up in mass arrests.US President-elect Joe Biden said the US rioters were undermining democracy by trying to overturn Trump’s defeat in November’s election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-goes-online-to-mock-beautiful-sight-of-us-capitol-chaos/story-Qxtjg7lajRdMnoywgf4tUO.html

07-01-2021||World||Cabinet members discussing Trump’s removal: US media||Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet on Wednesday discussed the possibility of removing Trump from office after his supporters stormed the Capitol, three US news channels reported.The discussions focused on the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, which allows for a president’s removal by the vice president and cabinet if he is judged “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” Invoking it would require Vice President Michael Pence to lead the cabinet in a vote on removing him.CNN quoted unnamed Republican leaders saying the 25th amendment had been discussed, saying they had described Trump as “out of control.”CBS reporter Margaret Brennan said that “nothing formal” had been presented to Pence, and ABC reporter Katherine Faulders said “multiple” sources had told her that discussions took place on the unprecedented move.Trump’s encouragement of the protesters, his unfounded claims that he lost the November 3 presidential election due to massive fraud, and other bizarre behavior have raised questions about his ability to lead.While only two weeks remain before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, after the attacks on Congress Wednesday Democratic lawmakers called for invoking the 25th Amendment as well.Democrats of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Pence urging him to act to remove Trump, saying he had stoked an act of insurrection and “sought to undermine our democracy.”Pointing to a rambling speech Trump gave Wednesday, it said he “revealed that he is not mentally sound and is still unable to process and accept the results of the 2020 election.”Others blamed Trump for fueling terrorism.“The President incited a domestic terror attack on the Capitol. He is an imminent threat to our democracy and he needs to be removed from office immediately,” said Representative Kathleen Rice in a tweet.“The Cabinet must invoke the 25th Amendment,” she wrote.The lawmakers’ call was echoed by the influential Washington Post.“Responsibility for this act of sedition lies squarely with the president, who has shown that his continued tenure in office poses a grave threat to US democracy. He should be removed,” the Post said.“The president is unfit to remain in office for the next 14 days. Every second he retains the vast powers of the presidency is a threat to public order and national security,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cabinet-members-discussing-trump-s-removal-us-media/story-LywjMxgMzsOkhGu980HXEP.html
07-01-2021||World||Building, location and importance: US Capitol Hill fast facts||There were unprecedented scenes in Washington, DC on Wednesday evening after thousands of Donald Trump’s supporters laid siege to the US Capitol. These supporters want Trump’s defeat in the US presidential election in November last year overturned.The trigger for these protest was a speech given by Trump, who asked his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election and march on the Capitol where a ceremony is being held to certify the Electoral College votes that will formalise President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.The scenes that Americans are accustomed to watching in distant lands, played out in their own backyard as the protesters pushed through police barricades and broke windows. The violence also included gunshots fired in the Capitol, which led to the death of a woman.Here is everything you need to know about the seat of the US government.About the building and US Capitol complexThe five square kilometre neighbourhood houses about a dozen, most high-profile buildings of the United States, including the Senate, the house of Representatives and the Supreme Court.It is one of the oldest residential neighbourhood in Washington, DC. According to the US Capitol Visitor Centre, the construction began in 1793 and the country’s Congress met for the first time in the completed portion in November, 1800.The Capitol was expanded after a legislation was passed in 1850. The architectural work took 18 years to get completed, according to the visitor centre. The Capitol has more than 540 rooms, according to the visitor centre.The RotundaThe Rotunda is the very heart of the Capitol. Although it serves no legislative function, it is a ceremonial centre where state funerals have been held for presidents from Abraham Lincoln to Lyndon Johnson, distinguished members of Congress, military heroes, and eminent citizens.Many visiting heads of state have been received in the Rotunda, and memorable individuals and events celebrated.How important is the US Capitol?Symbolically, the United States Capitol is among the most important buildings in the country. It stands as the monument to the American people and their government.The Capitol complex also has a museum of American art and history. It has a separate police branch - the US Capitol Police - which is entrusted with protecting the Congress members, employees and visitors.The domed Capitol building has for centuries been the scene of protests and occasional violence, including a 1954 shooting involving Puerto Rican nationalists. But Wednesday’s events were particularly astounding both because they unfolded at least initially with the implicit blessing of the president and because of the underlying goal of overturning the results of a free and fair presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/building-location-and-importance-us-capitol-fast-facts/story-wVlsvMIX0waqqcK4f7RbFN.html

07-01-2021||World||Twitter, Facebook and Instagram muzzle Trump amid US Capitol violence||Hours after supporters of Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol, social media giants Twitter, Facebook and Instagram locked the outgoing President’s page on their respective platforms.Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and said that future violations by Trump could result in a permanent suspension. The company had asked Trump to delete three of his tweets, including a short video, which is at the centre of the storm.Trump deleted those posts; had they remained, Twitter had threatened to extend the suspension of his account.Facebook and the platform its owns - Instagram - said Trump’s pages will be blocked for 24 hours, reported Associated Press. Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, said, “This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video.”“This is what happens,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a communications professor at Syracuse University. “We didn’t just see a breach at the Capitol. Social media platforms have been breached by the president repeatedly. This is disinformation. This was a coup attempt in the United States.”So far, YouTube has not taken similar action to muzzle Trump.Trump has harnessed social media - especially Twitter - as a potent tool for spreading misinformation about the election. Wednesday’s riot only increased calls to ban Trump from the platform.In the video which has now been deleted by social media platforms, Trump had expressed empathy for the mob which violently forced its way inside, clashed with police and forced lawmakers into hiding.“These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,” Trump said in the message. He added, “Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!”Trump has been single-mindedly focused on his electoral defeat since Election Day, aides said, at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office, including the fight against the raging coronavirus.

07-01-2021||World||Democrats’ Georgia alliance is diverse and broad. Is it durable?||President Donald Trump came to the north Georgia mountains Monday night to gin up turnout in conservative strongholds and stave off the Democratic challengers who threatened the GOP’s Senate majority in two runoff elections.It didn’t work.Republicans’ overwhelming white, older and rural and exurban coalition failed the GOP Senate candidates in Tuesday’s high-stakes elections, while Democrats proved their alliance that succeeded in defeating Donald Trump in the state in November was not a fluke.Black and young voters, suburbanites and the many recent arrivals to the state showed up a second time in two months to back Democrats, handing Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock narrow victories over Republicans David Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler.Across Georgia, a fast-growing, diversifying Deep South state, Tuesday’s election returns told the same story: Record runoff turnout -- more than 4.4 million -- didn’t match the 5 million ballots cast in November, but Democrats consistently came closer than their rivals to replicating their November vote totals, even in the large towns where Trump rallied.It was true in north Georgia’s Whitfield County, Trump territory, where Perdue and Loeffler got 89% of the votes that Perdue won in the general election, when he led all Senate candidates in the first round of voting. That would be an impressive showing in most runoffs, which almost invariably see a turnout drop. But Ossoff and Warnock managed slightly more than 90% of their November totals.And it was true across the Atlanta suburbs, both the northern, whiter enclaves that have for two decades assured statewide victories for Republicans and the southern ring of communities where Black voters tilt the ledger to Democrats. Democrats also outperformed Republicans in metro Atlanta, the center of an ever-expanding footprint that has remade the Georgia economy and, now, its politics.Behind the Democrats’ victories — two months after Biden became the first Democrat since 1992 to win the state’s presidential electoral votes — are a mix of factors: The double runoffs and their national consequences brought bottomless resources to a party infrastructure that had been expanding for years.Black voters were driven by the possibility of Warnock becoming the state’s first Black senator, an achievement coveted even more coming two years after Democrat Stacey Abrams narrowly missed becoming the first Black female governor in US history.And Trump shadowed over it all as he sowed chaos within his party over his fraudulent claims of a rigged election and continued to repel college-educated suburbanites. Democrats narrowly edged out Republicans among that group, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 3,700 Georgia voters.Democrats argue their new path to power in Georgia will outlast the president.“We’ve been building a multiracial, multiethnic, multigenerational statewide coalition — truly a statewide coalition for years,” said Lauren Groh-Wargo, who managed Abrams’ 2018 campaign and has been at the center of organizing work conducted by a range of groups on the left.According to AP VoteCast, Democrats were competitive with the help of small but mighty groups in the diversifying state. Black voters — 32% of the electorate in the runoff, according to the survey — supported Ossoff and Warnock almost universally. VoteCast showed Black voters were 29% of the November electorate. That slight uptick could by itself account for tipping statewide results in a close Georgia election.Voters in households earning under $50,000 are roughly 40% of voters in the state, and about 6 in 10 backed Democrats. And, even as Republicans hoped Loeffler might appeal to female voters, Democrats handily won majorities of women in cities and suburbs, Black and Latino women and college-educated women.The racial divide in the state was stark. Sixty percent of voters were white, and about three-quarters of them backed Republicans. The GOP candidates won majorities of white voters with and without a college degree, across age groups and genders. Roughly two-thirds of small town and rural voters supported Loeffler and Perdue, including comparable shares of men and women. Voters who have lived in Georgia for more than 20 years — about two-thirds of all voters — slightly favored the GOP.But it wasn’t enough in rapidly changing Georgia.Since 2017, census figures show that roughly 280,000 people moved to to the state annually. That influx has steadily tilted the state away from Republicans. About 6 in 10 of voters who moved there within the past 20 years voted for the Democrats, VoteCast found.That growth has pushed suburbs deeper into the state. The Atlanta area has expanded an average 61 square miles each year between 1990 and 2010, almost two times more than any other city in the country, according to economist Issi Romem. The rapid expansion caused Atlanta’s suburbs to become denser and more diverse, a pattern that favored improved margins for Democrats.Roughly half of Georgia’s voters in the Senate runoffs identified as suburban; Democrats won this group 54% to 46%, according to VoteCast.Republicans bemoaned those losses in places that once solidified GOP victories statewide.“Suburbs, my friends, the suburbs,” wrote Josh Holmes, a former top aide to outgoing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, on Twitter. “I feel like a one trick pony but here we are again. We went from talking about jobs and the economy to ... election conspiracies in 4 short years and — as it turns out — they were listening!”By about 2 to 1, moderate voters favored Ossoff and Warnock, according to VoteCast.Democrats have been mining Georgia’s suburbs for support for years and effectively capitalized on expanded mail and early voting opportunities this election season.About 6 in 10 Georgia voters say they were contacted on behalf of Democratic candidates, compared with about half for Republican candidates, according to VoteCast. Democratic voters were roughly twice as likely as Republican voters to say they responded to the contact by receiving help with registering, planning when to vote or voting absentee.The evidence showed up in the results.Cherokee County, fast-growing suburbs and exurbs north of Atlanta, remains a deep trove of Republican votes, even as Democrats have upped their performance in years. But Loeffler and Perdue managed just 90% of Perdue’s November high mark of nearly 100,000 — a net loss of more than 9,000 votes. Ossoff managed 94% of his November total, with Warnock a percentage point higher.South of Atlanta is Clayton County, which has the highest proportion of Democratic votes in the metro area. Democrats’ raw vote totals there are often comparable to Republicans’ in Cherokee. On Tuesday, Ossoff and Warnock managed 96% of Democrats’ November total, losing only 3,500 votes. The Republicans matched less than 80%.Groh-Wargo, the Democratic strategist and organizer, said the population growth and Democrats’ efforts across the state will intensify, not wane, after the victories.“The party that is reaching out and expanding across demographics, geography, figuring out how to connect with all voters,” she said, “the party that’s doing that is going to be the ascendant party in Georgia and any diverse state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-georgia-alliance-is-diverse-and-broad-is-it-durable/story-FvS0U1N9dGaZfL8zAh5FRL.html
07-01-2021||World||Twitter, Facebook suspend Trump accounts after violence at US Capitol||In an unprecedented move, Twitter and Facebook have suspended President Donald Trump’s accounts after he continued to push conspiracy theories about the November 3 election following the storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.Twitter suspended Trump’s account for 12 hours and also blocked three of his tweets including a video of his address to his supporters.“As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington, DC, we have required the removal of three realDonaldTrump Tweets that were posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,” Twitter Safety said.“This means that the account of @realDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these Tweets. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked,” said the social media company.Twitter also warned of permanent suspension of Trump’s account if he continued to violate its policies. “Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account,” it said.”Our public interest policy — which has guided our enforcement action in this area for years — ends where we believe the risk of harm is higher and/or more severe,” it said, adding that it will continue to evaluate the situation in real-time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter.“We will keep the public informed, including if further escalation in our enforcement approach is necessary,” it said.Facebook said it would be blocking the president’s account from posting for 24 hours due to two policy violations.One of Trump’s tweets that was removed by Twitter included a video of him repeating unfounded claims that the election was taken from him and encouraging his supporters to disperse after violence erupted at the Capitol.He said that law and order were needed and that he loved his supporters.Facebook and YouTube have removed the video from Trump’s accounts.Trump posted that video after protesters entered the Capitol, interrupting lawmakers meeting in joint session to confirm the Electoral College results and President-elect Joe Bidens victory in the election.“I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it--especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order,” Trump said in his video that lasted for less than a minute. “This was a fraudulent election but we can’t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace, so go home. We love you. You’re very special. You’ve seen what happens. You see the way, others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace,” Trump said.Trump has refused to concede the election. He alleges that there was a massive fraud and electoral malpractice. Election officials have denied the allegations. Facebook’s vice president integrity Guy Rosen said: “This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump’s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” In a blog post on October 15, 2019, Twitter said that the accounts of world leaders are not above its policies entirely.It listed out areas that will result in enforcement action for an account on its service.Prominent among them include the promotion of terrorism, clear and direct threats of violence against an individual, posting private information, such as a home address or non-public personal phone number; and posting or sharing intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-facebook-freeze-trump-accounts-as-tech-giants-respond-to-storming-of-us-capitol/story-53vdXjMkrxQJWytfHhi5TK.html

Biden, who is just days away from his inauguration, called it disorder and not dissent.“Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it’s disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now,” Biden said on Twitter. Let me be very clear: the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not represent who we are. What we are seeing is a small number of extremists dedicated to lawlessness. This is not dissent, it's disorder. It borders on sedition, and it must end. Now.“Today is a reminder, a painful one, that democracy is fragile.

07-01-2021||World||World leaders are appalled by storming of US Capitol||Leaders around the world condemned the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump on Wednesday, expressing shock at the chaos unfolding in a country they once relied upon for global leadership.“Disgraceful scenes in US Congress,” tweeted Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, a staunch ally of the United States over generations. “The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.”Other allies were similarly appalled at what they described as an attack on American democracy, though some said they believed US democratic institutions would withstand the turmoil. Some leaders singled out Trump for harsh criticism.Click here for live updates US Capitol breach“Trump and his supporters should finally accept the decision of the American voters and stop trampling on democracy,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas wrote on Twitter. “From inflammatory words come violent deeds.” He added that “contempt for democratic institutions has disastrous effects.”“The beauty of democracy?” with a shrug emoji was the reaction tweeted by Bashir Ahmad, a personal assistant to the president of Nigeria, which has seen several coups since independence — including one led decades ago by President Muhammadu Buhari, who most recently entered the office via a vote.Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and Colombian President Iván Duque were among those in Latin America who denounced the protesters, but both also said they were confident that American democracy and the rule of law would prevail.“In this sad episode in the US, supporters of fascism showed their real face: anti-democratic and aggressive,’‘ tweeted Luis Roberto Barroso, Brazilian Supreme Court justice and the head of the country’s electoral court. He said he hoped “American society and institutions react with vigor to this threat to democracy.’‘Venezuela, which is under US sanctions, said the events in Washington show that the US “is suffering what it has generated in other countries with its politics of aggression.”Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has survived US-backed opposition efforts to oust him despite accusations of human rights abuses, civil unrest and a humanitarian crisis that has forced millions to flee the oil-rich country.In Puerto Rico, many people took to social media and joked that the US territory no longer wanted statehood. Independence, they said, looked appealing for the first time in decades.In fact, it was that pursuit of independence that marked one of the last times the US Congress was stormed violently. Four members of Puerto Rico’s Nationalist Party opened fire on the House floor in March 1954, wounding five lawmakers.Italians watched the events with shock, having always considered the US to be the model of democracy and the country that rescued Italy after its fascist descent during World War II.“This is the widely anticipated outcome of Trumpism,” tweeted a retired Italian center-left politician, Pierluigi Castagnetti. “And unfortunately it won’t end today. When politics is replaced by deception and fanaticism of the people the drift is inevitable.”European Parliament President David Sassoli, who leads one of the largest legislatures in the world, also denounced the scenes at the Capitol. The European Union has spent four cantankerous years dealing with the Trump administration, and its top officials have repeatedly said they are looking forward to a better relationship under President-elect Joe Biden.“This is insurrection. Nothing less. In Washington,” tweeted Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden.Turkey, a NATO ally that has sometimes been at odds with Washington, expressed concern over the images of angry Trump supporters trying to thwart the certification of Biden as the new president. The chaos forced lawmakers to be rushed from the building.A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement urged all parties in the United States to use “moderation and common sense.”“We believe that the United States will overcome this domestic political crisis with maturity,” the ministry said.The ministry statement also urged Turkish citizens in the United States to stay away from crowds and demonstrations.Trump issued a restrained call for peace well after the melee was underway but did not immediately ask supporters to disperse. Later, he urged them to go home and called them “very special people.”Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country was “deeply disturbed” by the events in the US, Canada’s closest ally and neighbor.“Violence will never succeed in overruling the will of the people. Democracy in the US must be upheld — and it will be,” Trudeau tweeted.Volkan Bozkir, president of the 193-member United Nations General Assembly, said he was saddened by the developments. But, he tweeted, ″I believe that peace & respect for democratic processes will prevail in our host country at this critical time.”Polish President Andrzej Duda, who twice visited Trump at the White House and hosted him in Poland, said on Twitter that his country had “full confidence in the power of American democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-are-appalled-by-storming-of-us-capitol/story-WYNwRsjdo57xBgiVKMHzdL.html

Facebook’s vice president of integrity Guy Rosen tweeted the social media company believed the video “contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence,” saying the action was part of “appropriate emergency measures.”Google-owned YouTube said the video violated its policy against content that alleges “widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Election.” YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo added the company does allow copies that include additional context. Click here for live updates of US Capitol breach Twitter Inc restricted users from retweeting the video “due to a risk of violence,” as hundreds of protesters sought to force Congress to undo the president’s election loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.Twitter also restricted a later tweet from Trump, again falsely alleging he had won the election.Social media companies have been under pressure to police misinformation on their platforms around the election. Trump and his allies have continuously spread unsubstantiated claims of election fraud that have proliferated online.In a statement on Wednesday, the Anti-Defamation League called for social media companies to suspend Trump’s accounts, saying the events at the Capitol resulted from “fear and disinformation that has been spewed directly from the Oval Office.”Also Read | Woman shot at US Capitol has died: PoliceFormer Facebook security chief Alex Stamos tweeted: “Twitter and Facebook have to cut him off. There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won’t do it.”A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.According to researchers and public postings, violent rhetoric and advice on weaponry ramped up significantly in the past three weeks on many social media platforms as multiple groups planned rallies for Wednesday, including Trump supporters, white nationalists and enthusiasts of the wide-ranging conspiracy theory QAnon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-youtube-pull-trump-video-after-protesters-storm-us-capitol/story-s9sjE1HfIeEnwSRaBRwIJI.html

07-01-2021||World||Woman shot at US Capitol has died: Police||A woman has died after being shot on Wednesday during the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, a spokeswoman for the Washington police department said.No other details were available, the spokeswoman said. It remained unclear who shot the woman, but a witness said the shooting occurred after law enforcement authorities urged people to “get back.”Hundreds of Trump supporters entered the Capitol building on Wednesday in a bid to overturn his election defeat, forcing Congress to postpone a session that would have certified Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the Nov. 3 election.A protester from New Jersey told Washington CBS affiliate WUSA he witnessed the woman being shot at the Capitol after police and other law enforcement officials warned people to get back.“Well, we had stormed into the chambers inside, and there was a young lady who rushed to the windows; a number of police and Secret Service were saying, ‘Get back, get down, get out of the way,’“ he said. “She didn’t heed the call and as we kind of raced up to grab people and pull them back, they shot her in the neck, and she fell back on me.”The man told the local television station he saw blood coming from the woman’s mouth and neck and nose.“It could have been me, but she went first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-shot-at-us-capitol-has-died-police/story-vOtxdBoWRpFG1o18JvCaBI.html
07-01-2021||World||China plays down concern after WHO’s rare rebuke||China played down on Wednesday World Health Organization (WHO) concern about a delay in authorisation for a visit by team of experts looking into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, saying arrangements were being worked out.The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Tuesday he was “very disappointed” that China had not authorised the entry of the team for the investigation, which he said was a WHO priority. “We are eager to get the mission underway as soon as possible,” he said. The coronavirus disease was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since spread around the world.Much remains unknown about its origins and China has been sensitive about any suggestion it could have done more in the early stages of the pandemic to stop it.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that the problem was “not just about visas” for the team.Asked about reports that the dates had been agreed upon, she said there had been a “misunderstanding” and the two sides were still in discussions over the timing and other arrangements and “remain in close communication”.“There’s no need to overinterpret this,” she said. China’s experts were also busy dealing with a renewed spurt of coronavirus infections, with many locations entering a “wartime footing” to stop the virus, she said.The delay by Chinese authorities fuels concern that Beijing is obstructing international efforts to trace the origins of a pandemic that has now killed over 1.8 million people worldwide.The 10-strong team of international experts had been due to set off in early January as part of a long-awaited mission to investigate early cases of the disease.China has been seeking to shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began, with senior diplomat Wang Yi saying “more and more studies” showed that it emerged in multiple regions. WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan has previously called this “highly speculative”. China has also dismissed criticism of its handling of early cases although some including US President Donald Trump have questioned its actions during the outbreak.The WHO, too, has been criticised for being too deferential to China through the course of the pandemic, and has been blamed by other countries for initially downplaying the severity of the crisis. Trump said last year that the superpower would terminate its relationship with the WHO unless it “demonstrated independence” from China. The US President also called for a “transparent” investigation and criticised the terms under which Chinese experts conducted a first phase of research.The mission is due to be led by Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s top expert on animal diseases that cross the species barrier, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plays-down-concern-after-who-s-rare-rebuke/story-W2MwbhKTzt1Gfv8tt2PAvL.html
07-01-2021||World||Democrats on the brink of US Senate control||Democrats won one hotly contested US Senate race in Georgia on Wednesday and pulled ahead in a second, edging closer to control of the chamber and the power to advance Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals when he takes office this month.Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock beat Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, TV networks and Edison Research projected. Democrat Jon Ossoff held a narrow lead over Republican David Perdue in the other race, with a final outcome not expected until later on Wednesday.With 98% reporting, Warnock was ahead of Loeffler by 1.2 percentage points, roughly 50,000 votes, according to Edison Research. Ossoff on Wednesday claimed victory on Wednesday morning as he held a slight lead of about 16,000 votes in a race that was still too close for major news organisations to call. “It is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve you in the United States Senate,” Ossoff said in a video statement.Democrats must win both contests to take control of the Senate. A Democratic sweep would create a 50-50 split in the Senate and give vice president-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office on January 20. The party already has a narrow majority in the US House of Representatives.If Republicans hold the second seat, they will effectively wield veto power over Biden’s political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief from the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice.Most of the votes remaining to be counted were in counties Biden won in November, with roughly 13,000 votes still to be counted in Democratic-leaning DeKalb County near Atlanta, according to Edison Research estimates, fuelling Democratic optimism about an astounding Georgia sweep. No Democrat had won a US Senate race in Georgia in 20 years. But it could take days to get the final tally, as thousands of military and overseas ballots can still be counted as late as Friday. The narrow results will almost certainly spark legal challenges or recounts that also could delay a final determination of Senate control.“We were told that we couldn’t win this election. But tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible,” Warnock, a Baptist preacher, told supporters in a livestream message.“I am going to the Senate to work for all of Georgia, no matter who you cast your vote for in this election.”Warnock will become Georgia’s first Black US senator and Ossoff, at 33, would be the Senate’s youngest member if he wins. The critical races drew an estimated 4.5 million voters -- a record for a runoff -- along with nearly half a billion dollars in advertising spending since November 3 and visits on Monday by Republican President Donald Trump and Biden.Even if they manage to secure a slim Senate majority, Biden and Democrats could find it difficult to advance some legislative priorities in the Senate, where most bills need to clear a 60-vote procedural threshold in the 100-seat chamber. The head-to-head runoff elections in Georgia, a quirk of state law, became necessary when no candidate in either race drew more than 50% of the vote in November’s general election.Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger said election officials would take a break overnight but resume counting on Wednesday morning. “Hopefully by noon we’ll have a better idea where we are,” he said on CNN. Perdue is a former Fortune 500 executive who has served one Senate term. Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed a year ago to fill the seat of a retiring senator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-on-the-brink-of-us-senate-control/story-GmwIjgETg6tYW3rpP0nC6H.html
07-01-2021||World||Explainer: How Democrats won Georgia’s two Senate runoffs||The Associated Press on Wednesday declared Democrat Jon Ossoff the winner of his US Senate runoff election, the second such seat captured by the party in twin contests that were held in Georgia on Tuesday.Earlier in the day, the AP declared Democrat Raphael Warnock the winner of the other race.The two victories will give Democrats control of the Senate for the next two years.Here’s a look at the contests:WHY AP DECLARED OSSOFF THE WINNEROssoff held a lead of about 25,000 votes, or about 0.56 percentage points, over Republican David Perdue out of about 4.4 million cast when the AP called the race at 4:20 p.m. Wednesday.The call was made after an analysis of outstanding ballots showed there was no way for Perdue, who was seeking a second term, to overtake Ossoff’s lead.Tens of thousands of outstanding votes remain to be counted, but the vast majority were in six Democratic-leaning counties that Ossoff was winning.Many of the ballots left to be counted were mail votes, a form of voting that overwhelmingly favored Ossoff. The remaining votes left to be counted in Republican-leaning areas that favored Perdue were not enough for him to catch up.Georgia elections officials said there were about 14,000 outstanding overseas and military ballots that had been issued but not returned. Those must be received by Friday in order to be counted. Gabriel Sterling, a top Georgia elections official, said they expected only a fraction of those ballots would be returned in time.WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER RACE?Warnock defeated Loeffler after an analysis of outstanding votes showed there was no way for Loeffler to catch up to him with the remaining ballots left to be counted in Republican-leaning areas.Warnock held a lead over Loeffler of about about 1.2 percentage points, or about 62,000 votes as of 4:15 p.m. ET Wednesday, an edge that is likely to grow as more votes are tabulated.Almost all the votes left to be counted statewide were mail ballots and early in-person votes. Of those, most are in Democratic-leaning counties.Warnock was winning mail ballots by 68%, according to an AP analysis conducted early Wednesday morning. And most of the early in-person votes left to be counted were in DeKalb County; that method of voting in the county favored Warnock by about 70 percentage points.WHAT’S AT STAKEThe outcomes of the two races will help determine the country’s political trajectory over the next two years. With Democrats winning both races, they will have a 50-50 seat split with Republicans in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris poised to cast tie-breaking votes.That would enable President-elect Joe Biden to enact an agenda that includes liberal priorities like raising the minimum wage, approving additional economic stimulus to combat the effects of the pandemic and expanding health care.But Republicans need to carry only one of the seats to hold a slim 51-49 majority that could serve as a conservative bulwark to limit Biden’s ambitions.The fact that Georgia will determine which of these two dueling visions could become reality speaks to its recent emergence as a swing state. Georgia has been a Republican stronghold for decades, like much of the rest of the South. These two elections are testing just how much the state has changed.Georgia’s government is dominated by the GOP. Until Warnock, a Democrat hadn’t won a U.S. Senate contest in the state since former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller in 2000. And until Biden won it by just under 12,000 votes in November, a Democratic presidential contender hadn’t carried the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.But it has slowly morphed into a battleground — a change driven in part by demographic shifts, particularly in the economically vibrant area of metropolitan Atlanta.As older, white, Republican-leaning voters die, they’ve been replaced by a younger and more racially diverse cast of people, many of whom moved to the Atlanta area from other states — and carried their politics with them.Overall, demographic trends show that the state’s electorate is becoming younger and more diverse each year. Like other metro areas, Atlanta’s suburbs have also moved away from Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton flipped both Cobb and Gwinnett counties. Four years later, electoral maps showed a sea of blue in the more than half-dozen counties surrounding Atlanta.In 2018, Democrat Stacey Abrams galvanized Black voters in her bid to become the country’s first African American woman to lead a state, a campaign she narrowly lost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-democrats-won-georgia-s-two-senate-runoffs/story-8iImh07Ik5ZcmDKbGMLz2L.html

US lawmakers were asked to shelter in place and made to wear gas masks for use in case law enforcement officials used tear gas to clear the protesters. Police later responded with drawn guns and tear gas in a bid to evacuate the House of Representatives and the Senate after pro-Trump protesters marched through the halls of congress. The protestors reached the congress building in Capitol Hill from a rally nearby, where they had heard Trump rail against his election defeat and air false, baseless allegations of election fraud that have been rejected by more than 60 courts, including three times by the US Supreme Court. The entire US congress complex was put in lockdown and Washington DC officials declared curfew to disperse the protesters, but it had no immediate impact on the crowds still swirling in and around the building. Trump called for peace but after the supporters had stormed the building, in a potentially dangerous situations for lawmakers inside. While Pence, who presided over the joint session of congress, had been escorted from the senate, visuals showed protesters sitting in his chair. The incoming vice-president Kamala Harris was also reportedly in the building. “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful,” Trump tweeted, but said no more, despite calls from allies and former aides to issue a specific call for the protesters to stand down. Some protesters were armed, according to reports that also indicated armed standoffs between them and law enforcement personnel. A few of them had reached the well of the US senate in a major breach of security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-person-shot-inside-us-capitol-after-trump-supporters-storm-building/story-YyzF4PTFDn2eEO2l7ymtkK.html

Police confirmed 53 people - including a US citizen - were arrested for “subversion” in an early morning operation that involved about 1,000 officers. The charges were sparked by an attempt by opposition groups last year to win a majority in the city’s partially-elected legislature. Hong Kong’s security chief John Lee described the arrests as “necessary” and aimed at a group of people who tried to “sink Hong Kong into an abyss” and “overthrow the government”.Britain has criticised the arrests, accusing China of deceiving citizens about the true purpose of its security law. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab called the detentions “a grievous attack on Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms”.Germany also condemned the crackdown. Foreign minister Heiko Maas said, “China is deviating further from the commitments it made to Hong Kongers and the international community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hk-arrests-53-oppn-figures-sparks-outcry/story-JECs0SPqfpd6iwqsML3sBP.html
07-01-2021||World||Mike Pence disagrees after Donald Trump denies he lost||On a dramatic day in US politics, outgoing vice-president Mike Pence defied Donald Trump, saying that the president can’t claim “unilateral authority” to reject electoral votes that will make Joe Biden the new leader of the country.Pence made his stance clear as Trump addressed thousands of supporters at a rally in Washington protesting Wednesday’s meeting of Congress to confirm Biden’s victory in presidential election. Trump falsely claimed that he won the election as he spoke on an outdoor stage framing the White House. Crowds gathered at the “Save America March” wore Trump-approved red baseball caps and cheered as Trump repeated the groundless conspiracy theories that have consumed his final days in office. “You don’t concede when there’s theft involved,” Trump said. “Our country has had enough and we will not take it any more.”Weeks have passed since the states completed certifying that Biden, a Democrat, won the election by 306 Electoral College votes to Trump’s 232, and Trump’s extraordinary challenges to Biden’s victory have floundered in courts across the country. Congress was due to confirm Biden’s victory on Wednesday. Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have promised a stonewalling effort that was certain to fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-disagrees-after-donald-trump-denies-he-lost/story-JQWN9O41G9vbacG1uI4ocK.html
07-01-2021||World||Moderna vaccine gets EU’s approval||The European Union’s medicines watchdog on Wednesday approved a second coronavirus vaccine, in a relief to struggling European countries as the world reached a grim new record of 15,700 deaths in the last 24 hours.The Moderna vaccine is now set to join Pfizer-BioNTech’s jab for use in the 27-nation EU, where governments are grappling with soaring caseloads and slow roll-outs of the vaccines already available. “Good news for our efforts to bring more Covid-19 vaccines to Europeans!” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted.The breakthrough came as more than 15,700 Covid-19 deaths around the world were registered in the past 24 hours, according to a count by AFP - a new record.The United States, the world’s worst-hit country, logged a record 3,936 daily coronavirus deaths in a separate tally maintained by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. In Portugal, health authorities reported 10,000 new cases in 24 hours in the nation of just 10 million people.Mass vaccinations are seen as key to returning the world to a semblance of normality, but the EU’s campaign has got off to a sluggish start compared to the US, Britain and Israel. The Netherlands administered its first shot on Wednesday, becoming the last EU country to get started.As it recorded 1,041 new virus deaths, the most since late April, UK returned to a full lockdown on Wednesday. Authorities are battling to contain the alarming spread of a new coronavirus strain that appears to be more infectious. One in 50 people in England were infected last week, according to official data, rising to one in 30 in London.The global crisis shows no signs of slowing, with more than 1.8 million people known to have died worldwide among some 86mn cases.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, announced on Tuesday that it was toughening its partial lockdown and extending measures such as store closures until the end of January.Along with other leaders, such as France’s Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations from critics that her government should be rolling out vaccines much faster in order to spare people from more disruption to virtually every aspect of their lives.Concerns are also growing over the new coronavirus strains first located in Britain and South Africa, which have since been detected in dozens of other countries. While there is no evidence so far that available vaccines will prove less effective against them, the increased transmissibility of the new variants has officials worried that their spread will outstrip the rate at which they are able to protect people.The Cannes, the world’s biggest film festival, may be moved to the summer this year from its usual May date because of the Covid-19 crisis, organisers said on Wednesday.The festival, originally scheduled to be held from May 11 to 22, “will certainly take place in 2021”, a spokeswoman told AFP, but could be postponed to a time between the end of June and the end of July.The festival was cancelled last year, while rival European events in Berlin and Venice went ahead under strict health restrictions. Organisers still need some time “to evaluate the situation at the start of the year” before making a decision, the Cannes spokeswoman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-gets-eu-s-approval/story-FSOUtfaqwUTKRJhwdqAhjK.html

Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. A suspicious package was also reported in the area, Capitol Police said. The skirmishes came just shortly after Trump addressed thousands of his supporters, riling up the crowd with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally near the White House on Wednesday ahead of Congress’ vote. “We will not let them silence your voices,” Trump told the protesters, who had lined up before sunrise to get a prime position to hear the president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-locked-down-as-trump-supporters-clash-with-police-security-breach-reported/story-D7RzT0lFAUvnqQkwPxxCAN.html

The Hindu temple was vandalised and set ablaze by a mob of hundreds on December 30, sparking an outcry.Pakistan’s chief justice Gulzar Ahmed, who had taken suo motu notice of the attack, gave the ruling after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being vandalised during their meeting in Karachi last week.The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Auqaf department have been directed to start the work immediately and submit a progress report in two weeks. The chief justice also observed that the people who vandalised the temple should pay for its restoration. The court has also asked for reports on the number of temples in Pakistan, encroachment on land belonging to the Auqaf department, and the steps taken by the authorities against land grab. All temples in Pakistan come under the Auqaf department.Earlier, Muhammad Shoaib Suddle, a former police chief and one-man commission on the rights of minorities at the Supreme Court, submitted a report on the vandalism. The commission recommended a comprehensive investigation into the vandalism of the temple. Maulvi Sharif, the main suspect in the case, is believed to have incited people to carry out violence, the report said. It added that the record of the temple land at the time of Partition should be looked into.The report also recommended that the home department should take steps to stop the entry of suspicious people inside the temple. Exemplary punishment should be handed out to suspects to prevent such incidents in the future, the report recommended.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restore-temple-in-2-weeks-pak-sc/story-bvbIYgRoI83fNOWwhUjRfO.html
07-01-2021||World||Mike Pence breaks with Donald Trump as Congress meets to certify Joe Biden’s win||US Vice-President Mike Pence on Wednesday rejected pressure from President Donald Trump to refuse to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election win, saying he does not have the authority.“It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence said in a statement prior to a joint session of Congress that convened on Wednesday to certify Biden’s win as the final stage of the US election process.Pence’s refusal to comply with Trump’s wishes was expected as he had conveyed his decision to the president in a meeting on Tuesday — that he does not have the constitutional authority to reject or overturn the election. But Trump had persisted, openly calling for his deputy to “come through”.Congress started the process of certification as scheduled on Wednesday afternoon and will continue for hours as the president’s Republican allies will attempt to have the election overthrown, knowing they will fail.The development came on the sidelines of a tense runoff contest in the state of Georgia, where the two parties were battling for two Senate seats up for grabs, which would eventually determine who controls the Senate.A Democratic candidate was projected to win one of the two runoff elections in the state, while and a fellow party nominee expanded his lead in the second race on Wednesday, setting up a likely defeat for the Republicans in their stronghold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-breaks-with-donald-trump-as-congress-meets-to-certify-joe-biden-s-win/story-CLtLb8yeljcW1KGPgsD2cP.html

The Saudi move was announced on Monday night. On Tuesday, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim al Thani attended the Gulf Cooperation Council’s summit for the first time since 2017. He was received by Saudi Arabia’s Prince Mohammed with a hug in the desert city of Al-Ula. South Korea will send a delegation to Iran to negotiate the release of a seized oil tanker and its crew, Seoul said on Tuesday, as an anti-piracy unit arrived in waters near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had seized the South Korean-flagged Hankuk Chemi - which it said was carrying 7,200 tonnes of “oil chemical products” - for infringing maritime environmental laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arab-leaders-agree-to-end-qatar-standoff/story-rjz5MA6Nm2q4Ni7doWSInK.html

One case each had already been detected in Florida, California and Colorado, all in patients without recent travel history. Iran on Tuesday confirmed its first case of the new UK variant.As the virus continues to rage, Germany is set to extend its nationwide lockdown until the end of the month and introduce tougher restrictions.

He said members of the international scientific team have begun over the last 24 hours to leave from their home countries to China as part of an arrangement.Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for their arrival, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccines-in-us-lie-unused/story-126NszrfqX6XwI0ueOOTuL.html
07-01-2021||World||Hazara refuse to bury 11 miners killed by IS till Imran Khan comes. He says no||Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed his inability to visit members of the Hazara community who have refused to bury 11 miners killed by Islamic State, even as protests against the killing spread to other parts of Pakistan. Khan on Wednesday urged the protesting members of Balochistan’s Shia Hazara community to bury the bodies of the miners killed in a brutal attack in Mach coalfield, promising he would visit them “very soon”.“I want to reassure the Hazara families who lost their loved ones in a brutal terrorist attack in Machh that I am cognisant of their suffering & their demands,” he tweeted, adding that the government was taking steps to prevent such attacks in the future. He claimed he knew that “our neighbour is instigating this sectarian terrorism.”He added: “I share your pain and have come to you before also to stand with you in your time of suffering. I will come again very soon to offer prayers and condole with all the families personally.” “I will never betray my people’s trust. Please bury your loved ones so their souls find peace.”But this assurance has not helped in any way, said protestors. Several roads in Karachi were blocked on Wednesday as protests continued for a second day.The Majlis-i-Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) has insisted that they want Khan to visit Quetta where the dead bodies have been placed as part of the protest and give assurances for the safety of the community. The MWM also held protests in Karachi and Quetta on Tuesday that were attended by hundreds of men, women and children. A number of Shia organisations have taken part in the protests which are demanding measures to ensure the safety of the Shia Hazara community.On Wednesday evening, the MWM said that it would extend the protests to other cities in Pakistan. Sunday’s attack was the first major assault on members of the Hazara community since April last year, when a suicide bombing in a market killed 18, most of whom were Hazaras. There have been constant attacks on members of the community by militant groups. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Sunday attack. IS, Taliban and other Sunni extremist groups are known to have carried out attacks targeting the community. In 2013, three bombings killed more than 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods in Quetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hazara-refuse-to-bury-slain-miners-protest-spreads-in-pakistan/story-qxansmqA7SQT0qXM7D9MnK.html
