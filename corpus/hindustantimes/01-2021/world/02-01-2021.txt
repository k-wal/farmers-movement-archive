He didn’t give further details about the nature of the intelligence.His comments came after Iran’s military warned that it was prepared to defend itself and respond firmly to any U.S. aggression during a weekend of bellicose statements commemorating General Qassem Soleimani’s killing by the U.S. in a drone strike in Iraq on Jan. 3, 2020.U.S. forces were “vulnerable and in a defensive position” out of fear of an Iranian strike to retaliate for last year’s assault, said Major General Yahya Ramin Safavi, a top military adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “We hope that while Trump’s evil government is around, nothing will happen,” he said on state TV.“The U.S. military has a better understanding of its weaknesses than its politicians. We will never initiate war, but if someone attacks Iran, we will respond firmly and with full preparedness,” Safavi said, adding that Iran was capable of sinking U.S. aircraft carriers.The comments show that while Iran wants to make clear that it won’t hesitate to defend itself against U.S. military action, it does not want to escalate conflict and sees Trump’s allies in the region as trying to start a war and to exploit a possible divide within the defense community in Washington over whether Trump should strike Iran.On Thursday, the U.S. sent home the USS Nimitz, the only Navy aircraft carrier operating in the Middle East a day after it also sent B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in a show of force, AP reported, citing three unnamed defense officials. The report said the two actions may reflect a split among Pentagon officials.Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have resurged in recent weeks with Trump reviving threats against the Islamic Republic in his final weeks in office as he tries to derail plans by Biden to rescue the beleaguered nuclear accord and provide sanctions relief.Trump’s decision to target Soleimani pushed the countries to the brink of war, capping a security crisis in the Persian Gulf that started when Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal. Iranian officials and military commanders have repeatedly vowed to seek revenge for the strike for as long as U.S. forces are scattered across the Middle East.The multilateral accord limited Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, but since Trump walked away from it Iran has ramped-up its atomic activities and said on Saturday it had notified the United Nations’ nuclear agency that it may start producing 20% enriched uranium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-points-finger-at-israel-as-it-warns-donald-trump-against-war/story-mth9vaEybI7GQHzgDyNeQM.html

Iranians are marking the death on Saturday, Jan. 2, this year, the corresponding date in the Persian calendar.Iranian officials and military commanders have repeatedly vowed to seek revenge for the strike for as long as US forces are scattered across the Middle East.US President Donald Trump’s decision to target Soleimani pushed the countries to the brink of war, capping a security crisis in the Persian Gulf that started when Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal.President-elect Joe Biden has said he wants to save that accord and end the standoff with Iran, but Trump has continued to level threats at Tehran. Earlier this week, Washington deployed two B-52 bomber planes to the Persian Gulf in a show of force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-warns-us-it-will-act-decisively-against-any-aggression/story-4kH7J7TxcXPt8O5mcoNUHO.html
02-01-2021||World||UK judge to rule on US extradition for WikiLeaks’ Assange||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will find out Monday whether he can be extradited from the UK to the US to face espionage charges over the publication of secret American military documents.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is due to deliver her decision at London’s Old Bailey courthouse at 10 a.m. Monday. If she grants the request, then Britain’s home secretary, Priti Patel, would make the final decision.Whichever side loses is expected to appeal, which could lead to years more legal wrangling.However, there’s a possibility that outside forces may come into play that could instantly end the decade-long saga.Stella Moris, Assange’s partner and the mother of his two sons, has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump via Twitter to grant a pardon to Assange before he leaves office on Jan. 20.And even if Trump doesn’t, there’s speculation that his successor, Joe Biden, may take a more lenient approach to Assange’s extradition process.U.S. prosecutors indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse that carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government said in their closing arguments after the four-week hearing in the fall that Assange’s defense team had raised issues that were neither relevant nor admissible.“Consistently, the defense asks this court to make findings, or act upon the submission, that the United States of America is guilty of torture, war crimes, murder, breaches of diplomatic and international law and that the United States of America is ‘a lawless state’,” they said. “These submissions are not only non-justiciable in these proceedings but should never have been made.”Assange’s defense team argued that he is entitled to First Amendment protections for the publication of leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan and that the U.S. extradition request was politically motivated.In their written closing arguments, Assange’s legal team accused the U.S. of an “extraordinary, unprecedented and politicized” prosecution that constitutes “a flagrant denial of his right to freedom of expression and poses a fundamental threat to the freedom of the press throughout the world.”Defense lawyers also said Assange was suffering from wide-ranging mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies, that could be exacerbated if he is placed in inhospitable prison conditions in the U.S.They said his mental health deteriorated while he took asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for years and that he was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Assange jumped bail in 2012 when he sought asylum at the embassy, where he stayed for seven years before being evicted and arrested. He has been held at Belmarsh prison in London since April 2019.His legal team argued that Assange would, if extradited, likely face solitary confinement that would put him at a heightened risk of suicide. They said if he was subsequently convicted, he would probably be sent to the notorious ADX Supermax prison in Colorado, which is also inhabited by Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.Lawyers for the U.S. government argued that Assange’s mental state “is patently not so severe so as to preclude extradition.”Assange has attracted the support of high-profile figures, including the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and actress Pamela Anderson.Daniel Ellsberg, the famous U.S. whistleblower, also came out in support, telling the hearing that they had “very comparable political opinions.”The 89-year-old, widely credited for helping to bring about an end to the Vietnam War through his leaking of the Pentagon Papers in 1971, said the American public “needed urgently to know what was being done routinely in their name, and there was no other way for them to learn it than by unauthorized disclosure.”There are clear echoes between Assange and Ellsberg, who leaked over 7,000 pages of classified documents to the press, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. Ellsberg was subsequently put on trial for 12 charges in connection with violations of the Espionage Act, which were punishable by up to 115 years in prison. The charges were dismissed in 1973 because of government misconduct against him.Assange and his legal team will be hoping that developments in the U.S. bring an end to his ordeal if the judge grants the U.S. extradition request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-judge-to-rule-on-us-extradition-for-wikileaks-assange/story-SJZSlGMiKwY02At0PrZt9J.html
02-01-2021||World||China’s muscle flexing in East China Sea ‘wearing down’ Japanese resistance: Report||In an attempt to wear down Japanese resistance in disputed East China Sea, China has been ramping up civilian and military presence in the airspace and waters around a rocky uninhabited group of islands, which are under Japanese administration.The islands are also known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, are under Japanese administration but claimed by both countries.As part of its strategy, China has sent military planes on hundreds of sorties in the area, forcing the Japan Self-Defence Forces to scramble its fighter jets from dawn till dusk, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.Observers told the SCMP that the tactic is draining Japanese personnel and equipment but also comes at a big risk for China.From 2013 to 2018, an average of 720 Chinese coastguard vessels ventured into the waters and in 2020, 1,157 of the Chinese ships went into the contiguous zone of the islands, up more than 5 per cent from last year.According to SCMP, the Japanese Coast Guard started reporting the number of Chinese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus in 2008.In the early years, the Chinese sent vessels a few times. And in 2020, 1,157 of the Chinese ships went in the contiguous zone of the islands, up more than five per cent from last year and almost triple the number from 2012.Tensions have also been on the rise in the sky. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said in the year to March, Japanese fighter jets responded to 638 incursions by Chinese warplanes, nearly all of which were near the islands.The total was up from 500 from the previous year and was the second-highest annual number since 1958.The frequent Chinese sorties force the Japan Air Self-Defence Force to fly above the East China Sea from sunrise to sunset, Kyodo News reported citing government sources.The two countries have agreed to restart talks on the island but there is a great deal of mistrust to overcome.Japanese State Minister of Defence Yasuhide Nakayama voiced those concerns in early December when he said China’s growing maritime activities in the waters surrounding Japan were a threat.He also called Beijing’s movements an attempt to “unilaterally” change the status quo in the East China Sea. “Every single day, the Chinese ships, the coastguard vessels try to enter our territorial waters,” Nakayama said.Amid all this, the US, Japan and France plan to hold their first joint military drills on one of Japan’s uninhabited outlying islands in May.The exercise is nominal to practise disaster relief efforts but could also form the basis for coordinated defence against attack, according to Japan’s Sankei newspaper.Derek Grossman, a security specialist from the Rand Corporation, said pressure from Chinese warplanes has severely strained the Japan Air Self-Defence Force’s ability to sustain normal operations.“[It] has suffered in terms of pilot fatigue as well as the cost of maintenance on aircraft ... [and] the routinisation of intercepts makes it more difficult for the [air self-defence force] to determine whether this time is different. That is precisely the uncertain mindset Beijing wants potential adversaries to have prior to actual armed conflict,” Grossman said.Timothy Heath, also from the Rand Corporation, said China’s strategy for the Senkakus depended on “wearing down” Japan’s resistance over time so that eventually Tokyo acquiesced without fighting.And a number of factors were in China’s favour.“First, the huge amount of resources available to the Chinese coastguard and People’s Liberation Army Navy provides an important material advantage. Japan cannot match China plane for plane and ship for ship. Tokyo will become exhausted if it tries to do so,” Heath said.“Also, China is highly motivated to sustain these intrusions, due to the value for its security and the political benefits for Chinese audiences that the intrusions offer of humiliating Japan,” Heath added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-muscle-flexing-in-east-china-sea-wearing-down-japanese-resistance-report/story-ijmWiYAKGaZdAzcf7HwnQO.html
02-01-2021||World||Britain will allow mixing of Covid-19 vaccines on rare occasions||Britain will allow people to be given shots of different Covid-19 vaccines on rare occasions, despite a lack of evidence about the extent of immunity offered by mixing doses.In a departure from other strategies globally, the government said people could be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots, for example if the same vaccine dose was out of stock, according to guidelines published on New Year’s Eve.“(If) the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule,” according to the guidelines.Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said this would only happen on extremely rare occasions, and that the government was not recommending the mixing of vaccines, which require at least two doses given several weeks apart.“Every effort should be made to give them the same vaccine, but where this is not possible it is better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all,” she said.Covid-19 has killed more 74,000 people in Britain - the second-highest death toll in Europe, and health officials are racing to deliver doses to help end the pandemic as fears grow that the health service could be overwhelmed.Earlier this week, the government reactivated emergency hospitals built at the start of the outbreak as wards fill up with Covid-19 patients.Britain has been at the forefront of approving the new coronavirus vaccines, becoming the first country to give emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccines last month.Both vaccines are meant to be administered as two shots, given several weeks apart, but they were not designed to be mixed together.The government’s new guidelines said there “is no evidence on the interchangeability of the Covid-19 vaccines although studies are underway”.However, the advice said that while every effort should be made to complete the dosing regimen with the same vaccine, if the patient is at “immediate high risk” or is considered “unlikely to attend again” they can be given different vaccines.Britain sparked controversy earlier this week by announcing plans to delay giving the coronavirus vaccine booster shot in an attempt to ensure more people could be given the more limited protection conferred by a single dose.The top U.S. infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, said on Friday he did not agree with the British approach of delaying the second dose up to 12 weeks.“I would not be in favour of that,” he told CNN. “We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-will-allow-mixing-of-covid-19-vaccines-on-rare-occasions/story-6T21s58K01TE67jilGkbGM.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Situation worsening’: New Covid-19 strain increasing across UK, officials say||Officials on Saturday expressed concerns over the spread of a new mutated coronavirus strain in the United Kingdom as the infection rates across the country continue to rise. The hospitals across Britain, already stretched because of rising patients, are facing a meteoric rise with virus-infected filling in the ICUs and wards. Evidence shows that the new strain of Covid-19 is increasing in the country with a majority of cases surfacing from London, the South East and the East of England, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.Field hospitals that were constructed in the early days of the pandemic but were subsequently mothballed are being reactivated, news agency Reuters reported.The UK is in the “eye of the storm”, according to the Royal College of Nursing’s England director. The remarks come after the UK on Friday recorded 53,285 new Covid-19 cases and fresh 613 fatalities, taking the death toll to over 74,000.The government has confirmed that the infection rates have increased faster than expected in these areas where the new strain has been circulating and stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.The variant of the coronavirus, which could be up to 70% more transmissible, is spreading rapidly in Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously said that the mutated virus strain is not thought to be more deadly or to cause more serious illness.- London’s primary schools to stay closed, order authoritiesThe UK government ordered all primary schools in London to remain closed for the start of the new term next week in an attempt to rein in a jump in hospitalisations resulting from the mutant strain of the coronavirus.From Monday, the capital’s primary schools – for children from 5 to 11 years – will have to provide remote learning for most pupils. Vulnerable children and those whose guardians are key workers will continue to attend school. Pre-schools will remain open, the government ordered.- Britain braces for the new spike in coronavirus casesConcerns are mounting about the ability of the already-stretched National Health Service to cope with the anticipated increase in people seeking treatment for Covid-19 infections over the coming weeks that could be further fueled by holiday gatherings over Christmas and New Year’s.- Next few weeks will be ‘nail-bitingly difficult’, says NHS chiefThe state-funded National Health Service (NHS) chiefs have warned that the next few weeks will be “nail-bitingly difficult”, with staff absences and the new coronavirus variant virus adding enormous pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-worsening-new-covid-19-strain-increasing-across-uk-officials-say/story-UuRFlw2LxByGBs7Uf9xhEM.html

The ministry said it would give more details on Monday.Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, unions and hospitals have been pushing for front-line carers to get vaccinated rapidly.“The concerning situation in urgent care is partly driven by coronavirus related sick leave by care workers,” the health ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-to-vaccinate-emergency-care-workers-as-soon-as-possible/story-ePhwU7gOeRcH1wiHZp5xkL.html
02-01-2021||World||China expects Joe Biden to end Donald Trump’s ‘cold war’ policy, restore ties||As Joe Biden is set to assume power this month, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday hoped that the US President-elect would end the incumbent Donald Trump’s “Cold War” policy towards Beijing and return to a “sensible approach” by restoring normal ties.The Trump administration launched a broadside against China on all fronts, including trade, Tibet and Taiwan besides, scathing criticism against the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by President Xi Jinping.The Chinese side hopes that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation, Wang, who is also a State Councillor, told the state-run Xinhua news agency in an interview.“China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening,” he said.Biden, who defeated President Trump in the November 8 Presidential election, is scheduled to take over on January 20, formally ending the Trump era which saw the US-China ties touch a new low.Wang said that in recent years, the US-China relations have run into unprecedented difficulties.Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong, he said.“What has happened proves that the US’ attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail.“We are ready to develop with the United States a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability. We know that some in the US are uneasy about China’s rapid development. However, the best way to keep one’s lead is through constant self-improvement, not by blocking others’ development,” he said.“We believe that as long as the United States can draw lessons from the past and work with China in the same direction, the two countries are capable of resolving differences through dialogue and expanding converging interests by cooperation,” Wang said. He also stuck a positive note on China’s ties with the European Union (EU).China is racing to improve its ties with the EU ahead of Biden’s plans to end Trump’s unilateral approach and work out coordinated policies towards China with all US allies, especially the EU.Seen as an attempt to thwart Biden’s plans to forge a united policy towards Beijing, China concluded talks with the EU on a landmark investment treaty ending a long, drawn-out negotiations.On Wednesday, Chinese President Xi along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron announced that they have completed investment agreement negotiations as scheduled.“The agreement will provide greater market access, higher level of business environment, stronger institutional guarantees and brighter cooperation prospects for mutual investment,” Xi said.US Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger blasted the EU for reaching the deal with China despite Beijing’s “human rights record”.The EU has “removed a fig leaf,” Pottinger said, China’s state-run Global Times reported.White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro also called it “a bad deal,” which will pose a geopolitical challenge to the US.Wang, in his interview, said that “the most important conclusion is that our cooperation and common understandings far outweigh competition and differences. China and the EU are comprehensive strategic partners, not systemic rivals,” he said.Wang also hailed China’s burgeoning ties with Russia, which Chinese experts say could get stronger if Biden pursues former US president Barack Obama’s policy of identifying Moscow as a prime enemy of Washington than Beijing.China and Russia will continue to be the example of good-neighbourly and friendly relations between major countries, which would underpin the global strategic stability, Wang said.He hailed the intensive interactions between the two heads of states, noting that President Xi and President Vladimir Putin have had five phone calls and exchanged correspondence on multiple occasions, providing the most important strategic guidance for the steady growth of the bilateral relations.“The year 2021 is a year of special importance for China-Russia relations, as both countries will enter a new development stage. In developing China-Russia strategic cooperation, we see no limit, no forbidden zone and no ceiling to how far this cooperation can go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expects-joe-biden-to-end-donald-trump-s-cold-war-policy-restore-ties/story-mNn4jifJWOQEFWd2I7AaQK.html

Ltd., China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., with trading of the companies to be suspended sometime between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11.The move stems from an executive order President Donald Trump issued on Nov. 12 barring investment in publicly traded companies that the U.S. government says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.“China opposes the Americans from abusing national security by listing Chinese companies into the so-called ‘Communist China Military Companies’ list and will take the necessary countermeasures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement.The actions will also “greatly weaken all parties’ confidence in the US capital market,” the statement said.The ministry did not offer details on what the measures might be.Under Trump, the US has stepped up economic sanctions and travel bans against Chinese companies, government officials and Communist Party members, especially recently in Trump’s last few weeks in office.In December, the U.S. announced plans to limit visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their family members to one month, instead of 10 years.Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, albeit with mixed results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-retaliation-for-nyse-s-delisting-of-companies/story-mlMNoW8uL3tNCUbA63S04M.html
02-01-2021||World||AstraZeneca plans 2 million doses a week of Covid-19 vaccine for UK: Reports||Amidst growing pressure over sufficient supplies of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK, pharmaceutical companies have hit back at government claims that access to enough jabs was a “limiting factor”, insisting there was no issue at their end. While AstraZeneca says it expects 2 million doses of the Oxford University vaccine to be ready each week in just over a fortnight, Pfizer BioNTech said the number of doses it has now sent to the UK is “in the millions”. The Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs are the two vaccines against coronavirus that are approved for rollout in the UK. “The plan is then to build it up fairly rapidly; by the third week of January we should get to 2 million a week,” an AstraZeneca source told ‘The Times’ newspaper. “The deliveries to the UK are on track and progressing according to our agreed schedule,” a Pfizer spokesperson said. Meanwhile, there are growing questions on whether Britain could have had more supplies ready to go, similar to how India has created a massive vaccine stockpile in advance, according to ‘The Daily Telegraph’. Pune-based Serum Institute of India has a licensing tie-up for the Oxford vaccine. It has emerged that India has already managed to stockpile 50 million doses of the jabs. “The rate-limiting factor at the moment, as they say, is supply not distribution,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street briefing earlier in the week. The issues around supply are being raised as the UK is set to begin the rollout of the Oxford vaccine among the elderly and frontline workers from Monday after it received regulatory approval on Wednesday. The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine and scientific advisers have calculated that at least 2 million vaccinations a week could be needed, as well as a lockdown that includes school closures, to avoid the pressures on intensive care exceeding the peak of the first wave. Ministers hope that their target of vaccinating 30 million vulnerable people and health workers by Easter in early April could be met ahead of schedule. The UK’s chief medical officers (CMOs) have defended the Covid-19 vaccination plan, even though a doctors’ union has voiced criticism. The UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. The British Medical Association said cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses was “grossly unfair”. But the CMOs said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab “is much more preferable” as the “great majority” of initial protection came from the first jab. “The second vaccine dose is likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy,” the CMOs said. “In the short term, the additional increase of vaccine efficacy from the second dose is likely to be modest; the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine,” they added. However, some general practitioners (GPs) who had already booked in their patients for their second dose after a 21-day gap are planning to keep to the schedule. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and 944,539 people have had their first dose. Under updated government guidance, the second booster dose can now be administered any time up to 12 weeks apart for both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines. Experts advising the government, including the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the focus should be on giving at-risk people the first dose of whichever vaccine they receive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-plans-2-million-doses-a-week-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-uk-reports/story-8gbSOtrj72BWR0UgOi5ZpJ.html
02-01-2021||World||A closer look at the four candidates in Georgia’s senate runoffs||Georgia has two runoff elections on Tuesday that will decide control of the US Senate and have a decisive influence on the ability of President-elect Joe Biden to advance his legislative agenda.Here’s a look at the four candidates: Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.Also Read | In Georgia, Joe Biden’s presidency meets early defining momentDavid PerdueDavid Perdue, the 71-year-old Republican senator and former corporate executive, is fending off a challenge from Democrat Jon Ossoff.The incumbent lawmaker was born in Macon, Georgia, and earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Georgia Tech. While in graduate school he began working for an international management consulting firm, Kurt Salmon Associates.Perdue had a globe-trotting business career, spending time in Asia and Europe. He held executive positions with Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC and Haggar Clothing Co. before joining Reebok International Ltd., rising to president and CEO of the Reebok brand. During his tenure, Reebok negotiated a contract with the National Football League to be the exclusive uniform and sideline apparel provider for the league from 2001 to 2012.Perdue moved on to Pillowtex, a financially troubled North Carolina textile company that he left after less than year, shortly before the company shut down and shed thousands of jobs. He blamed the failure on an inability to raise sufficient capital in a short time. He then landed at Dollar General Corp., where as CEO he led a period of growth from 5,900 stores to 8,500 nationwide for the discount retailer.After leaving Dollar General in 2007, Perdue served as a Georgia Ports Authority board member and formed Perdue Partners, an international trading firm, with his cousin Sonny Perdue, the former two-term Georgia governor who became President Donald Trump’s agriculture secretary.Perdue has depicted himself as an outsider in the Senate who can bring business sense to government. He’s been a loyal Trump ally and has echoed the president’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud in November.Jon OssoffDemocrat Jon Ossoff is challenging Republican Senator David Perdue in a campaign focused on expanding access to health care, reducing drug prices, preserving abortion rights, transitioning to clean energy sources, and passing a New Civil Rights Act to address racial disparities in policing and incarceration.The 33-year-old documentary filmmaker gained national attention in a 2017 special election he narrowly lost for an Atlanta-area seat in the House of Representatives. Ossoff raised nearly $30 million in that race, helping to make it the most expensive House race in history.The November Senate election put Ossoff just 1.8 percentage points behind Perdue. The race is going to a runoff since Perdue didn’t capture 50% of the vote, falling just short with 49.7%.Ossoff got his bachelor’s degree from Georgetown University and a masters degree from the London School of Economics. He worked as a national security aide for Georgia Representative Hank Johnson for several years, and did a high school internship in the office of the late Georgia Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon whom he describes as a mentor.In 2013, Ossoff became CEO of Insight TWI, a company that helps reporters investigate, produce, and market documentaries on corruption in foreign countries. His campaign website includes footage from some of the company’s projects from Africa and the Middle East.Kelly LoefflerSenator Kelly Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, is running for re-election after being appointed in 2019 by Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp to replace Johnny Isakson, who had two years left in his Senate term when he retired due to health concerns.Born and raised in Illinois, Loeffler earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her master’s in business administration from DePaul University’s Kellstadt Graduate School of Business in 1999.Loeffler, 50, was the chief communications and marketing officer for Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the parent firm of the New York Stock Exchange, where her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is the chief executive officer. The 22% rally in ICE shares in 2020 helped make Sprecher a billionaire.Loeffler was also the chief executive officer of Bakkt, an Intercontinental Exchange unit that trades Bitcoin futures. She’s a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream of the Women’s National Basketball Association.The Republican incumbent finished second in the Nov. 3 general election, behind Raphael Warnock. Conservative voters split their ballots between her and GOP Representative Doug Collins, who came in third.Loeffler is a staunch defender of Trump and has supported his unfounded claims of voter fraud in the November election. She and Perdue, the other Republican incumbent, called for Brad Raffensberger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, to step down, alleging without evidence that he mishandled the November vote.Like Perdue, she’s come under scrutiny for stock trades that began the day she and other senators got a classified briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, but investigations have led to no ethics or other charges.Raphael WarnockReverend Raphael Warnock, 51, is the senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached. He won the most votes in November’s 20-candidate special election for one of Georgia’s Senate seats, almost 33%, although Republican votes were split between two major candidates.Originally from Savannah, where he grew up in public housing, Warnock earned a bachelor’s degree at Morehouse College and a PhD from Union Theological Seminary. Before being chosen to lead Ebenezer Baptist in 2005, he was an assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York and the senior pastor at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore.Warnock participated in protests to push Georgia’s elected officials to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. He’s also advocated for action to fight climate change, saying addressing environmental injustice is a moral duty.Warnock offered a prayer at Barack Obama’s second inauguration, and presided over the funeral of John Lewis, the Georgia Representative and civil rights leader who died in July.Loeffler, his Republican opponent, has tried to paint Warnock as “radically liberal,” a line of criticism that’s been criticized by other faith leaders as an attack on the Black Church..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-closer-look-at-the-four-candidates-in-georgia-s-senate-runoffs/story-0wrxQ3BM9BCfJNozsgeFBI.html
02-01-2021||World||‘It’s just unprecedented’: Senate hinges on Georgia runoff chaos||Georgia’s Senate run-off elections arrive Tuesday after a whirlwind two-month campaign that smashed fundraising records, inspired historic voter turnout, bombarded the airwaves with ads, and loomed over congressional negotiations on major spending legislation.The stakes may never have been higher in such a narrow election. Amid President Donald Trump’s incessant attacks on Georgia’s election integrity, four people are seeking two seats that will determine which party controls the Senate. For President-elect Joe Biden, nothing less than his entire agenda is on the table.Those high stakes are underscored by planned visits on Monday by Trump and Biden, repeat appearances for both the outgoing and incoming presidents.“Something like this has never happened before and probably never will again,” said University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock. “Two seats, from one state, in one election, that will decide Senate control. It’s just unprecedented.”During the final week of the campaign, the events ranged from small, tightly controlled get-togethers to drive-in rallies. Voters said they understood the broader significance of these races -- and the circumstances surrounding them.Democrat Terri Sapp, 47, said she voted early “because I just didn’t want to risk the chance that something might happen to me first,” and to “fire” Republican Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.Trump has focused his attention in the state not on the Republican candidates or the future of the Senate, but almost entirely on his baseless claims that voter fraud caused Biden to win the state in November by a little more than 12,000 votes. Some Republicans fear he may throw the election to the Democrats by demanding the resignation of Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans.If Democrat Jon Ossoff can beat first-term GOP Senator David Perdue, and fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock can defeat Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, the Senate will be split 50-50 between the parties. If that happens, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaking vote, effectively flipping control of the chamber to Democrats.But a victory by either Republican would give McConnell 51 votes, a slim majority but enough to curtail Biden’s initiatives and block key nominations to his cabinet and the judiciary.Perdue’s chance for last-minute barnstorming was curtailed after he decided to quarantine after coming into close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus, meaning he’ll likely skip Trump’s Monday rally and his own event on election night.Limited polling in the state shows both races are extremely close while drawing intense interest. More than 70,000 new voters have registered in Georgia since Nov. 3. More than 2.8 million people had cast ballots as of Thursday, shattering the previous record for the December 2008 Senate runoff, when 2.1 million votes were cast.Although Georgia doesn’t register voters by party, the locations of heavy early voting in urban and minority areas suggests strong Democratic turnout. But Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day so it’s difficult to predict an outcome.The results won’t be known for days, given that it took 10 days to call the Nov. 3 election in Georgia. And those counts will almost certainly face legal challenges.The unusual dual run-offs are playing out because none of the candidates got more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 general election, a requirement for winning statewide elections in Georgia.Since then, spending has poured in for the twin contests, which the Center for Responsive Politics now lists as the two most expensive congressional elections in American political history. Nearly half a billion dollars has been spent just in the runoffs, with another $205 million spent during the first round.Georgians last elected a Democrat to the Senate two decades ago, and such runoffs in the state typically have low turnout, which favors Republicans. Yet Democrats are fighting hard after Biden took the state. High-profile Democrats, including former first lady Michelle Obama, have cut ads on their behalf.“The state is clearly going through some realignment,” Bullock said. Bill Clinton in 1992 was the last Democratic president to carry Georgia before Biden, and a Democrat hasn’t held a Georgia Senate seat since 2005.In their campaign-trail messaging, Republicans Perdue and Loeffler claim Ossoff and Warnock are “dangerous radicals” and socialists who’ll support liberals like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Warnock is under attack for past supportive statements about the late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and the pastor Jeremiah Wright, whose sermon including a condemnation of the U.S. was a campaign flashpoint for Barack Obama in 2008. Ossoff, educated at Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, has been dismissed as a “trust-fund socialist.”From the left, Ossoff and Warnock claim the Republicans are heartless and too wealthy to relate to or care about the less fortunate -- Loeffler’s husband Jeff Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, recently hit the billion-dollar mark -- and who tried to enrich themselves at the expense of Georgia residents suffering from the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn.Democratic State Representative Roger Bruce, 67, said his party is benefiting from an influx of more diverse voters in the fast-growing suburbs around Atlanta, and Black voters inspired by what he called “big time” racial overtones in Republicans’ rhetoric.A photo of Loeffler posing beside a former Ku Klux Klan leader -- she says she was unaware of his affiliation -- bolstered those perceptions, said Bruce, along with her earlier criticisms of the Black Lives Matter movement. Those remarks prompted some members of the Atlanta Dream WNBA basketball team, which Loeffler co-owns, to wear “Vote Warnock” T-shirts.“The reality is we’ve already shown that we can get more votes than them. Donald Trump got less votes. We just got to do it again,” Bruce said.Ossoff on Tuesday repeated the claim that Perdue “has been personally profiting from this pandemic.” Investigations into stock sales by both Perdue and Loeffler that occurred after Congress was briefed on the coming pandemic before the public was fully aware haven’t led to any ethics citations or other charges.Despite being caught awkwardly between supporting Trump’s claims of voter fraud and their need to spur GOP turnout, both Republicans have underscored continued allegiance to the president, including siding with him against McConnell on increasing stimulus payments in the virus relief package from $600 to $2,000, a sideshow from Washington during the runoffs.Perdue boasted to supporters in the Atlanta suburbs how he consulted with the president over Christmas about the new stimulus package, before Trump signed it, and reminded them that the president will return for a second rally for him and Loeffler on Monday.“Let’s not let them slip in here in a runoff just because the president is not on the ballot,” Perdue said of the Democratic candidates.Loeffler used similar rhetoric at an event in Columbus.“This is why we have to hold the line. This is why we’re the firewall. This is why we cannot let Chuck Schumer’s radical agent of change -- Raphael Warnock -- and his running mate, the trust-fund socialist Jon Ossoff, into the Senate. Because they radically want to change America,” Loeffler said, referring to the Senate minority leader.Many of those interviewed at Loeffler and Perdue campaign events said they’ve been influenced by ads linking Warnock and Ossoff with images of liberal politicians from the coasts.“He’s way too radical for me,” former State Representative Gary Cason, 77, said of Warnock. “In every which way you can think of,” added Herman Dowden, 70, of Ellenwood.“I think that when we paint pictures of people as radicals, and as not in touch with society, it is not a good strategy,” said Olu Brown, 43, pastor of Impact Church in Atlanta, who backs the Democrats. “This is an opportunity to really focus on Georgia and what’s good for Georgians -- and I think Warnock and Ossoff have done that.”Georgia’s runoffs have even created international fascination. Bullock says he’s fielded media inquiries about the contests in recent days from news outlets in Argentina, Chile, Finland, Germany, South Korea, and “much of the British media.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-just-unprecedented-senate-hinges-on-georgia-runoff-chaos/story-ybWAdOW6vwh8EKlrzcNMvJ.html

This is why Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said he will not appear before the bureau,” said Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (JUI-F) leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.“You cannot run the government by hiding behind the army and continuously telling lies. Why do you defame the army by dragging it in politics?” he added.Pakistani Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) Senator Javed Abbasi said that the NAB has been turned into a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf “(PTI) wing”.“There are several judgements of the Supreme Court that highlights the role of NAB in political engineering and forcing politicians to change their loyalty,” he added.The members from the treasury benches responded by saying the opposition was trying to exert pressure on the government to force it to stop pursuing corruption cases against its leaders, who had amassed wealth through commissions and kickbacks, laundered money and stashed it in banks abroad, reported Dawn.Meanwhile, on December 29, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and PML-N senior leader Khawaja Muhammad Asif was arrested by NAB in Islamabad in connection with the assets beyond means case.

02-01-2021||World||India’s first ‘cultural diplomat’ to US returns home after three-year tenure||India’s first cultural diplomat to the US, Dr Moxraj, who spent last three years teaching Sanskrit, Hindi and spreading traditional Indian culture along with Yoga and meditation in many American states believes that the Vedic doctrine of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam” has found its own resonance in the post-COVID-19 world.“India is the only country which believes in the doctrine of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and this idea of India is not new but from the time of man’s origin, hence it was inspired by ‘Yatra Vishva Bhavatyekanidam’ in the Yajurveda,” said Dr Moxraj as he concluded his three-year tenure as the teacher of Indian Culture at the Indian embassy here.“Even a civilised person does not want to spoil his family and kutumb in the same way, the culture of India has been working for the good of all. Therefore, India has been trying to maintain the natural balance through yoga, meditation, mental health and vegetarianism and non-violence,” said Dr Moxraj, who left for India on Friday.Well versed in Vedic texts, Dr Moxraj was one of the 162 teachers sent by Indian Council for Cultural Relations three years ago to various diplomatic missions across the world to create awareness about traditional Indian culture, an initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi government.“It is the government, which for the first time worked on a plan to appoint 162 Indian culture teachers in all continents,” he said.Having worked under three Ambassadors – Navtej Sarna, Harshvardhan Shringla and Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Dr Moxraj, who was born in Rajasthan in 1979, in the last three years led the International Yoga Day celebrations in front of the US Capitol, White House and Washington Monument.Through special classes started by the Indian Embassy, he taught Hindi and Sanskrit to Indian Americans, US citizens and members of the diplomatic community in Washington DC.He taught Hindi, Indian culture, yoga and Sanskrit in many American States like Washington DC, Virginians, Maryland, West Virginians and Kentucky.He was invited by George Washington University and Georgetown University to conduct special Hindi classes. Both the universities have given special praise to the Government of India and the Indian Embassy.As millions of Americans were forced to stay home during the coronavirus lockdown, the Indian Embassy launched “Yog Apke Dwar” “Yoga at Home,” a free online yoga programme which was conducted by him.Dr Moxraj also took Hindi and Indian culture to Hollywood, as he conducted special classes for African-American Hollywood actress and popular singer Mary Milben.Milben’s two videos in particular -- National Anthem of India on India’s Independence Day in August and Om Jai Jagdish Hare on the occasion of Diwali – has been widely acclaimed.Milben attributed her success and knowledge of Indian culture to her “beloved Indian teacher” Dr Moxraj. Those performances were life changing, she said.“I fell in love with India because of Dr Moxraj, not only because of the language, but also I was introduced to India, the Indian American community and India community all over the world,” Milben said.Foreign Secretary Shringla, when he was the Indian Ambassador here, had praised Dr Moxraj for holding workshops on yoga and his Hindi classes.India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, in his farewell reception, acknowledged the “good work” and “contribution” of Dr Moxraj in spreading Indian culture and values at the embassy here. Sandhu hoped that the ICCR would soon send his successor here.Indian-American community leader Sunil Singh praised the initiative of Prime Minister Modi to send yoga teachers to the important diplomatic missions like Washington DC.“In these three years, he taught us Vedic knowledge and yoga. He made India proud by taking Hindi and Indian culture to Hollywood,” Singh said.

The document then went to the Kazakh parliament and was ratified by it on December 29.The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights commits its signatories to ensuring the abolition of death penalty within their jurisdiction, with the exception of war time. In 2003, the first president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed a decree temporarily suspending the death penalty. This suspended the execution of all death sentences but did not prohibit the courts from issuing death sentences. Life imprisonment was introduced in Kazakhstan in 2004 as an alternative punishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kazakhstan-ratifies-international-protocol-to-abolish-death-penalty/story-2ZSzd3XSZgPugqCfvHb3dI.html
02-01-2021||World||Iran plans 20% uranium enrichment ‘as soon as possible’||Iran said Saturday it plans to enrich uranium up to 20% at its underground Fordo nuclear facility “as soon as possible,” pushing its program a technical step away from weapons-grade levels as it increases pressure on the West over the tattered atomic deal.The move comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US in the waning days of the administration of President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal in 2018.That set in motion an escalating series of incidents capped by a US drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad a year ago, an anniversary coming Sunday that has American officials now worried about possible retaliation by Iran.Iran’s decision to begin enriching to 20% a decade ago nearly brought an Israeli strike targeting its nuclear facilities, tensions that only abated with the 2015 atomic deal. A resumption of 20% enrichment could see that brinksmanship return.Even Ali Akbar Salehi, the US-educated head of the civilian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, offered a military analogy to describe his agency’s readiness to take the next step.“We are like soldiers and our fingers are on the triggers,” Salehi told Iranian state television. “The commander should command and we shoot. We are ready for this and will produce (20% enriched uranium) as soon as possible.”Iran’s decision comes after its parliament passed a bill, later approved by a constitutional watchdog, aimed at hiking enrichment to pressure Europe into providing sanctions relief. It also serves as pressure ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he is willing to re-enter the nuclear deal.The International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledged Iran had informed its inspectors of the decision by a letter after news leaked overnight Friday.“Iran has informed the agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium ... up to 20 percent at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the IAEA said in a statement.The IAEA added Iran did not say when it planned to boost enrichment, though the agency “has inspectors present in Iran on a 24/7 basis and they have regular access to Fordo.” The parliamentary bill also called on Iran to expel those inspectors, though it appears Tehran still hasn’t decided to take that step.Salehi said Iran would need to switch out natural uranium in centrifuges at Fordo for material already enriched to 4% to begin the process of going to 20%.“It should be done under IAEA supervision,” Salehi added.Since the deal’s collapse, Iran has resumed enrichment at Fordo, near the Shiite holy city of Qom, some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Tehran.Shielded by the mountains, Fordo is ringed by anti-aircraft guns and other fortifications. It is about the size of a football field, large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges, but small and hardened enough to lead US officials to suspect it had a military purpose when they exposed the site publicly in 2009.The 2015 deal saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The accord also called for Fordo to be turned into a research-and-development facility.Under Iran’s former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Tehran began 20% enrichment. Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear weapons program, feared Tehran was building a bomb.After the discovery of Fordo, the US worked on so-called “bunker buster” bombs designed to strike such facilities. As Israel threatened at one point to bomb Iranian nuclear sites like Fordo, US officials reportedly showed them a video of a bunker-buster bomb destroying a mock-up of Fordo in America’s southwestern desert.Israel, which under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to criticize Iran’s nuclear program, offered no immediate comment Saturday.As of now, Iran is enriching uranium up to 4.5%, in violation of the accord’s limit of 3.67%. Experts say Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium stockpiled for at least two nuclear weapons, if it chose to pursue them. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.Iran separately has begun construction on a new site at Fordo, according to satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press in December.Iran’s announcement coincides with the anniversary of the US drone striking Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last year. That attack later saw Iran retaliate by launching a ballistic missile strike injuring dozens of US troops in Iraq. Tehran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet that night, killing all 176 people on board.As the anniversary approached, the US has sent B-52 bombers flying over the region and sent a nuclear-powered submarine into the Persian Gulf.On Thursday, sailors discovered a limpet mine on a tanker in the Persian Gulf off Iraq near the Iranian border as it prepared to transfer fuel to another tanker owned by a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. No one has claimed responsibility for the mining, though it comes after a series of similar attacks in 2019 that the US Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved.In November, an Iranian scientist who founded the country’s military nuclear program two decades earlier was killed in an attack Tehran blames on Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-plans-20-uranium-enrichment-as-soon-as-possible/story-8Aq0s5Vt3bNDPKI9v7nxzL.html

The country of 9 million people has ramped up its vaccination drive to a 24/7 operation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Israelis that the country will be the first to emerge from the pandemic if they cooperate. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith health providers administering the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at a rate of 150,000 people a day - almost 2% of the population - the country is expected to have a much higher fraction of population with vaccines than other countries including the UK, according to a report published in The Guardian.Here is how Israel launched the world’s fastest Covid-19 vaccination drive: 1. Israel has advantages - it is a relatively small country in terms of geography and also population. A robust pre-pandemic digitalised healthcare system clubbed with the geographical advantages were factors in Israel’s initial success. 2. Manpower also played an important role in the country’s successful inoculation drive. Everyone over the age of 18 is obliged to register with government-linked insurance agencies and army medics have been called in to help.3. The government campaigned vigorously to curb the spread of anti-vaccine information. It petitioned Facebook to remove four groups that published “content designed to mislead about coronavirus vaccines”, according to a report.4. ‘Green passports’ are being issued to encourage citizens to get vaccinated. These are documents that would allow vaccinated people to eat in restaurants, travel freely and be exempted from quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-passports-to-army-medics-how-israel-launched-the-world-s-fastest-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-06FmwAuu9x6Zm4FeCdNXmK.html

Victoria, which now has 29 active cases, this week made masks mandatory across the state while limiting gatherings and shutting its border to NSW, prompting lengthy delays at border checkpoints on New Year’s Day. Authorities on Saturday said genomic sequencing showed the Victoria outbreak was directly linked to the NSW cluster, vindicating the decision to shut borders.“As a result of the learnings that we have gone through, we’ve taken the view that the responses we have put in place are proportionate and fair. Victorians have a lot at stake here,” Victorian health minister Martin Foley said.South Australia state recorded another day of zero cases while Tasmania, which is COVID free, banned visitors from parts of Victoria. Queenslanders were urged to reassess travel plans to NSW and Victoria.Australia has reported more than 28,450 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.

The government has said residents will be able to choose which type they receive, though the details are yet to be announced.The Hong Kong government appointed a committee to approve the emergency use of the vaccines, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said last week, signaling the city is moving closer to authorizing the candidates.Separately, Radio Television Hong Kong reported Saturday that Tony Ko, chief executive of the city’s Hospital Authority, said the organization is considering testing all of its medical staff regularly for coronavirus.Hong Kong does not require all residents to screen for the virus but issued mandatory testing orders to tenants of 44 buildings where cases were found in the past 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-in-talks-to-use-vaccine-records-for-travel-hket-says/story-CPWhfGwPPOPL8ROEUgnaTJ.html
02-01-2021||World||Brazil President Bolsonaro’s tough 2021 balance between ideology, pragmatism||Brazil’s pugnacious president, Jair Bolsonaro, survived 2020 in surprisingly good shape personally and politically, with buoyant popularity ratings despite his own bout of Covid-19 and a broader pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 of his countrymen.But the new year — and a looming re-election campaign — bring risks on all sides for the populist who has fought to limit environmental protections and rein in leftist influence on government and culture while feuding even with fellow conservatives in Latin America’s largest nation.Resurgent Covid-19 has lifted Brazil’s death rate to its highest in three months, despite the president’s insistence the pandemic is petering out. His sons face corruption investigations. He has no firm block of support in congress. And he’s losing his main international ally with the exit of US President Donald Trump, whose off-the-cuff rhetoric and tendency to test democratic norms had emboldened the Brazilian leader.Perhaps most damaging is the expiration with the new year of a pandemic-inspired financial aid program that has helped fend off hunger for tens of millions of poor Brazilians — among whom his popularity has been growing.Bolsonaro may be famous for breaking the rules, but he’s going to have to be more pragmatic, said Lucas de Aragão, a partner at Brasilia-based political consultancy Arko Advice. “He’s never going to be a president who plays by the book, but he has to start picking his fights.”More pragmatism starts with choosing his enemies more carefully, de Aragão said.During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro’s broadsides against the political establishment and intellectual elite resonated with disaffected voters, including many moderates. He won handily, and has since kept up his confrontational tone, hammering away at congressional leaders, federal prosecutors, governors and the Supreme Court — many of them people who potentially could help him get bills through congress or win reelection in 2022.In the United States, Trump held to his polarizing tone and lost. Unlike Trump, Bolsonaro does not have a powerful party standing behind him. As a matter of fact, since leaving the Social Liberal Party a year ago, he does not have a party at all — and is now trying to cobble together a working majority in congress, where a February 1 leadership vote could determine the fate of his legislative ambitions.Bolsonaro has shown some signs of reaching out. After months of demonizing the Supreme Court as biased against him, he was photographed in October hugging Supreme Court Justice Dias Toffoli at an informal meeting in Toffoli’s house.The reaction illustrated his dilemma. Many of his firmest supporters turned to social media to express their surprise, if not bewilderment.“I need to govern,” Bolsonaro said in response to concerns raised by a supporter on his official Facebook account.Last month’s municipal elections alarmed the Presidential Palace. Only five of the 16 mayoral candidates who Bolsonaro publicly backed won — none of them in the country’s biggest cities. Three senior government officials told The Associated Press that the results took Bolsonaro by surprise. “He did not expect to have so little influence,” said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to comment publicly.Recent polls say Bolsonaro is roughly as popular as when he was elected. But his ratings have declined among richer and better educated Brazilians while increasing among the poor, who have been receiving the government’s pandemic financial aid.The end of that aid is likely to dent the president’s popularity, said Arko’s de Aragão.It is the only income for more than a third of those who received it, according to a December study by Brazilian polling institute Datafolha. As many as 70 million Brazilians ended up getting financial support during the health crisis, costing the government a hefty $61 billion at a time when economists are warning of an unsustainable deficit and rising inflation.The cutoff could leave 24 million of them in extreme poverty, International Monetary Fund Director Kristalina Georgieva warned in December.With no firm congressional bloc of his own, Bolsonaro has been courting a group of centrist lawmakers known as the Centrao in hopes of winning leadership in the lower house of congress.Such efforts might not be enough to assure a majority, and if their candidate, Arthur Lira, loses, Bolsonaro will struggle to achieve promised legislation, such as the loosening of gun laws or opening up the Amazon rainforest to development.The group’s support did not come for free and Bolsonaro faces pressure to grant its members some ministerial positions –– the sort of political horse trading he had promised his supporters that he would never do.For many Bolsonaro voters, the Centrao bloc represents the kind of corrupt politics the president tried to distance himself from during the campaign.But any signs of conciliation seem to be overshadowed by Bolsonaro’s hardline stands against pandemic restrictions on gatherings and his skepticism over vaccines.Bolsonaro, who recovered from a bout of Covid-19, has said he will not take any of the vaccines, and has actively undermined confidence in the Chinese-made CoronaVac shot backed by Sao Paulo Gov. João Doria, who is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in 2022.Prominent health experts and opposition lawmakers have accused the government of dragging its feet on a national immunization program. It only presented a plan in mid-December when forced to by the Supreme Court.With no approved vaccine ready for delivery, Latin America’s largest nation is running behind other Latin American countries.Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist who teaches at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, said the president still relies heavily on polarization.“He continues as a radical ... This is something that is deeply embedded in his political DNA: to polarize, divide and not govern,” Stuenkel said.Pereira echoed that view: “He needs to moderate to govern, but he needs to polarize to win elections. This is the contradiction of the Bolsonaro government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-bolsonaro-s-tough-2021-balance-between-ideology-pragmatism/story-avyCjWuLHQYgq1wpb794hI.html
02-01-2021||World||In Georgia, Joe Biden’s presidency meets early defining moment||Usually it’s a president’s first midterm election that reorders a White House’s political approach and priorities. For President-elect Joe Biden, his most defining congressional election is coming before he takes office.Two runoffs Tuesday in Georgia will decide which party controls the Senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy and the environment. For a politician who sold himself to Americans as a uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the Georgia elections will help determine whether he’s able to live up to his billing.“It’s not that you can’t get anything done in the minority or get everything done in the majority, but having the gavel, having that leadership control can be the difference in success or failure for an administration,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, who held his post opposite current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Both Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock must win Tuesday to split the Senate 50-50. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, would provide the tiebreaker needed to determine control.To be sure, even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn’t give Biden everything he wants. Senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren’t enough Democrats willing to change that requirement. So, regardless of Georgia’s results, Biden will have to win over Republicans in a Senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stand to see their stock rise.A Democratic Senate still would clear an easier path for Biden’s nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give Democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. Conversely, a Senate led by McConnell almost certainly would deny Biden major legislative victories, as it did late in President Barack Obama’s tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes.Biden’s team is keenly aware of the stakes. The president-elect will travel to Atlanta on Monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock for the second time in three weeks. Biden’s campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign Sunday in Savannah.In his last visit, Biden called Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler “roadblocks” and urged Georgians “to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word ‘yes’ and not just ‘no.’”Congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, plus eight as Obama’s vice president and top congressional liaison. Biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents’ increased use of executive action to go around Congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.Even some Republicans are hopeful. Michael Steel, once a top adviser to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a chief Obama foil along with McConnell, blamed Obama’s Capitol Hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. Conversely, Steel said, “President-elect Biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former President Obama was not.”Steel predicted Biden and McConnell, two former colleagues, can find “common ground” on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. Steel noted a handful of Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns.Still, there’s no indication McConnell would allow consideration of other top Biden priorities, most notably a “public option” expansion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without a single Republican vote when Democrats controlled both chambers on Capitol Hill. Biden’s proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans also are likely dead in a GOP Senate.Biden will need his negotiating skills to navigate the left flank of his own party as well. While progressives say they’ve lowered their expectations of what’s possible — even under a Democratic Senate — they still intend to push Biden.Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press Democrats in Congress to use the “budget reconciliation” process to work around the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold. Cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies.Those moves, Cohen noted, could generate considerable savings, creating new revenue even if Republicans won’t agree to any tax increases.He also said progressives will push Biden to use executive authority. He named two initiatives Biden has called for publicly: ending new drilling on federal lands and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, even if Congress won’t set that floor across the economy. Another progressive priority, cancelling student debt under federal loan programs, is something Biden has not said whether he’d be willing to attempt unilaterally.Democrats’ limited expectations about their own power, even with a potential majority, belie the exaggerated claims Republicans have used in the Georgia races.In Perdue’s and Loeffler’s telling, a Democratic Senate would “rubber stamp” a “socialist agenda,” from “ending private insurance” and “expanding the Supreme Court” to adopting wholesale a “Green New Deal” that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every US household by thousands of dollars each year. Besides misrepresenting Biden’s and most Democratic senators’ policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the Senate’s roster.At one campaign stop this week, Ossoff said Perdue’s “ridiculous” attacks “blow my mind.” He scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with Biden, amount to a leftist lunge. But the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the Georgia runoffs matter.“We have too much good work to do,” Ossoff said, “to be mired in gridlock and obstruction for the next few years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-georgia-joe-biden-s-presidency-meets-early-defining-moment/story-ggBWRFQUaExfxQXDKverBN.html
02-01-2021||World||China switches into covert mode in Nepal, has team of 3 to continue mission||President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party of China hasn’t given up on efforts to influence the course of Nepali politics and has positioned a three-member team in Kathmandu that is continuing to reach out to prominent politicians in the Himalayan nation, people familiar with the matter said.President Xi had sent a four-member team led by Guo Yezhou, vice-minister of the international department of the Chinese communist party’s central committee that made a high-profile visit to Nepal that was closely tracked by the media.The team wrapped up its visit on Wednesday, unable to deliver on its primary objective of uniting the two rival factions of the Nepal Communist Party led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Nepal.Also Read: Chinese team in Nepal makes a peace offering to PM Oli. He doesn’t biteGuo Yezhou’s delegation, which had targeted persuading PM Oli to roll back the December 20 presidential order dissolving Nepal’s 275-member House of Representatives, had also explored the possibility of getting the two warring factions to jointly contest the national elections on April 30 and May 10 if the presidential order can’t be rescinded. A third option believed to have been pursued by Guo Yezhou was designed to address the possibility of the Supreme Court rolling back the presidential order and involved the formation of a communist-led government with the support of opposition parties such as the Nepali Congress minus PM Oli.Nepal watchers said the high-profile Guo Yezhou’s delegation was, however, only the public face of the Chinese effort.“The covert aspect continues,” one of them said.For now, this assignment has been handed to three officials of the Chinese communist party, who were part of the second team that had quietly travelled by road from China to Nepal before Guo Yezhou landed at Kathmandu’s international airport on Sunday last.The three - Zekun Lai, Dongme Huang and Yonglin Zhong - are the Chinese communist party’s points persons on Nepal politics who have cultivated political leaders for years. “This is what you might call the backchannel effort that stays under the radar,” a diplomat based in Nepal said.The change in the Chinese approach to keep its intervention a secret comes against the backdrop of resentment in some quarters in Nepal over its attempt to influence politics and politicians. A day before Guo Yezhou’s delegation returned to China on Wednesday, dozens of people had hit the streets of Kathmandu holding a torch rally on Tuesday night to protest against the visit that was aimed at interfering in Nepal’s internal political matters.To be sure, China denies that Guo Yezhou’s team was tasked to influence Nepal’s politics but underlines that it wants Nepal’s politicians to “properly manage internal differences”.“As the country’s friend and close neighbour, we hope relevant parties in Nepal can take into account the national interests and the big picture, properly manage internal differences and commit themselves to political stability and national development,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hasn-t-given-up-in-nepal-positions-a-team-of-3-to-continue-outreach/story-sEfBAumsjyNscJdLyw60YO.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Down with patriarchy, long live feminism’: How demonstrations led to Argentina legalising abortion||Argentina has become the largest South American nation to legalise abortion after massive demonstrations across the country by pro-abortion activists, who had seen several bills about the issue rejected until now. December 30 saw one of the most important moments in Argentina’s history when after more than 12 hours of debate, the Catholic church influenced government passed the law, which legalises abortion allowing terminations up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. “We managed to break the prejudice, and the discussion became a lot less dramatic. Society at large started to understand the debate in more moderate, less fanatic terms,” Lucila Crexell, a senator, was quoted by the New York Times.Argentina is a country where the Catholic church has long held sway in government decisions, therefore the topic of abortion was always shunned. Only two years ago, the government rejected a bill that sought to legalise abortion, a decision that felt like a heartbreaking defeat for the organisers and demonstrators of a stirring women’s movement.However, the fight for legalising abortion had started in the 1980s, when feminists took up the cause. The issue gained little to no traction at the time, owing to a time when democracy seemed weak since the country had just come out of a military dictatorship and religious conservatism ruled public debate.In 2005, the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion was formed and the fight for legal abortion had formally begun. The first bill was introduced in 2008 but it was shunned due to lawmakers who did not want to be associated and the Catholic church lobbying. “Many said they agreed, but refused to put their signature on the bill,” said Julia Martino, one of the activists in that effort as quoted by New York Times.What really kicked off the movement was the brutal murders of women in 2015, including a 14-year-old pregnant girl, and led to the creation of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Woman Less) movement, which began highlighting the struggle Argentine women faced in getting underground abortions.The efforts of the movement brought Argentinian women together, participating in massive street demonstrations and protests, and shedding light on the issues like sexism, gender parity and women’s rights. Their demonstrations were so effective and outreaching that several other Latin American nations took notice and followed in their footsteps.In 2017, abortion rights activists called for a demonstration to support legalisation and the turnout was unlike anyone had expected. “What happened with the movement is that it started increasing in number and gaining different voices,” said Claudia Pineiro, a writer and abortion-rights activist. Slogans were shouted at the massive rallies, of which the most popular was, “Down with the patriarchy, which is going to fall! It’s going to fall! Long live feminism, which will triumph! It will triumph!” One of the activists of the issues in the 1980s and a government sociologist, Dora Barrancos, said that the new generation had ‘an insurrection that is infectious.’The Ni Una Menos movement had rocketed the issue of women’s rights into the country’s political discourse and has had a significant impact on government decisions surrounding the issue. In 2017, the country passed a law expanding the quota system which women to attain full parity in national politics.The foundation stone for such decisions was also laid by female lawmakers who, despite having political differences, found themselves united on this particular front who planned out their strategies on WhatsApp groups. “We realised how powerful we are as women when we act in a coordinated fashion,” Silvia Lospennato, an ally of the former president Mauricio Macri who was against abortion, was quoted as saying by New York Times. “We all contributed, in a way of doing politics that is very anomalous and is completely different from the way men do politics,” she added.Several women lawmakers sought to legalise abortion in 2018 but the government, after intense lobbying by the Catholic church, rejected the bill. Several senators who voted against the bill then, voted for it this time around as well. President Alberto Fernandez, elected in 2019, promised to make the issue a legislative priority in his campaigns. The movement had eventually garnered the support of all kinds of people. It had started out with young women but they were joined by older women, men, blue-collar workers and over time, the demonstrations had taken the shape of a national movement. Rural campaigners had also joined in with the urban base.This is not the first time that street activism has succeeded in ushering in progressive laws in the country. In 2010, Argentina approved same-sex marriage and 2012 saw them approving one of the world’s most progressive gender identity laws. Both had gained importance and traction through street demonstrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/down-with-patriarchy-long-live-feminism-how-demonstrations-led-to-argentina-legalising-abortion/story-KldI91DjS1SwbmiSdDCYBK.html

02-01-2021||World||US slams Chinese aggression against India in new defence policy law||The United States expressed “significant concern” with Chinese aggression along the border with India in a defence policy law passed by the Senate on Friday, completing a congressional override of President Donald Trump’s veto of the legislation.“Continued military aggression by the government of China along the border with India is a significant concern,” says the $740 billion National Defence Authorisation Act 2021 (NDAA). It calls upon Beijing to resolve all disputes using existing diplomatic mechanisms.The legislation became law after the Republican-controlled Senate voted 81-13 to pass it, with way more than the two-third votes required to override a presidential veto. The Democratic-led House of Representatives had passed the override last week with a similarly overwhelming support - 322 to 87.Trump had vetoed the legislation passed earlier by both chambers, but his reasons had nothing to do with the section on Chinese aggression on the border with India. He had demanded that it should repeal liability protection for social media platforms, drop sections renaming military facilities named after confederate military figures, and thinning US military deployments in certain areas.It was the first congressional override of presidential veto for Trump, whose term ends on January 20, when President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president.The NDAA conveys bicameral and bipartisan support for India in its border standoff with China. Though it is neither a demand nor a threat enforceable with consequences, it is a significant show of support for India.In Section 1206 titled “Sense of Congress on the aggression of the government of China along the border with India and growing territorial claims” the law says, “Continued military aggression by the government of China along the border with India is a significant concern.”The “government of China should work with the government of India towards de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force”, it adds, and goes on to point to China’s other aggressive actions in the region.It says US congress believes that “attempts by the government of China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilising and inconsistent with international law”.Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic lawmaker who proposed this language in the law, said after its passage, “Through today’s New Year’s Day vote in the Senate, Congress has made the National Defence Authorisation Act into law, including elements of my resolution calling on China to end its military aggression towards India and others in the broader Indo-Pacific region.”He added, “The Chinese military’s violent aggression along the Line of Actual Control with India and elsewhere is unacceptable, and the passage into law of this legislation sends a clear message of support and solidarity to India and our other partners across the world as we enter the New Year.”The bicameral and bipartisan snub for Trump came amid his efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden in the presidential election. Having failed to convince courts and state legislatures with claims of election wrongdoings, he is trying to get congress to overturn it when it meets on Wednesday to certify Biden’s victory, the final stage in the presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-chinese-aggression-against-india-in-new-defence-policy-law/story-Qyw5y9omIGjd9MiYCaiiZK.html
02-01-2021||World||Brexit is a new world businesses still need to figure out||British businesses probably didn’t expect to start 2021 worrying about wooden pallets after a year of grappling with the coronavirus and a meltdown in the economy.Yet as they start a  new relationship with the European Union, securing a supply of heat-treated platforms—baked to 56 degrees Celsius (133 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 30 minutes—is now one of the myriad issues they face.The 1,200-page trade deal struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve after a little over nine months of negotiations ended the uncertainty that the UK would crash out of the bloc in chaos. While the zero-tariff, zero-quota accord is a relief for British companies, it only marks the next stage in the evolution of the Brexit process—and potentially the most difficult one.  Also Read: Deal approved, post-Brexit era begins for UK and EUBe it wooden pallets for shipping goods, customs paperwork, new fish quotas or the recognition of professional qualifications, the next few months will be a case of figuring out the consequences of not just what’s in the historical agreement, but also what’s not.“It’s going to be a marathon, a very long marathon,” said Mark Price, former deputy chairman of retailer John Lewis Partnership and a former UK trade minister. “This is why trade deals normally on average take about seven years to agree as they are hugely complex.”Johnson hailed the agreement with the EU four and a half years after Britain voted to leave and said it will “drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent.” But it will take time to divine whether that prediction ultimately will come true.Bloomberg Economics estimates that UK growth will be half a percentage point lower per year for the next decade compared with if the country had stayed in the now 27-member single market. It forecast the economy will expand 6% this year, though that was before the latest tightening of England’s Covid-19 restrictions.Brexit Bulletin: They Think It’s All Over. It Isn’t YetIn the meantime, businesses have to contend with paperwork before more complex issues can be resolved, such as the financial services industry’s future in the EU. There are also regulations around rules of origin determining what goods can be exported to the EU that need to be navigated. Mutual recognition of standards, which would allow firms to make products in the UK and market them in the EU without any extra certification, isn’t part of the deal.“There are likely to be a thousand separate unintended consequences from a trade deal of such scale,” said Will Hayllar, a partner in the consumer goods practice at OC&C Strategy Consultants Ltd. While “many things will get flushed out in time,” there will be uncertainty for businesses “in the intervening period when they have to decide if they will comply with everything or not.”Take wooden pallets. With Britain now having “third country” status with the EU, exporters and importers must comply with rules on preventing the spread of pests and diseases. It may take some disruption to trade for the EU to agree on a solution, said Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation.“Heat-treated wooden pallets are not needed for safety reasons and just add extra costs and this is something that should and could have been resolved before now,” said Goudie. Britain’s food and drink industry alone could face an additional 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) of extra costs a year from increased bureaucracy, the group estimates.Indeed, when disruption comes, it comes quickly. Dover, Britain’s busiest port, has only just cleared a backlog of thousands of trucks after France shut its border for two days in December because of the new strain of the coronavirus that’s forced much of Britain into another lockdown.  Also Read: British lawmakers approve post-Brexit trade deal with EUCompanies have sought other routes. Deutsche Lufthansa AG flew another Boeing Co. 777F with fruit, vegetables, clothing, medical equipment and jet-engine parts from Frankfurt to Doncaster-Sheffield Airport in England on Thursday. A load bound for supermarkets is scheduled for Jan. 2.Irish officials also warned of potential delays from early next week. Around 410,000 trucks or vans come through Dublin port each year from the UK and before Brexit virtually all would have passed unencumbered. More than a quarter of these vehicles will contain food or animals that now have to be checked. For one, the auto industry has maintained a consistently dim view as to just how smoothly trade between the UK and EU will be, even though the Brexit accord spared manufacturers 10% tariffs on cars and 4% levies on components.“Immediate costs and friction are inevitable,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive officer of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. “Brexit has always been about damage limitation.”Bracing for the end of the Brexit transition period was already a costly endeavor, with the trade group estimating in November that the industry had spent at least 735 million pounds on preparing for new customs declarations, stockpiling parts and other measures.It remains to be seen whether investments in the UK delayed by Vauxhall maker PSA Group and BMW AG pending an outcome to trade talks will now materialize.  The same can be said for Nissan Motor Co., which hasn’t yet confirmed whether all models built at its plant in Sunderland, northeast England, contain enough local content to avoid tariffs. The Japanese carmaker opened the plant in the mid-1980s specifically to access the European single market.The government has attempted to ease the transition by delaying the introduction of full border controls. Companies moving goods into Britain won’t have to file customs declarations for six months.UK businesses exporting goods into the EU won’t have to produce rules-of-origin paperwork proving their goods were sourced domestically—and therefore exempt from tariffs—until the end of 2021, according to a Dec. 29 guidance note from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Firms could still be asked to provide the documents retroactively.Then there’s the financial industry. Banks have now lost their “passporting rights” allowing them to trade freely in the EU. Future access to the market will rely on the bloc confirming Britain’s financial frameworks are broadly aligned or “equivalent” with its own rules. Both sides had previously vowed to deal with that by mid-2020.“The deal is done but the reality that businesses have to face has not arrived yet,” said Ian Cheshire, the outgoing chairman of Barclays UK He predicted three to six months of “minor chaos from paperwork” though ultimately “people will work that out.”Among those people will be workers in Britain’s services industry, which makes up 80% of the economy. They face the hurdle of having their professional qualifications recognized in the EU, something that’s no longer automatic.  And while the Brexit deal was heralded by Johnson as a new era for the fishing industry, that too has been cast into doubt. A last-minute compromise on how and when to reduce EU access to British waters finally got the deal over the line. A study published on Dec. 29 by the Scottish government, which opposes Brexit, said new quotas reduce the catch for key species of cod and haddock.“It’s quite remarkable that for all the headlines about fishing, there was little on financial services when it is so blindingly obviously more important for our future,” said Cheshire. “I genuinely worry that people have not understood quite how difficult the path ahead could be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-is-a-new-world-businesses-still-need-to-figure-out/story-C95ZijqL1mdu2RLoTbD5fO.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Cheap trick’: China rebuffs latest Taiwan offer of talks||China has rebuffed the latest offer of talks from Taiwan, saying the government was engaging in a “cheap trick” and provocation by seeking confrontation with China at every turn.Taiwan is ready to have “meaningful” talks with China as equals as long as they are willing to put aside confrontation, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday, offering another olive branch to Beijing in her New Year’s speech.China views the democratic and self-governed island as its own territory, and cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after Tsai was first elected, viewing her as a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence.In a statement late on Friday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said there was no way of changing the reality that the island was part of China, and the refusal of Taiwan’s government to accept that was the root cause of present tensions.Since 2016, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) “has continued to provoke by seeking independence, confronting the mainland at every turn, deliberately creating confrontation across the Taiwan Strait”, it said.“They again talked about so-called ‘dialogue,’ but where can that come from?” the office added. “We urge the DPP authorities to stop it with these cheap tricks that dupe people.”Tsai, re-elected by a landslide last year on a pledge to stand up to China and defend Taiwan’s democracy and security, has repeatedly said Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.Tensions have risen in recent months with China ramping up its military activities near the island, including on occasion flying fighter jets across the median line of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which usually serves as an unofficial buffer.China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing US support for the island. Beijing views this as a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cheap-trick-china-rebuffs-latest-taiwan-offer-of-talks/story-CdRpYdBxbguiNSIbkdsTsO.html

The trial’s Vaccine Transition Option allows all participants aged 16 or older the choice to discover whether they were given the placebo, “and for participants who learn they received the placebo, to have the option to receive the investigational vaccine while staying in the study,” the companies said on their website. The US Food and Drug Administration and a panel of its outside advisers have expressed concerns over Pfizer’s “unblinding” plan, saying it could make it harder to continue collecting data on safety and effectiveness needed to win full FDA approval of the vaccine. Trial participants who received the placebo will have two doses of the investigational vaccine reserved for them within the study, the companies said on the website.“The study doctor will follow the latest guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their local health authorities to offer the Vaccine Transition Option to participants in a prioritized manner,” the companies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-to-offer-covid-vaccine-to-volunteers-who-got-placebo/story-8MP3jEm9228zPVcLJeFlfK.html
02-01-2021||World||Once a model, California now struggles to tame Covid-19||Ambulances waited hours for openings to offload coronavirus patients. Overflow patients were moved to hospital hallways and gift shops, even a cafeteria. Refrigerated trucks were on standby, ready to store the dead.For months, California did many of the right things to avoid a catastrophic surge from the pandemic. But by the time Gov. Gavin Newsom said on December 15 that 5,000 body bags were being distributed, it was clear that the nation’s most populous state had entered a new phase of the Covid-19 crisis.Now infections have been racing out of control for weeks, and California remains at or near the top of the list of states with the most new cases per capita. It has routinely set new marks for infections and deaths, and began the new year reporting a record 585 deaths in a single day.Experts say a variety of factors combined to wipe out the past efforts, which for much of the year held the virus to manageable levels. Cramped housing, travel and Thanksgiving gatherings contributed to the spread, along with the public’s fatigue amid regulations that closed many schools and businesses and encouraged — or required — an isolated lifestyle.Another factor could be a more contagious variant of the virus detected in Southern California, although it’s not clear yet how widespread that may be.California’s woes have helped fuel the year-end US infection spike and added urgency to the attempts to beat back the scourge that has killed more than 340,000 Americans. Even with vaccines becoming available, cases are almost certain to continue growing, and yet another surge is expected in the weeks after Christmas and New Year’s.On Friday, the number of confirmed US coronavirus cases surpassed 20 million, nearly twice as many as the No. 2 country, India, and nearly one-quarter of the more than 83 million cases globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In California, the southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped with patients, and intensive care units have no more beds for Covid-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms. Some hospitals are having difficulty keeping up with the demand for oxygen.Hospitalizations statewide have gone up more than eightfold in two months and nearly tenfold in Los Angeles County. On Thursday, the total number of California deaths surpassed 25,000, joining only New York and Texas at that milestone.“Most heartbreaking is that if we had done a better job of reducing transmission of the virus, many of these deaths would not have happened,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, who has pleaded with people not to get together and worsen the spread.Crowded houses and apartments are often cited as a source of spread, particularly in Los Angeles, which has some of the densest neighborhoods in the US Households in and around LA often have several generations — or multiple families — living under one roof. Those tend to be lower-income areas where residents work essential jobs that can expose them to the virus at work or while commuting.The socioeconomic situation in LA County is “like the kindling,” said Paula Cannon, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California. “And now we got to the stage where there was enough Covid out in the community that it lit the fire.”Home to a quarter of the state’s 40 million residents, LA County has had 40% of the state’s deaths and a third of its 2.3 million cases. The virus has hit Latino and Black communities harder.Cannon said there’s a moral imperative for people who can follow stay-home orders to help prevent spread that is harder to contain in other areas.“What you can’t do is say to people, ‘Can you stop living in a house with eight other people, five of whom are working essential worker jobs?’” she said. “This is the structure that we can’t change in LA. This is, I think, contributing to why our levels have suddenly got scarily high and looks like they’re going to keep going up and keep staying that way.”In March, during the early days of the pandemic, Newsom was hailed for issuing the nation’s first state stay-home order.The Democrat eased business restrictions in May, and when a broader restart led to another surge, imposed more rules. In early December, with cases out of control, he issued a looser stay-home order. He also closed businesses such as barbershops and salons, halted restaurant dining and limited capacity in retail stores. The latest restrictions apply everywhere except in rural Northern California.But Dr. Lee Riley, an infectious diseases professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said that while the state managed to flatten the curve of rising cases, it never effectively bent the curve downward to the point infections would die out.When cases rose in June and July, California was never able to do enough contact tracing to isolate infected people and those they may have exposed before they spread the disease — often unwittingly — to others, he said. And public health directives were never adequately enforced.“What California did was to maybe delay the peak,” Riley said. Infections “really just never got low enough. And we started lifting the restrictions, and that just allowed the transmissions to just continue to increase. We never really saw a real decline.”California’s health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said if state and local leaders had not made difficult decisions early on that saved lives, the current surge might not be the worst the state has seen.He acknowledged the exhaustion many people feel after enduring months of disruptions to their lives. Public health officials, he said, need to find a way to reach people who have given up or not followed rules on social distancing and masks.Across California, local officials have reminded people that the fate of the virus lies in their behavior and asked for one more round of shared sacrifice. They reminded people that activities that were safe earlier this year are now risky as the virus becomes more widespread.“You can practice safety and low-risk behavior from March to October. But all that is erased. Nothing matters except what you are doing to fight the virus right now,” said Corinne McDaniels-Davidson, director of the Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University. “This pandemic is an ultra-marathon. In our culture, we are used to sprints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-a-model-california-now-struggles-to-tame-covid-19/story-UTagblABrLuiDZ2ZwQaXfK.html
02-01-2021||World||US judge dismisses lawmaker lawsuit against Pence over electoral count||A judge on Friday rejected a lawsuit filed by a US lawmaker from Texas and other Republicans against Vice President Mike Pence who is set to preside Wednesday over a joint session of Congress to formalize the results of the 2020 presidential election.US District Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle said Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for the state of Arizona who filed suit Sunday lack standing to bring the legal action seeking to overturn the election of President-elect Joe Biden.A spokesman for President Donald Trump referred questions to Pence’s office. A spokesman for Pence declined to comment.Trump has refused to concede defeat and has repeatedly falsely claimed the election was tainted by widespread fraud. He and his allies have lost dozens of court efforts seeking to reverse the election results.Biden beat President Donald Trump by a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College and is set to be sworn in on Jan. 20.Under the Electoral College system, “electoral votes” are allotted to states and the District of Columbia based on their congressional representation.Some Republicans have said they plan to object to the count of presidential electors next week in Congress. Reuters reported this week the effort could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has virtually no chance of overturning the results.A Justice Department lawyer representing Pence on Thursday had urged Kernodle to dismiss the lawsuit saying they had sued the wrong person as they raised “a host of weighty legal issues about the manner in which the electoral votes for president are to be counted.”“The Senate and the House, not the Vice President, have legal interests that are sufficiently adverse to plaintiffs to ground a case or controversy,” Pence’s filing said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-dismisses-lawmaker-lawsuit-against-pence-over-electoral-count/story-UeSTXhu9wpT6hdAaaoojgJ.html
02-01-2021||World||GOP torn over Trump’s Electoral College challenge of Biden||President Donald Trump’s extraordinary challenge of his election defeat by President-elect Joe Biden is becoming a defining moment for the Republican Party before next week’s joint session of Congress to confirm the Electoral College results.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging Republicans not to try to overturn the election, but not everyone is heeding him. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri vows to join House Republicans in objecting to the state tallies. On the other side of the party’s split, GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska warns such challenges are a “dangerous ploy” threatening the nation’s civic norms.Caught in the middle is Vice President Mike Pence, who faces growing pressure and a lawsuit from Trump’s allies over his ceremonial role in presiding over the session Wednesday.The days ahead are expected to do little to change the outcome. Biden is set to be inaugurated January 20 after winning the Electoral College vote 306-232. But the effort to subvert the will of voters is forcing Republicans to make choices that will set the contours of the post-Trump era and an evolving GOP.“I will not be participating in a project to overturn the election,” Sasse wrote in a lengthy social media post.Sasse, a potential 2024 presidential contender, said he was “urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy.”Trump, the first president to lose a re-election bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of non partisan election officials that there wasn’t any. Of the roughly 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He’s also lost twice at the US Supreme Court.Still, the president has pushed Republican senators to pursue his unfounded charges even though the Electoral College has already cemented Biden’s victory and all that’s left is Congress’ formal recognition of the count before the new president is sworn in.“We are letting people vote their conscience,” Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican, told reporters at the Capitol.Thune’s remarks as the GOP whip in charge of rounding up votes show that Republican leadership is not putting its muscle behind Trump’s demands, but allowing senators to choose their course. He noted the gravity of questioning the election outcome.“This is an issue that’s incredibly consequential, incredibly rare historically and very precedent-setting,” he said. “This is a big vote. They are thinking about it.”Pence will be carefully watched as he presides over what is typically a routine vote count in Congress but is now heading toward a prolonged showdown that could extend into Wednesday night, depending on how many challenges Hawley and others mount.The vice president is being sued by a group of Republicans who want Pence to have the power to overturn the election results by doing away with an 1887 law that spells out how Congress handles the vote count.Trump’s own Justice Department may have complicated what is already a highly improbable effort to upend the ritualistic count January 6. It asked a federal judge to dismiss the last-gasp lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Republican electors from Arizona who are seeking to force Pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote.In a court filing in Texas, the department said they have “have sued the wrong defendant” and Pence should not be the target of the legal action.“A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction,” the department argues.A judge in Texas dismissed the Gohmert lawsuit Friday night. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee, wrote that the plaintiffs “allege an injury that is not fairly traceable” to Pence, “and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.”To ward off a dramatic unraveling, McConnell convened a conference call with Republican senators Thursday specifically to address the coming joint session and logistics of tallying the vote, according to several Republicans granted anonymity to discuss the private call.The Republican leader pointedly called on Hawley to answer questions about his challenge to Biden’s victory, according to two of the Republicans.But there was no response because Hawley was a no-show, the Republicans said.His office did not respond to a request for comment.Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who has acknowledged Biden’s victory and defended his state’s elections systems as valid and accurate, spoke up on the call, objecting to those challenging Pennsylvania’s results and making clear he disagrees with Hawley’s plan to contest the result, his office said in a statement.McConnell had previously warned GOP senators not to participate in raising objections, saying it would be a terrible vote for colleagues. In essence, lawmakers would be forced to choose between the will of the outgoing president and that of the voters.Several Republicans have indicated they are under pressure from constituents back home to show they are fighting for Trump in his baseless campaign to stay in office.Hawley became the first GOP senator this week to announce he will raise objections when Congress meets to affirm Biden’s victory in the election, forcing House and Senate votes that are likely to delay — but in no way alter — the final certification of Biden’s win.Other Republican senators are expected to join Hawley, wary of ceding the spotlight to him as they, too, try to emerge as leaders in a post-Trump era.A number of Republicans in the Democratic-majority House have already said they will object on Trump’s behalf. They only needed a single senator to go along with them to force votes in both chambers.When Biden was vice president, he, too, presided over the session as the Electoral College presented the 2016 vote tally to Congress to confirm Trump the winner. The session was brief, despite objections from some Democrats.Jen Psaki, speaking for the Biden transition team, dismissed Hawley’s move as “antics” that will have no bearing on Biden being sworn in on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-torn-over-trump-s-electoral-college-challenge-of-biden/story-6IvASFJI5WlFBCB2Qy2liM.html
02-01-2021||World||Trump vetoes California fishing bill, cites worsening seafood trade deficit||President Donald Trump vetoed a bill Friday that would have gradually ended the use of large-mesh drift gillnets deployed exclusively in federal waters off the coast of California, saying such legislation would increase reliance on imported seafood and worsen a multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit.Trump also said in his veto message to the Senate that the legislation sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., “will not achieve its purported conservation benefits.”Feinstein issued a statement late Friday saying Trump’s veto “has ensured that more whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine species will be needlessly killed, even as we have a proven alternative available.”Trump vetoed the fishing bill as the Republican-controlled Senate followed the Democratic-led House and voted to overturn his earlier veto of the annual defense policy bill, enacting it into law despite Trump’s objections.The fishing bill’s sponsors said large-mesh drift gillnets, which measure between 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) and 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) long and can extend 200 feet (60.9 meters) below the surface of the ocean, are left in the waters overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. But they said at least 60 other marine species — including whales, dolphins and sea lions — can also become entangled in the nets, where they are injured or die.It is illegal to use these nets in US territorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, and off the coasts of Washington state, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. They remain legal in federal waters off California’s coast.In 2018, California passed a four-year phaseout of large-mesh drift gillnets in state waters to protect marine life.The bill Trump vetoed would have extended similar protections to federal waters off California’s shoreline within five years and authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the commercial fishing industry switch to more sustainable types of gear.Trump said the West Coast drift gillnet fishery is subject to “robust legal and regulatory requirements” for environmental protection that equal or go beyond environmental protections applied to foreign fisheries.He said Americans will import more swordfish and other species from foreign sources without this fishery.Feinstein vowed to “reintroduce this bill on the first day of the new Congress” and said she will push for quick enactment once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vetoes-california-fishing-bill-cites-worsening-seafood-trade-deficit/story-280rZNSUmutw4TVoOjck3I.html

Happy New Year!”Obama then shared an article published by The Washington Post Friday describing how a group of prison inmates pooled money together to help a high school student pay for his tuition at the private Catholic school he attended, as reported by The Hill.“And here’s a story that reminds us of the power of fresh starts, community, and the good that’s in all of us, across the country and around the world,” Obama wrote, along with a link to the Post article.His sentiments mirrored those shared by his former vice president, now President-elect Joe Biden who called on Americans to “unite, heal and rebuild” in 2021.“The challenges we face as a nation will not disappear overnight, but as we look forward to the start of a new year, I’m filled with fresh hope about the possibilities of better days to come,” Biden wrote in a tweet.“After a year of pain and loss, let us unite, heal, and rebuild in 2021,” he added.The tweets of the President-elect and former President come after a year where the US has seen over 20 million people contracting Covid-19 and over 340,000 people succcumbing to the virus across the country.The pandemic also fuled an economic crisis where Americans filed for unemployment followed by months of socail unrest following the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.During Biden’s campaign, Obama made several appearances in TV ads and at rallies, calling for unity and support behind Biden to prevent a second term for President Donald Trump.Ahead of Georgia Senate runoff elections on Tuesday -- that would determine which party controls the upper chamber -- Obama has again used his platform to rally support for Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and the Raphael Warnock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-delivers-new-years-message-says-us-best-days-are-still-ahead/story-2rsLwlQQsCKiT59TCAOijO.html

Vulnerable children and those whose guardians are key workers will continue to attend school. Pre-schools will remain open, the government said Friday.The government had originally omitted 10 London areas from a list of schools that would be closed, but yielded after local authorities complained to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. London mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the government’s change of heart.London has one of the country’s highest levels of Covid-19 infections per capita -- in the most recent week of complete data, the capital had a rate of 807 cases per 100,000 people, compared with a rate of 675 in the previous week.“The situation in London continues to worsen and so today we are taking action to protect the public and reduce the spread of this disease in the community,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-tells-london-s-primary-schools-to-stay-closed/story-8qbYhKTuXKt6lqR8E7EeGN.html

In 2019 there were 86 accidents, eight of which were fatal, resulting in 257 fatalities.Large commercial airplanes had 0.27 fatal accidents per million flights in 2020, To70 said, or one fatal crash every 3.7 million flights -- up from 0.18 fatal accidents per million flights in 2019.The decline in crashes came amid a sharp decline in flights due to the coronavirus pandemic. Flightradar24 reported commercial flights it tracked worldwide in 2020 fell 42% to 24.4 million.More than half of all deaths in the To70 review were the 176 people killed in January 2020 when a Ukrainian plane was shot down in Iranian airspace. The second deadliest incident was the May crash of a Pakistan airliner crashed in May killing 98.Large passenger airplanes covered by the statistics are used by nearly all travellers on airlines but exclude small commuter airplanes in service.Over the last two decades, aviation deaths have been falling dramatically. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) said.Over the last five years, there have been an average of 14 fatal accidents for commercial passenger and cargo planes resulting in 345 deaths annually, ASN said.In 2017, aviation had its safest year on record worldwide with only two fatal accidents involving regional turboprops that resulted in 13 deaths and no fatal crashes of passenger jets.The United States has not had a fatal US passenger airline crash since February 2009 and one fatality due to a US passenger airline accident in that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aviation-deaths-rise-worldwide-in-2020-even-as-fatal-incidents-flights-fall/story-kUl3WDGSlWDgjlidUS09HK.html
02-01-2021||World||Mitt Romney assails US failure to plan for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out||Senator Mitt Romney criticized the slow roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine in the US, blaming the federal government for failing to help states get the shot into more people’s arms.“That comprehensive vaccination plans have not been developed at the federal level and sent to the states as models is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable,” the Utah Republican said in a statement Friday.The US vaccination program -- Operation Warp Speed -- has distributed millions of doses to states but is failing to meet projections for how quickly people will be inoculated. About 3.2 million doses have been given, according to the Bloomberg News vaccine tracker, far short of the Trump administration’s goal of administering 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020.Officials have blamed the delays on a delicate vaccine with complex storage requirements, uncertainty over the supply of doses, and strain on local health agencies already facing historic challenges. After criticism, President Donald Trump said this week that it’s the responsibility of the states to deliver the shots, urging them on Twitter to “Get moving!”Romney, one of the most forceful Trump critics among Republicans, said it’s unrealistic to assume health-care workers caring for those sickened by the virus can take on a vaccination program as well, or to lean on major pharmacy chains to save the day. He suggested more medical professionals be trained and enlisted to administer shots, including veterinarians, combat medics, and medical students.“The current program is woefully behind despite the fact that it encompasses the two easiest populations to vaccinate: front-line workers and long-term care residents,” Romney said. “Unless new strategies and plans are undertaken, the deadly delays may be compounded as broader and more complex populations are added.”Michael Pratt, chief communications officer for Operation Warp Speed at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the department has been working with states for months to distribute the vaccines and that the pace will ramp up.Sluggish Vaccine Campaign Raises Specter of US Dysfunction“There will always be a lag between the doses allocated and those shipped; between those shipped and those administered; and between those administered and those reported to CDC as administered. We’re working to make those lags as small as possible,” Pratt said.There have been more than 20 million cases in the US and more than 346,000 Americans have died. Tens of thousands more are expected to succumb in coming months, making the vaccine’s distribution all the more critical.Some countries are far outstripping the US’s vaccination pace. Israel, whose size and population is similar to New Jersey’s, gave shots to an average 60,000 people a day in its first week. If the US were moving at the same speed, it would be doing 2.2 million daily inoculations -- 10 times its current pace.President-elect Joe Biden this week faulted Trump for the slow roll-out of the vaccine and vowed he would speed up vaccinations to 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitt-romney-assails-us-failure-to-plan-for-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out/story-IUUHWWrYLYac3J1r6vDSOO.html

Ahmed said the PML-N chief’s passport will expire on February 16 and it will not be renewed. Prime Minister Imran Khan in October had said that he would contact his British counterpart Boris Johnson, if needed, to discuss Sharif’s deportation. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, on Wednesday said Pakistan had asked the British authorities to deport Sharif who was convicted by the courts. Sharif resigned as Pakistan prime minister in 2017 after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding public office and ruled that graft cases be filed against the beleaguered leader over the Panama Papers scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-extradition-treaty-with-uk-can-only-cancel-nawaz-sharif-s-passport-pak-minister/story-gqOwCWxiliI4OS5sRfqmBP.html

The states of New York and Illinois both registered more than 960,000 cases.Other states with over 520,000 cases include Ohio, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona, the CSSE data showed.By far, the United States remains the nation worst hit by the pandemic, with the world’s most cases and deaths, making up more than 23 percent of the global caseload.US Covid-19 cases reached 10 million on Nov. 9, and the number doubled in less than two months.The United States repeatedly saw record numbers of cases, deaths as well as hospitalizations in the deadliest month of December in 2020.With a toll of 3,750, US daily Covid deaths shattered the record for a second straight day on Wednesday, the deadliest day the country has ever witnessed since the start of the pandemic.Meanwhile, current hospitalizations in the United States hit a record high of 125,379 on Thursday, according to The Covid Tracking Project.Entering the New Year, the country will continue to fight the virus in the face of surging cases following gatherings and travel over the holidays, experts warned.A national ensemble forecast updated Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted a total of 383,000 to 424,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States by January 23, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-20-million-covid-19-cases-by-far-the-highest-total-in-the-world/story-IkKmyMco896uTq7O3SZlHO.html
02-01-2021||World||Trump handed defeat as congress overrides his defense bill veto||US Congress handed Donald Trump a major, bipartisan defeat in the waning days of his presidency, as the Republican-led Senate voted to override his veto of a $740.5 billion defense policy bill.It’s the first time one of Trump’s vetoes has been surmounted. On Twitter, in his first response to the override, Trump said the Senate “missed an opportunity,” terming the effort “Pathetic!!”The final tally was 81 to 13, easily exceeding the two-thirds threshold needed to override a veto, with support coming from both Republicans and Democrats as it did earlier in the House. The massive annual defense authorization measure now will become law.Trump had sought to intimidate GOP senators into voting to sustain his veto, unleashing a bitter attack on fellow Republicans as the chamber prepared to begin the override process.“Weak and tired Republican ‘leadership’ will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass,” Trump tweeted Dec. 29. “Negotiate a better Bill, or get better leaders, NOW!” he added. On Saturday, Trump attacked Senator John Thune for a second time, suggesting that Governor Kristin Noem run again the Senate’s No. 2 Republican in a 2022 South Dakota primary.Friday, before the final vote, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, urged “all of our colleagues” to override Trump’s veto. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and typically a Trump ally, called the annual defense bill “the most significant vote we have” and praised the bipartisan spirit that went into it.The Senate vote followed the House’s 322-87 vote on Dec. 28. Senate leaders had to overcome procedural hurdles after several senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, refused to give unanimous consent to proceed to the override vote -- part of their effort to increase pandemic aid to $2,000 a person from $600. In the tangled politics of the moment, that increase has been championed by Trump and opposed by many Republicans.The votes to override Trump’s veto reflects a widening rift between the president and some congressional Republicans, who stood by him through previous conflicts, as his influence ebbs. More GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in recent weeks recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election.‘Not an Option’“Not once in six decades has a Congress let its differences prevent it from completing this work for our national security and our men and women who wear the uniform,” McConnell said Tuesday on the Senate floor in backing the veto override. “For the brave men and women of the United States armed forces, failure is simply not an option. So when it’s our turn in Congress to have their backs, failure is not an option either.”Although many of Trump’s voters remain loyal to the president, a number of Republican lawmakers share concerns over his recent behavior. The split comes at a dangerous time politically for the GOP -- just days before two runoff races in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate.Trump vetoed the annual defense measure, in part, because he wanted to attach an unrelated provision to eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies from liability for most content published by their users. He cited Section 230 in Saturday’s Twitter post, saying it “gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies.”Trump also took issue with the bill because it contains a provision for renaming military installations that honor Confederate generals. And in his veto message, Trump called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia, without clearly articulating his reasoning.Troop BenefitsThe defense bill, H.R. 6395, is considered must-pass legislation because it authorizes not only billions of dollars for weapons systems, but also benefits for U.S. troops. The measure would increase hazardous duty pay to $275 from $250 per month.It’s a point of bipartisan pride for members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that the annual defense policy bill has now been enacted without fail for 60 consecutive years.The president and others on the right have long accused social media platforms of censoring conservatives, something that the technology giants deny. While lawmakers from both parties have called for modifying or even eliminating Section 230, even Trump allies said it was the wrong place and the wrong time to wage that battle.The defense bill authorizes $732 billion in discretionary spending for national defense, including $69 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also authorizes funding for 93 F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp., the No. 1 defense contractor.The legislation also establishes a commission to study and provide recommendations, within three years, on the removal of names, symbols, displays and monuments that honor or commemorate the Confederacy. It addresses diversity in the military ranks by requiring the removal of personal identifiers in promotion and selection pitches, a step backed by Democratic Representatives Jackie Speier of California and Anthony Brown of Maryland.The defense measure establishes a Pacific deterrence initiative intended to counter China’s influence in the region. Congress plans to authorize $2.2 billion for the new effort designed to bolster the U.S. defense posture and weapons and alliances in the region.Lawmakers took aim at Russia with provisions including additional sanctions on Turkey for purchasing a Russian made missile defense system, as well as penalties on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-handed-defeat-as-congress-overrides-his-defense-bill-veto/story-ilsaclPnoh9XLfI004GwFL.html

His exit had not been previously reported.Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.Leathern said in the post that he was “leaving Facebook to work on consumer privacy beyond just ads and social media,” without disclosing where he was headed. Leathern was often the public face of the company’s controversial political advertising policies. Prior to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, Facebook was heavily criticized for allowing misleading claims and conspiracy theories to spread widely on its platforms.In November, Leathern had tweeted that Facebook did not have “the technical ability in the short term to enable political ads by state or by advertiser.” Subsequently, Facebook lifted a temporary post-election ban on political ads in Georgia ahead of the Jan. 5 runoff that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-s-advertising-integrity-chief-leaves-company/story-wGDV14I2KmmGgbwXrZRkKM.html
02-01-2021||World||Iran tells IAEA it plans to enrich uranium to up to 20% at Fordow site||Iran has told the United Nations nuclear watchdog it plans to enrich uranium to up to 20% purity, a level it achieved before its 2015 accord, at its Fordow site buried inside a mountain, the agency said on Friday.The move is the latest of several recent announcements by Iran to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it plans to further breach the deal, which it started violating in 2019 in retaliation for Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran.This step was one of many mentioned in a law passed by Iran’s parliament last month in response to the killing of the country’s top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel. Such moves by Iran could complicate efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal.“Iran has informed the Agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU) up to 20 percent at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the IAEA said in a statement.An IAEA report to member states earlier on Friday obtained by Reuters used similar wording in describing a letter by Iran to the IAEA dated Dec. 31.“Iran’s letter to the Agency ... did not say when this enrichment activity would take place,” the IAEA statement said.Fordow was built inside a mountain, apparently to protect it from aerial bombardment, and the 2015 deal does not allow enrichment there. Iran is already enriching at Fordow with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges.Iran has breached the deal’s 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can enrich uranium, but it has only gone up to 4.5% so far, well short of the 20% it achieved before the deal and the 90% that is weapons-grade. The deal’s main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-tells-iaea-it-plans-to-enrich-uranium-to-up-to-20-at-fordow-site/story-enQT4PYzcz9nADExY6pptM.html
02-01-2021||World||Georgia US senate runoff: Loeffler, Perdue run hard-line pitch||The merchandise featured in Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s online campaign store includes T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing Donald Trump’s name and the message: “Still my president.”The Georgia Republican is running television ads ahead of Tuesday’s Senate runoff elections that lambastes her opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, as “dangerous” and “radical.”Loeffler’s colleague, Sen. David Perdue, meanwhile, is warning Georgians that Democrats will enact a “socialist agenda” if his challenger, Jon Ossoff, wins on Tuesday.In the final days of campaigns that will decide control of the US Senate, the Republican incumbents are appealing to the most conservative part of the electorate. Their steady embrace of the hard-right, Trump wing of the GOP — even repeatedly refusing to acknowledge Trump’s defeat — and their caricatures of the Democratic challengers may seem like a risky approach in a state that narrowly voted for Democrat Joe Biden for president in November after years of steady Democratic gains.Yet the strategy reflects prevailing GOP wisdom in the Trump era: Republicans’ clearest path to victory, even in swing states, is to drive up support among a GOP base motivated by allegiance to the president and fear of Democrats. Still, the approach comes at the expense of a once-broader Republican coalition that included more urban and suburban moderates and GOP-leaning independents who have rejected the Republican brand under Trump.“The president resonates with a lot of people, and so do the buzzwords, so you hear ‘Trump’ and ‘socialism’ a lot,” said Michael McNeely, a former vice chair of the Georgia Republican Party. “I wish we lived in a society where people talked about ideas, but that’s just not where we are.”Trump may have complicated Perdue’s and Loeffler’s gamble even more with how he’s handled his defeat to Biden.The president has spread unfounded assertions of voter fraud and blasted Georgia Republican officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp, who have defended the elections process. When Trump allies, including Perdue and Loeffler, backed up the claims, some Republicans expressed concern it could discourage some Trump loyalists from voting in the runoff. Now, other Republicans are worried that GOP candidates have instead turned off the more moderate voters repelled by Trump.“No Republican is really happy with the situation we find ourselves in,” said Chip Lake, a longtime GOP consultant and top adviser to Loeffler’s vanquished rival, Rep. Doug Collins. “But sometimes when you play poker, you have to play the hand you’re dealt, and for us that starts with the president.”Trump will visit Georgia for a final rally with Loeffler on Monday evening, hours before polls open. It is unclear whether Perdue will attend. The senator said Thursday he was quarantining after being exposed to an aide who tested positive for coronavirus.Democrats are fine with the GOP senators’ decision to run as Trump Republicans and use exaggerated attacks. Opposition to the president has been a unifying force among their core supporters, and Democrats believe Republicans’ overall tenor falls flat with voters in the middle.“We talk about something like expanding Medicaid. We talk about expanding Pell Grants” for low-income college students, Ossoff said at a recent stop in Marietta, north of Atlanta. “David Perdue denounces those things as socialism?”Ossoff noted Perdue’s claims that a Democratic-run Senate would abolish private insurance; Ossoff and Warnock, in fact, back Biden’s proposal to add a federal insurance plan to private insurance exchanges, not abolish private insurance. “I just want people to have the choice,” Ossoff said.November returns demonstrate the GOP snare. Biden beat Trump by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in Georgia, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992. Biden’s record vote total for a Democrat in the state was fueled by racially and ethnically diversifying metro areas but also shifts in key Atlanta suburbs where white voters have historically leaned Republican.Yet Perdue landed within a few thousand votes of Trump’s total and led Ossoff by about 88,000 votes. Republican turnout also surged in small towns and rural areas, while Georgia Democrats had a disappointing general election down-ballot, failing to make expected gains in legislative races.“We’ve won this race once already,” Perdue says at some of his runoff campaign stops, echoing his advisers’ belief that their top priority is maintaining enthusiasm from Trump’s base. They add that they can corral the narrow slice of swing voters with arguments that warn against handing Democrats control of the House, Senate and White House.Lake and McNeely, however, predicted that hard-right attacks and Trump-centric appeals won’t deliver votes beyond the base, particularly amid a crush of advertising in a runoff campaign whose total expense could top $500 million.“We reached the point of diminishing returns a long time ago,” Lake said.They also bemoaned Trump’s continued grievances about his defeat even after his own attorney general said there was no evidence the election was marred by fraud and courts across the country rejected challenges to the outcome.“If, for some reason, the Republican candidates lose,” Lake said, “it’s going to be hard to write a post-mortem on this runoff and not look directly at all the chaos that has been created on voter fraud.”Early voting ended Thursday with just more than 3 million Georgians casting absentee or in-person ballots. That trails the final early vote count of 3.65 million ahead of the general election. But the early vote already has set a statewide Georgia runoff turnout record.Jen Jordan, a Democratic state senator who in 2017 won a suburban Atlanta district long held by Republicans, acknowledges her party, too, has moved to base strategy. But Jordan argued that Democrats still root their pitch more in policy ideas, especially on health care access and public education, that she said has wide appeal. She said Perdue and Loeffler undermined their “socialism” warnings by splitting from most congressional Republicans to support the president’s call for $2,000 pandemic aid payments to individual Americans.“I’ve never heard the word socialism so much in my life, and then they’re both like, yeah, let’s give everybody $2,000 checks,” Jordan said.McNeely, the former state GOP leader, lamented that even if Perdue and Loeffler win, their campaigns move Georgia further away from a more centrist tradition. He cited Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, whose retirement opened the way for Kemp to appoint Loeffler.Unlike many Southern Republicans of his generation, Isakson was never a Democrat. But he rose through the Georgia General Assembly in an era when Democrats dominated the state. In Washington, Isakson was a reliable Republican vote but shunned partisan jousting and intently avoided talking about Trump whenever possible.“Sen. Isakson learned to see things from a different perspective,” McNeely said, adding that Republican politicians should “think beyond campaigns and what the president is thinking” and that more voters should decide that “it doesn’t make you a bad guy or gal because you compromise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-us-senate-runoff-loeffler-perdue-run-hard-line-pitch/story-ezalY7kz2tXa138cr4rDBN.html
02-01-2021||World||A record 3 million early votes cast in Georgia’s US senate runoff races||A record 3 million early votes have been cast in the two Georgia runoff elections that next week will decide which party controls the US Senate, according to a final tally released on Friday.The turnout figures, compiled by the University of Florida’s U.S. Elections Project, indicate strong voter interest in Tuesday’s elections that pit incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.If Republicans win one or both of those seats, they will retain a slim majority in the US Senate, enabling them to block much of incoming Democratic President Joe Biden’s agenda.If Democrats win both seats, the chamber will be split 50-50, giving the tiebreaking vote to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Biden and Harris are due to take office on Jan. 20.The 3,001,017 early votes amount to 38.8% of all registered voters in the state, according to the US Elections Project. That puts turnout at a record high for a Georgia runoff, exceeding the 2.1 million ballots cast in a 2008 Senate contest.The runoff elections are necessary because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election.Early voting ended on Thursday. Georgia releases information about the number of people who voted but does not tally their votes until Election Day.Perdue is quarantining in the race’s final days after coming in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-record-3-million-early-votes-cast-in-georgia-s-us-senate-runoff-races/story-ShS8OIqJiTBAWT1OrKJOFO.html

Thus using the US soil to generate investments in China - an abusive business practice. These companies are involved in civilian and military production with money from US investors.Earlier, US President Donald Trump on November 12 had signed an executive order that prohibits Americans from investing in 31 firms.The order prohibited US investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.“The Chinese Communist Party’s threat to American national security extends into our financial markets and impacts American investors,” the State Department said in a factual report.“Many major stock and bond indices developed by index providers like MSCI and FTSE include malign People’s Republic of China (PRC) companies, listed on the Department of Commerce Entity List and/or the Department of Defense List of Communist Chinese military companies,” it added.The executive order has resulted in a series of companies being removed from indexes compiled by MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Global Indices and FTSE Russell, reported SCMP.Following the steps of the US and Japan, the Taiwanese Economic Affairs Ministry on Wednesday too tightened control over Chinese investments due to national security concerns.Based on new regulations that came into effect from Wednesday, Chinese military-owned companies and Chinese Communist Party-owned companies were banned from investing in Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-to-delist-3-chinese-telecom-companies-to-comply-with-us-executive-order/story-8eDf3zIiMLfxTsW3RU1NgI.html
02-01-2021||World||Pak court halts controversial plan to fortify Gwadar with fencing||A controversial project to fortify Pakistan’s port city of Gwadar with secure fencing – possibly to allay fears of attacks on Chinese nationals based there – has been put on hold after the Balochistan high court sought details on the government’s motive behind the planned move.A two-judge bench heard a petition filed by Balochistan bar council vice-chairman Muneer Ahmed Kakar, who pleaded that the lives of more than 300,000 people residing in Gwadar would be affected by the move, with the possibility of half the city’s population ending up outside the planned fence.In the past, Gwadar has seen attacks on Chinese nationals as well as security forces. Some of the attacks have come from Baloch nationalist insurgents, who during the last three years have carried out at least five major terror strikes in the area.The security plan for Gwadar involved encircling the city with a fence and putting in place two entry and exit points, officials have said. It is believed a modified plan will be set in motion later this year. Read more| Hindu temple in Pakistan vandalised, set on fireThe project has been questioned on various platforms in Pakistan. At a press meet earlier, senator Mir Kabir Mohammad Shahi said it “was a conspiracy to separate Gwadar from Balochistan”.Following an outcry, provincial home minister Ziaullah Langove clarified this week that the provincial government stopped the fencing work “as it will not take any decision against the wishes of the people of the area”. He insisted that there was nothing more to the plan than the intention to protect the port city.Security analyst Amir Rana feels that if fenced as planned, Gwadar would become the first Pakistani city to be “sealed” on the basis of security concerns. In a column, Rana argued that fencing is considered one of the last resorts in dealing with trans-border security threats. Rana recalls that the 2019 attack on Pearl Continental Hotel was among the deadliest attacks in the area. The Balochistan Liberation Army, which claimed the attack, had badly damaged the building using explosives and rocket fire.Similarly, in October this year, militants targeted security forces that were escorting a convoy of Oil & Gas Development Company from Gwadar to Karachi, on the Makran coastal highway. An alliance of Baloch insurgent groups called BRAS claimed the attack in which at least 14 people including seven Frontier Corps men lost their lives.These attacks have raised questions not only about the security of strategic installations, but also about the lives of foreign nationals working there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-puts-on-hold-controversial-plan-to-fortify-gwadar-with-fencing/story-UAy7uaOrnDa4iirQkMzOvK.html
