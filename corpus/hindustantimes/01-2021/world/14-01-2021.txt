The CECC also accused China of harassing Uighurs in the United States.China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in Xinjiang that it describes as "vocational training centers" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills and which others have called concentration camps.The United Nations says at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang. Faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place there. Beijing denies abuse accusations.The CECC report called for a formal US "determination on whether atrocities are being committed" in Xinjiang, and such a determination is required within 90 days of US legislation passed on Dec. 27.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office before President-elect Joe Biden succeeds President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, has already been weighing a determination, although given current turmoil in Washington, officials have played down the possibility of an announcement before that.CECC co-chair, Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, called China's actions to crush human rights in the past year "shocking and unprecedented" and urged Congress and the incoming Biden administration to hold Beijing accountable."The United States must continue to stand with the people of China in their struggle and lead the world in a united and coordinated response to the human rights abuses of the Chinese government," he said.Relations between the world's two biggest economic powerhouses have plunged to the lowest level in recent years over disagreements on issues including human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, espionage and a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong.Experts say a genocide determination would be an enormous embarrassment for China, the world's second-largest economy and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.It could also pose problems for Biden by complicating his dealings with Beijing, although his campaign had already declared, before the November election, that genocide was occurring in Xinjiang.In October, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said Beijing was perpetrating "something close to" genocide in Xinjiang and other officials have referred to concentration camps there.Under international law, crimes against humanity are defined as widespread and systematic, whereas the burden of proof for genocide - the intent to destroy part of a population - can be more difficult to prove.Expectations that Pompeo might declare genocide were raised in June when he labeled as "shocking" and "disturbing" reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims.He was referring to a report last year about the situation in Xinjiang by German researcher Adrian Zenz, which the CECC report also cited.Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's Xinjiang policies met one of the criteria cited in the U.N. genocide convention, namely "imposing measures intended to prevent births within the (targeted) group."A US genocide declaration would mean that countries would have to think hard about allowing companies to do business with Xinjiang, a leading global supplier of cotton. It would also raise pressure for further US sanctions against China.On Wednesday, US Customs and Border Protection said the United States was imposing a region-wide ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they are made with forced labor by detained Uighurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commission-says-china-possibly-committed-genocide-against-xinjiang-muslims-101610645950914.html
14-01-2021||World||NATO chief calls for justice over US Capitol mob siege||The head of NATO said Thursday that all those responsible for last week’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol should be held accountable, and he expressed confidence that American institutions are up to the job.“Democracy must always prevail over violence, and I’m confident that the democratic institutions of the United States will handle this challenge,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.The storming of the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election victory resulted in the deaths of 5 people. In impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday for inciting the mob that broke into the building, several U.S. lawmakers insisted that Trump posed a “clear and present danger.”Stoltenberg, a former prime minister of Norway, said that what happened in Washington last week is “absolutely unacceptable.” He said it “was shocking, and the outcome of the election has to be respected and we have to make sure that our democratic values are fully respected.”The United States is by far the biggest and most influential member of NATO, but Trump has surprised and routinely confounded many allies by berating them over defense spending or taking unilateral actions such as pulling U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and northern Syria.Stoltenberg did not mention Trump by name, focusing instead on the incoming administration.“I look forward to a peaceful transition, and I look forward to working with Joe Biden,” Stoltenberg said, adding that the president-elect “is strongly committed to our trans-Atlantic cooperation, to NATO, and I know that he also of course strongly supports the idea of further strengthening the cooperation between North America and Europe.”Hundreds of National Guard members are camped out at the Capitol to protect lawmakers, some still reeling from the violence and preparing for Biden's inauguration next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-calls-for-justice-over-us-capitol-mob-siege-101610645347656.html

Harrison previously ran for national party chairman in 2017, but ultimately dropped out and endorsed current head Tom Perez.With a narrow margin in the House and a tied Senate, Democrats are planning for a tough fight in the 2022 midterm elections.

14-01-2021||World||Google closes deal to buy Fitbit as Justice Dept probe continues||Search and advertising giant Google has closed its deal to buy Fitbit, the companies said on Thursday, even as the Justice Department said it was continuing its probe of the $2.1 billion transaction.The Justice Department, which sued Alphabet Inc's Google in October for allegedly violating antitrust law in its search and search advertising businesses, said it "has not reached a final decision about whether to pursue an enforcement action" regarding the Fitbit deal.Google had said it was buying Fitbit, which makes a watch-like device to measure physical activity, as a way to enter the devices market and was hoping to address privacy concerns."We worked with global regulators on an approach which safeguards consumers' privacy expectations," Google said in a blog post, which said Fitbit had 29 million active users."(That includes) a series of binding commitments that confirm Fitbit users' health and wellness data won't be used for Google ads and this data will be separated from other Google ads data."While Alphabet is best known for a free service, its market-leading Google search engine, it has many other businesses, including online advertising services, audio device and thermostat maker Nest, video company YouTube and self-driving car company Waymo.Google won EU antitrust approval last month for its Fitbit bid after agreeing to restrictions on how it will use customers' health-related data.Google's plan to buy Fitbit immediately raised concerns when it was announced in late 2019 because of its already rich trove of data about people, what they buy, where they travel, and more.Fitbit's fitness trackers and other devices monitor users' daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled. They also measure floors climbed, heart rate, and how long and how well people sleep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-closes-deal-to-buy-fitbit-as-justice-dept-probe-continues-101610642733688.html
14-01-2021||World||Ex-presidential candidate Andrew Yang joins NYC mayoral race||Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang officially entered the race for mayor of New York City on Thursday, joining a crowded Democratic primary field that includes longtime elected officials and veterans of the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is barred by the city charter from seeking a third term.“It is here in New York City that my passion for uplifting people, for wanting to move our country forward, got started,” Yang said at a campaign launch that was streamed on YouTube because of the coronavirus pandemic. “And now that we are facing this historic crisis I am aiming to unleash and channel that energy for a human-centered economy right here in New York, my home!"Yang’s proposal for a universal basic income won him a national following during the 2020 Democratic primary campaign before he dropped out of the race in February. He brings high name recognition to the mayoral race but has no record of involvement in local politics.More than two dozen people have filed with the city's Campaign Finance Board to run in the June 22 Democratic mayoral primary, which for the first time in city history will be determined by ranked choice voting, a system that lets voters rank candidates in order of preference.The contenders include City Comptroller Scott Stringer, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, banker Ray McGuire, former city sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia and former U.S. housing secretary Shaun Donovan.Yang has lived in New York City since attending law school at Columbia University in the 1990s but has spent much of the coronavirus pandemic at his family’s weekend home about 85 miles (136 kilometers) north of the city in New Paltz, New York.Critics pounced when Yang explained his absence from the city by asking a New York Times reporter, “Can you imagine trying to have two kids on virtual school in a two-bedroom apartment, and then trying to do work yourself?” Fellow mayoral candidate Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, tweeted: “I spent all of 2020 in NYC, living with THREE generations under one roof, AND running a campaign from home.”Wherever the candidates are physically located, the mayoral campaign has so far been conducted largely via Zoom and other online platforms because of the pandemic.The winner of the Democratic primary will be the strong favorite in the November general election because Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city by a wide margin. Republicans who have said they are considering running include Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expresidential-candidate-andrew-yang-joins-nyc-mayoral-race-101610644332806.html
14-01-2021||World||American capital turns into a fortress ahead of Biden’s inauguration||Four times more US troops than the combined deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq would be stationed in Washington, DC around the time of the inauguration of Joe Biden as US president on January 20. The build-up to the big day has already started. National Guard troops have secured the US capital, where Biden will be sworn in the 46th American president. The US Capitol building was teeming with National Guard troops on Wednesday as the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump for a second time.“I think you can expect to see somewhere, upwards beyond 20,000 members of the National Guard that will be here in the footprint of the District of Columbia,” DC Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said.The defence department has said there will actually be 21,000 of them, which is more than four times the number of troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Military Times has reported that 2,500 troops are scheduled to be left in Afghanistan and Iraq each by January 15 because of a drawdown, as announced by acting defence secretary Chris Miller last November.Washington DC is on heightened security alert with warnings from the FBI and other security agencies of armed protests being planned at the Capitol and capitols in all 50 states in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration.Senior officials of the FBI and the US Secret Service briefed Biden and key members of his national security team on the security arrangement on Wednesday, said the transition team. They will be getting daily briefings on the “security and operational preparations”.A mob incited by President Trump had stormed the US Capitol on January 6 to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory. They had overrun the building complex, temporarily breaking up the session, forced Vice-President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification process, and lawmakers to be removed to secure locations. Five people, including a Capitol police officer, were killed in the riots that lasted hours. President Trump, who was impeached on Wednesday for inciting that attack, issued an appeal for peace and calm in a video message and a statement. “In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind. That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers,” he said in the written statement. In the video message, the outgoing president went further, and delivered a more forceful denunciation of the January 6 attack — calling it a “calamity at the Capitol”.Trump also went on to complain about the “unprecedented assault on free speech”, framing in general terms his accounts being shut down by social media platforms. “These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another. Not to silence one another.”Twitter, Facebook, Google, Instagram and a whole range of social media companies have shut down Trump’s accounts and those of some of his enablers and right-wing figures and entities in the days since the January 6 attack.Jack Dorsey, the Twitter founder and CEO, explained himself in a string of tweets on Wednesday. “I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning we’d take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct?”He added that he believes it was the right decision for Twitter because it “faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-capital-turns-into-a-fortress-ahead-of-biden-s-inauguration-101610644532606.html
14-01-2021||World||Brazil sends aircraft to collect vaccines, 'too early' for exports, says India||Brazil appears to have jumped the gun by officially announcing the despatch of an aircraft to transport two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine from India, with New Delhi making it clear on Thursday that decisions on supplies to foreign countries will take more time.A statement issued by Brazil’s foreign ministry on Wednesday said an Airbus A330neo aircraft of Azul Airlines equipped with special containers was set to fly back from Mumbai with two million doses of vaccine from Serum Institute of India and reach the country on January 16.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that any supplies contracted for by foreign countries, including Brazil, would be provided by India in due course though a timeframe for this is yet to be finalised.“India stands by its commitment to help the world and all countries will get the vaccines,” one of the people cited above said.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s office announced on January 8 that he had written a letter to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi to expedite a shipment of two million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Bolsonaro is facing pressure to rollout the vaccine from political rivals, including some who have shown a preference for the Chinese vaccine.Also Watch | Stage set for Covid vaccination drive in India: All you need to know“To [ensure] the immediate implementation of the Brazilian National Programme of Immunisation, I would highly appreciate your good offices in expediting the shipment of two million doses of the vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India to Brazil urgently, but as long as it does not impact the Indian vaccination programme,” Bolsonaro wrote in the letter in Portuguese.The Brazilian foreign ministry’s statement, also in Portuguese, said the health ministry had “purchased” the doses from the Serum Institute of India and that the Brazilian embassy had “made arrangements with the Indian authorities and the Serum Institute of India, following the letter from President Jair Bolsonaro to Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.The statement also spoke of plans to distribute the vaccines to Brazil’s states within five days after endorsement by the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) to start immunisation across the country, simultaneously and free of charge. It also described the “successful acquisition of doses” from India as a demonstration of the “excellent” Brazil-India relations.Asked about the matter during a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said it was too early to discuss vaccine exports as India’s immunisation programme is set to be rolled out on Saturday.“You would recall that the prime minister had already stated that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used for the benefit of all humanity in fighting this crisis,” Srivastava said.“As you would know, the vaccination process is just starting in India. It is too early to give a specific response on the supplies to other countries as we are still assessing production schedules and delivery. We will take decisions in this regard in due course, this may take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sends-aircraft-to-collect-vaccines-too-early-for-exports-says-india-101610643849088.html
14-01-2021||World||Drug dealer faces execution for 7 gang killings in Virginia||It was one of the worst bursts of gang violence Richmond had ever seen. At least 11 people were killed in a 45-day period in 1992, all at the hands of gang members who eliminated anyone they thought would get in the way of their growing crack cocaine business.Corey Johnson, who was sentenced to death in connection with seven of the slayings, was right in the thick of it as one of the leaders of the Newtowne gang. He and two other members were sentenced to death under a federal law that targets large-scale drug traffickers.Johnson, now 52, is scheduled to die at 6 p.m. ET Thursday at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., had halted the execution and Friday's scheduled execution of Dustin Higgs because both men tested positive last month for Covid-19, but a federal appeals court late Wednesday lifted the injunction. Additional appeals in the case are likely, though government lawyers have been successful in getting a green light from the U.S. Supreme Court to proceed even after lower courts put federal executions on hold.If the executions are delayed past this week they might not happen at all because President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next Wednesday, opposes the federal death penalty and has said he'll work to end its use.Lawyers for both inmates argue that lung damage from the coronavirus makes it more likely they'll suffer excruciating pain from a lethal injection of pentobarbital. Johnson's lawyers also argue he is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible to be put to death, under both federal law and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.In their clemency petition, Johnson's lawyers asked Trump to commute his death sentence to life in prison. They described a traumatic childhood when he was physically abused by his drug-addicted mother and her boyfriends, abandoned at age 13, then shuffled between residential and institutional facilities until he aged out of the foster care system. They cite numerous childhood IQ tests discovered after he was sentenced that place him in the mentally disabled category and say testing during his time in prison shows he can read and write at only an elementary school level.“Allowing Corey to be executed would be a grave miscarriage of justice,” said Don Salzman, one of Johnson's attorneys.Government filings have spelled Johnson's name ‘Cory,' but his lawyers say he spells it ‘Corey.'Richard Benedict, who was Johnson's special education teacher at a New York school for emotionally troubled kids, said Johnson was hyperactive, anxious and reading and writing at a second- or third-grade level when he was 16 and 17.“I had to have someone walk him to the bathroom because he just couldn't get back to the classroom," Benedict said.Prosecutors, however, say Johnson has not shown that he is mentally disabled.“While rejecting that he has intellectual disabilities that preclude his death sentences, courts have repeatedly and correctly concluded that Johnson’s seven murders were planned to advance his drug trafficking and were not impulsive acts by someone incapable of capable making calculated judgments, and are therefore eligible for the death penalty," prosecutors argue in court documents.A defense psychologist testified during the trial that Johnson’s IQ was measured at 77, above the threshold score of 75 then needed to label someone as intellectually disabled. Johnson's appellate lawyers say that psychologist was not an expert in intellectual disability and relied on standards that are now outdated.C.T. Woody Jr., the lead homicide detective on the case, said that during his interrogations of Johnson, he denied any involvement in the killings and said police were trying to frame him because of lies people were telling about him.“It did not seem to me that he had any kind of mental problems at all except his viciousness and no respect for human life — none whatsoever,” Woody said.Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Vick Jr., one of the prosecutors in the case, said the violence committed by Johnson and his fellow gang members was unmatched at the time. One of the gang's victims was stabbed 85 times and another was shot 16 times. Johnson was convicted of being the shooter in a triple slaying, and participating in four other capital murders, including shooting a rival drug dealer 15 times.“The heinousness of the crimes, the utter senselessness of the crimes, the crimes themselves warranted the seeking of the death penalty this case,” Vick said.In his clemency petition, Johnson's lawyers said he has repeatedly expressed “sincere remorse” for his crimes.“I’m sorry for the great number of people who are dead, you know, and there is a lot on us, and I feel we are no angels,” he said during his sentencing hearing. He also spoke to a group of students present in the courtroom that day and urged them not to commit crimes or make the mistakes he had made in his life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-dealer-faces-execution-for-7-gang-killings-in-virginia-101610643938099.html
14-01-2021||World||IAEA highlights another Iranian breach of nuclear deal||The United Nations' atomic watchdog agency confirmed Thursday that Iran has informed it the country has begun installing equipment for the production of uranium metal, which would be another violation of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers.Iran maintains its plans to conduct research and development on uranium metal production are part of its “declared aim to design an improved type of fuel,” the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said.Uranium metal can also be used for a nuclear bomb, however, and research on its production is specifically prohibited under the nuclear deal — the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — that Tehran signed with Germany, France, Britain, China, Russia and the United States in 2015.Since the unilateral American withdrawal from the deal in 2018, the other members have been working to try and preserve the accord, and Germany slammed the new Iranian move as a “completely wrong signal and not likely to build trust.”The Foreign Ministry told The Associated Press that as the other members are committed to the deal and the “future American government has also expressed its willingness to return" to it, Iran “must not continue to undermine the core provisions" of the accord.“It is long overdue for Iran to return to full compliance with its commitments,” the ministry said.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something Iran insists it does not want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.On Sunday, IAEA inspectors visited the Isfahan plant where Iran has said it plans to conduct the research, and officials were informed by Tehran on Wednesday that “modification and installation of the relevant equipment for the mentioned R&D activities have been already started," the agency said.Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, repeated that in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that “natural uranium will be used to produce uranium metal in the first stage.”He told Iran's official news agency IRNA that the move will elevate Iran to the level of “progressive nations in production of new fuels.”Although uranium metal in theory can be geared toward generating electricity, experiments with metal alloys are prohibited under the nuclear deal because uranium metal is a key material in the making of nuclear weapons. The process involves converting high-enriched uranium gas into metal that provides the cladding, or outer covering, for the fuel rods that power a nuclear reaction.“Iran had not previously experimented with this step in the process, but in order to make a bomb, you would have to,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, based in Washington.It was the latest in a string of violations of the nuclear deal that Iran has undertaken since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out in 2018, saying it needed to be re-negotiated.Tehran has been using the violations to put pressure on the other signatories to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions re-imposed after the American pullout. President-elect Joe Biden, who was vice president when the deal was signed during the Obama administration, has said he hopes to return the US to the deal.The timing of the uranium metal announcement, Kimball said, left little doubt about Iran’s intentions.“They know there’s someone named Biden who’s going to be in the White House next week and they want him to act as soon as possible to waive nuclear-related sanctions,” he added. “They are looking for ways to underscore that their patience has run out.”Britain, France and Germany said last week that Iran “risks compromising” chances of diplomacy with Washington after Tehran announced another violation — that it was starting to enrich uranium to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.The foreign ministers of the three European nations said in a joint statement then that the Iranian activity “has no credible civil justification.” They said the enrichment was a clear violation of the deal and “further hollows out the agreement.”Those working to save the deal also note that despite the violations, Iran continues to allow inspectors to access all sites in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iaea-highlights-another-iranian-breach-of-nuclear-deal-101610644048620.html
14-01-2021||World||Palm Oil producers say anti-palm oil campaigns hinder sustainability shift||Top palm oil producers said on Thursday that the industry is making strides towards transparency and sustainability across its supply chain despite campaigns against use of the oil.Campaigners say that the industry is responsible for deforestation of tropical rainforests and human rights abuses and have initiated consumer boycotts of palm oil, which is found in everything from pizza to lipsticks.However, such campaigns are hindering the industry's efforts to achieve sustainability certification and develop a market for certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO), top palm oil producers said during the Reuters Next conference.The panelists said sales of more expensive sustainable palm oil, certified by bodies including the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), are still lacking."The supply of CSPO outstrips demand by a factor of two ... Even if you are certified, it does not necessarily mean you're able to get that to the market," Mohd Haris Mohd Arshad, Managing Director at Sime Darby Oils said.Sime Darby Plantation is the world's largest palm oil company by land size and the largest producer of CSPO.Indonesia and Malaysia, which together account for 85% of global output, in particular have come under fire for clearing biodiversity-rich rainforests and allegations of forced labour.The United States last year banned imports of palm oil from Malaysian producers Sime and FGV Holdings over allegations of forced labour during production.Mohd Haris said on Tuesday in a radio interview that there was not a systemic problem and Sime has asked the NGO involved and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for more information on the allegations."The palm industry is a very large industry so ... yes, you can have a few bad apples but does it mean that it is a systemic issue and the systems are not in place?" Olivier Tichit, Director of Sustainable Supply Chain at Musim Mas, said."The issue is how do we regain the trust we seemed to have lost?" said Tichit, adding that the industry has a high level of transparency compared to other commodities.To boost their green credentials, both Malaysia and Indonesia have implemented national sustainability standards, but NGOs say these are not stringent enough."We can't afford for people to continue undermining efforts to get certification, because for everything that we do it seems like it is one-step forward and two-steps back. It will disincentivize others (to) get on board," Mohd Haris said.The palm oil industry has been linked to forest fires in Indonesia where in 2019 at least 1.6 million hectares of forest and other land were burned and losses were estimated at $5.2 billion as a choking haze blanketed the region.Greenpeace said in October that nearly a third of Indonesia forest fires are in pulp and palm areas.Ravi Muthayah, Secretary-General of Malaysia's Plantation & Commodities Ministry called for greater recognition of industry efforts instead of being singled out for driving deforestation."It's better than not having any sustainability standards and causing further damage, no matter what crop you're in."For more coverage from the Reuters Next conference please click here or http://www.reuters.com/business/reuters-nextTo watch Reuters Next live, visit https://www.reutersevents.com/events/next/register.php(Reporting by Mei Mei Chu; Editing by Alexander Smith)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palm-oil-producers-say-anti-palm-oil-campaigns-hinder-sustainability-shift-101610643466693.html
14-01-2021||World||Jacob Blake says he was ready to surrender before being shot||A Black man who was shot in the back by a white police officer in Wisconsin, triggering several nights of violent protests over the summer and leaving him partially paralyzed, said in an interview broadcast Thursday that he was prepared to surrender just before the officer opened fire.Jacob Blake, 29, said an interview with ABC's “Good Morning America” that during a struggle with Kenosha police who were trying to arrest him Aug. 23 on an outstanding warrant his pocketknife fell from his pants. He said he picked it up before heading to a vehicle to drive away with two of his children in the backseat.“I'm not really worried. I'm walking away from them, so it's not like they were going to shoot me,” Blake said.Blake said that he was prepared to surrender once he put the knife in the vehicle.“Throw myself to the ground and you know, put my arms behind my back because if they did it there and they killed me there, everybody would see it,” he said.Officer Rusten Sheskey told investigators that he feared that Blake was going to stab him, so he opened fire. Blake family attorney Ben Crump, however, has questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying “nowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent.”Kenosha erupted with violent protests for several nights after Blake was shot. Hundreds were arrested, and multiple businesses were destroyed. A Wisconsin prosecutor on Jan. 5 declined to file charges against Sheskey, concluding he couldn’t disprove the officer’s contention that he acted in self-defense.In the “Good Morning America” interview, Blake, who was shot seven times, said he shouldn't have grabbed his knife. He said he “wasn’t thinking clearly.” He said he couldn't hear officers' orders to comply before he was shot.“I was counting down my breaths, my blinks and I was like 'God I’m coming. I guess this is it for me,” he said.He said his thoughts turned to his sons in the backseat.“'Daddy loves you no matter what,'” Blake said he told them. "I thought it was going to be the last thing I say to them.”During one night of unrest following the shooting, prosecutors say a white 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, shot and killed two men and wounded a third, claiming the shootings were in self-defense. This week, prosecutors in Wisconsin asked a judge to order Kyle Rittenhouse, who now is 18 and free on $2 million bond, to stay out of bars and away from white supremacist groups.The request comes a week after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, after he pleaded not guilty to homicide and other charges resulting from the Aug. 25 shooting in Kenosha.The Associated Press left a message seeking comment Thursday with Rittenhouse’s defense lawyer Mark Richards.After his Jan. 5 arraignment, Rittenhouse, his mother and several other adults went to Pudgy's Pub, where he was seen drinking beer, according to prosecutors. Although the drinking age is 21, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol in Wisconsin because he was with his mother.The prosecutors' motion states that Rittenhouse posed outside the bar for a photo with two men as they all gestured an “OK” sign with their hands, which has become a symbol used by white supremacists.The motion also said five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with the song “Proud of Your Boy," which has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a white supremacist group whose members have been identified as being involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.“The defendant’s continued association with members of a group that prides itself on violence, and the use of their symbols, raises the significant possibility of future harm. Further, this association may serve to intimidate potential witnesses,” the motion reads.A hearing on the prosecutors’ request has not yet been scheduled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacob-blake-says-he-was-ready-to-surrender-before-being-shot-101610642381011.html
14-01-2021||World||Ex-Michigan health chief charged with manslaughter in Flint||Michigan’s former health director was charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of nine people who got Legionnaires’ disease during the Flint water crisis as prosecutors revisit how the city’s water system was contaminated with lead and bacteria during one of worst human-made environmental disasters in U.S. history.Nick Lyon pleaded not guilty during an appearance in a Genesee County court. Moments later, his old boss, former Gov. Rick Snyder, also pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of willful neglect of duty in Flint.They were among several people summoned to court to face charges, the result of a renewed 19-month investigation launched by the attorney general's office after Dana Nessel, a Democrat, was elected.The charges against Snyder carry up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine upon conviction. No governor or former governor in Michigan’s 184-year history had been charged with crimes related to their time in that office, according to the state archivist.Wearing a mask, Snyder, 62, said little during the brief hearing, which was conducted by video. He replied, “Yes, your honor,” when asked if he was living in Michigan.“We believe there is no evidence to support any criminal charges against Gov. Snyder,” defense attorney Brian Lennon told reporters Wednesday night.Snyder, a Republican, was governor from 2011 through 2018. The former computer executive pitched himself as a problem-solving “nerd” who eschewed partisan politics and favored online dashboards to show performance in government. Flint turned out to be the worst chapter of his two terms due to a series of catastrophic decisions that will affect residents for years.The date of Snyder's alleged crimes in Flint is listed as April 25, 2014, when a Snyder-appointed emergency manager, Darnell Earley, who was running the struggling, majority Black city carried out a money-saving decision to use the Flint River for water while a pipeline from Lake Huron was under construction.The corrosive water, however, was not treated properly and released lead from old plumbing into homes.Despite desperate pleas from residents holding jugs of discolored, skunky water, the Snyder administration took no significant action until a doctor reported elevated lead levels in children about 18 months later.“I’m sorry and I will fix it,” Snyder promised during his 2016 State of the State speech.Prosecutors also charged Earley with two felony counts of misconduct in office Thursday. He pleaded not guilty.Authorities counted at least 90 cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Genesee County during the water switch, including 12 deaths. Some experts found there was not enough chlorine in Flint's water-treatment system to control legionella bacteria, which can trigger a severe form of pneumonia when spread through misting and cooling systems.It's the second time that Lyon has been charged with manslaughter, but the earlier case involved only two deaths. He was accused in 2017 of failing to timely warn the public about the outbreak, but that case was dropped by prosecutors when they decided to take a fresh look at evidence.An involuntary manslaughter conviction carries up to 15 years in prison and a $7,500 fine.Lead can damage the brain and nervous system and cause learning and behavior problems. Flint's woes were highlighted as an example of environmental injustice and racism.The criminal investigation has lasted five years under two teams of prosecutors. Todd Flood, who got misdemeanor convictions from seven people, was ousted in 2019 after the election of Nessel. Fadwa Hammoud subsequently dropped charges in eight pending cases and said the investigation would start over. She said the first team had failed to collect all available evidence.Separately, the state, Flint, a hospital and an engineering firm have agreed to a $641 million settlement with residents over the water crisis, with $600 million coming from Michigan. A judge said she hopes to decide by Jan. 21 whether to grant preliminary approval. Other lawsuits, including one against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exmichigan-health-chief-charged-with-manslaughter-in-flint-101610641578859.html
14-01-2021||World||US jobless claims jump by most since March, approach 1 million||Applications for US state unemployment benefits surged last week by the most since late March, pointing to persistent labor-market pain as coronavirus infections continue to soar and potentially adding to momentum for a larger federal stimulus plan.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs rose by 181,000 to 965,000 in the week ended Jan. 9, according to Labor Department data Thursday that showed a broad number of states with large increases. On an unadjusted basis, the figure jumped to 1.15 million.The scope of the increase caught many economists by surprise; most of the several dozen surveyed by Bloomberg projected the claims number would be little changed and not a single one of them had predicted so big a jump.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 789,000 initial claims. The S&P 500 advanced in early trading along with the yield on the 10-year Treasury on prospects for more Covid-19 relief.Continuing claims in state programs -- an approximation of the number of people receiving ongoing benefits -- climbed by 199,000 to 5.27 million in the week ended Jan. 2.“The restrictions imposed to combat the third Covid wave clearly have done great damage, but it’s not obvious that the incremental hit is still increasing,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note. “Claims will drift sideways, more or less, over the next two to three months, before restrictions on the services sector can be gradually eased as vaccination brings herd immunity into sight.”Stimulus outlookJobless claims have exceeded 750,000 each week since virus cases started surging again late last year, underscoring the impact of infection fears and business restrictions on employment. Vaccine distribution should help restore economic activity in the coming months, but the first quarter could continue to bring labor market weakness until inoculations reach a critical mass.The recently approved $900 billion pandemic aid package should provide some relief for workers and businesses in the current quarter.Enhanced unemployment benefits passed in the December bill, combined with a $300 weekly top-up for regular state benefits, may have contributed to the latest increase in claims, said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.“From a signaling perspective, once you see that maybe you think ‘it’s worth me filing because I can get an additional $X per week.’ There’s a positive effect there in terms of signaling, but I would not say it’s a revelation of additional laziness,” Daco said.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to release details Thursday of a proposed additional relief package that could further extend unemployment benefits and aid cities and states. Biden last week put the “entire package” at “trillions of dollars,” and many Democrats believe it will be as much as $2 trillion, while others expect the coronavirus-only portion will fall closer to the value of the last package.The initial filings far exceeded the worst days of the 2007-09 recession and may skew negotiators toward a bigger relief package.Other Details||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-jump-by-most-since-march-approach-1-million-101610641864255.html

In December, India had accused Pakistan’s security establishment of pressuring a Pakistani lawyer engaged by the Indian high commission to misrepresent New Delhi’s position on Kulbhushan Jadhav during a court hearing.Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of espionage, and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court the following year. India has asserted he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.India has maintained that Pakistan failed to respond to core issues related to the case, including unconditional consular access to Jadhav and the provision of legal documents which will be the basis of an effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the ICJ.The Pakistan foreign Office had claimed that ”by casting aspersions” on the Indian High Commission’s own legal counsel, the Indian government was “looking for an escape from the legal proceedings in the case.”A larger bench headed by IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah and comprising Justice Amir Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb heard the Pakistani law ministry’s plea regarding provision of counsel to Jadhav for the implementation of the ICJ decision.“Is the Indian government not serious in the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav?” Justice Minallah inquired on Thursday. “The government should once again contact India and ask whether it wants to pursue the Kulbhushan case or not,” he added.Further hearing of the case was adjourned till February 3.Pakistan had earlier rejected as “incorrect” and “misleading” assertions by India regarding legal proceedings in the case of Jadhav.“The government of India is reminded that in pursuance of the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan had invited the Indian High Commission to meet with commander Jadhav and appoint a lawyer on his behalf so that proceedings to review and reconsider commander Jadhav’s conviction could commence,” the Pakistani foreign ministry had said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-slow-pedalling-on-kulbhushan-jadhav-pak-court-tells-govt-to-ask-india-if-it-s-serious-on-the-case-101610642192396.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid-19: German lockdown loopholes criticized as deaths hit new high||Germany has too many loopholes in its coronavirus lockdown rules, the head of the country's disease control agency said as figures published Thursday showed the highest number of daily deaths since the start of the pandemic.The Robert Koch Institute said 1,244 deaths from Covid-19 were confirmed in one day up to Thursday, taking the total number to 43,881. There were also 25,164 newly confirmed cases, putting Germany’s total known infections close to 2 million.Lothar Wieler, president of the institute, said data indicated people in Germany are traveling more than during the first phase of the pandemic in spring, contributing to the virus' spread.German authorities have imposed restrictions on social contacts, largely closed schools and limited travel for those in areas with high infection rates, but the rules aren't uniformly enforced across the country's 16 states.“To me, these measures we're now taking aren't a complete lockdown,” said Wieler. “There are still too many exceptions and they aren't being strictly implemented.”Officials are considering tougher restrictions to curb the continued rise in infections.The 7-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 23.36 per 100,000 people on Dec. 30 to 26.03 per 100,000 people on Jan. 13.Wieler pointed to the sharp spike in infections recently seen in Ireland as an example of how quickly the outbreak can escalate again if rules are relaxed, especially given the new seemingly more contagious variant of the virus circulating there and in neighboring Britain.All infections with the variants so far confirmed in Germany involved people who had traveled outside the country, said Wieler.“We need to be very careful, especially of the British mutation of this virus,” Ralph Brinkhaus, the parliamentary leader of Merkel’s bloc, told broadcaster n-tv. ”So we don't yet know what further measures will be necessary in coming weeks."To ease the strain on working families having to look after school-age children and discourage them from using emergency care facilities, parliament passed a bill Thursday doubling the amount of paid parental leave to 40 days for 2021. Public health insurances will pay out up to 112.88 euros ($137) a day to parents if they stay home to care for children under 12 who couldn't go to school because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-german-lockdown-loopholes-criticized-as-deaths-hit-new-high-101610637759960.html
14-01-2021||World||Europe mulls vaccine certificate to boost crippled economy||A proposal to grant special privileges to those who have been vaccinated is gaining traction in Europe ahead of a crunch call of the region’s leaders, as a rise in coronavirus infections damps hopes of a swift exit from the economy-crippling lockdowns.Over a video conference on Jan. 21, European Union leaders will discuss the introduction of a “vaccination certificate” that would allow holders to travel freely, several diplomats familiar with the preparations of the virtual meeting said. The proposal enjoys growing support, one EU official said, while another diplomat cautioned that there’s pushback by other governments, and any limits to the freedom of movement on such grounds could be illegal.The proposal to introduce such a certificate gained momentum after Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis formally requested it with a letter to the chief of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, earlier this week. With inoculation campaigns moving at a snail’s pace, a decision to extend EU-wide privileges for vaccines that are not yet available to everyone in the bloc, due to limited supplies, may not come imminently.Still, countries desperate to at least partially restore travel could go it alone, since border control is a national competence, and EU coordination, while sought, isn’t compulsory. The commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, said it’s deliberating with the bloc’s national capitals about the idea of vaccination certificates as part of efforts to keep internal borders open.New proposal“We are in active discussions with member states on recognition of vaccination certificates, just like we are working on the recognition of tests,” Stefan De Keersmaecker, the commission’s transport and health spokesman, said on Thursday. “This is an important issue for free movement in the EU.”The EU official said leaders are likely to ask the commission to come up with a proposal for a vaccination certificate during next week’s call. Leaders will also ask the executive for action to speed up vaccinations and boost production capacity.Vendors have started to roll out apps that can securely store health information such as test results, vaccination status or proof of having had Covid-19, and be used by airlines to speed transit based on policies that vary by country.The calls come as the EU is falling behind the US, the UK, and countries such as Israel and the United Arab Emirates in vaccinating its population. The delays mean that lockdowns will last longer, postponing the bloc’s recovery from the steepest recession in living memory.“We should explore all possible avenues to encourage private companies to scale up production of vaccines and deliveries to the member states,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a Jan. 13 letter to von der Leyen. Finnish premier Sanna Marin, in a Jan. 11 letter to the commission president, said, “there is an urgent need to increase production capacity of different vaccines and at the same time speed up the shipments to the member states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-mulls-vaccine-certificate-to-boost-crippled-economy-101610639830056.html
14-01-2021||World||'Security concerns' push UAE to suspend issuance of visit visas to Pakistan||The suspension of visas by the United Arab Emirates to the citizens of Pakistan and 12 other countries was the outcome of alerts about possible attacks on growing numbers of Israeli citizens flocking to the emirates, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.The people, both in New Delhi and other capitals, said on condition of anonymity that the visa suspension, which remains in effect since it was introduced on November 18, was aimed at giving time to UAE authorities to streamline and bolster their procedures to more effectively screen applicants from these countries.Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who has been facing growing domestic pressure over the suspension of visas and detention of Pakistani nationals in the UAE, raised the matter during his visit to the UAE in December. A statement issued by UAE’s foreign ministry had then said the restrictions on visas were temporary in nature and due to the Covid-19 outbreak.However, three different people said the move followed specific alerts about possible attacks on Israeli citizens, who have been travelling in large numbers to the UAE since the two countries normalised their ties in August.“The foreign ministry’s statement appears to have been aimed at assuaging the Pakistani sentiments. There were alerts about possible attacks and time was needed to put in place measures to better screen visa applicants from certain countries,” said one person.In a report on November 25, Reuters had cited a source as saying that issuance of visas to citizens of Pakistan and the other countries had been stopped over “security concerns”.In the case of Pakistan, the focus apparently will be on screening visa applications from residents of the country’s so-called tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, a region where the Taliban and several other terror groups are active, and areas in Balochistan bordering Iran.Some alerts had specifically referred to the possible infiltration of Pakistan’s Shias, the people said.There have been reports since November in Iran’s state-run media about the detention of Pakistani Shias in the UAE. In a report on November 17, state-run Tehran Times sought to blame the detention of Pakistani Shias on the improved UAE-Israel ties. A Pakistani Shia lawmaker also recently raised the matter in a letter sent to the Foreign Office in Islamabad, the people said.“It has been repeatedly pointed out the visa suspension is temporary and the aim is to improve the screening of applications,” a second person said.Since the signing of the UAE-Israel peace deal, more than 50,000 Israelis have visited the Emirates, primarily for holidays. There are now about 15 daily flights from Tel Aviv to Dubai and Jewish community centre in Dubai is now a hub of activity.Zikrur Rahman, a former envoy to Palestine who also did several stints in Saudi Arabia and closely tracks developments in West Asia, noted there seemed to be no blanket ban on Pakistanis who are either living or working in the UAE or those who hold iqamas or residence permits.“There definitely are fissures on issuance of new visas, in particular visit and tourist visas to Pakistanis. This could be due to the fear of any possible attempt by radical Pakistani elements, particularly those with extremist mindset living in Pakistan’s porous border areas with Afghanistan and Iran, to infiltrate with the aim of damaging the growing relations between Israel and the UAE after the Abraham Accords,” he said.“The Iran-Israel rivalry is known to all. There is all possibility that such fears could have been expressed by the Israelis and hence, the UAE temporarily stopped new visas in order to first coordinate with Pakistan on this issue, and evolve a bilateral strategy to deal with any possible harm to Israel-UAE relations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-concerns-push-uae-to-suspend-issuance-of-visit-visas-to-pakistan-101610639200364.html
14-01-2021||World||Long-withheld Pentagon survey shows widespread racial discrimination, harassment||Nearly a third of Black US military servicemembers reported experiencing racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to results of a long-withheld Defense Department survey that underscore concerns about racism in the ranks.The 2017 survey, whose results have not previously been reported, also showed that US troops who experienced racial discrimination or harassment had high levels of dissatisfaction with the complaint process and largely did not report it.The data support the findings of a 2020 Reuters investigation, which found that servicemembers feared that reporting discrimination would likely backfire and was not worth the risk."Overall, results reveal much work is needed to improve the reporting process for those who experience racial/ethnic harassment and discrimination," the Defense Department acknowledged in a report that accompanied the survey data.The Pentagon's release of the data followed a Reuters article last month disclosing how the Defense Department sat on the 2017 survey data during President Donald Trump's administration, even last month denying a Reuters Freedom of Information Act Request.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, condemned the Pentagon's failure to disclose the data sooner. A Gillibrand aide noted that the senator's office had been seeking the data for months."This just-released 2017 report shows that President Trump’s Department of Defense has deliberately concealed statistics exposing a racial justice crisis in the military," Gillibrand told Reuters."While Defense Department leadership paid lip service to equality, they withheld a report revealing that minority service members face rampant discrimination and harassment, and those that report it are nearly as likely to face punishment as the perpetrators."Concerns about racial discrimination in the military - the largest U.S. employer - have taken on new urgency over the past year, as America undergoes a nationwide reckoning on racism.Although the military is diverse in lower ranks, it is largely white and male at the top. Unpunished discrimination and racial harassment play a role in pushing out minorities, advocates say.President-elect Joe Biden underscored the importance of diversity at the Pentagon when he announced his pick last month to lead it: retired Army General Lloyd Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. defense secretary, if approved by Congress."More than 40% of our active-duty forces are people of color. It’s long past time that the department’s leadership reflects that diversity," Biden said.RACIST JOKES AND INSULTSThe 2017 Workplace and Equal Opportunity Survey of Active Duty Members showed that 31.2% of Black servicemembers reported suffering racial discrimination, harassment or both, compared with 23.3% and 21% for Asian and Hispanic troops surveyed, respectively, figures that were still high.The survey is unlikely to capture all the discrimination that minority U.S. troops encounter, advocates say.Daniele Anderson, a Navy veteran who is chief strategist of the Black Veterans Project advocacy group, noted that the survey only asked about discrimination over the previous 12-month period."I would hazard a guess that there's significantly more that have experienced" discrimination in their careers, Anderson said.Minorities in the US military reported everything from dealing with racially driven jokes and insults to hearing claims about racial superiority. Some 17.9% of Black servicemembers surveyed reported hearing someone use a racial stereotype about Black people."Collectively, these results suggest negative racial/ethnic experiences among active duty members are primarily comprised of racial/ethnic harassment, occur more than once, are done by someone of a different race/ethnicity, and often go uncorrected," the report said.Of the US troops who chose not to report an incident of racial discrimination or racial harassment, 39% thought nothing would be done and an even greater percentage thought it would make their work situation unpleasant. Of those who reported an incident, the vast majority did not know the outcome of their complaints, the survey found.The Defense Department has not explained why the data took so long to release. The survey, conducted every four years, is already so old that the Pentagon is required to carry out a new one for the 2021 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.Anderson, pointing to race-related incidents over the past four years, suspected that 2021 data would show a deteriorating situation for minority servicemembers."If we somehow were able to get data today on the last 12 months, or the last four years, that number would probably be significantly worse," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longwithheld-pentagon-survey-shows-widespread-racial-discrimination-harassment-101610635513418.html
14-01-2021||World||Donald Trump will try to make his impeachment about free speech||With the House of Representatives having voted to impeach President Donald Trump for incitement to insurrection, it’s time to start contemplating what Trump’s defense will be in a Senate trial. The answer can be summed up briefly: Trump’s lawyers will argue that Trump did not commit a crime of incitement and that his words were protected by the First Amendment.But wait, you may say, if you can remember Trump’s 2020 Senate trial 12 months ago (so much has happened since then that I barely can — and I testified during the House Judiciary Committee proceedings): Impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution. That doesn’t require conviction of a federal crime.That means the First Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court isn’t relevant and shouldn’t protect Trump. The framers kept the “high crimes and misdemeanors” language intentionally broad so that presidents could be held accountable for a wide array of abuses of power, including interfering with a free and fair election.Yet, still thinking back to the last impeachment, you will also recall that Trump’s lawyers — and some of his Senate defenders — never conceded that basic legal fact. In addition to arguing that Trump had done nothing wrong in his “perfect” phone call with the president of Ukraine, Trump’s defenders also maintained that Trump could not be impeached because he had not committed a federal crime. They insisted, despite the historical and logical evidence, that high crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution need to be statutory federal crimes.They are going to make that argument again. And this time, they will also be able to wrap themselves in the patriotic flag of the First Amendment. Specifically, they are going to rely on an iconic 1969 free-speech decision by the Supreme Court, Brandenburg v. Ohio.The Brandenburg case reframed the law of incitement, extending the protection of the First Amendment beyond where it had been before. As late as the notorious 1951 case of Dennis v. United States, the court was still using a version of the “clear and present danger” test first devised by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1920. In the Dennis case, that standard was interpreted to allow conviction of nearly a dozen leaders of the Communist Party USA for sedition.By 1969, free-speech advocates and scholars had come to see the Dennis approach as out of step with contemporary values of political self-expression. In the Brandenburg case, the court said that the government can’t outlaw or punish “advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.”The Brandenburg rule thus has two components. The first is that the speech is “directed” to inciting imminent lawlessness. The second is that the speech is actually likely to achieve its result.Again, under the Constitution’s definition of high crimes and misdemeanors, it isn’t legally necessary for Trump to have committed a federal crime. Abusing the power of his office is plenty. Nevertheless, Trump’s supporters will insist that Trump’s conduct fails the Brandenburg test and thus isn’t impeachable.Whether Brandenburg would protect Trump from federal criminal prosecution is a subtle question. There probably wouldn’t be much doubt about the second prong, “likely to incite.” Trump’s speech did in fact incite lawlessness, and so it certainly seems to have been likely to do so.The hard part is whether his speech was “directed” to incitement. Some scholars think this means that Trump’s words need to have explicitly called for violence. Read literally, they didn’t.Yet a counterargument to this requirement of literalism has long been that it would inappropriately protect speech that was artfully framed to incite violence without ever explicitly doing so. The classic example is the speech given by Shakespeare’s Mark Antony over Caesar’s dead body. The speech famously uses irony (“Brutus is an honourable man”) to incite the mob to violence. It’s therefore plausible to conclude that the Brandenburg test doesn’t require literal use of inciting language.If calls for violence don’t have to be explicit, the prosecuting side has an obligation to prove that violence is nonetheless what the speaker intended to incite. (Some scholars think both literal incitement and intent are required.) Circumstantial evidence — like whether he actually refused to call in the National Guard — could help to prove Trump’s intent. Without it, however, Trump will simply be able to say that he did not intend to incite violence, making it difficult to convict him for a crime under the Brandenburg standard.Needless to say, it would be a terrible shame if Trump’s impeachment trial devolved into a legalistic exchange about whether the First Amendment and Brandenburg apply in impeachment proceedings. That’s exactly why you can expect Trump’s defenders and lawyers to make the argument. It’s reason to worry that the result of Trump’s second impeachment trial will be no different than the result of his first one.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and host of the podcast “Deep Background.” He is a professor of law at Harvard University and was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.

We have immediately supplied hot food and bamboo and tarpaulins to the affected people to reconstruct their homes," he said.He added that a cooking gas cylinder -- used widely in the camp -- was the suspected cause.Nayapara in southeast Bangladesh is home to tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees originally from Myanmar, including many who have been living there since the 1990s.Other squalid and congested camps in the area are home to nearly 900,000 Rohingya, most of whom fled a brutal military offensive by Myanmar's military in 2017.Save the Children's Bangladesh director Onno van Manen said the fire was "another devastating blow for the Rohingya people who have endured unspeakable hardship for years"."It stands as another ghastly reminder that children stuck in the camps... face a bleak future with little freedom of movement, inadequate access to education, poverty, serious protection risks and abuse including child marriage."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blaze-razes-500-houses-in-bangladesh-rohingya-camp-101610633340854.html

Before the pandemic, weekly applications typically numbered around 225,000. Last spring, after nationwide shutdowns took effect, applications for jobless benefits spiked to nearly 7 million — 10 times the previous record high. After declining over the summer, weekly claims have been stuck above 700,000 since September.The high pace of layoffs coincides with an economy that has faltered as consumers have avoided traveling, shopping and eating out in the face of soaring viral caseloads. More than 4,300 deaths were reported Tuesday, another record high. Shutdowns of restaurants, bars and other venues where people gather in California, New York and other states have likely forced up layoffs.Some states and cities are resisting shutdowns, partly out of fear of the economic consequences but raising the risk of further infections. Minnesota allowed in-person dining to resume this week. Michigan is poised to do the same.

14-01-2021||World||Russia says 'obliged' to detain Alexei Navalny upon return||Russia's prison service said on Thursday it was "obliged" to detain Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny who has said he plans to return to Moscow from Germany on Sunday.Navalny has been in Germany since late August after he collapsed on a flight from Siberia to Moscow and was flown to Berlin by medical aircraft.Western countries say the 44-year-old opposition leader was poisoned with the Soviet-designed nerve toxin Novichok.The anti-graft campaigner and his allies accuse Russian authorities of doing everything to force Navalny into exile.On Thursday, the Moscow branch of Russia's Federal Prison Service (FSIN) said in a statement it was "obliged to take all actions to detain" Navalny pending a court decision to turn a suspended sentence he received in 2014 into a jail term.Earlier this week, authorities asked a Moscow court to turn Navalny's suspended sentence on fraud charges into real jail time for violating the terms of his sentence.FSIN said that Navalny was obliged to report to them at least twice a month as part of his probation period that ended on December 29 last year.The statement added that in 2020 Navalny did not report for registration on six occasions."For each violation by A.A. Navalny official warnings were issued about the possibility of the suspended sentence being cancelled and replaced with real incarceration," the prison service added.Last December, Russian investigators said they launched a probe into Navalny allegedly misappropriating more than $4 million of donations to his organisations.Navalny insists the poisoning attack was carried out by Russia's security agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), on the orders of President Vladimir Putin, a claim that the Kremlin denies.Navalny said Wednesday he was "almost healthy" and that he would fly back to Moscow on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-obliged-to-detain-alexei-navalny-upon-return-101610631239127.html
14-01-2021||World||Poor nations need more cash to adapt to climate change: UN||Half of the world's climate change financing should go to helping poorer nations adapt to the effects of global warming, such as droughts, rising seas and floods, the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) said on Thursday.Extreme weather last year such as torrential rains in Africa, record heat waves and warmer temperatures on tropical oceans is consistent with climate change, scientists say.Last year was one of the warmest on record and as impacts intensify, governments around the world must adapt better or face serious costs, damages and losses, the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2020 said.The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to curb warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5C, this century.Under the pact, governments also agreed to implement adaptation measures such as flood defences, greener homes and drought-resilient crops, with financial aid for poorer nations."As the U.N. Secretary-General has said, we need a global commitment to put half of all global climate finance towards adaptation in the next year," said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP."This will allow a huge step up in adaptation – in everything from early warning systems to resilient water resources to nature-based solutions."The UNEP annual report on progress towards adaptation revealed that 72% of countries have adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument.However, huge financing gaps remain to help developing countries adapt to the worst effects.More progress is also needed bringing adaptation projects to the stage where they bring real protection.International finance for adaptation is slowly rising from $30 billion, or 5% of tracked climate funds, annually.But adaptation costs in developing countries are estimated at $70 billion per year, the report said. This is expected to reach $140-300 billion in 2030 and $280-500 billion in 2050.According to the report, cutting greenhouse gas emissions will reduce the impacts and costs of climate change. Achieving the 2C target could limit losses in annual growth to up to 1.6%, compared to 2.2% for a 3C trajectory.The Global Commission on Adaptation, launched in 2018 by the United Nations, in 2019 estimated that a $1.8 trillion investment in adaptation measures from 2020 to 2030 would bring a return of $7.1 trillion in cost-saving and other benefits by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poor-nations-need-more-cash-to-adapt-to-climate-change-un-101610631277009.html
14-01-2021||World||Pope Francis, ex-pope Benedict get virus vaccines: Vatican||Both Pope Francis and his predecessor, former pope Benedict XVI, have received the coronavirus vaccine, the Vatican said on Thursday.The Argentine pontiff, 84, has previously spoken of the importance of the jab in the fight against Covid-19, which has severely curtailed his own love of being among his flock.Under the Vatican's vaccination programme launched Wednesday, "the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine has been administered to Pope Francis and the Pope Emeritus," spokesman Matteo Bruni said.It had already been reported that Francis, 84, had received the jab on Wednesday, but officials declined to confirm the news.The Vatican News portal said Benedict, 93, was given a dose on Thursday morning.The former pontiff, who stepped down in 2013, lives in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens.In an interview broadcast at the weekend, Francis urged people to get the vaccine."There is a suicidal denial which I cannot explain, but today we have to get vaccinated," he told Canale 5.The Vatican in December said it was "morally acceptable" for Catholics even where the vaccines had been developed using cell lines from aborted foetuses.In his Christmas message last year, Francis also added his voice to calls for vaccines to be available across the globe, not just in rich countries.He urged "vaccines for all, especially the most vulnerable and most in need in all regions of the planet".Iraq trip in doubtThe Argentine has been forced to limit his interaction with the public since the virus first swept Italy early last year, notably switching his weekly Wednesday audiences online.Francis conceded at the weekend that his historic trip to Iraq planned for March, the first visit by a pope to the Middle Eastern country, could be in doubt.Recalling how he was forced to cancel his foreign trips last year due to the pandemic, he said: "I don't know if the upcoming trip to Iraq will happen."He added: "I cannot in all conscience encourage gatherings."There are serious concerns about how Francis would cope if he himself became infected, given both his age and his history of lung problems.The pope almost died when he was 21 after developing pleurisy, according to biographer Austen Ivereigh, and had part of one of his lungs removed.He recalled the incident in a recent book, "Let Us Dream", saying: "I have some sense of how people with coronavirus feel as they struggle to breathe on ventilators."Media reports suggested Pope Francis received the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which was authorised for use in the European Union on December 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-ex-pope-benedict-get-virus-vaccines-vatican-101610629069082.html
14-01-2021||World||UN watchdog confirms another Iranian breach of nuclear deal||The United Nations' atomic watchdog agency confirmed Thursday that Iran has informed it that the country has begun installing equipment for the production of uranium metal, which would be another violation of the landmark nuclear deal with world powers.Iran maintains its plans to conduct research and development on uranium metal production are part of its “declared aim to design an improved type of fuel,” the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said. Uranium metal can also be used for a nuclear bomb, however, and research on its production is specifically prohibited in the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action signed with world powers in 2015.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something Iran insists it does not want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.IAEA inspectors visited the Isfahan plant where Iran has said it plans to conduct the research on Jan. 10, and officials were informed by Tehran on Jan. 13 that “modification and installation of the relevant equipment for the mentioned R&D activities have been already started," the agency said.Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, repeated that in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that “natural uranium will be used to produce uranium metal in the first stage.”He told Iran's official news agency IRNA that the move will elevate Iran to the level of “progressive nations in production of new fuels.”It was the latest in a string of violations of the JCPOA that Iran has undertaken since President Donald Trump pulled the United States unilaterally out of the deal in 2018, saying it needed to be re-negotiated.Tehran has been using the violations to put pressure on the other signatories — Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia — to provide more incentives to Iran to offset crippling American sanctions reimposed after the U.S. exited the deal.President-elect Joe Biden, who was vice president when the JCPOA was negotiated, has said he hopes to return the U.S. to the deal.Britain, France and Germany said last week, however, that Iran “risks compromising” chances of diplomacy with Washington after Tehran announced another violation — that it was starting to enrich uranium to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.The foreign ministers of the three European nations said in a joint statement then that the Iranian activity “has no credible civil justification.” They said the enrichment was a clear violation of the deal and “further hollows out the agreement.”Germany's Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment Thursday, but the announcement on the production of uranium metal now further complicates trying to get Washington back on board.Those working to save the deal also note that despite the violations, Iran continues to allow inspectors to access all sites in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-watchdog-confirms-another-iranian-breach-of-nuclear-deal-101610628422743.html
14-01-2021||World||Explained: What is WHO team looking for in Wuhan||The WHO team of international researchers that arrived in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday hopes to find clues to the origin of the Covid-19 pandemic.The visit has been shrouded in secrecy, with neither China nor the WHO revealing exactly what the team will do or where it will go. The search for the origins is likely to be a years-long effort that could help prevent future pandemics.Why Wuhan?The industrial and transportation hub on the Yangtze River is the first place the coronavirus surfaced in the world. It's possible that the virus came to Wuhan undetected from elsewhere, but the city of 11 million is a logical place for the mission to start.People began falling ill in December 2019, many with links to a sprawling food market that dealt in live animals. The growing number of patients triggered alarms that prompted China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention to send a team to investigate.The disease would ravage Wuhan before it was brought under control in March. The city was locked down on Jan. 23 with little or no warning. The hardships endured and lives lost became a source of both sorrow and pride for residents once the 76-day lockdown was lifted on April 8.What is the team's agenda?First they have to quarantine for 14 days, during which they will work with Chinese counterparts via video conference. Possible visits after quarantine are the Huanan Seafood Market, the site of the December 2019 cluster of cases, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold in the market. The market has since been largely ruled out but it could provide hints to how the virus spread so widely. Samples from the market may still be available, along with the testimony of those involved in the early response.The Wuhan Institute of Virology maintains an extensive archive of genetic sequences of bat coronaviruses built in the wake of the 2003 SARS pandemic, which spread from China to many countries. WHO team members would hope for access to lab logbooks and data, both junior and senior researchers and safety protocols for sample collection, storage and analysis.Why the secrecy?China has firmly rejected calls for an independent outside investigation. The head of the WHO recently expressed impatience with how long China took to make necessary arrangements for the expert team's visit.The ruling Communist Party keeps a tight hold on information and is particularly concerned about possible revelations about its handling of the virus that could open it up to international criticism and financial demands.China stifled independent reports about the outbreak and has published little information on its search for the origins of the virus. An AP investigation found that the government has strictly controlled all scientific research related to the outbreak and forbids researchers from speaking to the press.State media continue to play up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere. In announcing the experts’ visit, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said “the tracing of the virus origin will most likely involve multiple countries and localities."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-who-team-in-wuhan-looking-for-101610624541686.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid: Japan's new state emergency met with public indifference||Japan’s expanded state of emergency went into effect Thursday as the government seeks to stop a surge of new coronavirus infections, though with the restrictions not binding many people appeared to be ignoring the requests to avoid nonessential travel.People were still commuting on crowded trains and buses in Osaka, Fukuoka and other areas of the seven new prefectures placed under the state of emergency. In Tokyo, where the emergency decree has already been in place for a week, the governor expressed concern about people not following the official guidance."I thank for your cooperation, but the number of people up and about in town has not been significantly reduced,” Gov. Yuriko Koike told reporters.She said the state of emergency is not just about avoiding eating out at night or for restaurants to close early, but to reduce contacts among people.“The virus has no calendar, clock or even a map. Day or night, or prefectural borders doesn’t matter,” she said. “Please avoid going out for nonessential purposes.”Under the state of emergency that now covers areas home to more than half of Japan's population, bars and restaurants have been asked to close by 8 p.m., employers have been asked to have 70% of their staff work from home and residents in the affected areas have been asked to avoid going out for nonessential purposes. Reduced capacity has also been requested for sports and other events.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government has said the measures are needed to prevent an increase in infections in urban areas from spilling over to smaller towns where medical systems are vulnerable. Suga has called the situation “severe” and asked the people to cooperate, though in Japan the requests are nonbinding and those who ignore them are not punished.The Tokyo governor urged the country’s main business organization to encourage employers to do more to promote remote work and reduce commuting as requested by the government.Japan has seen coronavirus infections and deaths roughly double over the past month to about 302,000 and 4,200 respectively. Tokyo alone reported 1,502 new cases on Thursday.Yet despite the surge, Japan has reported far fewer infections than many countries of its size.Experts say people are not responsive to the emergency measures due to growing complacency.Suga has said he will seek the revision of a law to allow his government to issue binding measures with penalties for violators.The Cabinet minister in charge of the coronavirus measures, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told a special parliamentary panel Thursday that further expansion of the emergency is possible if infections spread.The emergency decree now covers Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures.Dr. Shigeru Omi, a former World Health Organization regional director who heads a government COVID-19 taskforce, said tougher measures such as business shutdown requests may be needed if the measures are ineffective by early February. He has previously said a month-long emergency may not be enough to slow the surge.Suga has been criticized for not taking stronger action earlier in the outbreak, when measures were largely limited to asking the public to take basic safety measures such as wearing masks and washing hands.Experts have said the surge in infections is putting pressure on hospitals in the country, especially in Tokyo, which has seen about a quarter of the country's virus cases. At least two people in Tokyo have died while waiting to be hospitalized after testing positive for the virus.To relieve manage the burden, Tokyo is working to secure hotel rooms for less-serious patients, while assigning three prefectural-run hospitals to specialize in coronavirus treatment, the governor said.“The infections are showing signs of becoming explosive. We must slow the pace as soon as possible,” said Norio Ohmagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center and a member of Tokyo’s coronavirus taskforce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-japan-s-new-state-emergency-met-with-public-indifference-101610624010234.html

14-01-2021||World||Past Covid-19 infection gives at least 5 months of immunity: UK study||People who have been infected with Covid-19 are immune from contracting the virus again for at least five months, according to a major study by Public Health England (PHE), which examined more than 6,500 people between June and December 2020.The study released on Thursday, however, cautions that those with such immunity may still be able to carry the virus in their noses and throats and therefore pose a risk of transmitting it to others.PHE scientists working on the study have concluded that naturally acquired immunity as a result of past infections provide 83% protection against reinfection, compared to people who have not had the disease before. PHE said that the study called SIREN (SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection EvaluatioN) will continue to assess whether protection may last for longer, which means that people who contracted the disease in the first wave may now be vulnerable to catching it again.Between June 18 and November 24, scientists detected 44 potential reinfections (2 ‘probable’ and 42 ‘possible’ reinfections) out of 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection, PHE said.Susan Hopkins, SIREN study lead, said: “This study has given us the clearest picture to date of the nature of antibody protection against Covid-19 but it is critical people do not misunderstand these early findings”.“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts. Crucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on”.She added: “This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others.”PHE said the study will continue to follow participants for 12 months to explore how long any immunity may last, the effectiveness of vaccines and to what extent people with immunity are able to carry and transmit the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/past-covid-19-infection-gives-at-least-5-months-of-immunity-uk-study-101610622927221.html

Sara Duterte chairs an alliance of political parties, and stepped into the national spotlight in 2019 by campaigning for Senate candidates, most of whom won.“I pity her,” the president said at the inauguration of an elevated highway in the capital. “She will go through what I went through.”Rodrigo Duterte, who has a history of making vulgar and sexist comments, also said he doesn’t intend to extend his six-year term. His allies in Congress have sought to revise the Constitution, which was enacted after the overthrow of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.“Even if you serve it to me on a silver platter or give me ten more years for free, I am done,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-says-presidency-not-for-women-tells-daughter-not-to-run-101610621965083.html

They are a part of the WHO team which is visiting China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The two members, who had tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in blood-based serology tests on their way to Wuhan via Singapore, were stopped from boarding their plane to Wuhan.They had tested negative for Covid-19 in swab tests, Bloomberg reported."The international team of 13 scientists examining the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19 arrived in Wuhan, China, today. The experts will begin their work immediately during the 2 weeks quarantine protocol for international travelers," the WHO said in a tweet on Thursday."Two scientists are still in Singapore completing tests for Covid-19. All team members had multiple negative PCR and antibody tests for Covid-19 in their home countries prior to traveling," the global health body tweeted.A global team of scientists led by the World Health Organization arrived in China's central city of Wuhan, where Covid-19 first surfaced in late 2019, to investigate the origins of the pandemic, state television said on Thursday.The team will spend about a month in the city, including two weeks in quarantine.WHO confirmed that the scientists were tested again in Singapore and were all negative for PCR. "But two members tested positive for IgM antibodies. They are being retested for both IgM and IgG antibodies."China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian did not directly comment but said, "China will strictly follow the relevant epidemic prevention regulations and requirements, and provide corresponding support and facilities for WHO experts who come to China to carry out international cooperation on tracing the origin of the virus."The rest of the team arrived at the Wuhan airport and walked through a makeshift clear plastic tunnel into the airport. The researchers, who wore face masks, were greeted by airport staff in full protective gear, including masks, goggles and full body suits.They will undergo a two-week quarantine as well as a throat swab test and an antibody test for Covid-19, according to CGTN, the English-language channel of state broadcaster CCTV. They are to start working with Chinese experts via video conference while in quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-entry-to-2-who-members-for-probe-cites-covid-19-test-report-101610619686021.html
14-01-2021||World||Hong Kong's first website takedown under national security law confirmed||A Hong Kong internet provider said Thursday it had blocked access to a website following a police order, the first confirmed takedown using a new national security law imposed by Beijing last year.Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong has open internet access, but critics of Beijing fear powers given to the police under the new law could herald the end of that freedom.Internet users noticed the website HKChronicles was unreachable from some Hong Kong-based devices last week, and its owner put out a statement saying she believed authorities were blocking access.Police declined to comment, but on Thursday Hong Kong Broadband Network -- one of the city's internet service providers -- confirmed a takedown order had been issued."We have disabled the access to the website in compliance with the requirement issued under the National Security Law," the company said.HKChronicles, which is still available overseas and in Hong Kong through virtual private networks, is a controversial site.It ran lists of businesses that support the democracy movement, and collected stories and footage from huge and often violent pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019 -- with a particular focus on allegations of excessive police violence.But after officers began removing identifying badges during clashes with protesters, the website started collecting their personal details -- a tactic known as doxxing, which is illegal in Hong Kong and many other jurisdictions.It also listed the names and details of many pro-Beijing figures.Similar websites doxxing pro-democracy supporters also exist.Access to the internet in authoritarian China is impeded by a "Great Firewall" that limits sites and information that people on the mainland can access.China also employs a sophisticated censorship network which scrubs posts deemed sensitive from the digital world.But semi-autonomous Hong Kong remains outside that firewall, a crucial component of its status as an international business hub.Last June Beijing imposed a sweeping new national security law to crush dissent.Among its many new provisions were fresh police powers to order internet providers to remove websites or content deemed to breach national security, sparking fears the "Great Firewall" might be widened to one day encompass Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-first-website-takedown-under-national-security-law-confirmed-101610619123074.html
14-01-2021||World||'Ignores current ground reality': India on UK parliament's Kashmir debate||India has expressed its dismay at some of the parliamentarians who participated in a debate on Kashmir in the Houses of Parliament complex in London relying on "false assertions" and unsubstantiated allegations propagated by a "third country" – an apparent reference to Pakistan.The debate, organised by backbench British MPs at Westminster Hall in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening, was entitled “Political situation in Kashmir” – terminology the Indian High Commission in London pointed out as problematic in itself.“Regarding the reference to ‘Kashmir’ in the title: the need is felt to differentiate between the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (when the erstwhile princely state of Kashmir legally acceded to India in October 1947, this part was forcibly and illegally occupied by Pakistan),” the High Commission said in a statement.“It was also noted that references to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, despite the volumes of authentic information available in the public domain – based on up to date and visible facts on the ground – ignored current ground reality and, instead chose to reflect false assertions of the kind promoted by a third country, such as unsubstantiated allegations of ‘genocide’, ‘rampant violence’ and ‘torture’,” it noted.Responding to the debate on behalf of the UK government, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) minister Nigel Adams had reiterated the official stance that it is not for Britain to play any mediatory role in a bilateral India-Pakistan matter, even as he accepted there were human rights concerns on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC).“The government’s policy [on Kashmir] remains stable, it’s unchanged. We continue to believe that this is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting political resolution to the situation that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people… as laid out in the Simla Agreement,” said Adams, in his capacity as Minister for Asia.“It’s not appropriate for the UK government to prescribe a solution or act as a mediator in this regard but it would be wrong to not acknowledge there are serious human rights concerns in both India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This has been confirmed by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in his reports,” he said.The minister also made a reference to the District Development Council (DDC) democratic elections held in the region in December last year, which Labour Party MP Barry Gardiner pointed out attracted the free and fair participation of over 50 per cent of the local electorate.“The people of Kashmir deserve the opportunity to thrive and succeed, so more broadly we welcome the commitment that the Indian government has made to the economic and social development of India-administered Kashmir and we continue to seek further details of their plans,” added Adams.The debate, organised by Labour’s Sarah Owen, included the participation of cross-party British MPs, many of whom have a large Kashmiri diaspora constituency base.They raised concerns of alleged human rights violations and called on the UK government to seek access to the region for direct reports from Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to be presented in the UK Parliament in future.The Indian High Commission in London sought to highlight that since last year, a smart wi-fi project has enabled high-speed internet access in the region and that despite threats of terror attacks, challenging weather conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic, landmark DDC elections were concluded in December 2020.“Since the administrative reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, it is well on the path of good governance and accelerated development. All administrative measures taken by the Government of India in Jammu and Kashmir are entirely an internal matter of India,” the Indian High Commission statement said.“Regarding the reference to peace and stability of our region, it is reiterated that India stands ready to engage with Pakistan on all outstanding issues – including on Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the Shimla Agreement (1972) and the Lahore Declaration (1999) in an atmosphere free from terror, hostility and violence,” it noted.The statement asserted that while it was not the policy of India to take “undue interest” in the internal discussions within a foreign Parliament, the High Commission of India continues to engage with all concerned – including the UK government and parliamentarians – to avoid “misperceptions and misinformation” by making authentic information about India available to all.

14-01-2021||World||Canada grants asylum to several Hong Kong activists: Support group||Several Hong Kong activists who protested the controversial security law imposed by Beijing have been granted asylum in Canada, according to a support group.According to a statement posted by the New Hong Kong Cultural Club (NHKCC), this makes Canada the “very first country” to accept those who claimed refugee status because of their protests against the law. This was first reported by the Globe and Mail daily.The NHKCC Canada also claimed that while 14 have been granted political refugee status, nearly another 30 had received claimant status, meaning their cases for asylum will be heard by the Immigration and Refugee Board or IRB.News of granting such asylum came even as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government faced criticism over allowing the visit of the husband and two children of a Huawei executive who is under house arrest in Vancouver.Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecommunications firm, was arrested in December 2018, precipitating retaliation from Beijing which detained two Canadians, including a former diplomat, in what Trudeau has described was a act of “hostage diplomacy.” Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor remain in captivity in China but it now appears that Canada may have been permitted consular access to them in return for agreeing to the visit by Meng’s husband Liu Xiaozong in October, followed by their children joining them in December last year.Opposition MP Raquel Dancho said: “The Liberals rolled out the red carpet and granted a special travel exemption for the Huawei CFO’s family to reunite in time for the holidays. This is an insult to the millions of Canadians who were told by this government not to visit loved ones.”Rob Oliphant, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, accepted that there was anger over the decision at granting special exemption of Meng’s family. “Do I understand Canadians’ outrage? Absolutely?” he said during a debate on the network CTV, but added this was a decision taken by officials at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.While the decision could not have been taken without the knowledge of the country’s top political leaders, given the sensitive nature of the case, multiple media outlets said the PMO has refused to comment on whether Trudeau was aware of this allowance being given to Meng’s family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-grants-asylum-to-several-hong-kong-activists-support-group-101610616446794.html
14-01-2021||World||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny may face 3.5 years jail on return to Russia||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is on a national wanted list for allegedly violating the terms of a suspended prison sentence and risks being jailed for three and a half years when he returns to Russia this weekend, one of his lawyers said on Thursday.Navalny announced on Wednesday that he plans to fly back to Russia on Sunday for the first time since he was poisoned in August with a Novichok nerve agent, despite the risk of being jailed on his return from Germany.The Kremlin denies involvement in his poisoning, said it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and has said he is free to return to Russia at any time.Navalny on Wednesday shrugged off the growing list of legal threats, calling criminal cases against him -- of which there are at least two pending -- fabricated to thwart his political ambitions.Vadim Kobzev, one of Navalny's lawyers, told Reuters on Thursday that Navalny had now been put on a national wanted list because Russia's prison service accuses him of not reporting to them at the end of last year in connection with a suspended sentence for embezzlement which he was serving out.Navalny said the original case against him was trumped up and that he was in Germany at the time being treated as an outpatient for his poisoning so could not report in. The prison service says he was discharged from a Berlin hospital in September and therefore should have returned to Moscow and reported to them."In theory they can detain him as soon as he arrives (in Russia) but initially only for 48 hours," said Kobzev, who said he expected a court to hear details of the case on Jan. 29 at which point it could order his suspended sentence to be converted into real jail time."The court can change his whole suspended sentence into a real one and give him three and a half years in jail," said Kobzev.Leonid Volkov, an ally of Navalny, has said that Navalny will become the world's most high profile political prisoner if he is jailed, likening him to Nelson Mandela, and has said he would become a symbol of resistance to the Kremlin.The Kremlin, which refers to Navalny only as "the Berlin patient," says it is up to the relevant law enforcement agencies to decide how he is treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-may-face-3-5-years-jail-on-return-to-russia-101610612880377.html
14-01-2021||World||Can the 14th amendment stop Trump from becoming President again||Some US lawmakers have said President Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding political office again following his impeachment on Wednesday for inciting a mob that stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.Now that the House has impeached Trump, the Senate will hold a trial on whether to remove him and possibly bar him from future office.Legal experts said disqualification could be accomplished through the impeachment proceedings or the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.Here is how the disqualification effort could play out.CAN TRUMP'S DISQUALIFICATION BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH IMPEACHMENT?The US Constitution says there are two ways to punish an impeached official: removal from office or “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."The House approved a single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting insurrection when he delivered an incendiary speech to supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged the Capitol.Trump is likely to argue at trial that his remarks were free speech protected by the Constitution's First Amendment and that, while he told supporters to "fight," he did not intend it as a literal call to violence.Removing an official requires a "conviction" by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction.Three federal officials in US history have been disqualified through impeachment proceedings. All three were federal judges.Most recently, in 2010 the Senate removed and disqualified from future office a Louisiana judge found to have engaged in corruption.There is some debate over the scope of the disqualification clause and whether it applies to the presidency, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University.Analyzing historical documents, some law experts say the founders did not intend the presidency to be considered an "office" under the disqualification clause, while others argue that the term applies.CAN TRUMP BE DISQUALIFIED IF HE IS NOT CONVICTED BY THE SENATE?This is uncharted legal territory, and there is no clear answer, scholars said.Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado, said he believed a vote to disqualify Trump can be held even if there are not enough votes for conviction. The US Supreme Court has made clear that the Senate has wide latitude to determine how it conducts a trial, he said.But Kalt said he thought disqualification would require conviction first. To do otherwise would be the equivalent of punishing the president for an offense he did not commit, Kalt said.All three judges who were disqualified from office were first convicted.WHAT ABOUT THE 14TH AMENDMENT?Section 3 of the 14th Amendment provides an alternative path for disqualification.The provision states that no person shall hold office if they have engaged in "insurrection or rebellion" against the United States. It was enacted following the Civil War to bar Confederates from holding public office.Under congressional precedent, only a simple majority of both chambers is needed to invoke this penalty. Congress can later remove the disqualification, but only if two-thirds of both houses vote in favor of doing so.In 1919, Congress used the 14th Amendment to block an elected official, Victor Berger, from assuming his seat in the House because he had actively opposed US intervention in World War I.The text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not explain how it should be invoked.Another section the 14th Amendment, Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the entire amendment through "appropriate legislation.” Some scholars have interpreted this language to mean that a majority of both chambers of Congress could enact a law applying a ban to a particular president, like Trump."The 14th Amendment route is very unclear as to what it would take to get it rolling," said Kalt. "I think it would require some combination of legislation and litigation."COULD TRUMP CHALLENGE A DISQUALIFICATION IN COURT?It is certainly possible, said Kalt.A Supreme Court case from 1993 makes clear that the court is wary of second-guessing how the Senate handles impeachment. In that case, involving an accused judge, the court said whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be litigated.If Trump is disqualified, the current Supreme Court might want to clarify whether the move was lawful, Kalt said.Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and most recently Amy Coney Barrett. The court now has a six-judge conservative majority."If you are going to say someone can't run, you want to get that litigated and settled sooner rather than later," Kalt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-the-14th-amendment-stop-trump-from-becoming-president-again-101610615038895.html

14-01-2021||World||'At 6 pm, life stops': Europe uses curfews to fight coronavirus||As the wan winter sun sets over France's Champagne region, the countdown clock kicks in.Laborers stop pruning the vines as the light fades at about 4:30 pm, leaving them 90 minutes to come in from the cold, change out of their work clothes, hop in their cars and zoom home before a 6 p.m. coronavirus curfew.Forget about any after-work socializing with friends, after-school clubs for children or doing any evening shopping beyond quick trips for essentials. Police on patrol demand valid reasons from people seen out and about. For those without them, the threat of mounting fines for curfew-breakers is increasingly making life outside of the weekends all work and no play.“At 6 pm, life stops,” says Champagne producer Alexandre Prat.Trying to fend off the need for a third nationwide lockdown that would further dent Europe’s second-largest economy and put more jobs in danger, France is instead opting for creeping curfews. Big chunks of eastern France, including most of its regions that border Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy, face 6 pm-to-6 am restrictions on movement.The rest of France could quickly follow suit, losing two extra hours of liberty that have been just enough for residents to maintain bare-bones social lives.Until a couple of weeks ago, the nightly curfew didn't kick in until 8 pm in Prat's region, the Marne. Customers still stopped to buy bottles of his family's bubbly wines on their way home, he said. But when the cut-off time was advanced to 6 pm to slow viral infections, the drinkers disappeared.“Now we have no one," Prat said.The village where retiree Jerome Brunault lives alone in the Burgundy wine region is also in one of the 6 pm curfew zones. The 67-year-old says his solitude weighs more heavily without the opportunity for early evening drinks, nibbles and chats with friends, the so-called “apero” get-togethers so beloved by the French that were hurried but still feasible when curfew started two hours later.“With the 6 pm curfew, we cannot go to see friends for a drink anymore,” Brunault said. "I now spend my days not talking to anyone except for the baker and some people by phone.”Imposing a 6 pm curfew nationwide is among options the French government is considering in response to rising infections and the spread of a particularly contagious virus variant that has swept across Britain, where new infections and virus deaths have soared.Prime Minister Jean Castex could announce a curfew extension Thursday evening, as well as other restrictions, to fight the virus in a country that has seen over 69,000 confirmed virus deaths.An earlier curfew combats virus transmission “precisely because it serves to limit social interactions that people can have at the end of the day, for example in private homes,” French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says.Overnight curfews have become the norm in swaths of Europe but the 6 pm-to-6 am curfew in 25 regions of eastern France is the most restrictive anywhere in the European Union's 27 nations. Others countries' curfews all start later and often finish earlier.The curfew in Italy runs from 10 pm to 5 am, as does the Friday night to Sunday morning curfew in Latvia. Regions of Belgium that speak French have a 10 pm to 6 am curfew while in Belgium's Dutch-speaking region, the hours are midnight to 5 am.People out between 8 pm and 5 am in Hungary must be able to show police written proof from their employers that they are either working or commuting.There are no curfews in Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Malta, Sweden, Poland or the Netherlands, although the Dutch government is thinking about whether imposing a curfew would slow new Covid-19 cases.In France, critics of the 6 pm curfew say the earlier time actually crams people together more after work, when they pile onto public transportation, clog roads and shop for groceries in a narrow rush-hour window before they must be home.Women's rugby coach Felicie Guinot says negotiating rush-hour traffic in Marseille has become a nightmare. The city in southern France is among the places where the more contagious virus variant has started to flare.“It's a scramble so everyone can be home by 6 pm,” Guinot said.In historic Besançon, the fortressed city that was the hometown of “Les Misérables” author Victor Hugo, music store owner Jean-Charles Valley says the 6 pm deadline means people no longer drop by after work to play with the guitars and other instruments that he sells. Instead, they rush home.“People are completely demoralised,” Valley said.In Dijon, the French city known for its pungent mustard, working mother of two Celine Bourdin says her life has narrowed to “dropping kids at school and going to work, then going back home, helping kids with homework and preparing dinner.”But even that cycle is better than a repeat of France's lockdown at the start of the pandemic, when schools also closed, Bourdin says.“If my children don’t go to school, it means I cannot work anymore," she said. "It was terribly difficult to be all stuck almost 24 hours a day in the house.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-6-pm-life-stops-europe-uses-curfews-to-fight-coronavirus-101610614066742.html
14-01-2021||World||Search itensifies for black box of doomed Sriwijaya Air Flight||Indonesia’s transport ministry ordered the nation’s airlines to inspect their older, so-called classic Boeing Co. 737 aircraft following Saturday’s crash of a Sriwijaya Air passenger jet with 62 people on board.The cause of the crash isn’t yet known -- divers are still trying to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage in the Java Sea. The flight-data recorder was recovered Tuesday. Rescue workers have been bringing in bags of human remains for identification, along with parts of the Boeing 737-500 plane, which was nearly 27 years old.“This is a preventive action on similar types of aircraft that operate in Indonesia,” Adita Irawati, a spokeswoman for the transport ministry, wrote in a text message. “It is a common practice in other countries.”Boeing 737-300, 400 and 500 jets all fall under the classic series. Indonesian airlines that fly those include Citilink, Nam Air, Deraya Air Taxi, Xpress Air, Jayawijaya Dirgantara, My Indo Airlines, Trigana Air and Tri-MG Intra Asia Airlines, according to data from planespotters.net.Sriwijaya Flight 182 plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta at 2:36 p.m. on Jan. 9. The aircraft had returned to service only on Dec. 20, after spending nine months in storage due to the downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The plane was traveling to Pontianak on the island of Borneo. Four minutes after takeoff, air-traffic controllers noticed it wasn’t on its assigned track and radioed the crew. Within seconds, the aircraft disappeared from radar.The retrieved flight-data recorder is “in relatively good shape,” Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said Wednesday. The box is being dried out and the contents should be downloaded within five days, he said.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is sending a team of technical experts to assist the Indonesian government’s probe into the crash. They’ll be joined by representatives of Boeing, engine maker General Electric Co. and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Air-accident probes are typically run by the country in which the crash occurred, but investigators from the nation where the plane and its components were built can participate. Indonesia granted waivers allowing them to enter the country despite its coronavirus travel ban, a person familiar with the matter said Tuesday.Representatives from the NTSC and Sriwijaya Air met with victims’ families for the first time on Wednesday to provide updates on the investigation and notify them that a preliminary report will be available 30 days after the date of the crash, the airline said in an emailed statement.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced airlines globally to park fleets due to a lack of demand and border restrictions. Aircraft require specific maintenance work during storage and when they are brought back into service to ensure that engines function properly, fuel isn’t contaminated and all systems work.Weather has been a factor in several crashes in Indonesia, a fast-growing market with one of the world’s worst safety records. Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 had been delayed for 56 minutes as heavy rain hit the Indonesian capital. The plane plunged more than 10,000 feet shortly after takeoff.Other major crashes in the Java Sea in recent years include a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max in October 2018 and an AirAsia Group Bhd. Airbus SE jet in December 2014. Both hurtled into the ocean, claiming 351 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-itensifies-for-black-box-of-doomed-sriwijaya-air-flight-101610613483252.html

We invite (the United States) to distance themselves from threatening language such as sanctions," Akar told journalists in Ankara."We want the solution of problems through dialogue. If the US side wants a solution, a solution could be found with work on the technical level," he said.The sanctions were imposed at a challenging time in the fraught relationship between Ankara and Washington. President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office on Jan. 20, replacing Donald Trump. Biden has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan's policies in the past.Turkey has defended its acquisition of the S-400s as a necessity because it was unable to procure air defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms.Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into NATO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-says-turning-back-on-s-400s-problematic-seeks-us-dialogue-101610604273048.html

In a long-running dispute, Google and Facebook have called the rules unfair and suggested they would force them to limit their offerings in the country.After media reports said Australian news websites were not showing up in searches, Google confirmed it was running unspecified tests in relation to news media."We're currently running a few experiments that will each reach about 1% of Google Search users in Australia to measure the impacts of news businesses and Google Search on each other," a spokesman said in an email, adding that the experiments would conclude by early February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-calls-out-google-for-experiment-blocking-some-news-sites-101610606511202.html
14-01-2021||World||China ends 2020 with record trade surplus as pandemic goods soar||China’s export boom continued into December, pushing the trade surplus to a record high in the month and bolstering what is already the world’s best-performing major economy.Fueling the shipments surge is insatiable global appetite for work-from-home technology and health care equipment as Covid-19 continues to surge in many places around the world. Demand is so strong that’s it’s contributing to a bottleneck at ports as manufacturers complain of a shortage of shipping containers and surging costs.Early control of virus cases last year allowed China’s factories to capitalize on global demand while its trading rivals were hobbled. That export momentum is expected to keep going even as vaccines are rolled out to tame the virus spread and allow industrial production to recover in the US and Europe.The bumper year also underscores China’s role as the fulcrum of global supply chains even as political tensions with the US and other trading rivals simmered.“The biggest takeaway is that China’s exports have remained surprisingly resilient despite the return of the second wave in major economies,” said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong.The trade data showed surging demand across the board:“Demand for China’s goods may remain strong in the next few months with the recent surge of Covid infections in the US and Europe,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong.That outperformance will inevitably wane as the virus is controlled in big markets including the US and Europe and industrial production recovers, he added.Li Kuiwen, an official at China’s General Administration of Customs, said the trade surplus may keep growing this year, supported by an expected recovery in the global economy and stable domestic growth.Jian Chang, chief China economist at Barclays Plc in Hong Kong, said the data supports regional evidence from South Korea and Vietnam of booming demand.“The external recovery has continued,” said Chang. “Chinese manufacturers have flexibly adjusted their production lines to produce goods to meet the demand through the new Covid era.” Both pandemic and non-pandemic related goods are growing strongly, she said.The data probably won’t shift the central bank from its stance of gradually withdrawing monetary stimulus but without any sharp turn in policy, Chang said, adding there’s unlikely to be an interest-rate cut or hike this year.The figures also showed shifts in China’s trading partners last year, with the 10-member bloc of Southeast Asian nations rising to the No. 1 spot, followed by the European Union and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ends-2020-with-record-trade-surplus-as-pandemic-goods-soar-101610606537165.html

Beijing says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan on the world stage, something Taipei's democratically-elected government rejects.Tsai told Craft that Taiwan would keep pushing for access to the United Nations and U.N.-related meetings, and hoped that the United States would continue to support this, Taiwan's presidential office said."We will continue to let the world know that Taiwan is a force for good and an important partner. We are capable and determined to contribute to the international community," the office cited Tsai as saying.It added that David Feith, Deputy US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was also on the call.Beijing has been angered by stepped-up support for Taiwan from the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump, including trips to Taipei by top US officials, further straining Sino-U.S. ties.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between US officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.Craft's Taiwan trip appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Biden takes office on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-stands-by-taiwan-envoy-says-after-cancelled-trip-101610609232320.html

I want to stress that the government’s policy remains stable, it is unchanged, we continue to believe that this is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting political resolution to the situation that takes into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people”.“It is not appropriate for the UK government to prescribe a solution or act as a mediator in this regard but it would be wrong to not acknowledge that there are serious human rights concerns in both India-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This has been confirmed by the UN high commissioner for human rights in his report”.He added: “The situation in India-administered Kashmir has been a particular concern to many here today including as well this government, particularly since the revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution in 2019”.The UK government, he said, welcomed the recent release of former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, and noted that several restrictions had been relaxed in recent days and weeks.Adams said: “We repeatedly raise our concerns about detentions and restrictions with the Indian government. The foreign secretary (Dominic Raab) raised Kashmir with his counterpart, including during his visit to New Delhi last month”.“The situation in Kashmir remains an important issue for the government. We continue to talk frankly to the governments of India and Pakistan about our human rights concerns and for all remaining restrictions on India-administered Kashmir to be lifted as soon as possible”.India was the focus of debates in the Westminster Hall for the second day on Wednesday. On Tuesday, MPs highlighted alleged persecution of Muslims, Christians and religious minorities in the country, with Adams assuring MPs that such issues are often raised with New Delhi.Noting the debates, the Indian high commission extended an invitation to British MPs to discuss all India-related issues so that they have authentic and factual information, including issues of concern to them or their constituents.It said: “It is not the policy of India to take undue interest in internal discussions within a foreign parliament. High Commission of India is engaging with all concerned – including the UK Government and H’ble Parliamentarians to avoid misperceptions and misinformation by making authentic information about India available to all”.“The measures taken since 2019 have brought an unprecedented sense of safety and security that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have long yearned for as they are now able to secure their lives , livelihoods and futures – safe from externally-induced violence and terror”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-situation-of-great-concern-uk-minister-101610605646407.html

The province has 16 active severe cases in hospitals. In a sign of the new wave spreading across the country, northeastern Heilongjiang declared an “emergency state” on Wednesday, telling its 37.5 million residents not to leave the province unless absolutely necessary and saying public gatherings would be cancelled.The death comes as China readies for the arrival of an expert team of scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO), who will start a politically sensitive investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.The team is expected to arrive in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, directly from Singapore on Thursday.Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO’s top expert on animal diseases that cross to other species who went to China on a preliminary mission last July, is leading the 10 independent experts, a WHO spokesperson said.Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese biologist and part of the 10-member team, told Reuters that he did not expect any restrictions on the group’s work in China, but cautioned against finding firm answers.Embarek said the group would start with a two-week quarantine at a hotel due to China’s border requirements.“And then after the two weeks, we would be able to move around and meet our Chinese counterparts in person and go to the different sites that we will want to visit,” he said.“The idea is to advance a number of studies that were already designed and decided upon some months ago to get us a better understanding of what happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-death-in-china-since-may-as-who-team-set-to-land-101610604866467.html

The U.S. Capitol that proved such a soft target last week was visible only through lines of tall, black fence.Also Read: Impeachment or the 14th Amendment: Can Trump be barred from future office?Two blocks from the White House, a group of uniformed National Guard troops emerged from a tour bus and headed into a hotel as a state of lockdown descended on Washington that will last through the Jan. 20 inauguration.“Clearly we are in uncharted waters,” said Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser.Last week’s “violent insurrection” at the Capitol by supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump has “impacted the way we are approaching working with our federal partners in planning for the 59th inauguration,” Bowser said Wednesday.The FBI has warned that armed protests by violent Trump supporters were being planned in all 50 state capitals as well as in Washington for the days leading up to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Between the pandemic and the security threat, Bowser is flat-out asking people not to come to the District of Columbia for the inauguration. And at Bowser’s request, a National Special Security Event declaration was moved up to Jan. 13, a distinction which she said "puts in place an entirely different command and control structure” for security.The NSSE status is normal for a presidential inauguration and other major events like an international summit or the Super Bowl. But it's rare to start the lockdown so far in advance of the event.Police vehicles sealed off a huge swath of downtown D.C. Wednesday, causing immediate traffic snarls. Starting Wednesday, Bowser said, anyone inside the inauguration perimeter might be stopped and questioned. Starting Friday, all parking garages in the downtown restricted zone will be sealed through the inauguration.Also Read: Now that Trump is impeached (again), what's next?Bowser is also being pushed to deny lodging options to potentially violent protesters. The local Black Lives Matter affiliate and Shutdown DC issued a joint statement Wednesday urging all downtown hotels to voluntarily close and pay their staffs. In addition to the threat of violence, the activist groups say Trump supporters are a threat to the health of hotel staff for their general refusal to wear facemasks amid the pandemic. Several downtown hotels, including one which had become a favorite hangout of the militant Proud Boy faction, chose to avoid trouble by closing last week.“Closing hotels completely for these six nights is the only way to guarantee the safety of hotel workers, neighbors, vulnerable and unhoused residents, incoming administration officials, members of Congress, and our democracy,” the statement said. “If hotels do not willingly close, we ask Mayor Bowser to extend today’s emergency order and close all hotels in the city.”On Wednesday, Airbnb announced it was cancelling all reservations in the Washington metro area. Bowser said she had been in regular contact with Airbnb officials since last week, but did not specifically request this step.“We are aware of reports emerging yesterday afternoon regarding armed militias and known hate groups that are attempting to travel and disrupt the Inauguration,” a company statement said. “We are continuing our work to ensure hate group members are not part of the Airbnb community.”On the ground, much of the most visible security will come in the form of more than 15,000 National Guardsmen from multiple states, some of them armed.According to officials, the number of Guardsmen who will actually be carrying guns will be limited. Some Guard members nearer the Capitol will have long guns, and others will have their sidearms.It is likely that those closer to the crowds or on fence lines won’t be armed, but those up closer to the building may be. National Guard members operate under strict rules of engagement on the use of force. But generally speaking, troops can use lethal force to protect the lives of others and themselves.Officials also said that while 15,000 Guard members have been activated, more may be called. D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee estimated Wednesday that more than 20,000 National Guardsmen would be active in the District of Columbia on Inauguration Day.Officials are continuing to review requests from law enforcement, and some believe several thousand more could be brought in. Defense and military officials have been calling governors and adjutants general to ask if they might have people they could send, if requested.So far, officials said state leaders have said that protecting their own capitols will be their top priority, but they still have some Guard members they will be able to send, if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expecting-trouble-washington-locks-down-a-week-before-biden-inauguration-101610603978789.html

Researchers at the institute are still studying whether it’s more easily spread and if it causes more severe illness, according to the newspaper.Since the onset of the pandemic, scientists at the institute have sequenced about 500 genomes, most of them collected during the second wave, according to the Nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-detect-covid-19-variant-unique-to-kenya-nation-says-101610603354074.html
14-01-2021||World||Vaccines and masks: Biden plan aims to break pandemic cycle||A coronavirus action plan being unveiled by President-elect Joe Biden centers on a mass vaccination campaign and closer coordination among all levels of government.The Biden plan comes as a divided nation remains caught in the grip of the pandemic’s most dangerous wave yet. So far, more than 380,000 Americans have died.Biden hopes his multidimensional strategy, expected to be detailed in a Thursday evening speech, will put the country on the path to recovery by the end of his first 100 days. “It’s going to be hard,” Biden said Monday after he got his second vaccine shot. “It’s not going to be easy. But we can get it done.”A more disciplined focus on vaccination is the new and widely anticipated game-changing element, but that's far from the whole story. Biden is asking Americans to override their sense of pandemic fatigue and recommit to wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding indoor gatherings, particularly larger ones. That's still the surest way to brake the Covid-19 wave, with more than 4,400 deaths reported just on Tuesday.Biden has also talked about asking Congress to pump more money to states, to help their efforts to contain the pandemic and replenish depleted coffers that pay for basic services. And Democratic lawmakers are eager to push for $2,000 economic stimulus payments to Americans.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Biden Covid-19 package will be the first order of business this year.But Biden's biggest challenge is to “win the hearts and minds of the American people to follow his lead,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.With the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration has delivered two highly effective vaccines and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation's vaccination campaign is off to a slow start with about 10.3 million people getting the first of two shots, although more than 29 million doses have been delivered.Biden aims to speed that up by delivering more vaccine and working closely with states and local communities to get shots into the arms of more people. The Trump administration provided the vaccine to states and set guidelines for who should get priority for shots, but largely left it up to state and local officials to organize their vaccination campaigns.“This is going to entail coordination at all levels, as well as resources,” said Dr. Nadine Gracia, executive vice president of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. “There is a commitment the (incoming) administration has articulated to address the needs of communities.”Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million shots in his first 100 days. The pace of vaccination is approaching 1 million shots a day, but it needs to be nearly double that to reach his mark.President Donald Trump repeatedly asserted the coronavirus would go away on its own. Early on, he said it would disappear with warmer weather, and later he said after the election. But Biden sees the pandemic on the level of an existential threat. "That’s my No. 1 concern, to get the virus under control," he said last week.At the pinnacle of power, Trump's leadership during the pandemic has been erratic. He did back “Operation Warp Speed ” to quickly develop vaccines and treatments, but he also picked fights with leading government scientists like Dr. Anthony Fauci and his own appointees at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Biden has pledged to take his lead from science, and has named Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as his top medical adviser. He has tapped businessman Jeff Zients, who has a reputation for successfully tackling complex missions, to coordinate the government's coronavirus response. He's also selected Yale medicine professor Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, to head an effort to ensure equity and fairness for racial and ethnic minorities in access to vaccines and treatments.But he'll need more than top-resume talent, experts say. It's still unclear how the new administration will address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, the doubts and suspicions that keep many people from getting a shot. Polls show it's particularly a problem among Black Americans. “It's important to acknowledge the reasons why it exists and work to earn trust and build vaccine confidence in communities,” said Gracia.Next Wednesday, when Biden will be sworn in as president, marks the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-and-masks-biden-plan-aims-to-break-pandemic-cycle-101610600868962.html
14-01-2021||World||Boris Johnson warns hospitals on the brink as UK deaths hit record||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned intensive care units could be overwhelmed as the country hit its highest daily coronavirus death toll since the pandemic began.The premier said there is a “very substantial” risk of intensive care capacity in hospitals being “over-topped,” and urged people to follow lockdown rules to curb the spread of the disease.The UK reported a further 1,564 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test Wednesday, the highest number in a single day. It brings the total British death toll so far to 84,767.“We’re in for a pretty grim period, I’m afraid,” UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said on ITV’s “Peston.” “We’re in a period of high death numbers that’s going to carry on for some weeks.”England is currently in the second week of its third national lockdown amid a sharp rise in infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks. Schools are closed to most pupils, restaurants and non-essential shops shuttered, and people ordered to stay at home.The closures threaten to tip the economy into a double dip recession, prompting the government to hand out billions of pounds in additional aid to businesses.Despite the lockdown, Johnson’s government has faced calls to go further amid concerns the current rules are not working. Medical services are under intense pressure to treat an influx of patients, with more than 36,000 people in the hospital with the virus, according to the latest data, including almost 3,500 on ventilators.Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said there have “now been more deaths in the second wave than the first.”Johnson told a panel of lawmakers on Wednesday there are 70% more inpatients than at the peak of the pandemic in April.“The risk is very substantial, and we have to keep the pressure off the NHS,” he said when pressed on intensive care capacity. “The only way to do that is follow the current lockdown.”There are signs the national lockdown is working, he said, with a “flattening, leveling off” of cases in some areas -- but it is “far, far too early” to say lockdown rules could be relaxed in mid-February as initially planned.A new strain of the disease from Brazil is a cause for concern and the government is looking at measures to prevent it being imported into the UK, Johnson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-warns-hospitals-on-the-brink-as-uk-deaths-hit-record-101610600599982.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump considering lawyer John Eastman for impeachment defense: Reports||President Donald Trump may hire a law professor who spoke at his rally before the riot at the U.S. Capitol to help defend him in an impeachment trial over a charge that he incited the violence, according to two people familiar with the matter.John Eastman, who joined Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani on stage at the Jan. 6 rally, is being considered for a role on Trump's defense team, the people said.Giuliani, 76, who told the crowd they should engage in "trial by combat," may lead the impeachment defense, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing a source. Giuliani has not responded to requests for comment.Eastman, 60, who made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud at the rally, would neither confirm nor deny whether he will represent Trump, citing attorney-client privilege.Asked whether he would be willing, Eastman said: "If the President of the United States asked me to consider helping him, I would certainly give it consideration."The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Eastman and has declined to comment on Giuliani.The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday made Trump the first U.S. president to be impeached twice, charging him with inciting an insurrection as lawmakers sought to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election.A former clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Eastman represented Trump last month in unsuccessful challenges to the election.At the rally, Eastman, who until Wednesday was a professor at Chapman University in California, spoke about "secret folders" of ballots used to defraud the election before Trump took the stage and repeated the discredited claim that the election was stolen from him.Faculty members and students, among others, subsequently called for Chapman to fire Eastman. In a statement on Wednesday, the university president said an agreement had been reached under which Eastman would immediately retire from Chapman.Eastman told Reuters he did not believe he did anything wrong. He does not think Trump has culpability, either. "None, whatsoever," he said.Eastman came under fire last summer for an op-ed he wrote in Newsweek that questioned whether Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was eligible to serve because her parents were not U.S. citizens or permanent residents.Newsweek later apologized for publishing the piece.Trump may have a tough time retaining legal talent. He has had trouble hiring lawyers since former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the widespread condemnation of the violence at the Capitol and pressure from anti-Trump groups may discourage others from signing up.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House in 2019 on charges that he pressured Ukraine's president to announce an investigation of his rival Biden, but was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February 2020.Giuliani’s own pressure on Ukraine helped lead to Trump’s impeachment trial.White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who helped lead the defense effort during the impeachment over Ukraine, is not expected to participate in the latest effort, according to one person familiar with the matter. Cipollone will leave his post on Jan. 20, when Biden becomes president.Jay Sekulow, another personal lawyer for Trump who played a role during the first impeachment, also is not expected to be involved.John Yoo, a conservative legal scholar who also clerked for Thomas and worked in the Department of Justice during the George W. Bush administration, said on Wednesday he did not think Trump would want him to represent him."I think he committed impeachable acts," said Yoo, although he added that he thought incitement was the wrong grounds and "the Senate should not convict him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-considering-lawyer-john-eastman-for-impeachment-defense-reports-101610601826484.html
14-01-2021||World||Mitch McConnell open to convicting Donald Trump in impeachment trial||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pointedly did not rule out that he might eventually vote to convict the now twice-impeached President Donald Trump, but he also blocked a quick Senate impeachment trial.Minutes after the House voted 232-197 on Wednesday to impeach Trump, McConnell said in a letter to his GOP colleagues that he’s not determined whether Trump should be convicted in the Senate's upcoming proceedings. The House impeachment articles charge that Trump incited insurrection by exhorting supporters who violently attacked the Capitol last week, resulting in five deaths and a disruption of Congress.“I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate,” McConnell wrote.McConnell's openness was a stark contrast to the support, or at times silence, he’s shown during much of Trump’s presidency, and to the opposition he expressed rapidly when the House impeached Trump 13 months ago. McConnell will be Washington’s most powerful Republican once Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated, and McConnell’s increasingly chilly view of Trump could make it easier for other GOP lawmakers to turn against him.McConnell’s burgeoning alienation from Trump, plus the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him, underscored how the GOP’s long, reflexive support and condoning of Trump’s actions was eroding.McConnell also issued a statement saying Congress and the government should spend the next week “completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power” to Biden. He suggested Trump's Senate trial would begin no earlier than Jan. 19 — in effect rejecting a drive by the chamber's Democrats to begin the proceedings immediately so Trump could be ousted from office.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that unless McConnell reverses himself and agrees to quickly start the trial, it would begin after Jan. 19. That's a day before Biden is inaugurated as president and about the time Democrats take over majority control of the Senate. The timetable essentially means McConnell is dropping the trial into Democrats' laps.“Make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate," Schumer said. He added, “If the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again."The Constitution requires a two-thirds majority to convict a president, meaning at least 17 Republicans would need to join all 50 Democrats to oust Trump. If Trump were convicted, it would take only a simple majority of the Senate to prohibit Trump, who's mentioned running again in 2024, from holding federal office again.Earlier Wednesday, a GOP strategist said McConnell has told people he thinks Trump perpetrated impeachable offenses. McConnell also saw House Democrats’ drive to impeach Trump as an opportune moment to distance the GOP from the tumultuous, divisive outgoing president, according to the strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.McConnell's views were first reported by The New York Times.McConnell spoke to major Republican donors last weekend to assess their thinking about Trump and was told that they believed Trump had clearly crossed a line, the strategist said. McConnell told them he was finished with Trump, according to the consultant.The Democratic-led House approved an impeachment article accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, an unprecedented second impeachment of his clamorous presidency. Trump exhorted a throng of his followers to march on the Capitol last Wednesday, where they disrupted Congress' formal certification of Biden's win in a deadly riot that produced widespread damage.McConnell is looking out for his party’s long-term future, but moving toward a political divorce from Trump could mean that congressional Republicans will face challenges in GOP primaries.It is unclear how many Republicans would vote to convict Trump in a Senate trial, but it appears plausible that several would.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, on Wednesday told Alaska's News Source, an Anchorage news outlet, that Trump “has committed an impeachable offense." She stopped short of saying if she'd vote to convict him.Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., has said he would “definitely consider” House impeachment articles.Complicating GOP thinking about Trump’s second impeachment is that Republicans will be defending 20 of the 34 Senate seats up for election in 2022. Thanks to Democratic victories this month in two Georgia runoffs, Democrats are about to take control of the chamber by 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.Speaking out against impeachment Wednesday was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. A once-bitter Trump foe, Graham became one of his closest allies during his presidency, then lambasted him over last week's Capitol invasion but has since spent time with Trump.Impeaching Trump now would “do great damage to the institutions of government and could invite further violence," Graham said in a statement. He said Trump's millions of backers “should not be demonized because of the despicable actions of a seditious mob," but he did not specifically defend Trump's actions last week.“If there was a time for America’s political leaders to bend a knee and ask for God’s counsel and guidance, it is now. The most important thing for leaders to do in times of crisis is to make things better, not worse," Graham said.When the Senate voted against removing Trump in February after the House impeached him for pressuring Ukraine to provide political dirt on Biden, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was the only Republican who cast a vote to oust him.Trump has falsely insisted that November’s presidential election was stolen from him by fraud. Those allegations have been rejected by state officials of both parties, state and federal courts and members of his own administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-open-to-convicting-donald-trump-in-impeachment-trial-101610601547171.html

Seeing our City in so much pain breaks my heart.”In the video, released on Twitter, he put forth an agenda that included a guaranteed minimum income, bringing universal high-speed Internet, starting a “people’s bank,” and reopening New York City “intelligently” from the pandemic.Yang joins more than two dozen people running for the seat, including Ray McGuire, the former vice chairman of Citigroup Inc.; Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams, city Comptroller Scott Stringer and former US Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan. Incumbent Mayor Bill de Blasio is prevented by term limits from running again. Some initial polling shows Yang will start as one of the early frontrunners in the race.Born in Schenectady, New York, to immigrants from Taiwan, Yang worked for several startups before becoming chief executive officer of a Manhattan test-preparation company that was sold to Kaplan Inc. in 2009. In 2017, he declared his run for president.Yang built his presidential campaign on a promise of $1,000 a month in universal basic income to every adult, with a tax on tech companies. He ended his bid in February 2020, but a longer-than-expected run throughout the Democratic primaries brought him a national platform that he used to campaign for President-Elect Joe Biden and Democrats who took control of the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/andrew-yang-officially-announces-candidacy-for-nyc-mayor-101610600579022.html

14-01-2021||World||WHO team lands in Wuhan to search for pandemic origins, quarantined for 2 weeks||A global team of researchers arrived Thursday in the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic was first detected to conduct a politically sensitive investigation into its origins amid uncertainty about whether Beijing might try to prevent embarrassing discoveries.The 10-member team sent to Wuhan by the World Health Organization was approved by President Xi Jinping's government after months of diplomatic wrangling that prompted an unusual public complaint by the head of the WHO. They arrived Thursday, state media CGTN reported on Thursday.Scientists suspect the virus that has killed 1.9 million people since late 2019 jumped to humans from bats or other animals, most likely in China's southwest. The ruling Communist Party, stung by complaints it allowed the disease to spread, says the virus came from abroad, possibly on imported seafood, but scientists reject that.The WHO team includes virus and other experts from the United States, Australia, Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia, the Netherlands, Qatar and Vietnam.A government spokesman said this week they will “exchange views” with Chinese scientists but gave no indication whether they would be allowed to gather evidence.They will undergo a two-week quarantine as well as a throat swab test and an antibody test for Covid-19, according to a post on CGTN’s official Weibo account. They are to start working with Chinese experts via video conference while in quarantine.China rejected demands for an international investigation after the Trump administration blamed Beijing for the virus's spread, which plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s.After Australia called in April for an independent inquiry, Beijing retaliated by blocking imports of Australian beef, wine and other goods.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan, one of the WHO team members, zoologist Peter Daszak of the U.S. group EcoHealth Alliance, told the Associated Press in November.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus's origins; pinning down an outbreak's animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.“The government should be very transparent and collaborative," said Shin-Ru Shih, director at the Research Center for Emerging Viral Infections at Taiwan's Chang Gung University.The Chinese government has tried to stir confusion about the virus's origin. It has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of tainted seafood, a notion rejected by international scientists and agencies."The WHO will need to conduct similar investigations in other places,” an official of the National Health Commission, Mi Feng, said Wednesday.Some of the WHO team were en route to China a week ago but had to turn back after Beijing announced they hadn't received valid visas.That might have been a “bureaucratic bungle,” but the incident "raises the question if the Chinese authorities were trying to interfere,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a health expert at the University of Sydney.A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the city where the outbreak began. One of China's top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.According to WHO's published agenda for its origins research, there are no plans to assess whether there might have been an accidental release of the coronavirus at the Wuhan lab, as some American politicians, including President Donald Trump, have claimed.A “scientific audit” of Institute records and safety measures would be a “routine activity,” said Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. He said that depends on how willing Chinese authorities are to share information.“There’s a big element of trust here,” Woolhouse said.An AP investigation found the government imposed controls on research into the outbreak and bars scientists from speaking to reporters.The coronavirus's exact origin may never be traced because viruses change quickly, said Woolhouse.Although it may be challenging to find precisely the same Covid-19 virus in animals as in humans, discovering closely related viruses might help explain how the disease first jumped from animals and clarify what preventive measures are needed to avoid future epidemics.Scientists should focus instead on making a “comprehensive picture” of the virus to help respond to future outbreaks, Woolhouse said.“Now is not the time to blame anyone," Shih said. “We shouldn’t say, it’s your fault.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-lands-in-wuhan-to-search-for-pandemic-origins-quarantined-for-2-weeks-101610597639838.html

14-01-2021||World||Now that Trump is impeached (again), what's next?||The US House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump on Wednesday for a second time -- just days before he is scheduled to leave office -- raising questions about what happens next.The House voted 232-197 to impeach the president, with 10 members of Trump's Republican Party joining 222 Democrats.Here are some of the possible scenarios after the House impeached Trump for inciting last week's attack by his supporters on the US Capitol as Congress certified Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory:- Senate trial -Now that Trump has been impeached, it is up to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to submit the article of impeachment to the Senate at a time of her choosing.The Senate would then hold a trial.That's what happened last year after Trump was impeached in 2019 by the Democratic-controlled House for pressuring the leader of Ukraine to dig up political dirt on Biden.Trump was acquitted by the Republican-majority Senate in February 2020.This time, however, Trump has only a week left in the White House and Biden is to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on January 20.The Senate is currently in recess and is not scheduled to return until January 19.Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could call the Senate back early and hold an emergency session -- but McConnell ruled that out.Even if the Senate did move "promptly," there is no way it could conduct a trial before Biden is inaugurated and Trump leaves office, McConnell said in a statement."Given the rules, procedures, and Senate precedents that govern presidential impeachment trials, there is simply no chance that a fair or serious trial could conclude before President-elect Biden is sworn in next week," he said.McConnell noted that the three previous presidential impeachment trials had lasted 83 days, 37 days, and 21 days.Schumer, in a statement welcoming Trump's impeachment by the House, said that regardless of when it starts "make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate.""Donald Trump has deservedly become the first president in American history to bear the stain of impeachment twice over," Schumer said. "The Senate is required to act and will proceed with his trial and hold a vote on his conviction."- Post-presidency trial? -While three US presidents have been impeached, none has ever been tried by the Senate after leaving office.All three previous presidential impeachments -- those of Trump and presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton -- occurred while the leaders were still in the White House.Like Trump, both Johnson -- in 1868 -- and Clinton -- in 1998-99 -- were impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.Some constitutional scholars argue that an ex-president cannot be tried by the Senate.But the House has impeached and the Senate has tried former senators and judges after they were no longer in office or on the bench.If a trial begins after January 20, Republicans would no longer hold a majority in the Senate and Schumer would be the majority leader.While no longer in control of the Senate, McConnell would continue to have a powerful voice among his Republican colleagues and he has not ruled out convicting Trump."While the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate," McConnell said.The Republican senator from Kentucky thwarted the last bid to convict Trump in the Senate, managing to rally all Republican senators with the exception of Mitt Romney of Utah to vote for acquittal.But McConnell believes Trump did commit impeachable offenses, according to press reports, and sees an opportunity to rid the Republican Party of the real estate tycoon once and for all.A two-thirds majority of the senators present is needed to convict the president, meaning that if all of them are in the chamber at least 17 Republicans would have to join Democrats in voting for conviction.Schumer said the Senate will not only vote on convicting Trump for "high crimes and misdemeanors" but will also hold a vote that could bar him from running again for federal office.Trump has expressed interest in potentially running for president again in 2024 and a simple majority vote of the Senate could bar him from another White House run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-that-trump-is-impeached-again-what-s-next-101610589744201.html
14-01-2021||World||Armed guards, fences: Washington under heavy security as Donald Trump impeached||Downtown Washington was fenced off and boarded up Wednesday, with concrete barriers blocking avenues, police at street corners, and armed National Guard soldiers patrolling Capitol Hill as Congress impeached President Donald Trump for a second time.The city at the heart of US democracy has been a shadow of itself during pandemic shutdowns, but now it is also under heavy guard after the January 6 deadly attack by Trump supporters on the Congress building.Also Read: US House convenes to impeach Donald Trump for his role in Capitol assaultNational Guard soldiers in body armor and camouflage spent the night inside the Capitol, their black rifles leaning against the polished stone walls of the building's halls.Some 20,000 National Guard soldiers are expected in Washington for Biden's inauguration, more than the combined number of US troops officially deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.Lawmakers on Wednesday formally accused Trump of inciting the mob that attacked the Capitol last week in a failed effort to stop Congress from finalizing the president's November loss to Joe Biden.The House voted 232-197 to impeach the president, with 10 members of Trump's Republican Party joining 222 Democrats.The Capitol building grounds are ringed by a security fence erected after the attack, similar to the one raised around the White House months ago when protests erupted nationwide against police killings of African Americans.The US capital, known for its historical monuments, museums and crowds of tourists, has had a rough ride over the past 12 months.'Ghost of itself' Navigating the once humming downtown on foot, it is difficult to tell which buildings have been shuttered by the pandemic and which simply shut up shop due to the violent protests the city has been seeing."This is my first time (in downtown Washington) in a year. There's usually people walking all over the place. This is very, very quiet. I almost think it's like a ghost of itself," said Jaime, a mother from Maryland who did not wish to give her full name.Also Read: Move to impeach continuation of greatest witch hunt in political history: TrumpHordes of schoolchildren who normally travel from all over the country to visit museums and see the White House now stay away, as do most foreign tourists.The hectic jostle of politicians, lobbyists and lawyers on the street has also fallen quiet, while the large metro stations that bring workers in from suburbs are quiet and little-used.The city of more than 700,000 inhabitants is subdued, one week before the inauguration of Biden on the steps of the Capitol."The city is basically desolate," said Nadine Seiler, 55, who has been demonstrating every day since the end of October near the White House in favor of anti-racist causes."Usually it's very stressful, but here it's like everybody's away on vacation," she added.As in many Western cities, many workers have been signing in from home -- especially staff at big institutions headquartered in Washington such as the World Bank and the IMF, as well as the countless government agencies.Eateries must try to survive by erecting tents and marquees along sidewalks, and tempting customers to sit down next to heaters of varying efficiency battling the winter cold."I went to the Christmas market... that's gone, all that's gone. You go into bars, (previously) packed bars -- it's gone," laments Timothy Bartholomew, a resident of Arlington, just over the Potomac River in neighboring Virginia.Violent protestsAccording to the specialist site Eater, nearly 70 restaurants have permanently closed in Washington since the start of the pandemic, and many others are boarded up with no certainty they will ever reopen.Violent protests and unrest have shaken Washington repeatedly in the last year.After the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis in May, Washington became one of the hotspots of nationwide anti-racist demonstrations.City authorities painted huge yellow letters reading "Black Lives Matter" across a wide street outside the White House, and the location became a popular site for rallies.But over the months, clashes between anti-racism activists and pro-Trump protesters have brought an edge of tension to the city.Roads and sidewalks have been gradually shut down around the White House, with the security cordon now holding people far back from Trump's residence.Police patrol vehicles keep their flashing lights on at all times and block streets normally streaming with traffic, while high metal fences surround many government buildings such as the US Treasury.Crowds cheering Biden's inauguration on January 20 will be thin on the ground, as authorities have urged Americans to avoid the city, fearing more violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-guards-fences-washington-under-heavy-security-as-donald-trump-impeached-101610589435397.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump urges no more violence as his impeachment looms in House||President Donald Trump called for no more violence or vandalism ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration after inciting a deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol last week.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” Trump said in a statement on Wednesday. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Trump issued the statement ahead of an impeachment vote Wednesday afternoon in the House of Representatives. He continues to face bans across social media sites for stoking the mob that stormed the Capitol last week, leaving at least five dead.Trump rebuffed calls for him to resign, and Vice President Mike Pence has said he won’t force him out. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate wouldn’t return early from recess, all but guaranteeing that any impeachment trial will take place after Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration.Before the attack, Trump delivered a speech to his supporters gathered near the White House in which he repeated falsehoods about vote fraud and then urged them to march to the Capitol and “fight much harder” to ensure he remained president.Trump called for peace after last Wednesday’s riot but never accepted responsibility for the attack, describing his remarks as “totally appropriate.” He acknowledged a “new administration” would take office on Jan. 20 but didn’t concede that he lost the November election, which he has baselessly claimed was tainted by fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-urges-no-more-violence-as-his-impeachment-looms-in-house-101610589080919.html
14-01-2021||World||Trump confronts political future with burden of historic rebuke||Donald Trump’s political future suffered a grave blow on Wednesday after the House impeached him for a second time, an unprecedented rebuke that may result in the White House doors being forever shut to him.Ten Republicans crossed the aisle to join all House Democrats in declaring that Trump deserved removal from office for inciting an insurrection, offering a withering coda to the president’s inglorious fall.Unable to manage the coronavirus pandemic and persuade voters to return him to the White House, the president instead inspired a violent and conspiracy-fueled attack on the seat of American democracy.The backlash against Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has been swift, creating an unprecedented test of the vise-like grip he’s held on his party since his 2016 political ascendance. The Capitol riot the president helped incite sparked a wave of resignations across the administration, led to the president’s banishment from Twitter, and prompted corporate leaders to suspend donations to Republicans who peddled false allegations of widespread voter fraud.The Senate now must hold its second impeachment trial of Trump, likely after he’s already left office. A post-presidential conviction could bar Trump from ever seeking federal office again.While few Republican senators have said where they stand on the matter, the GOP leader, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell, left open the possibility he’ll vote to convict in a letter to colleagues on Wednesday.Regardless of the outcome, the events of the past week have shaken the pillars of American politics and point to a fraught road ahead for the Republican party.Trump’s impeachment will undoubtedly cement his status as a martyr among his most loyal followers, who have cast the move as the latest effort by Washington to attack and undermine an outsider who threatened the status quo. But several Republicans, including Representatives Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger and John Katko, spoke out forcefully against Trump’s actions and voted to impeach.“This is a vote of conscience,” Cheney said Wednesday. “It’s one where there are different views in our conference. But our nation is facing an unprecedented, since the Civil War, constitutional crisis. That’s what we need to be focused on.”Some members of the party, though, tried to have it both ways. Loath to defend Trump’s actions, they instead argued that impeachment undermined President-elect Joe Biden’s call for the country to unify in the aftermath of a presidency that has worn the nation thin. Trump was impeached by a 232-197 vote.‘Tremendous Anger’Trump, for his part, has maintained the same vaguely threatening posture that helped foment the crisis in the first place. On Tuesday, he blamed the media and Democrats for “a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics.”“I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country and it’s causing tremendous anger,” he said.He issued a statement Wednesday, as the House debated impeachment, that called for peace.“In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind,” he said. “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for.”But the violent riot has tested the loyalty of some of Trump’s longtime enablers and allies. He alienated Mike Pence by tweeting that the vice president “didn’t have the courage” to illegally declare Trump the winner of an election he had lost, further inflaming his supporters before the riot.Pence, in the Capitol at the time presiding over the congressional count of Electoral College votes, had to flee the mob with other lawmakers.Several top administration officials canceled international travel or cut trips short this week out of concern that foreign adversaries might seek to exploit the U.S. political crisis and a White House under strain.Trump’s attention will now turn to minimizing fallout from the impeachment vote on any possible second act in political life, while attempting to paint the consequences for his role instigating the riot as overblown and unfair.His most immediate concern may be whipping support in the Senate, which needs a two-thirds vote to convict. More than a dozen Republicans would need to join Democrats to remove him from office. While Trump’s electoral loss and subsequent behavior has eroded his standing with many in the party, only one GOP senator -- Utah’s Mitt Romney -- voted to convict during Trump’s first impeachment trial less than a year ago.Even out of office, Senate conviction would be more than an embarrassment for the president. He would go down in history as the only president ever impeached and convicted, and senators could subsequently move to disqualify Trump from seeking federal office ever again, a measure requiring only a simple majority vote.And fighting conviction could prove financially costly to Trump as well. Since he won’t be president, he won’t have a taxpayer-funded White House counsel’s office to defend him.He already faces mounting financial pressure. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will cancel some $17 million in contracts with the president’s company, Trump Organization, including deals to operate skating rinks and a golf course. Stripe Inc. said earlier this week it would halt payment processing for Trump’s campaign.And investigators for New York’s attorney general continue to examine Trump’s tax records and whether he broke the law by making hush-money payments to women who claimed he’d had affairs with them before his election.Impeachment could also mean the loss of pensions for the president and first lady Melania Trump, as well as federal funds for a post-presidential office and staff, though legal opinions are split on the matter.Trump’s FutureSeparately, the president will try desperately to frame the impeachment effort within a broader narrative of persecution and grievance that he’s channeled throughout his presidency.It worked before, when his approval ratings rebounded in the aftermath of the special counsel investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties with Russia, and after the Senate failed to convict him following his impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to launch an investigation into Biden and his son.But Trump’s role in the riot -- which broke out shortly after he encouraged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight much harder” against his political opponents -- is less complicated. Just 33% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of his job in a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday.And the mob scene at the Capitol only exacerbated perceptions Trump had become politically toxic. Not only was the president unable to win re-election, but GOP control of the Senate evaporated when two incumbent Republicans in Georgia lost despite the president campaigning on their behalf -- all before the chaos unfolded in the halls of Congress.Trump will hope once again to defy expectations by operating outside the mainstream, though his options may prove dwindling. Fringe conservative cable channels have found themselves under threat of legal action for echoing the Trump campaign’s allegations about rigged voting machines, while Cumulus Media told conservative talk radio hosts to stop suggesting the election had been stolen, according to Inside Music Media.And Trump’s role in the riot cost him his most important megaphone, his @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, now permanently suspended.Trump has already said he is considering launching his own alternative social media network in the wake of his ban and on Wednesday sought to place his troubles with technology companies within a broader conservative narrative alleging discrimination and persecution.“They shouldn’t be doing it,” Trump said. “But there’s always a counter move when they do that.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-confronts-political-future-with-burden-of-historic-rebuke-101610586380559.html
14-01-2021||World||Covid-19 infection gives some immunity for at least five months, UK study finds||People who have had Covid-19 are highly likely to have immunity to it for at least five months but there is evidence that those with antibodies may still be able to carry and spread the virus, a UK study of healthcare workers has found.Preliminary findings by scientists at Public Health England (PHE) showed that reinfections in people who have Covid-19 antibodies from a past infection are rare - with only 44 cases found among 6,614 previously infected people in the study.But experts cautioned that the findings mean people who contracted the disease in the first wave of the pandemic in the early months of 2020 may now be vulnerable to catching it again.They also warned that people with so-called "natural immunity" - acquired through having had the infection - may still be able carry the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in their nose and throat, and could unwittingly pass it on.“We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts," said Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and co-leader of the study, whose findings were published on Thursday.“This means even if you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others."A statement on the study said its findings did not address antibody or other immune responses to vaccines now being rolled out against Covid-19, or on how effective vaccines would be. Vaccine responses will be considered later this year, it said.The research, known as the SIREN study, involves tens of thousands of healthcare workers in Britain who have been tested regularly since June for new Covid-19 infections as well as for the presence of antibodies.Between June 18 and Nov. 24 scientists detected 44 potential reinfections - two "probable" and 42 "possible" - out of 6,614 participants who had tested positive for antibodies. This represents an 83% rate of protection from reinfection, they said.The researchers plan to continue following and assessing the participants to see if this natural immunity might last longer than five months in some. But they warned that early evidence from the next stage of the study already suggests some people with immunity can still carry high levels of virus and could transmit it to others."It is therefore crucial that everyone continues to follow the rules and stays at home, even if they have previously had Covid-19," they said in the statement about their results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-infection-gives-some-immunity-for-at-least-five-months-uk-study-finds-101610587612065.html
14-01-2021||World||Impeachment or the 14th Amendment: Can Trump be barred from future office?||Some U.S. lawmakers have said President Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding political office again following his impeachment on Wednesday for inciting a mob that stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying President-elect Joe Biden's victory.Now that the House has impeached Trump, the Senate will hold a trial on whether to remove him and possibly bar him from future office.Legal experts said disqualification could be accomplished through the impeachment proceedings or the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Here is how the disqualification effort could play out.CAN TRUMP'S DISQUALIFICATION BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH IMPEACHMENT?   The U.S. Constitution says there are two ways to punish an impeached official: removal from office or “disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States."The House approved a single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting insurrection when he delivered an incendiary speech to supporters shortly before the pro-Trump mob rampaged the Capitol.Trump is likely to argue at trial that his remarks were free speech protected by the Constitution's First Amendment and that, while he told supporters to "fight," he did not intend it as a literal call to violence.Removing an official requires a "conviction" by a two-thirds Senate majority under the Constitution. Under precedent, only a simple majority is needed for disqualification. Historically, that vote only happens after a conviction.Three federal officials in U.S. history have been disqualified through impeachment proceedings. All three were federal judges.Most recently, in 2010 the Senate removed and disqualified from future office a Louisiana judge found to have engaged in corruption.There is some debate over the scope of the disqualification clause and whether it applies to the presidency, said Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University.Analyzing historical documents, some law experts say the founders did not intend the presidency to be considered an "office" under the disqualification clause, while others argue that the term applies.CAN TRUMP BE DISQUALIFIED IF HE IS NOT CONVICTED BY THE SENATE?This is uncharted legal territory, and there is no clear answer, scholars said.Paul Campos, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Colorado, said he believed a vote to disqualify Trump can be held even if there are not enough votes for conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that the Senate has wide latitude to determine how it conducts a trial, he said.But Kalt said he thought disqualification would require conviction first. To do otherwise would be the equivalent of punishing the president for an offense he did not commit, Kalt said.All three judges who were disqualified from office were first convicted.WHAT ABOUT THE 14TH AMENDMENT?Section 3 of the 14th Amendment provides an alternative path for disqualification.The provision states that no person shall hold office if they have engaged in "insurrection or rebellion" against the United States. It was enacted following the Civil War to bar Confederates from holding public office.Under congressional precedent, only a simple majority of both chambers is needed to invoke this penalty. Congress can later remove the disqualification, but only if two-thirds of both houses vote in favor of doing so.In 1919, Congress used the 14th Amendment to block an elected official, Victor Berger, from assuming his seat in the House because he had actively opposed U.S. intervention in World War I.The text of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not explain how it should be invoked.Another section the 14th Amendment, Section 5, empowers Congress to enforce the entire amendment through "appropriate legislation.” Some scholars have interpreted this language to mean that a majority of both chambers of Congress could enact a law applying a ban to a particular president, like Trump."The 14th Amendment route is very unclear as to what it would take to get it rolling," said Kalt. "I think it would require some combination of legislation and litigation."COULD TRUMP CHALLENGE A DISQUALIFICATION IN COURT?It is certainly possible, said Kalt.A Supreme Court case from 1993 makes clear that the court is wary of second-guessing how the Senate handles impeachment. In that case, involving an accused judge, the court said whether the Senate had properly tried an impeachment was a political question and could not be litigated.If Trump is disqualified, the current Supreme Court might want to clarify whether the move was lawful, Kalt said.Trump appointed three of the Supreme Court's nine members: Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and most recently Amy Coney Barrett. The court now has a six-judge conservative majority."If you are going to say someone can't run, you want to get that litigated and settled sooner rather than later," Kalt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impeachment-or-the-14th-amendment-can-trump-be-barred-from-future-office-101610587186543.html
14-01-2021||World||Twitter CEO breaks silence on ban on Trump, says he doesn't feel proud||For the first time after imposing a permanent ban on US outgoing president Donald Trump, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey broke his silence on the contentious move and said that he was not proud of the action as it has been a failure of the microblogging site to promote healthy conversation. But it was the right decision for Twitter, he said.Defending the decision, Jack wrote that the action was taken only after a clear warning and the decision was made with the best information on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter.Also Read: Twitter permanently suspends Donald Trump's accountBut now that the action of the tech company has triggered a debate over freedom of expression, he took it on himself to explain why it was the right decision.Here is what he said in his statement."I do not celebrate or feel pride in our having to ban @realDonaldTrump from Twitter, or how we got here. After a clear warning, we’d take this action, we made a decision with the best information we had based on threats to physical safety both on and off Twitter. Was this correct?"I believe this was the right decision for Twitter. We faced an extraordinary and untenable circumstance, forcing us to focus all of our actions on public safety. Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all. That said, having to ban an account has real and significant ramifications. While there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation. And a time for us to reflect on our operations and the environment around us."Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation. They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation. The check and accountability on this power has always been the fact that a service like Twitter is one small part of the larger public conversation happening across the internet. If folks do not agree with our rules and enforcement, they can simply go to another internet service. This concept was challenged last week when a number of foundational internet tool providers also decided not to host what they found dangerous. I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others."This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term, it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same. Yes, we all need to look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement. Yes, we need to look at how our service might incentivize distraction and harm. Yes, we need more transparency in our moderation operations. All this can’t erode a free and open global internet.Also Read: Twitter suspends Trump's campaign account @TeamTrump for violating its rules"The reason I have so much passion for #Bitcoin is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be. We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it @bluesky."This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists. No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency. It’s important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world. Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth. I believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this. I also recognize it does not feel that way today. Everything we learn in this moment will better our effort, and push us to be what we are: one humanity working together."Twitter, the San Francisco-based company, first suspended Donald Trump's account after he posted tweets misleading users about the presidential election results, which apparently encouraged the mob violence at US Capitol. After his account was restored, he tweeted that he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration which Twitter said violated the company's policies when "read in the context of broader events in the country".It was then that Twitter decided to ban Trump completely on the platform citing "risk of further incitement of violence".The action evoked strong reaction from other world leaders most of whom concurred that social media platforms should be accountable.United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said private social media companies make their own moderation decisions, but they should be accountable.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reservations about the way Donald Trump's Twitter account was suspended, her spokesman said, adding that legislators, not private companies, should decide on any necessary curbs to free expression.Addressing these concerns, Jack in his statement endorsed the way Bitcoin functions — a technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity.Twitter's 'BlueSky' initiative may lead Twitter to a Bitcoin-like operation, Jack said. In 2019, Jack first talked about 'Blue Sky' which is aimed at developing an open and decentralised standard for social media. Twitter is in the process of interviewing and hiring people for Blue Sky, he said in his statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-breaks-silence-on-ban-on-trump-says-he-doesn-t-feel-proud-101610586309067.html
14-01-2021||World||Biden Inauguration Day: Agencies gear up to prevent repeat of US Capitol chaos||Overwhelmed during the deadly attack on Congress by President Donald Trump's supporters last week, U.S. security forces are mounting a national operation to thwart any violence before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.Federal and state officials are evaluating online threats and menacing messages to members of Congress and making sure the security operation has the force to repel an attack.The incoming Biden administration has significantly ramped up security around his team ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration.The riot at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6 forced lawmakers to flee the inner chambers of the building, fearing for their lives.One police officer and four protesters died in the siege, which began after Trump called on thousands of supporters to march on Congress in a bid to stop the final certification of Biden's election victory.Trump, who falsely claims he lost the election because of fraud, faced impeachment in the House of Representatives on Wednesday for encouraging his supporters to march on Congress. He has also faced growing calls to resign.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned that armed protests in support of Trump were planned for Washington and all 50 U.S. state capitals this weekend or around Biden's inauguration.Local officials have been ramping up security, especially in the battleground states where Biden narrowly beat Trump."It is clear that more must be done to preempt, penetrate, and prevent deadly and seditious assaults by domestic violent extremists in the days ahead," two senior House Democrats, Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff, said in a statement on Tuesday.The biggest single security operation is in Washington, where Biden will be sworn in outside the Capitol next Wednesday.Some 20,000 National Guard troops will be available for Biden's inauguration, and half of those will be in the city by Saturday in case protests explode this weekend.National Guard troops were assigned to provide 24-hour security inside the halls of Congress and deputized as Capitol Police officers, enabling them to make arrests.The National Park Service has closed the Washington Monument through Jan. 24, and home-sharing company Airbnb said it was blocking and cancelling all reservations in the Washington area to discourage protesters from descending on the capital.In Wisconsin, Governor Tony Evers authorized National Guard troops to support security efforts in the state capital of Madison. Georgia's top court canceled all in-person proceedings on Jan. 19 and Jan. 20 as a precaution."While individual state capitals have been subject to threats and actual violence across the years, the current environment is unique at least since the weeks following Sept. 11, 2001," said James Nash, spokesman for the bipartisan National Governors Association.FAR-RIGHT PLANS UNCLEARConflicting messages have surfaced in far-right chat rooms and forums about possible protests around Biden's inauguration.The website of Patriot Action for America, which was recently taken down, called for supporters to encircle the White House, Congress and Supreme Court days before "to, at all costs, prevent Joseph Biden, or any other democrat from being inaugurated."An image posted to the pro-Trump website The Donald called for protesters to "stand up for liberty" with armed marches on Jan. 17 at the U.S. Capitol and in state capitals, according to SITE Intelligence Group, a Maryland-based organization that tracks extremists.But users on some other far-right forums cautioned people not to attend the events, which they warned might be part of a plot to ensnare them.Trump has defended his Jan. 6 speech to supporters before they marched to Congress as "totally appropriate," but he had a different message on Wednesday as public criticism from his fellow Republicans grew."In light of reports of more demonstrations, I urge that there must be NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind," Trump said in a statement.Acting U.S. Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli on Tuesday appeared to downplay the threat at state capitols."There's a lot of statements out there. And while we need to take them seriously, at the same time it would be an incredible unlikelihood to see what is described in those threats actually take place," Cuccinelli said in an interview with Fox News Channel.Still, a congressional source familiar with intelligence reporting and analysis said the FBI is "taking pretty seriously" the warnings of Inauguration Day protests.Multiple investigations are under way into how Trump's supporters were able to storm the Capitol building, and whether some public officials participated. IAt least two Capitol police officers have been suspended and more than a dozen others are under investigation for alleged dereliction of duty, aiding or abetting rioters. Off-duty police alleged to have participated in the riot have also been suspended by departments outside Washington.Dozens of cases are being investigated for potential charges ranging from sedition to felony murder related to the riot, in what acting D.C. Attorney General Sherwin called a "significant" counterterrorism probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-inauguration-day-forces-gear-up-to-prevent-repeat-of-us-capitol-chaos-101610585672666.html
14-01-2021||World||'Can begin immediately': Senate minority leader on Trump impeachment trial||After US House impeached President Donald Trump for his role in inciting last week's deadly riot at Capitol, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that a trial can "begin immediately" if the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agrees."A Senate trial can begin immediately, with agreement from the current Senate majority leader to reconvene the Senate for an emergency session, or it will begin after January 19," CNN quoted Schumer as saying in a statement.He further said, "But make no mistake, there will be an impeachment trial in the United States Senate; there will be a vote on convicting the president for high crimes and misdemeanors; and if the president is convicted, there will be a vote on barring him from running again."Senate leader McConnell had earlier said that he would not reconvene the upper house of the Congress before January 19. He also said that he has not made a final decision on how he will vote in the impeachment trial, stating he intends to listen to the arguments when they are presented.According to a report by CNN, McConnell has sent a note to his Republican colleagues this afternoon on impeachment, writing "while the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate."The House of Representatives on Wednesday (local time) impeached President Donald Trump for "inciting" last week's deadly violence at Capitol Hill.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi confirmed the impeachment making Trump the first US president to be impeached twice. Congress voted 232 to 197 on the single article of impeachment charging Trump with "incitement of insurrection".Trump now faces a trial in the Senate. According to McConnell, the trial is unlikely to be held before January 20, the inauguration of incoming president Joe Biden.

14-01-2021||World||Donald Trump becomes first US President to be impeached twice||President Donald Trump was impeached by the US House for a historic second time Wednesday, charged with “incitement of insurrection” over the deadly mob siege of the Capitol in a swift and stunning collapse of his final days in office.With the Capitol secured by armed National Guard troops inside and out, the House voted 232-197 to impeach Trump. The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the US Capitol, urged on by the president’s calls for them to “fight like hell” against the election results.Ten Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a “clear and present danger” if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden’s inauguration January 20.Trump is the only US president to be twice impeached.The Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation’s history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign “and domestic.”She said of Trump: “He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”Holed up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump took no responsibility for the bloody riot seen around the world, but issued a statement urging “NO violence, NO lawbreaking and NO vandalism of any kind" to disrupt Biden's ascension to the White House.In the face of the accusations against him and with the FBI warning of more violence, Trump said, “That is not what I stand for, and it is not what America stands for. I call on ALL Americans to help ease tensions and calm tempers.”Trump was first impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but the Senate voted in 2020 acquit. He is the first to be impeached twice. None has been convicted by the Senate, but Republicans said Wednesday that could change in the rapidly shifting political environment as officeholders, donors, big business and others peel away from the defeated president.The soonest Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell would start an impeachment trial is next Tuesday, the day before Trump is already set to leave the White House, McConnell's office said. The legislation is also intended to prevent Trump from ever running again.McConnell believes Trump committed impeachable offenses and considers the Democrats’ impeachment drive an opportunity to reduce the divisive, chaotic president’s hold on the GOP, a Republican strategist told The Associated Press on Wednesday.McConnell told major donors over the weekend that he was through with Trump, said the strategist, who demanded anonymity to describe McConnell’s conversations.In a note to colleagues Wednesday, McConnell said he had “not made a final decision on how I will vote.”Unlike his first time, Trump faces this impeachment as a weakened leader, having lost his own reelection as well as the Senate Republican majority.Even Trump ally Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, shifted his position and said Wednesday the president bears responsibility for the horrifying day at the Capitol.In making a case for the “high crimes and misdemeanors” demanded in the Constitution, the four-page impeachment resolution approved Wednesday relies on Trump’s own incendiary rhetoric and the falsehoods he spread about Biden’s election victory, including at a rally near the White House on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.A Capitol Police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot and killed a woman during the siege. Three other people died in what authorities said were medical emergencies. The riot delayed the tally of Electoral College votes that was the last step in finalizing Biden’s victory.Ten Republican lawmakers, including third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming, voted to impeach Trump, cleaving the Republican leadership, and the party itself.Cheney, whose father is the former Republican vice president, said of Trump's actions summoning the mob that "there has never been a greater betrayal by a President” of his office.Trump was said to be livid with perceived disloyalty from McConnell and Cheney.With the team around Trump hollowed out and his Twitter account silenced by the social media company, the president was deeply frustrated that he could not hit back, according to White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing who weren’t authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.From the White House, Trump leaned on Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina to push Republican senators to resist, while chief of staff Mark Meadows called some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill.The president’s sturdy popularity with the GOP lawmakers’ constituents still had some sway, and most House Republicans voted not to impeach.Security was exceptionally tight at the Capitol, with tall fences around the complex. Metal-detector screenings were required for lawmakers entering the House chamber, where a week earlier lawmakers huddled inside as police, guns drawn, barricade the door from rioters.“We are debating this historic measure at a crime scene,” said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.During the debate, some Republicans repeated the falsehoods spread by Trump about the election and argued that the president has been treated unfairly by Democrats from the day he took office.Other Republicans argued the impeachment was a rushed sham and complained about a double standard applied to his supporters but not to the liberal left. Some simply appealed for the nation to move on.Rep. Tom McClintock of California said, “Every movement has a lunatic fringe."Yet Democratic Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo. and others recounted the harrowing day as rioters pounded on the chamber door trying to break in. Some called it a “coup” attempt.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., contended that Trump was “capable of starting a civil war.”Conviction and removal of Trump would require a two-thirds vote in the Senate, which will be evenly divided. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”Fending off concerns that an impeachment trial would bog down his first days in office, Biden is encouraging senators to divide their time between taking taking up his priorities of confirming his nominees and approving COVID-19 relief while also conducting the trial.The impeachment bill draws from Trump’s own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud.The House had first tried to persuade Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke their authority under the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Pence declined to do so, but the House passed the resolution anyway.The impeachment bill also details Trump’s pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes.While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, there is precedent. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-becomes-first-us-president-to-be-impeached-twice-101610576864652.html
14-01-2021||World||US bans entry of Xinjiang cotton products, tomatoes over forced labor claims||The US will bar entry of all cotton products and tomatoes from China’s Xinjiang region, where it says Beijing is oppressing Muslim-minority Uighurs.The move is the latest in a string where the US is raising pressure on China over some companies’ alleged ill-treatment of workers. The US says the Chinese government has detained more than 1 million Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minorities in “re-education” internment camps, allegations that the Foreign Ministry in Beijing denies.“Forced labor is a form of modern slavery,” Acting Department of Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli said on a call with reporters Wednesday. “‘Made in China’ doesn’t just indicate country of origin -- it’s a warning label.”The US imported $9 billion of cotton products in the past year and $10 million of tomatoes from China, Brenda Smith, the executive assistant commissioner in the office for trade at Customs and Border Protection, said on the call.In September, CBP said it planned a so-called withhold release order, or WRO, covering all cotton, textile and tomato products from the country’s northwestern Xinjiang region. CBP has already issued WROs against three Xinjiang-based hair-product and garment producers in 2020 and plans six more in addition to the blanket Xinjiang order.In December, the US-based Center for Global Policy published a report alleging new evidence from Chinese government documents and media reports of hundreds of thousands of Uighurs in Xinjiang being forced to pick cotton by hand through coercive state-mandated labor.President-elect Joe Biden has labeled China’s mass detention and re-education program for Xinjiang’s Uighur minority as “genocide” and called for an international effort to make a united stand against the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-entry-of-xinjiang-cotton-products-tomatoes-over-forced-labor-claims-101610559674082.html
14-01-2021||World||Rare Tintin comic book art set to sell for millions in Paris||Not even the coronavirus can get in the way of intrepid Belgian reporter and comic book legend Tintin.Comic book lovers and tourists alike can catch a socially distanced glimpse of a Tintin drawing by Herge in Paris before it goes under the hammer Thursday, estimated to sell between 2 and 3 million euros and possibly break the record for the most expensive comic book art in history.The 1936 work in Chinese ink, gouache and watercolor, was destined as a cover for The Blue Lotus, the fifth volume of the Belgian journalist's adventures. But it never sat on any book store shelves because it was rejected for being too expensive to reproduce on a wide scale - a victim of its own rare craftsmanship.“They had to do a four colour process printing, so an additional colour and (the publisher) thought that the comic albums were already expensive and reproducing this cover would increase the production costs,” said comics expert Eric Leroy at Art Curial auction house by the Champs-Elysees avenue.As the name “Blue Lotus” suggests, the art work places Tintin in Asia. A huge red dragon appears on a black background by the Belgian reporter's petrified face. It is a prized addition to the universe of Tintin, the subject of recent shows in London and Barcelona, a 2011 Hollywood adaptation, a videogame and an app.In “Blue Lotus,” Tintin travels to China during the 1931 Japanese invasion to investigate and expose - along with his dog Snowy - Japanese spy networks, drug-smuggling rings and other crimes.But the huge interest in this work has raised a host of questions among French media regarding the work's provenance - whether it was a gift to the son of Tintin's printer or a drawing simply never returned to the artist.There is no question, however, of its authenticity. On Thursday, Hergé, whose real name was Georges Remi, could break the record for the most expensive piece of comic book art at 2.6 million euros that was previously set by himself.“We set the previous record for the 'Pages de Garde' in 2014 ..it would be fair for this piece to break this record. Hergé had done only five comic covers using this technique of direct color so it's very rare,” Leroy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-tintin-comic-book-art-set-to-sell-for-millions-in-paris-101610552270054.html
