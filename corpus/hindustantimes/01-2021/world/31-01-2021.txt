Instead of the 1,000 pounds ($1,370) aspiration, he raised around 33 million pounds ($45 million).Moore, who rose to the rank of captain while serving in India and Burma during the war, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July for his fundraising efforts.Best wishes came in from far and wide, including from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said in a tweet that Moore had "inspired the whole nation, and I know we are all wishing you a full recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/captain-tom-moore-hospitalized-after-testsitive-for-covid19-101612117179076.html

These actions serve no purpose besides hurting the Afghan people who - largely due to decades of conflict -suffer from food insecurity and significant economic and development challenges, further exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic."The intra-Afghan peace talks between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban had resumed earlier this month but no progress till now has been made.Instead, the Taliban's Doha-based leader embarked on a trip to Iran on Sunday for talks with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on the implementation of the Doha deal with the US, according to a report by Sputnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nato-allies-slam-taliban-for-destroying-vital-infrastructure-in-afghanistan-101612116475236.html

Women protestors were dragged by their hair, arrested and put in chains by Pakistani authorities,” the letter said.In the letter, the Sindhi Foundation highlighted the construction of a Chinese-backed dam on the Indus River in Pakistan.The Pakistan government is building the dam with China’s investment of USD 5.85 billion.The location of the dam is a hotspot for earthquakes. Many fear that the construction of the dam could result in an environmental disaster, leading to further changes in the entire ecosystem of Sindh, particularly within the delta region, the foundation said.“Citizens of the United States care greatly about global human rights, and hope that before supporting the Pakistani government, the Biden administration will check Pakistan's human rights record. Human rights abuses in Pakistan have increased significantly in the last decades, particularly in Sindh.” Laghari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-asked-to-address-human-rights-abuses-in-pakistan-s-sindh-province-101612112961331.html

31-01-2021||World||Washington DC statehood: US Democrats renew effort but how likely is it?||The movement for Washington DC’s statehood has gathered momentum after the January 6 Capitol riots when the White House took hours to mobilise National Guard. Earlier this week, a bill, with significant support from Democrats, was introduced in Senate to make District of Columbia the 51st state of the US.Delaware Senator Tom Carper, who introduced the bill with a record number of cosponsors, said in a statement that the lack of fair representation for DC residents is “inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded.” “It is therefore incumbent upon all of us who enjoy the right and the privilege of full voting rights and representation to take up the cause of our fellow citizens in the District of Columbia,” Carper added.Why residents want statehood?The supporters argue that DC has more residents than Vermont and Wyoming and comparable with several other states like Delaware and Alaska. DC residents pay more in total federal income tax than residents of 22 other states but have no say over how the tax amount is spent.While DC residents pay the highest per-capita federal income taxes in the United States, they elect a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives who can draft legislation but cannot vote. They also don’t have a voice in Senate committees or on the Senate floor, which means they have no say in the determination of federal agencies’ leadership.Of all the National Guard units, only DC doesn’t have control over its unit and is dependent on the White House. During the Capitol violence episode, police from neighbouring counties in Maryland and Virginia arrived even before the National Guard to take control of the situation. The statehood would give control to the local government.Read | Capitol Police tighten Congress security in era of rising threatsHow likely is the statehood?Most Republicans oppose statehood for DC since the district is heavily Democratic and admitting Washington as a state would automatically give two Senate seats to Democrats. Although the Democrats control the Senate with 50 seats, the legislation for DC’s statehood, like most legislation, requires 60 votes to end the debate and go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote. In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators need to be on board with the plan but at least two Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have opposed the idea of ending the procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-statehood-us-democrats-renew-effort-but-how-likely-is-it-101612109821952.html

31-01-2021||World||Deal or no deal: Virus aid tests Biden 'work together' plea||He was an arm-draping pol as a senator. He hung out in the Senate cloakroom chatting up legislators as vice president. He pitched himself during the presidential campaign as someone who could “get people working together” and lower the temperature in a Washington overheated by Donald Trump.Now, after his first full week as president, Joe Biden is coming face to face with the potential limitations of his ability to work across the aisle as he pushes for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is the first big test of his tenure.Republicans are balking at the price tag and Democrats are sending signals that they’re willing to push the bill through without GOP help as Biden’s campaign pitch to be a deal-maker appears to be giving way to the reality of a Senate that does not resemble the one he once inhabited.In a nod to reality, Biden told reporters on Friday: “I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the Covid relief has to pass -- no ifs, ands or buts.”The White House has not given up hope of landing some GOP support for the package, and Biden’s call list bears that out. But some of Biden’s courtship is also directed at members of his own party to make sure a deal gets done.He has called Sen. Susan Collins of Maine several times since his inauguration, and the moderate Republican says she has a “closer relationship” with Biden than she did with Trump.Biden has made repeated calls to senators in his own party, including two centrists -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- who have expressed some concerns about the package, according to three people familiar with the calls who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations.A retail politician who never misses a chance for small talk or schmooze, Biden has been penned in somewhat by the pandemic, which limits the face-to-face interactions on which he thrives. But there’s still his peerless phone book, built over four decades of dealing with senators on both sides of the political divide.“When he decides to make one of those calls, he doesn’t really require a call sheet, a sheet that tells him exactly what to say to a member of Congress and how to outline the bill,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. “He knows. He’s known a lot of these people for decades.”Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator from Missouri, says Biden is “workman-like in terms of his outreach and it was not unusual for me to run into Joe Biden in the Senate cloakroom when he was vice president” to Barack Obama.“He burned up the phone lines,” McCaskill said. “Obama was terrible at that part of the job, while Biden was good at it, to both parties.”Having spent 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president, Biden made bipartisan outreach a central promise, even when many in his party argued that Republicans no longer were interested in working across the aisle.Biden’s most notable deal-making success came in the Obama-era fiscal showdowns during the rise of the tea party Republicans. The landmark agreements locked in tax and spending cuts for a decade -- and soured some progressive Democrats on Biden’s brand of compromise.As vice president, Biden was a trusted emissary to Capitol Hill for Obama, who had served just four years in the Senate.Biden arrived as a presence in the halls of Congress at several critical junctures. He helped cut a 2010 deal to prevent the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts, then negotiated on the landmark Budget Control Act of 2011 that slashed spending and walked the country back from the 2012 “fiscal cliff” of looming tax increases and budget reductions.“Biden’s chief virtue as a negotiator is the understanding that ‘Look, you have politics on your side, I have politics on my side, we both have to live within our political constraints,’” said Rohit Kumar, former deputy chief of staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “His pitch: ‘I know there are certain things you can’t do and I am not going to make them deal breakers. We have to get a deal I can sell, a deal you can sell.’”As senator, Biden also prized his relationships with colleagues, even though his nightly commute home to Delaware cut into his ability to socialize with other lawmakers.“Well, I don’t want to ruin him, but he did work with us on occasion,” said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.Lott said Biden was not someone he recalls as often being in the room when Senate leadership was trying to work out a deal on major bills. But Lott pointed to two major instances when he was: the 1994 crime bill and the 2002 Iraq War resolution, a pair of measures for which Biden has since expressed regret.Still, Lott said Biden’s relationship with McConnell was real and could pay dividends again.“They worked out an agreement that basically is what they’ve been working off ever since,” Lott said. “Somebody in the media referred to Biden then as the McConnell whisperer.”Still, the Senate has changed markedly since Biden first joined decades ago, with different skills now in currency as senators gain status on social media, raise money beyond their home states and spend less time socializing with one another in Washington.Biden’s style of old-school, one-on-one cajoling may be less persuasive for senators from either party who cultivate their own brands and don’t necessarily rely on proximity to presidential power to raise their profiles.And, of course, policy matters. The parties are more split than ever over the legislative remedies for the nation, a partisan divide that political scientists see as on par with the rifts of the Civil War era.Biden aides worry that Republicans will continue to balk no matter how many personal phone calls they get from the president or post-pandemic invitations they receive to high-profile events at the White House.Their boss may be the last one to buy in to that.“There’s people who say you can’t work with the other side,” Biden said a year ago. “And if that’s the case, prepare your children for a totally different U.S., a totally different world. I don’t believe it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deal-or-no-deal-virus-aid-tests-biden-work-together-plea-101612097462987.html

31-01-2021||World||Moderate US Republican senators urge Biden to compromise on Covid-19 plan||A group of 10 moderate Republican US senators urged Democratic President Joe Biden on Sunday to reconsider his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, saying they wanted a meeting to discuss a compromise that they said could win swift bipartisan support.In a letter to Biden, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and seven other senators said they would unveil on Monday their proposed legislation to address the coronavirus crisis.The progress of Biden's package to support individuals and businesses will be an early test of the new US president's promise to work across the political divide.Some Republicans, who have lost control of the Senate, have questioned the cost, while others urged more targeted measures."Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support," the group wrote in the letter, whose signatories also included Bill Cassidy, Shelley Moore Capito, Todd Young, Jerry Moran, Michal Rounds.Rob Portman, who has announced he will not seek re-election in 2022, also signed the letter, which said the group wished to "work in good faith" with the new administration.While offering few specifics, they said their plan echoed Biden's call for more funding to boost vaccines and testing as well as support for schools and child care centers, but said their plan would include more targeted assistance for families in need and additional funds for small businesses.They did not give an overall cost for compromised bill, but said money from previous Covid-19 relief bill passed last year remained unspent.Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, told CNN's State of the Union programme that the White House had seen the letter and would review it.Congress, controlled by Democrats, is set to move this week on Biden's plan to deliver a fresh infusion of Covid-19 relief to Americans and businesses reeling from the pandemic, which has killed more than 430,000 people in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-us-republican-senators-urge-biden-to-compromise-on-covid-19-plan-101612103184393.html
31-01-2021||World||Foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond May deadline: NATO officials||International troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline envisaged by the insurgent Taliban's deal with the United States, four senior NATO officials said, a move that could escalate tensions with the Taliban demanding full withdrawal."There will be no full withdrawal by allies by April-end," one of the officials told Reuters."Conditions have not been met," he said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. "And with the new US administration, there will be tweaks in the policy, the sense of hasty withdrawal which was prevalent will be addressed and we could see a much more calculated exit strategy."The administration of then-President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban early last year calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops by May in return for the insurgents fulfilling certain security guarantees.Trump hailed the accord - which did not include the Afghan government - as the end of two decades of war. He reduced U.S. troops to 2,500 by this month, the fewest since 2001.Plans on what will happen after April are now being considered and likely to be a top issue at a key NATO meeting in February, the NATO sources said.The positions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are becoming increasingly important after the alliance was sidelined by Trump, diplomats and experts say.Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in September in Doha, but violence has remained high."No NATO ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary, but we have been clear that our presence remains conditions-based," said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu.No NATO decision has been made, she said, adding that a February meeting NATO defence ministers meeting could not be preempted. "Allies continue to assess the overall situation and to consult on the way forward."NATO continues to call on all sides to "seize this historic opportunity for peace," Lungescu said."NATO fully supports the Afghanistan peace process in order to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists that would attack our homelands," she said.Around 10,000 troops, including Americans, are in Afghanistan, Lungescu said.The NATO source said troop levels are expected to stay roughly the same until after May, but the plan beyond that is not clear.Kabul and some foreign governments and agencies say the Taliban has failed to meet conditions due to escalated violence and a failure to cut ties with militant groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Taliban denies.The administration of Joe Biden, who replaced Trump on Jan. 20, has launched a review of his predecessor's peace agreement.A Pentagon spokesman said the Taliban have not met their commitments but Washington remained committed to the process and had not decided on future troop levels.A State Department representative said Biden was committed to bringing a "responsible end to the 'forever wars'... while also protecting Americans from terrorist and other threats."Afghanistan's presidential palace did not respond to a request for comment.Rising concernThe Taliban have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility that Washington might change aspects of the agreement and keep troops in the country beyond May, two Taliban sources told Reuters."We conveyed our apprehensions, but they assured us of honouring and acting on the Doha accord. What's going on, on the ground in Afghanistan, is showing something else. And that's why we decided to send our delegations to take our allies into confidence," said a Taliban leader in Doha.A Taliban delegation this week visited Iran and Russia, and the leader said they were contacting China.Although informal meetings have been taking place between negotiators in Doha, progress has stalled in recent weeks after an almost one-month break, according to negotiators and diplomats.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters the insurgents remained committed to the peace process."No doubt that if the Doha deal is not implemented there will be consequences, and the blame will be upon that side which does not honour the deal," he said. "Our expectations are also that NATO will think to end this war and avoid more excuses for prolonging the war in Afghanistan."NATO and Washington will have a challenge getting the Taliban to agree to an extension beyond May.If the situation remains unclear, the Taliban may increase attacks, possibly once again on international forces, said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the British think tank ODI.The lack of a resolution "gives voice to spoilers inside the Taliban who never believed the US would leave willingly, and who have pushed for a ratcheting up of attacks even after the US-Taliban deal was agreed," she said.A Feb. 17-18 meeting of NATO defence ministers will be a chance for a newly empowered NATO to determine how the process would be shaped, said one source, a senior European diplomat."With the new administration coming in there will be a more cooperative result, NATO countries will have a say."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-troops-to-stay-in-afghanistan-beyond-may-deadline-nato-officials-101612100124055.html

Navalny's allies have also claimed that his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, was detained by Russian police at an unauthorised protest in Moscow on Sunday. The nationwide protests have rattled the Kremlin as Russian authorities struggle to contain the wave of demonstrations in support of the 44-year-old opposition leader.Read | Alexei Navalny's spokeswoman detained for violating sanitary rules at protestsNavalny was detained on January 17 as soon as he landed in Moscow for the first time after being treated in Germany for poisoning.

He has been at the forefront of the anti-corruption struggle in Russia and has organised several demonstrations in the past against President Vladimir Putin and his political allies.During a phone call earlier this week, US President Joe Biden called on his Russian counterpart to release Navalny.

It saw daily infections fall from a peak above 4,000 in June to dip below the 100 mark in early January."We have unfortunately in recent days registered a noticeable increase and continued rise in infections. One of the main reasons is gatherings and complacency with precautionary measures," said Health Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah."Lack of compliance will force us to take measures to protect society," he said in televised remarks.

31-01-2021||World||Afghan negotiating team warns Taliban to resume talks||A member of the Afghan government's peace negotiating team on Sunday warned the Taliban that if they don't resume peace talks in Qatar soon, the government could recall the team before a deal is reached.Government negotiator Rasul Talib said in a news conference the team is waiting for the return of the Taliban leadership to Doha, where a second round of peace talks began this month but have made little progress.He asked the Taliban to "stop spreading baseless remarks" and return to the negotiating table, adding "The Taliban does not have the guts for peace, they are spreading nonsense around."There was no immediate response from the Taliban.Talib's comments came as the Taliban leadership has recently been in Iran and Russia for discussions on the negotiations, and as President Joe Biden's new administration has said it plans to review the peace agreement signed last February between the US and the Taliban.The Pentagon said last week that the Taliban's refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all US troops will be able to leave by May as required under the peace deal.Following discussions in Moscow on Friday, the head of the Taliban delegation, Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanikzai, said the group expects the US to fulfill its pledge to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by May.The US Pentagon announced in mid-January that the US military has met its goal of reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan to about 2,500.Stanikzai has also demanded the resignation of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, calling his administration an obstacle to peace, and a spike in violence has decreased optimism among Afghans the peace process will work.Meanwhile, the Afghan peace negotiating team praised President Biden's administration for its decision to review the US-Taliban peace deal, saying the deal favours the Taliban.Talib asked the new US administration to withdraw its forces in a way that will prevent a security vacuum in the country and prevent the possibility of more militant attacks in Afghanistan and against the US and other countries.The Taliban on Sunday mistakenly fired two mortars in northern Faryab province killing two civilians and wounding 14 others, said the provincial police spokesman, Karim Yuresh. He said Afghan security checkpoints were targeted but the shells missed the checkpoints and hit the civilians.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the group fired mortars toward civilians and accused Afghan forces of firing the mortars and causing the casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-negotiating-team-warns-taliban-to-resume-talks-101612097333706.html
31-01-2021||World||Israel to give some coronavirus vaccines to Palestinians||Israel has agreed to transfer 5,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine to the Palestinians to immunize front-line medical workers, Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz's office announced Sunday.It was the first time that Israel has confirmed the transfer of vaccines to the Palestinians, who lag far behind Israel's aggressive vaccination campaign and have not yet received any vaccines.The World Health Organization has raised concerns about the disparity between Israel and Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and international human rights groups and U.N. experts have said Israel is responsible for the well being of Palestinians in these areas. Israel says that under interim peace agreements reached in the 1990s it is not responsible for the Palestinians and in any case has not received requests for help.Gantz's office said early Sunday the transfer had been approved. It had no further details on when that would happen. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.Also read| Why is India called the world’s pharmacy? Here are 160 million reasonsIsrael is one of the world's leaders in vaccinating its population after striking procurement deals with international drug giants Pfizer and Moderna. The Health Ministry says nearly one-third of Israel's 9.3 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine, while about 1.7 million people have received both doses.The campaign includes Israel's Arab citizens and Palestinians living in annexed east Jerusalem. But Palestinians living in the West Bank under the autonomy government of the Palestinian Authority and those living under Hamas rule in Gaza are not included.The Palestinian Authority has been trying to acquire doses through a WHO program known as Covax. But the program, which aims to procure vaccines for needed countries, has been slow to get off the ground.The dispute reflects global inequality in access to vaccines, as wealthy countries vacuum up the lion’s share of doses, leaving poorer countries even farther behind in combating the public health and economic effects of the pandemic. It has also emerged as another flashpoint in the decades-old Mideast conflict, even as the virus has wreaked havoc on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-give-some-coronavirus-vaccines-to-palestinians-101612088344354.html

31-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan's Huanan food market, likely origin of Covid-19||WHO experts on Sunday visited the market in central China linked to the first known Covid-19 cluster, seeking clues about the beginning of the pandemic as a number of nations further tightened restrictions to stop the coronavirus.France on Sunday closed its borders to non-European countries except for essential travel, a day after Germany imposed a ban on most travellers from nations hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants.And authorities in Australia imposed a snap five-day lockdown in Perth after the detection of a single case in the city of roughly two million people.The emergence of the new variants has further complicated the fight against the coronavirus, which first emerged in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan before unleashing death and economic devastation around the world.A World Health Organization team visited the Huanan food market in Wuhan on Sunday as part of its fieldwork in a politically sensitive mission to investigate the origins of the pandemic.Their visit is being tightly controlled, and the WHO has already downplayed expectations of finding the source of the virus, which is known to have infected more than 102 million people so far with over 2.2 million deaths.The experts did not take any questions from journalists as they visited the market.In recent days, Chinese authorities have relentlessly pushed a positive narrative of heroism and decisive, swift action against the virus.But it has faced criticism at home and abroad for how it handled the initial Wuhan outbreak and its lack of transparency.- More restrictions -With mass vaccination programmes still in their infancy and struggling with supply, unpopular restrictions on business, movement and travel remain among the few options available to governments in their fight against the virus.On Sunday, France closed its borders to all non-EU travellers except those on essential trips, and closed big shopping centres, except those selling food; whilst Portuguese citizens will not be able to travel abroad except in "special cases" for two weeks.The day before, Germany barred most travellers from countries battling the new virus variants that are believed to be more contagious. The decision impacts people from Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini.Even nations that have largely brought their outbreaks under control are wary of a resurgence. The lockdown in Perth, Australia, was ordered after a security guard at a quarantine hotel tested positive."Our model is to deal with it very, very quickly and harshly," said Western Australia premier Mark McGowan.Canada announced that arriving passengers will have to quarantine in hotels at their own expense, with airlines suspending flights to southern destinations.And in the United States, the hardest-hit nation in the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a sweeping order requiring people to wear masks on virtually every form of public transportation.Despite the number of infections and deaths remaining high, the outbreak in the United States appears to be easing, with new cases and hospitalisations down two weeks in a row.Experts say that is down to better adherence to mask wearing and social distancing, as well as the end of the holiday season.But another factor identified by some experts is that -- at least in some areas of the country -- the virus has already burned through much of the population and is running out of targets.- 'If we don't have oxygen, our family dies' -The recently launched vaccination drives in many countries are stumbling because of supply shortages, which have also sparked a bitter diplomatic row between the EU and Britain.Both are tussling over the AstraZeneca-Oxford shots, with the firm saying there are not enough to go around because of production issues. Germany has threatened legal action against companies that do not deliver the doses they promised.In less privileged parts of the world that have yet to launch vaccinations at that scale, people are struggling to find resources that could mean life or death for them or their loved ones.In Peru, where health services are on the edge of collapse and short on resources, some have been forced to sleep on the streets of the capital Lima as they wait to refill oxygen tanks for their loved ones fighting Covid-19 in the hospital."We need (oxygen) for our family to live," said 46-year-old Yulitza Torres, a transport worker."If we don't have oxygen, our family dies."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-who-team-visits-wuhan-s-huanan-food-market-likely-origin-of-covid19-101612088553339.html
31-01-2021||World||Russia arrests over 1,000 people demanding Navalny's release||Thousands of people took to the streets Sunday across Russia's vast expanse to demand the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, keeping up a wave of nationwide protests that have rattled the Kremlin. Over 1,000 were detained by police, according to a monitoring group.Russian authorities have mounted a massive effort to stem the tide of demonstrations after tens of thousands of people rallied across the country last weekend in the largest and most widespread show of discontent Russia has seen in years.The 44-year-old Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator who is the best-known critic of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusations.On Sunday, police detained more than 1,000 people in protests held in cities across Russia's 11 time zones, according to the OVD-Info, a group that monitors arrests.In Moscow, authorities introduced unprecedented security measures in the city center, closing subway stations near the Kremlin, cutting bus traffic and ordering restaurants and stores to stay closed.Navalny's team initially called for Sunday's protest to be held on Moscow's Lubyanka Square, home to the main headquarters of the Federal Security Service, which Navalny claims was responsible for his poisoning. After police cordoned off the area around the square, the protest shifted to another central square a mile away. Police deployed in force at that location too, randomly picking up people and putting them into police buses. At least 100 were detained.But hundreds of others marched across the city center, chanting “Putin, resign!” and Putin, thief!" a reference to an opulent Black Sea estate reportedly built for the Russian leader that was featured in a widely popular video released by Navalny's team.The city of Novosibirsk in eastern Siberia saw one of the biggest rallies, with thousands marching across the city. About 90 protesters were detained.In the far eastern port of Vladivostok, more than 100 people were detained after protesters danced on the ice and rallied in the city center.As part of a multipronged effort by authorities to block the protests, courts have jailed Navalny's associates and activists across the country over the past week. His brother Oleg, top aide Lyubov Sobol and three other people were put Friday under a two-month house arrest on charges of allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions during last weekend's protests.Prosecutors also demanded that social media platforms block calls to join the protests.The Interior Ministry has issued stern warnings to the public not to join the protests, saying participants could be charged with taking part in mass riots, which carries a prison sentence of up to eight years. Those engaging in violence against police could face up to 15 years.Nearly 4,000 people were reportedly detained at demonstrations on Jan. 23 calling for Navalny's release took place in more than 100 Russian cities, and some were given fines and jail terms. About 20 were accused of assaulting police and faced criminal charges.Just after Navalny's arrest, his team released a two-hour video on his YouTube channel about the Black Sea residence purportedly built for Putin. The video has been viewed over 100 million times, helping fuel discontent and inspiring a stream of sarcastic jokes on the internet amid an economic downturn.Demonstrators in Moscow chanted “Aqua discotheque!,” a reference to one of the fancy amenities at the residence that also features a casino and a hookah lounge equipped for watching pole dances.Putin says that neither he nor any of his close relatives own the property. On Saturday, construction magnate Arkady Rotenberg, a longtime Putin confidant and his occasional judo sparring partner, claimed that he himself owned the property.Russia has seen extensive corruption during Putin's time in office even as many ordinary citizens struggle financially.Navalny fell into a coma on Aug. 20 while on a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow. He was transferred to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, claiming a lack of evidence that he was poisoned.When he returned to Russia in January, Navalny was jailed for 30 days after Russia's prison service alleged he had violated the probation terms of his suspended sentence from a 2014 money-laundering conviction that he has rejected as political revenge.On Thursday, a Moscow court rejected Navalny's appeal to be released, and another hearing next week could turn his 3 1/2-year suspended sentence into one he must serve in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-arrests-over-1-000-people-demanding-navalny-s-release-101612091545015.html

However, that is a complicated story. He (Osama) used to extend financial assistance [to Nawaz Sharif]," Express Tribune quoted her as saying.Abida, also an ex-cabinet member of Nawaz Sharif's government, recalled that at one-time bin Laden was popular and liked by everyone including the Americans but at a later stage, he was treated as a 'stranger'.Her remarks come days after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's Member of National Assembly Farrukh Habib alleged that Nawaz Sharif had laid the foundation of foreign funding in the country and took USD 10 million from Osama bin Laden to bring a no-confidence motion for overthrowing Benazir Bhutto's government.Nawaz Sharif, who has been the prime minister of Pakistan for three non-consecutive terms, has been accused, time and again, of taking money from slain terrorist Osama bin Laden in order to promote and fund jihad in Kashmir. He served as prime minister from 1990-93, 1997-98, and 2013-17.Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is in London for medical treatment.Osama was killed in a midnight raid by the US Navy SEALs in Pakistan's garrison town of Abbottabad in 2011.Pakistan had officially denied having any knowledge of the terror chief until he was shot dead in a raid by US forces. Pakistan has been accused of using its soil to perpetrate terror in neighbouring countries.In 2016, a book was released accusing Nawaz Sharif of taking money from former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.The book, Khalid Khawaja: Shaheed-i-Aman, is authored by Shamama Khalid, the wife of former ISI operative Khalid Khawaja."Chief of PML-N Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif received funding from Osama Bin Laden, founder of Al-Qaeda, to contest elections against Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after the end of Zia regime," the book states.But even though Osama funded Sharif heavily, the latter backtracked from all his promises after coming into power, the Dawn had reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/osama-bin-laden-supported-funded-nawaz-sharif-ex-pak-envoy-abida-hussain-101612091891895.html
31-01-2021||World||Trump left with no legal representation ahead of impeachment trial. Here’s why||Former US president Donald Trump is left with no legal representation ahead of his second impeachment trial in Senate after five defence attorneys reportedly parted ways with the Republican leader. Butch Bowers and Deborah Barberi, the two lead attorneys working on Trump’s defence, abruptly left due to differences over strategy, reported news agency Reuters.Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris from South Carolina are no longer part of the defence team and Josh Howard, who was recently added to the team, has also left. The Senate trial is scheduled to begin on February 9 and no attorneys have announced that they are working on the case. According to a CNN report, the attorneys were neither paid any fees in advance nor a letter of intent was ever signed.Why the lead lawyers left?Reports quoting people familiar with the situation claim that the South Carolina attorneys and Trump mutually decided to part ways after their differences over defence strategy ahead of the trial. Trump was reportedly still contending that he was a victim of massive electoral fraud. He wanted the lawyers to argue that the election was stolen from him and not on the legality of convicting a president after he has left the office, an argument several Republican lawmakers have made in defence of Trump.Read | Explained: How Trump’s 2nd impeachment trial could be different from 1stPat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, Trump’s White House lawyers at the first impeachment trial, are not expected to take part in the proceedings. It is unclear who would represent the former president at the Senate trial even though a majority of Republican leaders have argued against the impeachment, making Trump’s conviction unlikely. The Senate will also enter into uncharted constitutional waters when the trial begins since no president in the history of the United States have faced trial after leaving the office.In the aftermath of Capitol riots, Democrats-controlled House of Representatives, with support of 10 Republicans, impeached Trump on the charge of “Incitement of Insurrection”. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that this impeachment trial will be different from last time since the whole world witnessed “president's incitement and the violence that was used”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-left-with-no-legal-representation-ahead-of-impeachment-trial-here-s-why-101612089481753.html
31-01-2021||World||Perth in lockdown, ending Australia's two-week run without Covid-19||The Australian city of Perth was ordered into lockdown on Sunday after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive for Covid-19, ending the country's longest coronavirus-free run.From Sunday evening until Friday, people in the city of 2 million must stay home, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise, with visits to hospitals and nursing homes banned, said Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan.Australia's fourth-most populous city had recorded no cases of the virus for 10 months, and Australia just hours earlier had announced 14 days without a locally acquired infection.Restaurants, cafes and cinemas were ordered shut in Perth and surrounding areas were ordered shut, while a scheduled return from summer school holidays was extended by a week, after the security guard returned a positive test late on Saturday, McGowan said.The vast, largely isolated state has been known in Australia for a hardline Covid-19 response that included keeping its border closed to the rest of the country until recently when it reopened to some regions."I know for many Western Australians this is going to come as a shock," McGowan told a hastily scheduled news conference. "We cannot forget how quickly this virus can spread, nor the devastation it can cause."The security guard, aged in his 20s, was working at a hotel where four people in quarantine had active cases of the virus, including with highly contagious strains that have been linked to Britain and South Africa, the health authorities said.The man had a second job with an unspecified ride-sharing company but had not worked his driving job since reporting symptoms on Thursday. Other people in the man's household had tested negative but were put in isolation and were expected to test positive in the coming days, they said.The lockdown affected four-fifths of the population of Australia's geographically biggest state, and the rest were asked not to travel. People from other states, only some of whom were recently allowed back into the state, were again asked to stay away.The police would set up road checkpoints to question people's movements, Police Commissioner Chris Dawson told reporters, adding that the police would also enforce a new rule requiring people to wear masks in public indoor spaces and on public transport.Australia has had its borders closed since March to slow the spread of the illness that has infected 29,000 in the country and killed 909.State governments have closed internal borders for the first time in a century, an effort to keep the virus out that has at times resulted in terse exchanges between state leaders over disagreements about people's ability to move around the country.Earlier on Sunday, Australia reopened its "travel bubble" with New Zealand, meaning travellers from New Zealand are exempt from 14-day hotel quarantine, after the neighbouring country reported no new locally acquired Covid-19 cases.New Zealand has, however, kept its border closed to Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perth-in-lockdown-ending-australia-s-two-week-run-without-covid19-101612083660854.html

There were no incidents of violence.___SANTA FE, N.M. — New Mexico reported 752 additional known Covid-19 cases and 17 deaths on Saturday, increasing the state’s pandemic totals to 173,539 cases and 3,265 deaths.The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.The counties with the most additional cases were Bernalillo (255), Sandoval (70), Dona Ana (70), McKinley (54), San Juan (41) and Santa Fe (32).The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.New Mexico’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases dropped in the past two weeks while the rolling average of daily deaths was nearly flat.Santa Fe’s school superintendent announced Saturday that schools will reopen in a voluntary hybrid model on Feb. 22, two weeks after when state officials have said New Mexico school districts and charter schools can reopen.The Feb. 22 date provides time to inspect schools and for teachers to set up their classrooms while giving families and staff at least two weeks notice Superintendent Veronica García said.___HAVANA -- Cuban authorities say they will tighten measures against the spread of COVID-19 to require tourists and other visitors to isolate at their own expense for several days until tests for the new coronavirus come out negative.The announcement Saturday by Dr. Francisco Durán, Cuba’s director of epidemiology, came as the country announced 910 new infections of the new virus detected Friday, as well as three additional deaths.Duran said that as of Feb. 6, arriving tourists and Cubans who live abroad will be sent to hotels at their own expense to wait for the results of a PCR test for the new coronavirus, which will be given on their fifth day in the country. A similar measure was imposed in the spring, and apparently helped stem the spread of the virus.Cubans returning home from abroad will be housed in other centers at government expense to await test results.Diplomats and some categories of foreign businesspeople will be allowed to isolate at home.Cube has recorded 25,674 infections with the new coronavirus and 213 deaths since March.Cuba had eased restrictions in November, opening airports to tourists and others, but the number of infections detected has risen sharply this month.___BALTIMORE — Baltimore public health officials are canceling some COVID-19 vaccination appointments scheduled for next week after overbooking hundreds of first-dose appointments.The city health department did not specify how many appointments would be canceled, or why the overbooking happened, The Baltimore Sun reported.The department issued a statement saying it was working to identify potential issues in the state’s scheduling system, and the possibility that links to second-dose appointments were shared via email or social media.“We are working to confirm that this situation will not occur moving forward,” the statement read.Officials said they are prioritizing giving second doses to people who have already gotten their first shot because of limited inventory.Meanwhile, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced Saturday that state health officials have confirmed a case of Covid-19 caused by the new variant of the virus that was first detected in South Africa.___ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- City officials in Alaska say multiple crew members on a seafood factory trawler in the Aleutian Islands have tested positive for Covid-19.The Anchorage Daily News reported that the city of Unalaska said Friday that factory trawler Araho, owned by seafood company O’Hara Corporation, reported 20 of its 40 crew members tested positive.City Manager Erin Reinders said a couple of crew members reported symptoms after the vessel arrived in Alaska from Seattle on Wednesday. Reinders said the city is developing a plan to coordinate care for infected crew members and determine what to do with the others.___BOSTON — Starting Monday, 500 vaccinations per day will be administered at Fenway Park.

Blinken, on Friday spoke with Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, pressing his "concern about the potential release of these prisoners", a spokesman for the US Department of State said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-s-family-to-challenge-pakistan-murder-acquittals-101612081353207.html
31-01-2021||World||Pfizer or Sputnik? Race to inject against Covid prompts calls for choice||Few people care who made their flu shot or their childhood immunizations against a range of deadly diseases. Covid changed that, turning vaccine makers into household names and prompting calls for choice.Doses remain scarce for now, amid a global scramble inflamed by a dispute between the European Union and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc. Most of the more than 90 million people who’ve gotten a shot consider themselves lucky for any protection against the pandemic. But vaccines are proliferating, with positive trial data from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc. placing their candidates next in line for approval.Health officials will have to figure out how to allocate all these different vaccines. Many people who’ve been boning up on efficacy rates, dosing schedules or side effects want to decide for themselves. If the options are a shot from a Western drugmaker that’s been vetted by an independent regulator or one from a Russian or Chinese lab with lesser transparency, that desire is even greater.“We demand the government to provide people the freedom of choice,” said Gergely Arato, a member of the opposition Democratic Coalition party in Hungary.Hungary broke ranks with other EU members to approve Russia’s Sputnik V and a vaccine from China’s Sinopharm Group Ltd. alongside the three shots cleared by Europe’s drug regulator -- from Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca. While Prime Minister Viktor Orban is technically offering choice, his promotion of the Chinese and Russian shots is endangering people’s “willingness to get vaccinated,” Arato said at a press conference this month.In the U.S., where the only two shots authorized so far -- from Pfizer and Moderna -- use similar technology and demonstrated virtually identical test results, choice may matter less for now. Elsewhere, however, some health authorities have begun catering to people’s concerns about vaccine differences.Dubai, Hong KongIn Dubai, residents older than 60 or with pre-existing conditions can access the shot Pfizer developed with BioNTech SE, or the one from Sinopharm.In Hong Kong, officials ordered enough doses of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and AstraZeneca -- along with plans to secure a fourth option -- to cover the 7.5 million residents.The Pfizer shot will be available at community vaccination centers, with the Sinovac and Astra options offered at private hospitals and clinics, and people will be given the choice of which they want to receive. That’s important in Hong Kong, where some people are wary of taking a Chinese-made vaccine.“If residents don’t want to take a certain vaccine, they can choose to get the shots at another time and another location,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in December.Supplies are so tight in most of the world that choice remains impossible. Those getting shots often have no idea which one they’ll receive until they walk through the door of a vaccination center or doctor’s office. But that could change if vaccines from the likes of J&J, Novavax and CureVac NV come on stream in the coming weeks, and as pharma giants like Sanofi and Novartis AG lend their heft to the production effort.EU ApprovalEven if they don’t offer choice, health officials have to decide who gets what. At the Cleveland Clinic, Cassandra Calabrese has been telling patients to take whatever vaccine they get offered, even though some have been asking her which one she’d recommend. “Things may be different as more are approved,” she said in an email.The European Union, criticized for its slow rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, expanded its offerings Friday by approving AstraZeneca’s shot. In a sign of the growing tide of people wanting to choose, the approval came after days of pitched debate about the shot’s efficacy, with Germany’s immunization commission recommending against its use in seniors.In the U.K., where infections and fatalities are much higher than in Hong Kong, health authorities are prioritizing the quick inoculation of as many people as possible. The second dose of two-shot vaccines is being delayed in an effort to get first injections into as many arms as possible. Other countries are considering similar steps.Distribution is based on “supply and logistics, such as availability of very cold freezers,” a U.K. Department of Health spokesman said by email. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots must be kept frozen for long-term storage, while refrigeration suffices for the AstraZeneca vaccine.Efficacy RatesAlthough the U.K. has set a priority list for vaccine recipients -- starting with the oldest, most vulnerable people -- it doesn’t allocate the different shots based on a person’s profile, the agency added. So one 80-year-old patient might receive the AstraZeneca shot while someone else with the same age and health conditions might get the Pfizer one. Some Britons are expressing a preference on the grounds of patriotism rather than what they might have read about different efficacy rates or side effects. Never mind that the U.S. company’s vaccine was 95% effective in large trials, compared with an average of 70% for AstraZeneca’s shot. “They’re saying they want to wait for the British one,” Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said in a phone interview. “I think that it’s purely a nationalistic viewpoint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-or-sputnik-race-to-inject-against-covid-prompts-calls-for-choice-101612080992711.html
31-01-2021||World||Navalny, WHO and Thunberg among nominees for Nobel Peace Prize||Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the World Health Organization and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg are among those nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, all backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner.Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, are eligible to propose candidates. Nominations, which close on Sunday, do not imply an endorsement from the Nobel committee.Norwegian lawmakers have nominated the eventual laureate every year since 2014, with the exception of 2019, said Henrik Urdal, Director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. "The pattern from recent years is quite stunning."The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.But nominators can choose to reveal their picks.According to a Reuters survey of Norwegian lawmakers, nominees include Thunberg, Navalny, the WHO and its COVAX programme to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poor countries.Thunberg was named as one of "the foremost spokespeople in the fight against the climate crisis", with the campaigning group she co-founded, Fridays for Future, also receiving a nod.Navalny, nominated by Russian academics, was named for his "efforts for a peaceful democratisation of Russia" by Norwegian former minister Ola Elvestuen.The battle against Covid-19 is front and centre, including a nomination for the GAVI vaccine alliance.Other names are Belarusian activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo for their "fight for a fair election and inspiration for peaceful resistance", one nominator, Geir Sigbjoern Toskedal, said.Another, Jette Christensen, also named the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, and IUSTITIA, a group of Polish judges defending civil rights."My nomination this year is ... for the fight to preserve democracy as a form of government in Europe," Christensen said.Freedom of information is a recurring theme with nominees including the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists; former Charlie Hebdo journalist Zineb el Rhazoui; news website Hong Kong Free Press, the U.S.-based International Fact-Checking Network and Paris-based Reporters without Borders (RSF).Other nominees include former U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO and the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).Also on the list is Aminatou Haidar, for her peaceful campaigning towards an independent Western Sahara, the International Space Station and the International Scout Movement.The 2021 laureate will be announced in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-who-and-thunberg-among-nominees-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612080429299.html
31-01-2021||World||Russians join protests against jailing of Kremlin critic Navalny despite crackdown||Supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny took to the streets in Siberia and the Russian Far East on Sunday for a second straight weekend despite a sweeping crackdown on his allies and warnings from the police.Rallies are also planned in Moscow later on Sunday, part of a campaign to win the release of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent. He was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer.Police have said the protests have not been authorised and will be broken up as they were last weekend. OVD-Info, a protest monitoring group, said that more than 4,000 people were detained at the rallies last week.In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, where a rally began at 0200 GMT, police prevented protesters from accessing the centre, forcing them to relocate to the waterfront and the frozen waters of the Amur Bay.Video footage showed protesters chanting "Putin is a thief" as they linked hands and marched on the ice in temperatures of around -13 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit).In Tomsk, the Siberian city that Navalny visited before suddenly collapsing on a domestic flight last August, demonstrators gathered in front of a concert hall and chanted "Let him go!" and held up Russian flags.OVD-Info said police had detained 145 people, including 76 in Vladivostok, since the rallies began.Navalny's supporters in Moscow plan to gather at 0900 GMT near the Kremlin administration and the headquarters of the FSB, the KGB's successor, where protesters in 1991 famously pulled down a statue of the secret police's founder during the Soviet breakup.Authorities have closed seven metro stations in the Russian capital and have said they will restrict pedestrian movement in the area due to the protest plans. There was a heavy police presence in central Moscow early on Sunday.Navalny, a 44-year-old opposition politician, accuses Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.He is accused of parole violations which he says are trumped up. A court is due to meet next week to consider handing him a jail term of up to three and a half years.The protests following Navalny's dramatic return to Moscow despite the threat of arrest put Putin in a quandary over how to respond. Polls show pent-up frustrations among Russians over years of falling wages and fallout from the pandemic.The West has told Moscow to let Navalny go and his allies have appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to sanction 35 people who they say are Putin's close allies.To galvanise support at home in an online video viewed over 100 million times, Navalny has accused Putin of being the ultimate owner of a sumptuous Black Sea palace, something the Kremlin leader has denied.On the eve of the protests, Arkady Rotenberg, a businessman and Putin's former judo sparring partner, said he owns the property.Many of Navalny's prominent allies were targeted in a crackdown this week. Several, including his brother Oleg, are under house arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-join-protests-against-jailing-of-kremlin-critic-navalny-despite-crackdown-101612079625598.html

Meanwhile, it has substantially increased the wealth of billionaires."- Lots to celebrate -Philanthropy activists say Scott's actions are likely to make other billionaires -- including her ex-husband -- take notice."There is a ton to celebrate about her philanthropy," said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which provides research data to foundations and other charitable donors."I would hope that the sheer amount of money she is getting out the door and her intention to continue to do so is a kick in the pants to all those sitting on tremendous wealth at time of unbelievable challenge and need."Scott, whose Amazon stake acquired in her divorce settlement is estimated at some $58 billion, pledged to give away the majority of her wealth to fight social inequity.She announced grants of some $1.7 billion last July and another $4.2 billion in December.She enlisted a team of advisors to help identify organizations to aid those suffering from the economic toll of the pandemic, focusing on those working to combat hunger, poverty and racial inequity.While her ex-husband Bezos has donated $10 billion to fight climate change -- the largest charitable gift of 2020 -- and additional amounts to other causes, his giving has been slower and proportionately smaller, given that his fortune is worth more than three times hers.The former couple could offer a major boost to philanthropy in the US, which represented some $450 billion in donations from Americans in 2019.- Speed and scale -Benjamin Soskis, senior research associate at the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, said Scott's actions are remarkable not only for their scale but the speed in delivering the funds."The pandemic has amplified an imperative in getting money out the door as fast as possible," Soskis said.Additionally, Scott has broken with much of philanthropic tradition by eliminating onerous restrictions and limits, which can complicate matters for organizations scrambling to cope with the pandemic."She has emphasized giving money and getting out of the way," Soskis said."Philanthropists often see themselves as part of the process, with multiple checks and evaluations and metrics which can be really burdensome."One potential critique of Scott's approach is her "opaque" process in which she has selected grant recipients, Soskis said."She is operating in a realm of absolute discretion that is not accountable to anyone," he said.Still, Soskis said her actions set an important precedent which could be a positive force for philanthropy."We shouldn't underestimate the role MacKenzie Scott plays in establishing a new norm for philanthropic giving," Soskis said."Any major philanthropist has to confront the example that she has set."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mackenzie-scott-shakes-up-philanthropy-with-amazon-billions-101612077931697.html

31-01-2021||World||Canada oppn MPs put pressure on PM to condemn ‘police brutality’ on Indian farmers||Some Canadian opposition MPs are putting pressure to get Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government to address their “concerns” over the alleged “violence” and “police brutality” against protesting farmers in India.Leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh has started a petition campaign on his party’s official website, which reads: “The Indian government’s use of violence on farmers protesting mass privatisation of the agricultural sector is appalling.”“Instead of using water cannons, tear gas and violence, the Indian government needs to engage in open dialogue with farmers,” it adds. Singh also tweeted, “I am deeply concerned about the violence against farmers in India Those calling to harm farmers must be held accountable and the right to peaceful protest must be protected. I am calling on Justin Trudeau to condemn the violence, immediately.”Indian officials pointed out that neither Singh nor groups like the World Sikh Organization (WSO) have raised the issue of attacks on police personnel on Republic Day or take into account that several rounds of talks between farmers’ group and the government have already taken place.Former minister and Conservative Party MP Tim Uppal also joined the chorus, tweeting, “Shocking & disturbing images of police brutality out of Delhi towards farmers protesting.” He added, “I raise my voice with all those around the world calling for this brutality to end.”With Canada’s parliament in session, there is concern among Indian diplomats that the government will be forced to respond, even as Trudeau and recently appointed foreign minister Marc Garneau have avoided the issue, after New Delhi reacted sharply to the Canadian PM’s earlier comments on the protests. Trudeau had said in December during the course of a Facebook live event that “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.”The Canadian government thereafter has maintained silence on the matter. But Indian officials believe a coordinated campaign has started with “propaganda” by groups like the separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice, to have the issue raised in the House of Commons and elicit a response from the Canadian government.Singh and Uppal’s remarks came soon after the WSO started a campaign to get “Sikh Canadians” to “express concern, ranging from attacks on Sikhs to the threatening of gurdwaras in Delhi.”Other Indo-Canadian groups, though, responded to the charges. The Ottawa-based Overseas Friends of India Canada, replied to Uppal’s tweet, “What are you advocating - violence against the police? You are MP of Canada and should know better than to advocate violence against the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-oppn-mps-put-pressure-on-pm-to-condemn-police-brutality-on-indian-farmers-101612075103919.html
31-01-2021||World||US must 'impose cost' on China for threat towards Taiwan, Hong Kong: Sullivan||The United States must be prepared to "impose cost" on China for its threats toward Taiwan, as well for its actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said.In an online discussion with his predecessor from the Trump administration, Robert O'Brien' on Friday, Sullivan called China as the top foreign policy challenge that was handed over to President Joe Biden, citing Beijing increasingly "assertive" approach to Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, reported Focus Taiwan.In response, Sullivan listed out four steps that the US can take to contend with the threat that China poses.First, he said, US must recognise that China is making the case that Chinese model is better than the American model and is pointing to the recent dysfunction and division in the US as evidence of this claim.To effectively combat this argument, the US must "refurbish the foundations of (its) democracy" by tackling social problems such as racial and economic inequality, Sullivan said.Secondly, he said, the US will be most effective in advancing its vision for a free, prosperous and equitable society if it does so "in lockstep with its democratic allies and partners."With its allies in Europe and Asia, the US can lead "a chorus of voices" who collectively represent more than one half of the world's economy, which would give it "leverage" to stand up to Chinese pressure, he said.Third, Sullivan said, the U.S. must increase public investment in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology and clean energy, as a great deal of the competition between the U.S. and China will be decided by which country enjoys a technological advantage.The last step, according to Sullivan, is for the US to speak with clarity and consistency in regards to China and other foreign policy issues.Specifically, this includes "being prepared to act as well as to impose costs for what China is doing in Xinjiang, what it's doing in Hong Kong, and for the bellicosity and threats that it is projecting towards Taiwan," he said.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.China had passed the Hong Kong Security Law last year to curtail the autonomy of the city, which drew international condemnation.In the aftermath of the law, Beijing launched a crackdown against its critics in Hong Kong. Several lawmakers and pro-democracy activists have been detained.Another aspect of Chinese policy that has been questioned by leaders around the world is the treatment meted out against Uyghurs Muslims in Xinjiang province.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-impose-cost-on-china-for-threat-towards-taiwan-hong-kong-sullivan-101612069848010.html
31-01-2021||World||Explained: Why UAE is witnessing a surge in number of Covid-19 cases||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is seeing a hue surge in number of Covid-19 cases. In the past one month, the number of cases in the UAE have nearly tripled.This led to the ruler of Dubai to replace the head of the emirate's health authority.The surge came after the country largely removed coronavirus restrictions with the exception of face masks in public and social distancing. Dubai, the region's business and tourism hub, has seen an influx of visitors during its peak winter season.The doctors in the UAE say that cold weather could be a potential reason for a spike in the cases of Covid-19. Explaining the behaviour of the virus, the doctors said that it typically survive and reproduce more effectively in colder climatic conditions.Doctors said that dipping mercury levels may also reduce the immune response and make it harder for the body to fight off harmful microorganisms.Part of its potency comes from the fact that the viruses change so quickly that the human body is rarely prepared for the next season’s strain, said the doctors.Healthcare professionals also pointed out that the antibodies no longer recognise the virus, leading to a loss in immunity.The number of daily coronavirus cases in the UAE averaged about 1,200 a day over the past couple of months, but infections started to spike at the end of December and the country reported a record 2,998 cases on January 9.Last week, Dubai suspended non-essential surgeries in hospitals for a month and live music at restaurants indefinitely after daily infections of the coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates rose to their highest levels in January.On Saturday, authorities reported 3,647 new cases and 12 deaths bringing the total number of cases and deaths from Covid-19 to 300,661 and 674 respectively.In contrast with the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi, which has rolled out Sinopharm vaccine to the general public since December, Dubai began the first phase of its vaccination campaign with vaccines produced by Pfizer and BioNTech.The gulf state of about 9 million people hopes massive vaccination will curb infections while keeping its economy open for business.On Saturday, the government said 107,561 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were given in the past 24 hours, taking the total of doses distributed so far to 3,114,162, with a rate of of 31.49 doses per 100 people.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-uae-is-witnessing-a-surge-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-101612066414167.html
31-01-2021||World||WHO teams visits Wuhan food market in search of coronavirus clues||A World Health Organization team looking into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday visited a market known to be the food distribution center for the Chinese city of Wuhan during the 76-day lockdown last year.The team members were seen walking through sections of the Baishazhou market — one of the largest wet markets in Wuhan — surrounded by a large entourage of Chinese officials and representatives.The members, with expertise in veterinarian, virology, food safety and epidemiology, have so far visited two hospitals at the center of the early outbreak — Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and the Hubei Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital.On Saturday, they also visited a museum exhibition dedicated to the early history of Covid-19.The Geneva-based WHO said on Twitter last Thursday that the team plans to visit hospitals and markets like the Huanan Seafood Market, which was linked to many of the first cases. They also listed the Wuhan Institute of Virology and laboratories at facilities including the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-teams-visits-wuhan-food-market-in-search-of-coronavirus-clues-101612067515295.html

31-01-2021||World||Alexei Navalny's spokeswoman detained for violating sanitary rules at protests||The Police have detained Kira Yarmysh, the spokeswoman of Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny, for violating sanitary regulations at the unauthorized demonstrations held earlier this month, Yarmysh's lawyer said."Kira Yarmysh is being detained under art. 91 of the criminal procedural code," Veronika Polyakova wrote on Twitter, adding that the case of violating sanitary and epidemiological norms at the January 23 rally had been transferred to the Investigative Committee.Earlier this month, a Moscow court charged Yarmysh with "violating the procedure established for conducting a meeting, rally, demonstration, procession or picket." Yarmysh was arrested for nine days for urging Russian citizens to join the unauthorized rally in support of Navalny on January 23.On Friday, a Moscow court placed several of Navalny's close allies, including his top associate Lyubov Sobol, coordinator of his team in Moscow Oleg Stepanov, Alexey's brother Oleg Navalny and Pussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina, under house arrest for violating sanitary rules by calling for protests during the COVID-19 pandemic.On January 23, many Russian cities were hit by protests in support of Alexey Navalny, who was detained in Moscow earlier this month upon his arrival at Sheremetyevo International Airport. Prior to Navalny's return to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for his alleged poisoning, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service warned it would arrest him for probation violations as he was previously found guilty of committing two administrative offenses.Following the unauthorized pro-Navalny rallies, more than 1,000 people were detained in Moscow, where about 4,000 protesters took to the streets on January 23.Commenting on the West's repeated calls for Navalny's release, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it is an attempt to shift attention from the crisis of the liberal model of development.Russian President Vladimir Putin said that everyone has a right to express their opinion but "anything that goes beyond the law is not just counterproductive but dangerous." The president's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called organizers of such unauthorized protests provocateurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-s-spokeswoman-detained-for-violating-sanitary-rules-at-protests-101612061795353.html

31-01-2021||World||After free-spending Trump years, Republicans rediscover US debt||US President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion plan to revive the US economy has been met with howls from the Republican opposition in Washington, with conservative lawmakers saying it is full of money-wasting programs at a time when the country doesn't need any more debt.Yet it wasn't so long ago that the party, led by fellow Republican Donald Trump in the White House, passed massive tax cuts and an even larger stimulus package to fight the economic disruptions caused by Covid-19 -- expensive measures that fueled the rising budget deficit.Now, with Democrats back in the presidency and narrowly controlling Congress, Republicans are citing concerns about the rising US debt and deficit as grounds to object to Biden's agenda.The $1.9 trillion package the president proposed to accelerate the country's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is "a colossal waste, and economically harmful," Republican Senator Pat Toomey said."The total figure is pretty shocking," said Mitt Romney, a fellow Republican senator who seized on the rising national debt during his failed attempt to unseat Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election.- Time to 'act big' -New Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has taken the lead in countering the Republicans' protests, saying at her recent confirmation hearing, "Neither (Biden), nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country's debt burden."But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big."Biden served as vice president under Obama, in a period when Republicans repeatedly raised debt and deficit concerns to stymie his agenda.Trump, then a private citizen, joined in, tweeting in 2012, "The deficits under (Obama) are the highest in America's history. Why is he bankrupting our country?"Yet after Trump took office in 2017 with a Republican-controlled Congress, that party's lawmakers seemed to forget those concerns.Government spending increased, and Congress enacted a $2 trillion tax cut -- the most significant tax reform in 30 years and one voted for by every Republican senator, including the "budget hawks" known for decrying such spending."Republican concerns about the deficit, they are kind of tough to take seriously right now, given their support for tax cuts and spending increases during the Trump years," said Tori Gorman, policy director of the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, which advocates for fiscal responsibility."And a lot of that took place even before the pandemic," she told AFP.The tax reform boosted growth in 2018 but also increased the budget deficit and inflated the debt, which rose from $19.5 trillion four years earlier to nearly $27 trillion at the end of September 2020.- 'Hypocrisy' on both sides -At the beginning of 2020, before the pandemic battered the economy, Trump signaled that debt was no longer a concern, saying money was better spent on the country's armed forces.He also pushed back the target date for achieving a balanced federal budget to 2035 from 2030, even as the Congressional Budget Office warned of a spiraling deficit.Then Covid-19 broke out, and Democrats and Republicans agreed to pass the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, the country's largest-ever stimulus package. It helped keep the economy from an even worse downturn.But in the months to follow, Republicans who controlled the Senate objected to Democrats' attempt to pass an even larger follow-up measure, arguing for smaller individual bills before the parties, at the last minute, signed off on a $900 billion law in December.With Democrats now fully in control of the levers of power in Washington, Gorman said, both sides have lost credibility over the deficit."I think both sides are guilty of hypocrisy when it comes to fiscal responsibility," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-free-spending-trump-years-republicans-rediscover-us-debt-101612058134110.html
31-01-2021||World||Joe Biden calls for Democrats to keep Trump impeachment trial short||US President Joe Biden urged his fellow members of the Democratic Party in the Senate to keep former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the upper chamber short and not to let it "derail the agenda".According to The Hill, Biden has never embraced Trump's second impeachment though he hasn't sought to stand in its way either amid outrage in his party over the former president's involvement in the January 6 riots at the Capitol.Biden administration officials and allies close to the White House say the president will distance himself from Trump's trial as it begins in the second week of February."He's going to let the Senate do what it needs to do," said one Biden ally close to the White House as quoted by The Hill and added, "We always knew this was going to happen. We always knew this would be the position we're in now with Republicans. And now he's going to respect the process and let it play out."It is reported that the impeachment trial poses some risks to Biden, and some Democrats had warned it could ruin his early agenda."He's come to the White House with a strong unity message and the last thing he wants is for the impeachment trial to define the early days of his presidency," one ally said.Citing sources, it was reported that Biden and his advisers have been in frequent touch with Democratic leaders in Congress, and some members of Biden's inner circle threw their support behind impeachment.After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Cedric Richmond, who resigned from Congress to become a senior Biden adviser, expressed immediate support for impeachment, according to a source familiar with the internal conversations on Biden's team.But several prominent Democrats in both chambers voiced concern early in the process about a Senate impeachment trial delaying Biden's agenda. "We already know the outcome before it starts and that's frustrating to everybody," said a Senate Democratic aide after this week's vote on the motion sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (Republican-Kentucky.).The Hill further reported that House Majority Whip James Clyburn advocated for waiting after Biden's first 100 days in office before sending an article of impeachment to the Senate.Across the Capitol, in the upper chamber, Senators Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy privately expressed concerns that confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees and moving a Covid-19 relief package should be the top priorities.Murphy said, "my point privately was not necessarily that we shouldn't hold a trial but we needed a couple of weeks to get the Cabinet in place and to get Covid [relief] moving."Kaine said Friday he raised early concerns about "the likely outcome" of a trial."I just felt as outrageous as the behavior was and as much as accountability is needed, I just didn't see a way that Republicans would get to 17 votes to convict," he said.In fact, earlier this week he told CNN he thought "it (the impeachment trial) has to happen."Immediately after the riot, Biden signaled the decision was for lawmakers.The US Senate signalled on Tuesday that there are not nearly enough votes to convict ex-President Donald Trump in an impeachment trial when five Republican senators rejected an effort by Senator Rand Paul to declare the looming trial as unconstitutional.The US Senate formally opened the second impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump on Tuesday with the swearing-in of Senate President Pro-Tempore Patrick Leahy to preside over the process and the swearing-in of the senators to serve as jurors.On Monday, the House of Representatives delivered the article of impeachment against Trump, accusing him of inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol building on January 6 to stop Congress from verifying President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.The impeachment trial arguments will begin on February 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-for-democrats-to-keep-trump-impeachment-trial-short-101612057805142.html
31-01-2021||World||Anti-science movement set up US for worse pandemic: Expert||US infectious disease expert Dr. Peter Hotez has said that the anti-science movement has set up the United States and the world up for a worse Covid-19 pandemic than otherwise would have been."An anti-science disinformation campaign of unprecedented magnitude and led by both multinational corporations and some governments, especially the Russian and US Governments, fuels the pandemic," Hotez, dean for the National School for Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in the journal Plos Biology as quoted by CNN.He added, "Although President Trump did not win reelection and the new Biden administration has vowed to mount an evidence-based pandemic strategy, the anti-science pursuits of the Trump White House and Coronavirus Task Force have caused serious harm."According to CNN, the essay comes as the US races to try to get a majority of Americans vaccinated by the end of the summer. The Covid-19 pandemic arrived as the anti-vaccination movement had been amplified and politicized on the internet, Hotez said and pointed to vaccine disinformation efforts both in Russia and the US that appeared to accelerate in 2014 ahead of the 2016 US presidential election that led to Trump's presidency."During this time, the anti-vaccine movement began rallying behind medical freedom to counter the introduction of bills in the California legislature designed to close nonmedical exemptions for vaccines," wrote Hotez.He stated that the anti-vaccination movement gained traction during the pandemic. Added to that were protests citing "independent choice" and" freedom" against face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. "Fueling these sentiments was an active and unabashed anti-science disinformation initiative by the White House," Hotez said.He further said that the US leading the world in coronavirus cases and deaths can be attributed to a lack of a national coordinated effort to utilize face masks, social distancing, school closures, testing, and contact tracing."Thus, anti-science disinformation that advocates shunning masks could inflict a mass casualty event in the US," Hotez wrote.CNN reported further that Hotez suggested that the US may have to remove anti-science content and organizations from social media and e-commerce sites. He added that the US should form an interagency government task force to handle such matters, including representatives from all parts of government, including the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Homeland security.According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has reported over 26 million Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiscience-movement-set-up-us-for-worse-pandemic-expert-101612056851760.html
31-01-2021||World||Thousands flee Hong Kong for UK, fearing China crackdown||Cindy had a comfortable lifestyle in Hong Kong: she owned several properties with her husband, they had a good business going. But last year she made up her mind to leave it all behind and move her family to Britain, and not even a global pandemic was going to sway her decision.“To uproot ourselves like this is definitely not easy. But things got uglier last year, the government was really driving us away,” said the businesswoman and mother of two young children who didn't give her family name because she feared repercussions for speaking out against the Chinese government. “Everything we value - freedom of speech, fair elections, liberties - has been eroded. It’s no longer the Hong Kong we knew, it’s no longer somewhere we can call home.”Cindy, who landed in London last week, is one of thousands of Hong Kongers fleeing their hometown since Beijing imposed a draconian national security law on the territory last summer.Some are leaving because they fear punishment for supporting pro-democracy protests. But many others, like her, say China’s encroachment on their way of life and civil liberties has become unbearable, and they want to seek a better future for their children abroad. Most say they don’t plan to ever go back.Many firmed up their exit plans after Britain announced in July that it would open a special immigration pathway for up to 5 million eligible Hong Kongers to live, work and eventually settle in the U.K.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week the offer shows Britain is honoring its “profound ties of history” with Hong Kong, a former colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 on the understanding that it would retain its Western-style freedoms and much of its political autonomy not seen on mainland China.Applications for the British National Overseas visa officially open Sunday, though many like Wong have already arrived on British soil to get a head start. Eligible Hong Kongers can currently come to the U.K. for six months, but from Sunday they can apply for the right to live and work in the country for five years. After that, they can apply for settled status and then British citizenship.Britain’s government said some 7,000 people with British National Overseas (BNO) status have arrived since July. It estimates that over 300,000 people will take up the offer of extended residency rights in the next five years.Wong said she wanted to leave as soon as possible because she feared Beijing would soon move to halt the exodus.“The Chinese government said it hasn’t ruled out harsher tactics,” she said. “I think they could lash out if tens of thousands of young professionals start leaving, because that would surely upset Hong Kong’s economy and they wouldn’t like that at all.”Beijing said Friday it will no longer recognize the BNO passport as a travel document or form of identification, and criticized Britain’s citizenship offer as a move that “seriously infringed” on China’s sovereignty. It was unclear what effect the announcement would have because many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports.Beijing drastically hardened its stance on Hong Kong after massive anti-government protests in 2019 turned violent and plunged the city into a months-long crisis. Since the security law’s enactment, dozens of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, and the movement’s young leaders have either been jailed or fled abroad.Because the new law broadly defined acts of subversion, secession, foreign collusion and terrorism, many in Hong Kong fear that expressing any form of political opposition - even posting messages on social media - could land them in trouble.“I think if you knew when to shut up, you’ll be OK staying in Hong Kong,” said 39-year-old Fan, who also recently arrived in London. Like Wong, he didn’t want to provide his full name. “But I don’t want to do that. I can complain about the queen if I wanted to - I can say anything here.”Fan, an animator, had sold his flat in Hong Kong and plans to slowly build a new life in Britain - a country he had never even visited before. He won't be alone in starting from scratch.“This is a really unique emigration wave – some people haven’t had time to actually visit the country they’re relocating to. Many have no experience of living abroad,” said Miriam Lo, who runs Excelsior UK, a relocation agency. “And because of the pandemic, they couldn’t even come over to view a home before deciding to buy.”The British government estimates there are 2.9 million BNO status holders eligible to move to the U.K., with a further 2.3 million eligible dependants. The U.K. introduced BNO passports in the 1980s for people who were a “British dependent territories citizen by connection with Hong Kong.” Until recently, the passports had limited benefits because they did not confer nationality or the right to live and work in Britain.Cindy, the businesswoman, was still recovering from jetlag, but she's upbeat about her future.“We want to bring Hong Kong’s energy, our resources and our finances here,” she said. “The move is for our kids, sure. But we want to build a whole new life here for ourselves too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-hong-kong-for-uk-fearing-china-crackdown-101612056931265.html
31-01-2021||World||Royal family documentary banned by Queen leaked on YouTube 50 yrs later: Report||An infamous documentary on the royal family that was said to have been banned by Queen Elizabeth decades ago was mysteriously leaked onto YouTube this week.People Magazine reported that the fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary, titled 'Royal Family', aired in 1969 and offered an unprecedented look inside the life of Queen Elizabeth and her family. Prince Philip thought it would open the doors to what being a member of the royal family was all about, but the Queen was said to have regretted the decision to film the documentary and it has largely been locked away ever since.That is until this week when someone uploaded the film onto YouTube. It was swiftly taken down on Thursday before appearing again briefly on Friday morning.The often-charming video charts Queen Elizabeth's working life and her home life over the course of a year and could be a real-life version of 'Netflix's The Crown'.For millions of her subjects, 'Royal Family' was a unique insight into Her Majesty's life and work - from diplomatic functions to greeting ambassadors to travel to places like Chile and rides on the Royal Train. Viewers got to see her awakened every morning by the sound of bagpipes -- something that continues to this day at Windsor, or wherever she is staying.An intimate family moment around the barbecue on the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland is also shown. And the Queen is seen alongside her daughter Princess Anne as they watch some of her racehorses being put through their paces in the midst of the Berkshire Downs. Anne famously disapproved of the documentary."I never liked the idea of the Royal Family film. I always thought it was a rotten idea. The attention that had been brought on one ever since one was a child, you just didn't want anymore. The last thing you needed was greater access," she previously said.The Queen, who has often been perceived as a distant mother, is also seen as being very hands-on, excitedly driving through the snow to take her sons Prince Edward -- who is about 5 years old -- and Prince Andrew to see the Labradors during their winter break in Sandringham. Edward is even seen learning to read alongside cousin Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones and some friends.As reported by People Magazine, the film also shows the visit of President Richard Nixon, who tells Charles and Anne that his daughters follow their progress avidly via news reports.There is a lot of introduction to Charles as heir. At the time, he was studying at Cambridge University and is seen being told about his Duchy of Cornwall. He is still heir, 52 years later.At the end of the film is a moment that some have pondered may be the reason the show has been kept under wraps. As the family gathers around the table over tea, Queen Elizabeth recounts a tale of when the (unnamed) British Home Secretary - a UK Government minister - tells her, "There's a gorilla coming in" for a meeting.The Queen says she turned to the politician and said, "What an extraordinary remark to make about someone - very unkind about anybody.'" She goes on to explain, "I stood in the middle of the room and pressed the bell and the doors opened and there was a gorilla. I had the most terrible trouble. He had a short body and long arms."Around the table, Charles and Philip join in the lively conversation. "If that happened to me, I would dissolve," says Charles.The remark would be rightly seen as wildly inappropriate today, but apparently was barely commented upon at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-family-documentary-banned-by-queen-leaked-on-youtube-50-yrs-later-report-101612055757516.html

The protesters have been gathering every week near Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem for over seven months, but the use of water cannons is rare.In a statement, police said hundreds of protesters took part in the demonstration. They accused some protesters of unruly behavior, including throwing objects and trying to break through a police barricade. It said one officer was lightly hurt, and several protesters were arrested.The protesters say Netanyahu cannot serve as prime minister when he is on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.They also accuse him of mismanaging the coronavirus crisis, with unemployment in double digits after a series of nationwide lockdowns.

31-01-2021||World||Britain opens visa scheme for millions of Hong Kong citizens||A new visa scheme offering millions of Hong Kongers a pathway to British citizenship will go live later on Sunday as the city's former colonial master opens its doors to those wanting to escape China's crackdown on dissent.From Sunday afternoon, anyone with a British National (Overseas) passport and their dependents will be able to apply online for a visa allowing them to live and work in the United Kingdom. After five years they can then apply for citizenship.The immigration scheme is a response to Beijing's decision last year to impose a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong to snuff out huge and often violent democracy protests.Britain has accused China of tearing up its promise ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover that the financial hub would maintain key liberties and autonomy for 50 years. London argued it has a moral duty to protect its former colonial subjects."We have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of the scheme this week.China has reacted with fury to the visa offer.On Friday it announced BN(O) passports would no longer be recognised as a legitimate travel or ID document.The move was largely symbolic as Hong Kongers tend to use their own passports or ID cards to leave the city.But Beijing said it was prepared to take "further measures", raising fears authorities might try to stop Hong Kongers from leaving for Britain.Applications soarIt is not clear how many Hong Kongers will take up the offer, especially as the coronavirus restricts global flights and mires much of the world, including Britain, in a painful economic malaise.But a BN(O) passport is available to a huge number of people -- about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population.Applications for BN(O) passports have skyrocketed more than 300 percent since the national security law was imposed last July, with 733,000 registered holders as of mid-January.Britain predicts up to 154,000 Hong Kongers could arrive over the next year and as many as 322,000 over five years, bringing an estimated "net benefit" of up to £2.9 billion ($4 billion).The BN(O) passport is a legacy of Hong Kong's return to authoritarian China.Many Hong Kongers at the time wanted Britain to grant them full citizenship but China was opposed to the move.The BN(O) was a compromise, allowing Hong Kongers born before 1997 the right to stay in Britain for six months at a time, but with no working or settling rights.Now it has become one of the few ways out for Hong Kongers hoping to start a new life overseas as authorities conduct mass arrests against democracy supporters and move to purge the restless city of dissenting views.'A lifeboat'Stella, a former marketing professional, plans to move to Britain imminently with her husband and three-year-old son."The national security law in 2020 gave us one last kick because the provisions are basically criminalising free speech," she told AFP, asking to use just her first name.Under the visa scheme, those hoping to move have to show they have enough funds to sustain both themselves and their dependents for at least six months.Hong Kongers already in Britain who are involved in helping others relocate say many of the early applicants tend to be educated middle-class people, often with young families, who have enough liquidity to finance their move."Most people we spoke with are families with primary school or nursery age kids," Nic, an activist with a group called Lion Rock Hill UK, told AFP, asking for anonymity.Some Hong Kongers began leaving the city even before the new scheme went live.Earlier this week Britain said around 7,000 people moved over the last six months under a separate Leave Outside the Rules (LOTR) system. They will also be able to apply for the pathway-to-citizenship visas."The BNO is definitely a lifeboat for Hong Kongers," Mike, a medical scientist who recently relocated with his family to the city of Manchester, told AFP.He said many Hong Kongers feared China might stop residents leaving the territory."So it is better to leave as soon as possible," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-opens-visa-scheme-for-millions-of-hong-kong-citizens-101612054020706.html

The billionaire “reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook” in what the treasurer called “a very constructive discussion.”Tech giants from Facebook to Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been battling Australian lawmakers on the proposed legislation requiring them to pay for using media content. The new laws are designed to support the local media industry, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., that has struggled to adapt to the digital economy.Facebook has threatened to block Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law is pushed through, while Google said it could remove its search engine entirely from the Australian market.Frydenberg said Sunday that while he doesn’t dismiss Google’s threats, he’s not “intimidated” by them either.Australia Says ‘Inevitable’ Google Will Have to Pay for News“We’re in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry, because this has not been a short conversation that we’ve had with these companies,” he said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also spoken with Microsoft Corp.’s CEO Satya Nadella about the proposed changes, Frydenberg said.“At every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted,” the treasurer said. “What I do know is media businesses should be paid for content.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-hasn-t-convinced-australia-to-back-down-from-new-law-101612052742913.html
31-01-2021||World||Macron defends decision not to order third lockdown as third Covid wave spreads||President Emmanuel Macron defended his decision to hold off on a third lockdown on Saturday, telling the public he had faith in their ability to rein in Covid-19 with less severe curbs even as a third wave spreads and the vaccine rollout falters.From Sunday, France will close it borders to all but essential travel to and from countries outside the European Union, while people arriving from within the bloc will have to show a negative test. Large shopping malls will be shut and police patrols increased to enforce a 6 pm curfew.But Macron has stopped short of ordering a new daytime lockdown, saying he wants to see first if other measures will be enough to slow the spread of the coronavirus.With 10% of cases now attributable to the more contagious variant first found in Britain, senior medics have recommended a new lockdown, and one opinion poll showed more than three-quarters of French people think one is now inevitable. The poll also showed falling public confidence in the government's handling of the crisis."I have trust in us. These hours that we are living through are crucial. Let's do all we can to slow the epidemic together," Macron tweeted.Government advisers judged that the slower-than-expected spread of a contagious variant first detected in Britain meant there was no risk in delaying the decision on a lockdown by a week, Health Minister Olivier Veran told the Journal du Dimanche.But he added action would be swift if the virus started spreading faster: "We never said we would not impose a lockdown in the next two weeks if necessary."THIRD VACCINE?Macron has also been under fire for rolling out vaccines at a slower pace than other big EU countries, and far more slowly than Britain or the United States. France's latest figures showed it had given just 1.45 million vaccine doses so far. Britain, by comparison, has recorded 8.4 million.Veran said France's medical regulator was due to give its assessment on AstraZenaca's vaccine on Tuesday. France has so far approved vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.France reported 24,393 new Covid-19 infections on Saturday while the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital stayed above 27,000 for a fifth straight day.The rate of new infections is still lower than it was when the last lockdown was ordered in October, but hospitalisation rates are already comparable.Paris resident Sami Terki said it was "a good thing for now - even mentally - to not have to go through a new lockdown." But he added: "My only concern is that we then take the decision to lockdown too late."The public health authority said the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care dipped slightly to 3,113.Professor Dominique Rossi, who heads the Marseille Hospitals’ Medical Commission, said the local heath authority had asked hospitals in the Bouche-du-Rhone area to cancel 40% of all non-urgent medical interventions.Managing the flow of Covid and non-Covid patients was "a real ethical headache", he told Reuters. "The (COVID-19) projections are really worrying."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-defends-decision-not-to-order-third-lockdown-as-third-covid-wave-spreads-101612052402820.html

The plan drew some criticism after The New York Times reported that the vaccination of prisoners would start in the coming days.“We’re pausing the plan to move forward, as we review force protection protocols,” Kirby said. “We remain committed to our obligations to keep our troops safe.”The US military announced earlier this month that it planned to offer the vaccine to prisoners as it vaccinated all personnel at the detention center.At the time, US Southern Command said it expected to have enough vaccine for all of the approximately 1,500 personnel assigned to the detention center. It said that the vaccine would be offered to prisoners but did not plan to reveal how many actually received it because of medical privacy regulations.The US opened the detention center in January 2002 to hold detainees suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Those who remain include five men facing a trial by military commission for their alleged roles planning and aiding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pauses-plan-to-give-covid-19-vaccine-to-guantanamo-prisoners-101612047489168.html
31-01-2021||World||UK to launch formal bid to join transpacific trading bloc||The UK will formally request to join an 11-member transpacific trading bloc Monday, with negotiations expected to start later this year.Since leaving the European Union, Britain has signed bilateral trade agreements of varying depths with seven members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, including Japan, Vietnam and Singapore.The UK Department for International Trade said it hoped accession to the group would build on these to facilitate easier business travel, eliminate tariffs on British exports such as whisky and cars, and simplify rules of origin so that UK manufacturers can use more components made in member states.As the first nation that was not a founding member of the group to attempt to join it, Britain is “at the front of the queue,” said Liz Truss, secretary for international trade. She plans to speak to Japan’s economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura and Damien O’Connor, New Zealand’s minister for trade and economic growth, by video call Monday.The international trade department said it would publish an assessment of the economic benefits of CPTPP membership this spring, despite an earlier promise to release it before the application to allow more time for parliamentary scrutiny.The 11 current members of CPTPP account for about 13% of global gross domestic product, worth $10.6 trillion, according to New Zealand’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-launch-formal-bid-to-join-transpacific-trading-bloc-101612047004486.html
31-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl case: US presses Pakistan for ‘accountability’||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday pressed his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi to ensure “accountability” for Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been convicted over the killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl.The United Nations has also called for the convicted terrorist to be held accountable.Omar Sheikh is set to be released after Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld his acquittal by a lower court in a verdict that sparked outrage in the United States.A three-judge court, which ruled 2-1 to clear the way for Omar Sheikh’s release, has said it will explain its order at a later date.Blinken and Qureshi spoke for the first time on Friday after the Biden administration took office. They “discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Omar Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl”, the state department said in a readout of their call. “The secretary (of state) reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners,” it added.Blinken reinforced this message in a post on Twitter.At the United Nations in New York, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, had a similar message for Pakistan. “I don’t have a comment on the specific case. What is important is that there be accountability for those crimes committed,” he told reporters in response to a question about Omar Sheikh’s acquittal.Daniel Pearl, who was South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi in 2002. A video of his beheading was posted online.Omar Sheikh, who is British-born, was arrested and convicted for Pearl’s kidnapping and murder, and was eventually sentenced to death, which was commuted by the Sindh high court in April 2020 to seven years.He had already been in prison for 18 years by that time.His release was delayed as the Sindh state government and Pearl’s family appealed to the Supreme Court.White House press secretary Jen Psaki had earlier expressed “outrage” at the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order on Thursday, and Blinken had separately said the acquittal was an “affront to terrorism victims everywhere”.They had both reaffirmed US preparedness to prosecute Omar Sheikh in America, renewing an offer first made by the Trump administration in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-case-us-presses-pakistan-for-accountability-101612039854628.html
31-01-2021||World||UK sees smooth Covid-19 vaccine supplies after EU addresses 'mistake'||The British government said Saturday that it does not expect any disruptions to its orders for coronavirus vaccines after the European Union emphasized it would not trigger an emergency provision of the Brexit deal as part of its strategy to monitor export of doses produced in the EU.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said the government expects the vaccines to be supplied as planned after the EU addressed the "mistake" in its proposal to tighten export rules for Covid-19 vaccines produced in the 27 member nations.The UK government complained late Friday that the bloc had invoked an emergency clause in its divorce deal with Britain to introduce controls on exports from EU member Ireland into Northern Ireland, which is part of the UKAfter a call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive commission, the EU said it was not invoking the article of the Brexit agreement allowing either side to override parts of the deal.Gove said Johnson was “very clear” in the call to stress that the UK has contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer.“President von der Leyen was clear that she understood exactly the UK government’s position, so we expect that those contracts will be honored, we expect that vaccines will continue to be supplied,” he added.While the UK has made progress in its campaign to vaccinate the population against the coronavirus, the EU has faced complaints and criticism for its slow start.Concerns over the pace of the rollout across the EU's 27 member nations grew over the last week after British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said it could not supply EU members with as many doses as originally anticipated because of production capacity limits.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has said that vaccine delivery figures in the contract with the EU were targets, not firm commitments, and the company was unable to meet them because plants in Europe had lower than expected yields from the biological process used to produce the vaccine.However, the European Commission suspected that doses meant for Europe might have been diverted from an AstraZeneca plant on the continent to the UK, where two other company sites are located. The EU also wants doses at two sites in Britain to be made available to European citizens.That was the backdrop to the EU's decision to trigger the Northern Ireland provision on Friday, when EU regulators authorized the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. As part of the Brexit agreement, goods are supposed to flow freely between the EU and Northern Ireland under special arrangements for the UK region designed to protect the peace process on the island of Ireland.Though it reversed course on that, the EU is pushing ahead with a plan to oversee vaccines manufactured in its member states, a move that could hinder the U.K.’s access to supplies, particularly to the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine made in Belgium.Germany’s health minister called Saturday for the European Union to get its “fair share” of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.In an interview with German weekly newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Health Minister Jens Spahn said he wanted transparency from the drugmaker. ,“It’s not about Europe first, but about Europe’s fair share,” Spahn was quoted as saying.According to the newspaper, Spahn said he wanted to be sure that all of AstraZeneca’s customers were “affected in the same way” by the production problems the company blamed for the reduction in shipments over the coming months.The European Union expressed anger this week at AstraZeneca’s announcement that it would initially only supply 31 million doses of vaccine to the 27-nation bloc, instead of the 80 million doses it had hoped to deliver. The EU said it provided 336 million ($408 million) to help finance the production of AstraZeneca’s vaccine at four factories months before it was approved by medical regulators.The row reached a new pitch late Friday when the EU introduced a “vaccine export transparency mechanism″ to put tighter rules on exports of Covid-19 vaccines.The EU insists the mechanism is not an export ban and said it would be in place at least until the end of March to ensure member nations get the shots they bought from producers. The World Health Organization has criticized the new EU export rules as “not helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-smooth-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-after-eu-addresses-mistake-101612034312790.html
31-01-2021||World||Covid-19: US CDC requires face masks on airlines, public transportation||Travellers on airplanes and public transportation like buses and subways will be required to wear face masks starting next week to curb the spread of Covid-19.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued a mask-wearing rule late Friday that builds on an order announced January 21 by President Joe Biden.The rule "will protect Americans and provide confidence that we can once again travel safely even during this pandemic," said Dr Marty Cetron, director of CDC's division of migration and quarantine, who signed the order.The 11-page CDC order takes effect just before midnight on Monday night. It makes refusal to wear a mask a violation of federal law, enforced by the Transportation Security Administration and other federal, state and local authorities.The rule applies to passengers on airplanes, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares. It says travellers must wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth while riding and while getting on and off rides. The order extends to waiting areas such as airports, train platforms and subway stations.Airlines already require masks and have banned more than 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear one. Flight attendant unions have said a federal rule will make it easier for crews to enforce the requirement.The order exempts children under 2 years of age and people with a disability that makes it unsafe to wear a mask. Airlines struggled with an exemption for safety and stopped allowing it. The CDC said transportation operators can require medical documentation.Travellers will be allowed to remove masks while eating or drinking.The CDC said some face coverings aren't good enough to comply with the rule. The don't-travel list includes face shields, bandanas, masks with exhalation valves and masks that are too big or otherwise don't fit properly.The CDC said transportation operators may require a negative Covid-19 test from passengers. Cetron said this week that the health agency is considering requiring testing of passengers on flights within the United States, but the airline industry is fighting a testing requirement out of fear that fewer people will fly.US air travel is already down more than 60% from a year ago.The CDC rule came just over a week after Biden's executive order, which already mandated masks on certain modes of public transportation including planes and trains, and it mandated masks on federal property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-requires-face-masks-on-airlines-public-transportation-101612033990641.html
31-01-2021||World||Italy: Medicines agency cautious on AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jab for people over 55 years of age||Italy's medicines agency on Saturday approved the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for all adults but recommended alternatives be given to people aged over 55.AIFA's decision comes a day after the European Union gave the green light for the jab, but Germany's vaccine commission recommended against using it on older people amid questions over its effectiveness that have been rejected by the company."AIFA authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19 disease in individuals over the age of 18, as per European Medicines Agency guidance," it said.But it noted "a level of uncertainty" about claims of the jab's effectiveness in people over the age of 55, because the age group was "poorly represented" in trials.To help with the best use of the vaccine, it recommended "preferential use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, pending further data, in subjects between 18 and 55 years old, for whom more solid evidence is available".It urged the "preferential use of messenger RNA vaccines in older and/or more frail subjects".So-called mRNA vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs, and are based on a new technology previously untested in a real-world situation.They use an inert snippet of genetic code from the coronavirus to trigger an immune response in the body that can repel the active virus.Many of the other vaccines -- including Oxford/AstraZeneca -- are variants of the method used for flu jabs, based on a virus that has been killed and rendered harmless.AstraZeneca earlier rejected German media questioning the vaccine's effectiveness in over 65s."Reports that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as eight percent in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect," the firm said in a statement last Monday."In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100 percent of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-medicines-agency-cautious-on-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-jab-for-over-55s-101612033293427.html
31-01-2021||World||Federal conspiracy charges for two Proud Boys members in US Capitol riot case||Two men identified as members of the Proud Boys have been indicted on federal conspiracy and other charges in the Capitol riot as prosecutors raise the stakes in some of the slew of cases stemming from the Jan. 6 insurrection.Dominic Pezzola, a former Marine who authorities say was seen on video smashing a Capitol window with a stolen Capitol Police riot shield, and William Pepe, who authorities said was photographed inside the building, were arrested earlier in the month on federal charges that included illegally entering a restricted building. The two, both from New York state, have now been indicted in Washington on charges that newly include conspiracy.“The object of the conspiracy was to obstruct, influence, impede and interfere with law enforcement officers engaged in their official duties in protecting the US Capitol and its grounds,” the indictment says, accusing Pezzola, Pepe and unnamed others of leading a group of Proud Boys and others to the Capitol and moving police barricades there.Pezzola went on to snatch an officer's shield and use it to break the window, according to the indictment, which was filed in court Friday.Pezzola's lawyer Michael Scibetta said Saturday he was researching the charges but hadn’t been able yet to discuss the indictment with his client, who is being held without bail. A lawyer for Pepe, Shelli Peterson, declined to comment.Three self-described members of a paramilitary group were charged with conspiracy this month and accused of plotting the attack on the Capitol. But the new charges against Pezzola and Pepe appear to be the first conspiracy cases involving alleged members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group of self-described “Western chauvinists.”Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, said in a court filing Friday that Pezzola “showed perseverance, determination, and coordination in being at the front lines every step along the way before breaking into the Capitol,” and that his actions in shattering the window and allowing an initial group of rioters to stream through "cannot be overstated.”Pezzola was later seen on video inside the Capitol with a cigar, having what he called a “victory smoke," and boasting that he “knew we could take this” over, Sherwin wrote. He argued the remarks showed Pezzola “invested a significant personal effort to take over the Capitol and that he did so in coordination with others.”An unidentified witness told the FBI that Pezzola was with a group at the Capitol whose members said they would have killed anyone they got hold of, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, according to prosecutors. The witness added that people in the group said they'd return on the “20th” and kill everyone they could. The presidential inauguration was Jan. 20.In a search of Pezzola's home in Rochester, New York, FBI agents found a computer thumb drive with hundreds of files detailing how to make firearms, poisons or explosives, Sherwin wrote in arguing that Pezzola should continue to be held without bail.Pezzola, 43, served six years stateside in the Marines as an infantryman and was discharged in 2005 at the rank of corporal, service records show. His lawyer has said his client is self-employed and a family man.Pepe, 31, was photographed inside the Capitol and later identified as a Metro-North Railroad train yard laborer who had called in sick to go to Washington for a Jan. 6 protest by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, according to a Jan. 11 criminal court complaint. Pepe, who lives in Beacon in New York’s Hudson Valley, has since been suspended without pay from his job at the New York City-area commuter railroad.At Trump's urging, thousands of the protesters streamed to the Capitol. Some then stormed it, temporarily disrupting Congress' certification of Democratic President Joe Biden’s victory over the Republican Trump in the November election.Overall, federal authorities have charged more than 150 people in the Capitol siege.The Justice Department said both Pepe and Pezzola have gone to Proud Boys gatherings and have tactical vests emblazoned with the group's logo.The group is known for violent confrontations with antifascists and other ideological opponents at protests. In a notable moment on the campaign trail last year, Trump told the group to "stand back and stand by” when asked at a September debate whether he would condemn white supremacist and militia groups that showed up at some protests last summer.Shortly before the Capitol riot, the Proud Boys' leader, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, was arrested in Washington and ordered to stay out of the city after being accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-conspiracy-charges-for-two-proud-boys-members-in-us-capitol-riot-case-101612031364538.html
