They also discussed bilateral, regional and global issues, according to a readout from the defence ministry.The Pentagon said Austin emphasised the defence department’s commitment to the US-India Major Defence Partnership, which is built on “shared values and common interest in ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains free and open”. Austin also noted the “great strides” in bilateral defence ties and pledged to work collaboratively with Singh.India and the US highlighted the need to collectively address challenges in the post-Covid-19 era and also agreed to work closely on key issues such as counter-terrorism and stability in the Indo-Pacific during the conversation between Doval and Sullivan, the external affairs ministry said.There was no official word from the US on the conversation between the NSAs.The telephone calls marked the first formal contact between the new US administration headed by President Joe Biden and India’s top leadership. Biden is also expected to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of his ongoing outreach to world leaders.Singh had earlier congratulated Austin, the first African-American secretary of defence, on his appointment. Modi spoke to Biden in November after his election victory and discussed shared priorities and concerns, including the pandemic, climate change and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.In his conversation with Sullivan, Doval said that as “leading democracies with an abiding faith in an open and inclusive world order, India and the US were uniquely positioned to work closely on regional and international issues”, including combating terrorism, maritime security, cyber-security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond, the external affairs ministry said.Sullivan said the US is looking forward to working together on the bilateral agenda and common global challenges.The two NSAs agreed to work closely to advance India-US relations, “which are built on shared values and common strategic and security interests”, the external affairs ministry said. They also “highlighted the need to work collectively to address challenges in the post-Covid era and further expand the comprehensive global strategic partnership” between the two sides.Addressing the annual conference of the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, on Wednesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the US is coming to terms with the rebalancing of global power distribution, which has accelerated over the past decade.The US, as a pre-eminent power, will have to grapple with the challenges of the world, and this will require “smart applications of power and influence abroad as well as strong partnerships,” he said. “It is also necessary that solutions to current conflicts are arrived at through broader consultations,” he added.Referring to changes around the world, Jaishankar said: “Nowhere have the changes been sharper than in Asia, so presumably it would be reflected now in policy formulation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-leaders-dial-indian-counterparts-seek-cooperation-in-defence-indopacific-101611769571332.html

Many parts of the Amazon experienced drier weather last year and were therefore more susceptible to fire.Bolivia accounted for the biggest increase in destruction compared to 2019 as enormous fires tore through its Chiquitano dry forests, Finer said. Many Bolivians use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land for cattle or soy, and the fires can get out of control and escape into the forest in dry conditions.Bolivia announced a state of emergency in October, saying that 600 families had been affected by the fires.After Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador saw smaller increases in deforestation.Brazil had the most deforestation, accounting for 61% of the hotspots in the Amazon overall, although 2020 forest destruction was similar to 2019, Finer said."I think 2019 is regarded as a really bad year for the Brazilian Amazon. 2020 got less press and attention but it was just as bad, if not worse," he said.The 2020 data is based on a preliminary analysis of deforestation alerts generated by the University of Maryland, with final figures to be confirmed later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deforestation-soars-in-amazon-forest-in-2020-analysis-finds-101611767135915.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden’s UN nominee urged to counter China, defend 2019 speech||President Joe Biden’s nominee for United Nations ambassador was pressed to counter China’s influence at the organization as well as defend a speech she gave in 2019 about Beijing’s strategy in Africa.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at her confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pledged to restore American leadership at the UN and said China is trying to drive “an authoritarian agenda that stands in opposition to the founding values of the institution -- American values.”“When America shows up, when we are consistent and persistent, when we exert our influence in accordance with our values, the United Nations can be an indispensable institution for advancing peace, security, and our collective well-being,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “If instead we walk away from the table, and allow others to fill the void, the global community suffers -- and so do American interests.”Under the Trump administration, the US repeatedly clashed with the UN and its organizations, withdrawing from the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. Critics argued that walking away allowed China to expand its influence, undermine human rights positions and sponsor resolutions that reflect its worldview.Signaling a concern of Republicans on the panel, Chairman James Risch of Idaho called on Thomas-Greenfield to explain a 2019 speech to a China-funded institute in Georgia at which he said she was too positive about Beijing’s role in Africa.“I can tell you that there isn’t a person sitting in this room who hasn’t given a speech that they don’t wish they had back” Risch said. “I personally am not going to hold one speech against somebody, but you are going to have to speak to that.”Thomas-Greenfield said she regretted giving the speech at a China-backed “Confucius Institute” at Savannah State University and vowed to push back on Beijing’s “parasitic” influence in Africa.“I truly regret having accepted that invitation and having had my name associated with the Confucius Institutes,” Thomas-Greenfield said, adding she accepted the invitation to speak at the historically-black university in order to help promote a career in foreign service to minority students.The issue comes after former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo ramped up pressure on U.S. universities to shut down the Confucius Institutes, saying they were a malign influence on higher learning, and ordering them to register as “foreign missions,” like embassies and consulates.Savannah State has since terminated its relationship with the institute, Democratic Senator Ben Cardin said. And Risch suggested that despite the controversy, he expected Thomas-Greenfield, 67, to be confirmed.As UN ambassador, Thomas-Greenfield will be leaning on her experience across four continents, including State Department assignments in Jamaica, Nigeria, Switzerland and Pakistan, as well as in Washington as assistant secretary of state for African affairs.Thomas-Greenfield, who would be one of the highest-ranking Black officials in Biden’s administration, plans to emphasize “old-fashioned, people-to-people diplomacy” while calling for making the UN more accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-un-nominee-urged-to-counter-china-defend-2019-speech-101611764005322.html

27-01-2021||World||Pakistan unveils plan to administer Covid-19 vaccine across country||Pakistan's top official body to deal with the coronavirus crisis on Wednesday announced a comprehensive plan to administer the COVID-19 vaccine across the country to curb the pandemic.The National Command and Control Centre (NCOC) has decided that the vaccine would be given through the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) which will be operated by the National Vaccine Administration and Coordination Cell (NVACC), said officials.The plan was unveiled at a meeting of the top body in Islamabad chaired by Minister for Planning Asad Umar.The meeting was informed that the NIMS is fully digital and appointments for vaccinations to the masses would be done automatically. The masses will send an SMS to 1166 or visit the NIMS website for registration, which will generate a PIN code and send it to the applicant with the address of a vaccination centre closer to home.Special Assistant on National Health Services Dr Faisal Sultan said that the government will provide vaccines free of cost to the general public.He said that in the first phase, frontline health workers will be vaccinated, while in the second phase, senior citizens will be administered with the anti-pandemic medicine. So far 400,000 health workers have been registered for vaccination, according to Sultan.Pakistan has authorised the emergency use of three vaccines against coronavirus, including Russia's Sputnik V and Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm’s Covid-19.Meanwhile, the NCOC also decided to stick to an earlier decision to reopen primary and elementary schools as well as universities from February 1.Earlier, the secondary and higher secondary schools and colleges were reopened on January 18.The developments came as the 1,563 new patients were detected in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 537,477, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Another 74 people died in the last 24 hours, taking the Covid-19 toll to 11,450.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unveils-plan-to-administer-covid-19-vaccine-across-country-101611760170305.html
27-01-2021||World||French Holocaust memorial vandalized on remembrance day||Vandals painted graffiti on France’s Holocaust Memorial ahead of international commemorations of the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews.The Israeli Embassy in France tweeted a photo of the pro-Uighur graffiti scrawled on a wall etched with the names of tens of thousands of French victims of the Holocaust. The embassy expressed “horror and anger” at the vandalism “on such a symbolic day.”Paris police said the graffiti was discovered Wednesday morning, as ceremonies were being held or planned around the world to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is observed on the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp on Jan. 27, 1945.The graffiti was quickly cleaned off.While France sees persistent but scattered anti-Semitic vandalism or violence, the graffiti found Wednesday was not explicitly anti-Jewish. It included the message “Uighur Lives Matter” and appeared aimed at calling attention to China's treatment of mostly Muslim Uighurs.The Chinese government has detained an estimated 1 million or more members of ethnic Turkic minority groups in Xinjiang, holding them in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused. China has long suspected the Uighurs of harboring separatist tendencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-holocaust-memorial-vandalized-on-remembrance-day-101611765450726.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden admin scraps Trump-era rule ending work permit for some H-1B spouses||The Joe Biden administration has withdrawn a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for spouses of some H-1B visa holders, a large number of whom are from India.The reversal comes as a huge relief for a community that had lived with mounting uncertainty as former President Donald Trump’s administration had sought to take away work their work authorisation purportedly as part of a larger effort to protect American jobs for Americans.“Withdrawn,” said a government regulatory posting from the Office of Management and Budget on Monday, for the order, “Employment Authorization for Certain Classes of Aliens With Final Orders of Removal.”Certain H-4 visa holders, spouses of H-1B visa holders with approved applications for green cards, were granted authorisation to work by president Barack Obama in 2015, primarily to help families cope with prolonged waiting time for applicants from India (because of an annual country-cap on green cards). It’s called H-4 Employment Authorization Document (H-4EAD). “Nearly 90% of H-4 workers are highly paid women from India with college degrees,” Cato Institute, a US think tank, said in a 2020 report.“It’s significant—though not unexpected—that the Biden administration wants to continue the Obama-era policy of allowing spouses of H-1B workers to apply for work permits,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship. “The 2015 Obama-era regulation, which the Trump administration opposed but failed to rescind, applies to H-4 visa holders who are spouses (not children) of H-1B visa holders with an approved green card petition.”Trump had wanted to rescind the order as part of his larger plan to reform the legal immigration system to ensure Americans had the first shot at American jobs and not foreigners, under his overarching “Buy American, Hire American” policy. His administration had joint a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era rule and later issued a rule rescinding it. The former president and other immigration hawks in his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, for instance, alleging that it had been used by American companies to outsource American jobs to foreigners on lower wages. Indians have been the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the annual 85,000. And the former administration had rescinded work authorisation for H-4 visa holders, arguing they were taking away American jobs from Americans, despite bipartisan pushback from US Congress.“We commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administration’s disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to t United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.usa, a group founded by Facebook to “help fix our country’s harmful immigration system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-scraps-trump-era-rule-ending-work-permit-for-some-h-1b-spouses-101611766678070.html

Analysts expect them to rise in a Reuters poll ahead of official inventory figures due at 1530 GMT.Brent crude slipped 37 cents or 0.7% to $55.54 a barrel by 1447 GMT, giving up an earlier gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 31 cents to $52.30."Demand concerns should remain with us for some time," Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank said.Brent on Jan. 13 hit an 11-month high of $57.42, having recovered from a 21-year low below $16 in April due to a demand recovery particularly in China and huge supply cuts by OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+."Oil continues consolidating," said Jeffrey Halley of brokerage OANDA. "The Saudi Arabian cuts, OPEC+ compliance above 85% and an insatiable demand from Asia means that oil has seen its cyclical lows for 2021."As well as the inventory report, in focus later on Wednesday will be the results of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Analysts expect the Fed to stick to its dovish tone to help speed the economic recovery.Still, the number of global coronavirus cases has surpassed 100 million as infections rise in Europe and the Americas, and Asia scrambles to contain fresh outbreaks.China, the second-largest oil consumer, has recently seen a coronavirus resurgence, but official Chinese data showed 75 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the lowest daily rise since Jan. 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-slips-as-covid-19-demand-concerns-weigh-ahead-of-supply-report-101611760219074.html
27-01-2021||World||Man to plead guilty in plot to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer||One of six men charged in an alleged plot to snatch Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has agreed to plead guilty to a kidnapping conspiracy, according to a court document filed Wednesday.The filing was made by prosecutors ahead of Ty Garbin's appearance in federal court in Grand Rapids. The plea agreement signed by Garbin indicates that he will “fully cooperate” with investigators. There is no agreement on his sentencing guidelines.The FBI in October said it broke up a plot to kidnap the Democratic governor by anti-government extremists upset over her coronavirus restrictions. Six people were charged in federal court while eight others were charged in state court with aiding the alleged scheme.In the plea agreement, Garbin admitted to more than five pages of stunning allegations. He said he and others trained with weapons in Munith, Michigan, and Cambria, Wisconsin, last summer and “discussed the plan to storm the Capitol and kidnap the governor.”The plot, he said, switched to a summer home on Mackinac Island reserved for Michigan governors or Whitmer's second home in Antrim County.Garbin said he “advocated waiting until after the national election, when the conspirators expected widespread civil unrest to make it easier for them to operate.”In September, the six men trained at Garbin's property near Luther, Michigan, constructing a “shoot house” to resemble Whitmer's vacation home and “assaulting it with firearms.”Last fall, defense attorney Mark Satawa said Garbin had no intention to carry out a kidnapping, no matter what he might have said in recorded or online conversations. A “big talk” defense had emerged as a strategy.“Saying things like, ‘I hate the governor, the governor is tyrannical’ ... is not illegal, even if you’re holding a gun and running around the woods when you do it,” Satawa said in October.Garbin’s guilty plea would be a swift resolution for prosecutors, only about four months after the arrests.The other defendants are Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. A trial has been scheduled for March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-to-plead-guilty-in-plot-to-kidnap-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer-101611761249514.html
27-01-2021||World||UK plant producing Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine evacuated after receiving suspicious package||A British pharmaceutical manufacturing company producing coronavirus vaccines had to partially evacuate its factory Wednesday after receiving a “suspicious package.”The UK arm of Mumbai-based pharmaceutical company Wockhardt, which is producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in north Wales, said it notified authorities after receiving the package on Wednesday morning.“Upon expert advice, we have partially evacuated the site pending a full investigation. The safety of our employees and business continuity remain of paramount importance," the company said in a statement.North Wales Police said they were dealing with the “ongoing incident” at the Wrexham Industrial Estate, 42 miles (68 kilometers) south of Liverpool. They closed the surrounding roads and asked residents to avoid the area until further notice. The force did not provide further details.The Ministry of Defense said an ordnance disposal team had been called out and was assisting authorities at the plant. The BBC reported that there were no injuries.The company employs 400 people but did not elaborate on how many were evacuated Wednesday.Wockhardt UK had struck an agreement with the British government, which reserved a production line at the Welsh plant to guarantee the supply of the Covid-19 vaccines. The company recently hosted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hailed the agreement as a milestone in Britain's vaccine distribution program.Last week, emergency teams were deployed to protect supplies of the coronavirus vaccine following flooding at the Wrexham industrial area. Wockhardt said at the time that all precautions were taken to prevent a disruption in manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plant-producing-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-evacuated-after-receiving-suspicious-package-101611764453794.html
27-01-2021||World||South Korea sees one of strongest recoveries among major economies||President Moon Jae-in expects South Korea’s economy to rebound to pre-pandemic levels in the first half of the year, saying it will have one of the strongest recoveries among major economies.“South Korea managed to minimize the economic damage of Covid last year,” Moon told the World Economic Forum’s Davos Agenda on Wednesday. “The combined growth rate last year and this year is expected to be the highest among the OECD nations,” Moon added, referring to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Moon said South Korea will begin its Covid-19 vaccination program next month. Although it’s later than many advanced economies, South Korea has posted relatively low infection and death rates after it slowed the virus’s initial spread without a lockdown, relying instead on rapid testing and contact-tracing to mitigate flareups.South Korea ended the pandemic year of 2020 with a 1% contraction in gross domestic product, likely to be the smallest among OECD members. Government spending that included four extra budgets helped limit the damage from a slump in consumer spending, with exports powering the recovery from the second half of the year.Korea Economy Shrinks Just 1% in 2020 on Exports, Virus ControlThe Bank of Korea expects the economy to expand 3% this year. The government’s plan to increase housing supply is helping the construction industry, while policies to provide more pandemic relief are being mulled.The small annual contraction leaves South Korea in better shape than most developed economies. Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the country’s performance stood out when considering that the world’s 10 biggest economies probably shrank between 3-10%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-one-of-strongest-recoveries-among-major-economies-101611736734461.html
27-01-2021||World||South Africa cracks down on Bitcoin after alleged ponzi scheme||South Africa’s finance-industry regulator wants more power to prosecute perpetrators of fraud and oversee dealing in cryptocurrencies after the collapse of a Bitcoin trader, alleged to be the country’s largest Ponzi scheme.The Financial Sector Conduct Authority is making proposals to regulate trading in cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, XRP and Litecoin, the watchdog’s head of enforcement, Brandon Topham, said by phone. The FSCA has handed details of its probe into the failure of Mirror Trading International Ltd. to a top police unit after uncovering alleged fraud.“At the point something becomes a Ponzi scheme, we have lost our jurisdiction,” he said. “We need the police and the prosecuting authority to work fast and put people in jail.”MTI -- which in November claimed it had 260,000 members from around the world and 23,000 Bitcoin now worth about $740 million -- was placed in provisional liquidation last month after clients battled to withdraw funds. A surge in the price of the world’s best-known digital token has been accompanied by convictions abroad in scams tied to digital platforms and speculation that authorities globally will seek tighter controls.Liquidators Want More Power to Probe South African Bitcoin TraderFour temporary overseers must now begin tracing MTI’s investors to recover the firm’s assets, including money allegedly paid to some early players that runs into millions of rands. The FSCA investigation found that the company kept neither accounting records nor a comprehensive register of participants, apart from 170,000 unique email addresses found during an October raid.On Dec. 22, MTI’s management said in a letter posted on Telegram that they were misled and that the company’s Chief Executive Officer Johann Steynberg may have fled to Brazil. In July, the Texas State Securities Board issued a cease-and-desist order against the company.While the FSCA hasn’t received formal requests to assist law-enforcement agencies abroad, it is expecting queries, Topham said.‘Live Trades’The FSCA investigations hadn’t concluded MTI to be a Ponzi scheme and the regulator only noted it was trading without a license, Clynton and Cheri Marks, who joined the firm in August as head of the referral program and head of communications respectively, said in an email sent by their lawyer, Henry Selzer.“MTI set out to see what requirements are necessary to obtain a license,” they said. “When it became apparent that such a license would be impossible to obtain, Johann Steynberg moved MTI to crypto-trading for which apparently no license was required. The live trades were demonstrated to the FSCA during 2020 and MTI cooperated with every request from the FSCA.”While the Marks have had no contact with Steynberg, or knowledge of his whereabouts since the matter came to light, they are sure he “will repay to members their Bitcoin investments as that is the character of the Johann Steynberg they came to know,” their lawyer said.Bitcoin ‘Scam’ Has South Africa’s Police Chasing BillionsThe couple denied any negligence and also said there is “no connection whatsoever” between MTI and another failed cryptocurrency firm, BTC Global, other than that they were members of both companies. Regulators and liquidators were unable to supply contact details for Steynberg.‘Get in Quick’“It’s going to take a serious investigation to ascertain how much was involved,” Topham said. The FSCA is also looking into what transpired at two other firms believed to have a relationship with MTI, he said.Investors are drawn into potential scams because of South Africa’s persistently sluggish economic growth and greed, Topham said. The testimonials of sport-stars or other prominent figures are also a lure.Another alleged South African Ponzi scheme in 2009 snared about 800 investors across eight countries, including Qatar’s Barwa Real Estate Co. Barry Tannenbaum, who was accused of running the alleged 12.5 billion rand ($820 million) scam, moved to Australia and at the time said that some of the allegations against him are “drivel.”“I have been on radio shows where people say, ‘I am a professional Ponzi investor. You get in quick and get out and like with any business you have to risk money to make money,’” Topham said. “We need to make an example of MTI so that people understand that investing in a Ponzi is never a good idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-cracks-down-on-bitcoin-after-alleged-ponzi-scheme-101611745081614.html

Going on holiday is not a valid reason."The list of travel exemptions will also be urgently reviewed, she said, to crack down on movements and ensure only those people with exceptional reasons go abroad.More restrictions will mean further pain for airlines and the travel industry at a time when many companies are struggling after eleven months of the pandemic.Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, easyJet and others, repeated calls for government help."We can only help connect the UK to the world – and deliver the Global Britain agenda that is so important to our future prosperity – if we have a viable airlines sector," said Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-cracks-down-on-travel-to-stop-virus-spread-101611762402931.html

27-01-2021||World||Biden to target drilling, fossil fuel subsidies in new climate orders||The Biden administration will announce on Wednesday a new batch of executive actions aimed at combating climate change that will pause new oil and gas leases on federal land, reduce fossil fuel subsidies, and strengthen measures to protect poor and minority neighborhoods from pollution, according to the White House.The orders will set the direction for newly sworn-in President Joe Biden's climate change and environmental agenda and mark a drastic reversal from his predecessor Donald Trump, who sought to maximize the country’s oil, gas and coal output by removing regulations and easing environmental reviews.Biden's focus on climate change has cheered international partners and environmental advocates, but upset Big Oil, which has been arguing the moves will cost the United States millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.In the orders, Biden will call for a pause on new federal oil and gas leases "to the extent possible" and direct the Interior Department to review the program's climate impacts and taxpayer benefits. He will also set a goal to conserve 30% of federal land and waters to protect wildlife by 2030.The orders will impact large swathes of acreage onshore in mostly Western states, as well as offshore drilling acreage located mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which combined make up about a quarter of the nation's oil and gas supply.Word of the measure has drawn criticism from some states that depend on drilling revenue and the oil industry, which has warned the move will costs jobs and economic growth.Biden will also direct federal agencies to "eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law", according to a White House fact sheet. It was not immediately clear which subsidies could be stripped away under this order, given many of the industry's tax breaks are Congressionally approved.The orders also include an announcement that Biden will host an international climate summit on Earth Day April 22, the creation of new climate change positions and an inter-agency task force within his government, and measures to boost government procurement of US-sourced clean energy and vehicles, boost science, and assist communities most affected by industrial pollution.The orders aim to make good on several of Biden's campaign promises to tackle climate change while also addressing racial and economic inequality.The US climate task force will be led by White House domestic climate policy advisor Gina McCarthy, while Biden's climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, will lead the administration's international work on global warming, according to Biden administration sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-target-drilling-fossil-fuel-subsidies-in-new-climate-orders-101611758801539.html

The proposed rules are expected to come into force in the next two years.The Google Safety Engineering Center at Google's European headquarters in Dublin will focus on content responsibility and is the first in the world for the company, the company's Director of Trust and Safety Amanda Storey said in a blog."The new Dublin centre will be a regional hub for Google experts working to tackle the spread of illegal and harmful content and a place where we can share this work with policymakers, researchers, and regulators," she said.She added it would help everyone understand work with "trusted flaggers" and the way incidents are tackled, but she did not specify how many would be employed in the centre, whose staff will work from home for as long as lockdown restrictions require.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-opens-dublin-hub-to-tackle-harmful-online-content-101611759870993.html
27-01-2021||World||Proud Boys leader was ‘prolific’ informer for US law enforcement: Report||Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012, according to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding obtained by Reuters.In the Miami hearing, a federal prosecutor, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Tarrio’s own lawyer described his undercover work and said he had helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling.Tarrio, in an interview with Reuters Tuesday, denied working undercover or cooperating in cases against others. “I don’t know any of this,” he said, when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”Law-enforcement officials and the court transcript contradict Tarrio’s denial. In a statement to Reuters, the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”Read | Pro-Trump march: Who are ‘Proud Boys’ and ‘Three Percenters’?Tarrio, 36, is a high-profile figure who organizes and leads the right-wing Proud Boys in their confrontations with those they believe to be Antifa, short for “anti-fascism,” an amorphous and often violent leftist movement. The Proud Boys were involved in the deadly insurrection at the Capitol January 6.The records uncovered by Reuters are startling because they show that a leader of a far-right group now under intense scrutiny by law enforcement was previously an active collaborator with criminal investigators.Washington police arrested Tarrio in early January when he arrived in the city two days before the Capitol Hill riot. He was charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, and burning a Black Lives Matter banner during a December demonstration by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The DC Superior Court ordered him to leave the city pending a court date in June.Though Tarrio did not take part in the Capitol insurrection, at least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. The FBI previously said Tarrio’s earlier arrest was an effort to preempt the events of January 6.The transcript from 2014 shines a new light on Tarrio’s past connections to law enforcement. During the hearing, the prosecutor and Tarrio’s defense attorney asked a judge to reduce the prison sentence of Tarrio and two co-defendants. They had pleaded guilty in a fraud case related to the relabeling and sale of stolen diabetes test kits.The prosecutor said Tarrio’s information had led to the prosecution of 13 people on federal charges in two separate cases, and had helped local authorities investigate a gambling ring.Tarrio’s then-lawyer Jeffrey Feiler said in court that his client had worked undercover in numerous investigations, one involving the sale of anabolic steroids, another regarding “wholesale prescription narcotics” and a third targeting human smuggling. He said Tarrio helped police uncover three marijuana grow houses, and was a “prolific” cooperator.In the smuggling case, Tarrio, “at his own risk, in an undercover role met and negotiated to pay $11,000 to members of that ring to bring in fictitious family members of his from another country,” the lawyer said in court.In an interview, Feiler said he did not recall details about the case but added, “The information I provided to the court was based on information provided to me by law enforcement and the prosecutor.”An FBI agent at the hearing called Tarrio a “key component” in local police investigations involving marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, or ecstasy. The Miami FBI office declined comment.There is no evidence Tarrio has cooperated with authorities since then. In interviews with Reuters, however, he said that before rallies in various cities, he would let police departments know of the Proud Boys’ plans. It is unclear if this was actually the case. He said he stopped this coordination after December 12 because the DC police had cracked down on the group.Tarrio on Tuesday acknowledged that his fraud sentence was reduced, from 30 months to 16 months, but insisted that leniency was provided only because he and his co-defendants helped investigators “clear up” questions about his own case. He said he never helped investigate others.That comment contrasts with statements made in court by the prosecutor, his lawyer and the FBI. The judge in the case, Joan A. Lenard, said Tarrio “provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of other persons involved in criminal conduct.”As Trump supporters challenged the Republican’s election loss in often violent demonstrations, Tarrio stood out for his swagger as he led crowds of mostly white Proud Boys in a series of confrontations and street brawls in Washington, DC, Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.The Proud Boys, founded in 2016, began as a group protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity. It grew into a group with distinctive colors of yellow and black that embraced street fighting. In September their profile soared when Trump called on them to “Stand back and stand by.”Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of DC after Trump’s loss. Video shows him on December 11 with a bullhorn in front of a large crowd. “To the parasites both in Congress, and in that stolen White House,” he said. “You want a war, you got one!” The crowd roared. The next day Tarrio burned the BLM banner.Former prosecutor Johannes said she was surprised that the defendant she prosecuted for fraud is now a key player in the violent movement that sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden.“I knew that he was a fraudster – but had no reason to know that he was also a domestic terrorist,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-boys-leader-was-prolific-informer-for-us-law-enforcement-report-101611758160133.html

In a decision published Wednesday, the committee said Italy “failed to respond promptly” to distress calls after the vessel was shot “by a boat flying a Berber flag in international waters” some 113 kilometres south of the Italian island of Lampedusa.The committee of 18 experts says distress calls to Italian authorities were redirected to Malta, which was some 218 kilometers away. By the time a Maltese patrol boat arrived the boat had capsized. More than 200 people, including 60 children, drowned.Committee member Helene Tigroudja called it a “complex case” since the migrants' boat was in international waters within Malta's search and rescue zone, but she said a timely response might have averted the tragedy."Had the Italian authorities immediately directed its naval ship and coast guard boats after the distress calls, the rescue would have reached the vessel at the latest two hours before it sank,” Tigroudja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-fault-italy-in-drownings-of-over-200-migrants-101611757464394.html

27-01-2021||World||Biden administration to give debt relief to 12,000 farmers||The Biden administration will announce debt-relief measures Wednesday for more than 12,000 financially distressed farmers.The US Department of Agriculture will temporarily suspend past-due debt collections and foreclosures for farmers borrowing under two major loan programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, administration officials said. The measure is designed to help farmers hit by the coronavirus pandemic and economy’s slump with about 10% of borrowers qualifying.“USDA and the Biden Administration are committed to bringing relief and support to farmers, ranchers and producers of all backgrounds and financial status, including by ensuring producers have access to temporary debt relief,” Robert Bonnie, the department’s deputy chief of staff, said in a statement.The government is evaluating ways to improve and address borrowing to keep farmers “earning living expenses, providing for emergency needs and maintaining cash flow,” Bonnie said.The USDA will temporarily suspend non-judicial foreclosures and wage garnishments and halt referring foreclosures to the Justice Department. The department will also seek to stop foreclosures and evictions already in progress. The administration plans to keep the debt-relief measures in place until the Covid-19 emergency ends, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-give-debt-relief-to-12-000-farmers-101611756197828.html
27-01-2021||World||India takes up with Italy, Canada incidents outside missions in Rome, Vancouver||India is taking up with foreign governments, including those of Canada and Italy, the actions of pro-Khalistan elements in events linked to the farmers’ protest over three farm laws, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday.A sizeable group of protestors, including some carrying Khalistan flags and placards, converged on a veranda leading to the Indian consulate in Vancouver on Republic Day, and weren’t prevented by law enforcement from blocking the entrance.In Italy, unidentified persons painted the slogan “Khalistan Zindabad” on the facade of the Indian embassy in Rome and put up several pro-Khalistan flags and banners at the gate ahead of Republic Day. The Indian side took up the incident with Italian authorities and conveyed its concerns, the people said.India intends to formally complain to Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the country’s foreign ministry, over allowing the pre-planned blockade of the consulate in Vancouver by protestors ostensibly opposing the farm laws.Protests will also be lodged with the provincial government of British Columbia, where Vancouver is located, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), responsible for security of diplomats and diplomatic premises. While Vancouver Police Department is responsible for law and order in the city, missions deal with local law enforcement through RCMP.The people said they were incensed that the protestors in Vancouver were allowed to “violate the sanctity of diplomatic premises” and that they weren’t preventing from taking “direct action despite promises to the contrary”.The presence of a person who recently threatened India’s consul general Manish among the protestors is of particular concern to Indian authorities. Also believed to be present was Hardeep Singh Nijjar, among the main Khalistani figures in Canada.Plans for the blockade were announced in advance by the separatist Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Despite the forewarning, lack of measures to prevent the obstruction has incensed Indian diplomats.The flag unfurling ceremony to mark Republic Day was held early in the morning, but protestors arrived and blocked the building at 8.30 am and remained in front of it for several hours.What disappointed Indian diplomats more is that the day had commenced on a positive note with a warm message from Canada’s new foreign minister Marc Garneau, which was shared on social media by his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.“On India’s Republic Day, we are reminded of the importance of strengthening current bonds as well as forging new ones in the years ahead,” Garneau said.He said the “challenges of the past year show that the links between our countries continue to grow stronger” and that “India’s leadership in sustaining global supply chains of critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals has proven to be invaluable, helping a great number of Canadians”.The people cited above said India has been constantly raising its concerns about protests near the Indian embassy in Rome with Italian authorities and this was done again recently in view of Republic Day.“Safety and security of Indian diplomats and diplomatic premises is the responsibility of the host government. We are hopeful the Italian authorities will take action against the perpetrators and prevent such incidents from happening in future,” said a person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-takes-up-with-italy-canada-incidents-outside-missions-in-rome-vancouver-101611754523119.html
27-01-2021||World||New START: All you need to know about US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty||The Russian parliament on Wednesday ratified the extension of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START, in a fast-track action days before its expiration. The treaty is the last remaining nuclear arms control between Washington and Kremlin which was signed by US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev in 2010.The New START was set to expire on February 5 but the newly-elected US President, Joe Biden, proposed extending the treaty for five more years, which was quickly welcomed by Russia. United Nations’ chief Antonio Guterres has also been encouraging the United States and Russia for a long time to extend their nuclear arms reduction treaty.Here’s all you need to know about the New START:The New START entered into force on February 5, 2011, and was expected to last at least until February 5, 2021, unless superseded by a subsequent agreement. The two parties are allowed to extend the treaty for a period of no more than five years.The treaty limits Russia and the US to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.It also limits both countries to 800 deployed and non-deployed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.Read | US prez Biden, Vladimir Putin speak over phone, discuss nuke treaty, NavalnyIt further envisages sweeping on-site inspections, exhibitions, and data exchanges to verify compliance. It also provides for an annual exchange of telemetry on an agreed number of ICBM and SLBM launches.Each side is allowed to conduct ten ‘Type One’ inspections and eight Type Two inspections every year. The ‘Type One’ inspections focus on sites with deployed and non-deployed strategic systems, while the ‘Type Two’ inspections focus on sites with only non-deployed strategic systems.According to the US state department’s website, the US and Russia conducted two inspections in the tenth year of the treaty. The two parties have exchanged 21,403 notifications as of January 21, 2021. The treaty provides for 18 on-site inspections annually.The treaty doesn’t put a constraint on testing, development, or deployment of current or planned US missile defence programs or long-range conventional strike capabilities.New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the two countries after they withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-start-all-you-need-to-know-about-us-russia-nuclear-arms-control-treaty-101611755500309.html
27-01-2021||World||Who’s who on Joe Biden’s sprawling climate team||Past presidents—even progressive ones—have viewed climate change as a problem for the future. President Barack Obama, for example, “took the view that climate change was a moral issue,” said Jeff Burnam, an adjunct professor at American University who previously served as a senior legislative staffer in the US House and Senate. “At the time, that was the idea—what are we going to do about our children?”Especially following a year when wildfires caused record levels of destruction along one US coast while hurricanes pummeLled another, President Joe Biden doesn’t have that luxury. Already he’s assembled an unprecedented team of White House climate advisers and installed climate experts in roles that haven’t typically been thought to require environmental expertise, a sign that environmental policy will be central to his administration’s agenda.Here’s a brief guide to who’s on Biden’s team and what they’re doing there:John Kerry Special Presidential Envoy for ClimateIn 2015, as Secretary of State under Obama, Kerry helped secure passage of the Paris climate agreement. In his new role under Biden, Kerry will be back in the Cabinet—plus, he’ll have a seat on the National Security Council, a first for the group dedicated to advising the president on the nation’s biggest threats. As climate envoy, Kerry will be the global face of the US’s climate agenda, charged with making sure the world sees the US as a leader on climate again.Gina McCarthy National Climate AdviserAs head of the Environmental Protection Agency, McCarthy signed the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which set the first national limits on carbon pollution from power plants but was blocked from going into effect by the Supreme Court and later became a bogeyman of the Trump administration. She’ll play the US counterpart to Kerry’s international efforts.Janet Yellen Treasury SecretaryDuring her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Yellen called climate change an “existential threat” to the US economy, which stands to take a 10.5% hit by 2100 if emissions keep increasing. She told senators she’d create a special hub within the department dedicated climate-related financial risk and appoint someone at a “very senior level” to lead it.Jennifer Granholm Secretary of EnergyGranholm’s climate track record is already long. In 2007, as governor of Michigan, she created the Michigan Climate Action Council, which was tasked with developing a set of recommendations for the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions gird its economy against the effects of warming. Two years later, she worked with the Obama administration to coordinate the auto industry bailout, which included a plan to cut greenhouse gases by steadily raising fuel efficiency standards to a target of 54.5 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2025.Deb Haaland Secretary of the InteriorBarely off her freshman term in the House as a representative from New Mexico, Haaland will become the first Native American Cabinet secretary if she’s confirmed. As the top official for the country’s public lands, Haaland would oversee a key focus of the administration’s climate policy. Biden is expected to expand on a previous order suspending new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits for public lands and waters, directing his agencies to determine whether that could be made a permanent ban.Pete Buttigieg Secretary of TransportationWhile running for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Buttigieg said he’d restore Obama-era vehicle emissions standards; now, assuming the Senate approves his nomination as Transportation Secretary, he’ll have the power to do just that. The Department of Transportation governs many facets of US infrastructure, including public transit and road construction, putting him at the forefront of climate resilience efforts, as well.Michael ReganEnvironmental Protection Agency AdministratorAs head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Regan facilitated a multi-billion-dollar coal ash cleanup, ordered chemical companies to prevent so-called “forever chemicals” from contaminating the Cape Fear River, and established an environmental justice advisory board, all in a state that voted for Trump in 2020 by a margin of more than 100,000 votes. That determination and willpower will help him in his next job—if confirmed, he’ll be responsible for reenergizing the agency, which struggled with attrition and ideological clashes under Trump.Deanne CriswellFederal Emergency Management Agency AdministratorCriswell led New York City’s response to the coronavirus pandemic as its commissioner of emergency management. As of mid-December, FEMA had responded to 125 official declarations of emergency in 2020, up from 15 in 2019. Criswell must be confirmed by the Senate before starting work.Brian DeeseDirector of the National Economic CouncilDeese served in a number of roles in the Obama administration, including as a climate adviser and as deputy director of the NEC. After Obama left the White House, Deese became the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, an association that rankles some environmentalists; despite Chairman Larry Fink’s pledge to put sustainability at the center of the firm’s investment strategy, it remains the world’s largest backer of fossil fuel projects. Deese will be in charge of the jobs part of Biden’s climate and jobs agenda.Brenda Mallory Chair of the White House Council on Environmental QualityMallory was most recently the director of regulatory policy for the Southern Environmental Law Center, an advocacy group aimed at protecting the environment and citizens of the south. Before that, she was acting general counsel at the EPA and helped lead the Climate 21 Project, a policy memo put together by more than 150 people with government experience giving recommendations to the Biden administration on tackling the climate crisis.Rich Glick Chairman of the US Federal Energy Regulatory CommissionGlick has already served on the FERC board; before that, he was vice president for government affairs for Spanish utility giant Iberdrola’s US renewables business and director of government affairs at US power giant PacifiCorp. As leader of FERC, once confirmed, he’d be responsible for approving natural gas infrastructure and overseeing electricity markets, making him a key player in Biden’s effort to achieve a clean electrical grid by 2035.Eric Lander Science Adviser and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology PolicyLander is best known for co-leading the Human Genome Project, the international research initiative that succeeded in building the first map of human DNA in 2003, and was co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during the Obama years. The OSTP has in the past been primarily focused on nuclear technology, so the nomination of a life scientist to lead the office (he still has to be confirmed) is yet another demonstration of the Biden’s administration’s deliberate shift toward climate and related issues.Jeff Marootian Special Assistant to the President for Climate and Science Agency PersonnelAs Washington, D.C.’s one-time top transportation official, Marootian helped broker a joint agreement between Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia signed in 2020 to reduce pollution related to transportation over the next decade and invest in clean transportation. He also worked as the White House liaison for the Department of Transportation under the Obama administration.Frances Arnold and Maria Zuber Co-chairs of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and TechnologyArnold is a professor of chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work using direct evolution to design new enzymes. Zuber coordinated efforts to combat climate change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she was also vice president for research. Neither has previous experience in politics, although Zuber once led a NASA mission to examine the moon’s gravitational field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whos-who-on-biden-s-sprawling-climate-team-101611751945821.html
27-01-2021||World||Auschwitz marks anniversary virtually as survivors fear end of an era||Marian Turski, a 94-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, was marking the 76th anniversary of its liberation by Soviet troops on Wednesday only virtually, aware that he might never return as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.Survivors and museum officials told Reuters they fear the pandemic could end the era where Auschwitz's former prisoners can tell their own stories to visitors on site. Most Auschwitz survivors are in their eighties and nineties."Even if there was no pandemic, there would be fewer survivors at every anniversary," Turski told Reuters in a Zoom interview from his Warsaw home."People at my age who are already vulnerable to many other illnesses are also in the first line of fire for this virus."He declined an in-person interview, in part due to the pandemic risks.The Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial preserves the Auschwitz death camp set up on Polish soil by Nazi Germany during World War Two. More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers at the camp or from starvation, cold and disease.Wednesday's ceremony marking the camp's liberation will take place virtually starting at 1500 GMT, with speeches by survivors, Poland's President Andrzej Duda and Israeli and Russian diplomats, as well as a debate on the Holocaust's influence on children.Other virtual ceremonies will also take place to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.The Memorial has been closed to visitors for 161 days due to the pandemic. In 2019 it was visited by around 2.3 million people. In 2020 that number dropped to around 502,000.The Museum's director, Piotr Cywinski, acknowledged virtual events and education programmes were not as effective in passing on the lessons of the Holocaust and World War Two."Nothing will replace witnessing the place in its authentic state, because this isn't just about seeing and listening. This is about looking around, in your own steps, touching, experiencing different perspectives, understanding," Cywinski told Reuters.WARNING THE WORLDSurvivors emphasized the importance of finding ways to keep Auschwitz relevant after they can no longer tell their own stories, amid a rise in far-right movements and anti-Semitism.In Germany, former finance minister and now president of the lower house of parliament, Wolfgang Schaeuble, warned that "our culture of remembrance does not protect us from a brazen reinterpretation and even a denial of history".He added that racism and anti-Semitism were spreading through internet forums and conspiracy theories, stressing society's collective responsibility to honour the memory of the Holocaust.Pope Francis urged people to keep a close watch on ideological extremism, because "these things can happen again".He spoke three weeks after displays of anti-Semitism surfaced at the US Capitol riot on January 6 and two weeks after one of Montreal's largest synagogues was vandalised and almost set on fire.Speaking at his general audience, held inside the papal library because of coronavirus restrictions, Francis said it was imperative that the world did not forget."To remember ... means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity," he said.Some Auschwitz survivors, like Bogdan Bartnikowski, 89, said they were optimistic that the pandemic would not end their chances of returning to the memorial and telling their stories."I have hope that for sure there will continue to be groups of visitors to the museum," Bartnikowski said. "Us former prisoners will not be lacking."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/auschwitz-marks-anniversary-virtually-as-survivors-fear-end-of-an-era-101611753741968.html

27-01-2021||World||Russian parliament approves New START nuclear treaty extension||Russian lawmakers on Wednesday quickly approved the extension of the last remaining nuclear Russia-US arms control, a fast-track action that comes just days before it’s due to expire.Both houses of parliament voted unanimously to extend the New START treaty for five years, a day after a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin said they agreed to complete the necessary extension procedures in the next few days.The pact’s extension doesn’t require congressional approval in the US, but Russian lawmakers must ratify the move and Putin has to sign the relevant bill into law.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told lawmakers that the extension will be validated by exchanging diplomatic notes once all the procedures are completed.Upper house Speaker Valentina Matvienko said after the vote that the decision to extend the pact shows that Russia and the US can reach agreements on major issues despite the tensions between them.New START expires on Feb. 5. After taking office last week, Biden proposed extending the treaty for five years, and the Kremlin quickly welcomed the offer.The treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.Biden indicated during the campaign that he favored the preservation of the New START treaty, which was negotiated during his tenure as U.S. vice president.Russia has long proposed prolonging the pact without any conditions or changes, but the Trump administration waited until last year to start talks and made the extension contingent on a set of demands. The talks stalled, and months of bargaining have failed to narrow differences.The negotiations were also marred by tensions between Russia and the United States, which have been fueled by the Ukrainian crisis, Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and other irritants.After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries.Earlier this month, Russia announced that it would follow the US in pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allowed surveillance flights over military facilities, to help build trust and transparency between Russia and the West.Before the Biden administration took office, Russia always had offered to extend New START for five years — a possibility that was envisaged by the pact at the time it was signed.

Trump initially insisted that China be added to the treaty, an idea that Beijing bluntly dismissed.The Trump administration then proposed to extend New START for just one year and also sought to expand it to include limits on battlefield nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-parliament-approves-new-start-nuclear-treaty-extension-101611748356451.html

27-01-2021||World||UK could save 1.5 million crisis-hit workers at a modest cost||The UK could offer help for over a million people currently left out of income support programs at relatively little cost, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.While the government’s aid programs have drawn praise for preventing a large spike in unemployment during the crisis, pressure to address the flaws in the system is mounting ahead of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s March budget.Excluded groups include the 1.3 million workers who get less than half of their income from self-employment and the 225,000 people who earn profits in excess of 50,000 pounds ($69,000), both of which could be added without much difficulty, the IFS said in a report Wednesday.Expanding existing government help to include the first group, as well as extending payments to people who have profits of as much as 90,000 pounds in a tapered manner, would cost around 1 billion pounds per quarter, the IFS found. That’s about 5% of the total spent helping the self employed so far.“It is hard to believe it would be significantly less well targeted than the current Self-Employment Income Support Scheme and it would certainly support a significant number of people facing financial difficulties,” the report said.While the government insists people can fall back on government welfare payments, the application process can be lengthy, and many miss out due to their existing savings, which have to be run down before the benefits, known as Universal Credit, can be claimed.Almost 4 million adults, or 7%, have been left out of income replacement programs and are not claiming Universal Credit, according to a separate YouGov survey commissioned by the Standard Life Foundation. Of those, 1.8 million have lost at least a third of their household income and 63% said they are struggling to pay their bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-save-1-5-million-crisis-hit-workers-at-a-modest-cost-101611747314969.html
27-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine delivery talks with EU will go ahead: AstraZeneca||AstraZeneca says it has not pulled out of talks with the European Union and plans to meet with EU officials later Wednesday in Brussels.The comments came after EU officials said that the company had pulled out of the meeting to discuss delayed vaccine commitments to the bloc. The talks were slated to be the third in as many days.The spat between AstraZeneca and the EU has raised concerns about vaccine nationalism, as countries desperate to end the pandemic and return to normalcy jockey to make sure to obtain as many of the precious vaccine shots as possible.The latest disagreement between the two sides came after AstraZeneca rejected the EU’s accusation that the company had failed to honor its commitments for the delivery of coronavirus vaccine. The company says figures in its contract with the EU were targets that couldn’t be met because of problems in rapidly expanding production capacity.AstraZeneca said in a statement that they “understand and share in the frustration that initial supply volumes of our vaccine delivered to the European Union will be lower than forecast.”Chief Executive Pascal Soriot made the comments in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica following days of criticism from EU leaders furious about the news that initial shipments from AstraZeneca would be lower than anticipated. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said last week that it planned to cut initial deliveries in the EU to 31 million doses from 80 million due to reduced yield in the manufacturing process.“Our contract is not a contractual commitment,’’ Soriot said. “It’s the best effort. Basically we said we’re going to try our best, but we can’t guarantee we’re going to succeed. In fact, getting there, we are a little bit delayed.”On Monday, the EU threatened to impose tight export controls within days on Covid-19 vaccines made in the bloc.The EU, which has 450 million citizens and the economic and political clout of the world’s biggest trading bloc, is lagging badly behind countries like Israel and Britain in rolling out coronavirus vaccine shots for its health care workers and most vulnerable people. That’s despite having over 400,000 confirmed virus deaths since the pandemic began.The shortfall of planned deliveries of the AstraZeneca vaccine come at the same time a slowdown in the distribution of Pfizer-BioNTech shots as that company upgrades production facilities at a plant in Belgium is putting EU nations under heavy political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-delivery-talks-with-eu-will-go-ahead-astrazeneca-101611747858449.html

She is a 35-year veteran of the US Foreign Service who has served on four continents, most notably in Africa."We know China is working across the UN system to drive an authoritarian agenda that stands in opposition to the founding values of the institution - American values," Thomas-Greenfield will say, according to excerpts from her statement."Their success depends on our continued withdrawal. That will not happen on my watch," she will say.Beijing has been pushing for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to traditional US leadership. Tensions between the two superpowers have hit a boiling point at the United Nations over the deadly coronavirus pandemic.Former President Donald Trump was critical of the United Nations and wary of the value of multilateralism. He announced plans to quit the World Health Organization (WHO), and pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal.On his first day in office last week, Biden rescinded the US decision to withdraw from the WHO and announced a return to the climate agreement."When America shows up, when we are consistent and persistent, when we exert our influence in accordance with our values, the United Nations can be an indispensable institution for advancing peace, security, and our collective well-being," Thomas-Greenfield will say."If instead we walk away from the table, and allow others to fill the void, the global community suffers — and so do American interests," she will say.If confirmed, Thomas-Greenfield will join counterparts with decades of experience in diplomacy from Britain, France, China and Russia - which along with the United States - make up the UN Security Council's five permanent veto-wielding members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-un-pick-to-warn-that-us-absence-allows-china-to-thrive-at-world-body-101611746173724.html

They issued videos of themselves in what looked like makeshift underground structures supported by wooden slats.A Reuters photographer on Wednesday saw some protesters in trees refusing to come down. The garden had been cordoned off and reporters were not being allowed inside to see the entrance to the tunnel.HS2 Ltd said the eviction was necessary because the protesters were trespassing on its land and certain works needed to take place on time."HS2 has taken legal temporary possession of Euston Square Gardens East in order to progress with works necessary for the construction of the new Euston Station," it said.The Reuters photographer saw personnel from the National Eviction Team, a private contractor that specialises in evicting protesters, squatters and travellers, according to its website.Police officers were also present. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were there to prevent any breach of the peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/environmental-protesters-tunnel-under-london-to-resist-eviction-101611744589718.html

COVAX has said it aims to deliver 1.8 billion doses to poorer countries this year.At least five countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will benefit from the first wave of COVAX vaccines though the list of countries is yet been confirmed, said Richard Brennan, a second WHO official.Countries with larger populations, lower income and weaker health systems that are expected to make slower progress vaccinating will be prioritised in the COVAX vaccine rollout, officials said.Eight countries in the Eastern Mediterranean have started vaccination campaigns. Ten countries in the region have documented one or more coronavirus variants, though its likely that the variants have spread further, Brennan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-to-supply-355-million-vaccine-doses-for-eastern-mediterranean-this-year-101611744682602.html

To remember is a sign of civility. To remember is a condition for a better future of peace and fraternity," said Francis, who visited Auschwitz in 2016.The Nazis and their allies murdered around 6 million Jews, as well as others, in German-occupied Europe.More than a million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland, which was liberated by Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945. The vast majority were gassed to death.Francis said society should never let its guard down against the dangers of nationalism."To remember also means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity," he said."Be wary of how this path of death, extermination and brutality started," he said, referring to the Nazis' rise to power in the 1930s on a wave a extreme nationalism.At the U.S. Capitol riot, some supporters of former President Donald Trump wore clothes bearing anti-Semitic messages or displayed Nazi symbols.One wore a T-shirt reading "Camp Auschwitz" and another wore a T-shirt with the inscription "6MWE," a far-right acronym that stands for "6 Million Wasn't Enough".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-holocaust-remembrance-day-pope-warns-against-new-nationalism-101611744993625.html
27-01-2021||World||India, China vaccinations to stretch into late 2022, says study||Mass immunisation programmes against Covid-19 in China and India will likely stretch until late 2022 because of the sheer size of the populations, a new study has said, adding that over 85 poor countries will only have limited access to vaccines before 2023.The unusually rapid development of vaccines against the coronavirus had raised hopes for the pandemic to come to an end but limited production capacities, unequal distribution networks and massive demand for the shots are now sowing seeds of doubt.The WHO has pointed out that bilateral deals between rich countries and pharma companies are also a concern.The new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit says while production represents the main hurdle, “…vaccine diplomacy will play a big role to determine which developing countries get access to shots in the coming months.”“Most developing countries will not have widespread access to the shots before 2023 at the earliest, Agathe Demarais, director of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the research division of the Economist Group, said in its study.China and India, the study added, represent special cases. Both countries have developed their own shots and are pressing ahead with rollout plans, “but the sheer size of their population means that mass immunisation programmes will stretch until late 2022, in line with the expected timeline for most middle-income countries,” it said.Countries at the front of the queue—including the UK, the US and most European Union nations—are expected to have immunised their priority groups by end of March, with other wealthy countries catching up by June-end. “We therefore expect that global economic prospects will brighten from mid-2021, with the global economic rebound gaining speed in the third and fourth quarters. However, life will not be back to normal by then, as immunisation programmes for the bulk of the population will continue until mid-2022.”In an earlier report, the EIU had said that vaccine diplomacy will play a big role in determining which developing countries get access to a vaccine in the coming months, with Russia and China using the rollout of their own coronavirus shots to advance their interests. “The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the bulk of the adult population in advanced economies will have been vaccinated by mid-2022. For middle-income countries, this timeline will stretch to late 2022 or early 2023. For poorer economies, mass immunisation will take until 2024, if it happens at all,” the earlier report said.China has administered a total of 22.77 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines by Tuesday, the National Health Commission said here Wednesday.The world’s most populous nation – with more than 1.4 billion people – has widened its targeted inoculation scheme since mid-December to include more priority groups facing higher risk of virus exposure, in a bid to prevent any outbreaks in winter and spring.“Overall, the work is progressing in a smooth and orderly manner,” Zeng Yixin, vice director of the national health commission, told a news conference on Wednesday.China aims to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, state-backed tabloid Global Times said this month. “The nationwide vaccine scheme now prioritises essential groups such as workers in medical, transport and food services, employees and students going abroad. The elderly and others will have to wait,” Reuters news agency said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-vaccinations-to-stretch-into-late-2022-says-study-101611745055534.html

The spouses of H1-B visa holders receive H4 visas and only in certain cases, those spouses could apply for an employment authorisation document.The work permit was generally given to H4 visa holders when their H1-B spouses were on track to receive a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. But the decades of green card-backlog left thousands of families struggling to survive on a single income. The Obama administration introduced the H4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule in 2015 to resolve such issues.After the Trump administration started taking concrete steps to rescind the program, US vice president Kamala Harris, then a California senator, objected to the “outrageous” move. Calling on the DHS to withdraw the proposal, Harris had said that the decision will force immigrant doctors, scientists and academics to abandon their professional careers.“This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this,” she had tweeted in February 2019.This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers.

27-01-2021||World||Trump vs Biden: A comparison of cabinet picks||Almost a week after being sworn in as President of the United States, Joe Biden’s cabinet is beginning to come together. The Senate confirmed Antony Blinken as Secretary of State on Tuesday making him the President’s fourth nominee to be approved. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and director of national intelligence Avril have also been approved by the Senate.While Biden has focused on diversity and government experience in choosing his cabinet members, his predecessor Donald Trump was more anti-establishment. The difference between the approaches of both is stark.Here’s a comparative look at the top picks of Biden and Trump:1. Treasury secretaryFor treasury secretary, Trump’s choice was Steven Mnuchin, a financier with ties to Wall Street who bankrolled movies including “X-Men” and “Avatar.” Mnuchin had no government experience whatsoever and had spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs later becoming part of a group of investors that purchased a bank which was seized during the financial crisis of 2008.Biden’s pick is Janet L Yellen, who has a long career in economics and almost two decades at the federal reserve. She was also a chairwoman of the council of economic advisers during the Clinton administration.2. Secretary of StateTrump’s pick for Secretary of State was Rex W Tillerson, who was then the chief executive of Exxon Mobil and had a very close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden has chosen Antony J Blinken, his longtime aide who also worked at the state department during the Clinton administration. Blinken was Biden’s national security adviser and was a key player in the Obama administration’s policy in Iraq and Syria.3. Secretary of CommerceTrump’s pick for the position was Wilbur Ross, an investor and Trump campaign donor, who made a fortune through private equity investments. He took on the role without any government experience.Biden’s pick is Gina M Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island since 2015 who has experience in both government and finance. She was also the state treasurer and founded a joint venture firm that helped finance a number of start-ups.4. Secretary of department of housing and urban developmentTrump chose Ben Carson, a retired renowned neurosurgeon with no government experience for this post. The pick was widely criticised by the media and by the Democrats as well.Biden’s choice is Marcia L Fudge who has represented the state of Ohio in the House since 2008 and is also a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She was also the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.5. Secretary of department of educationTrump chose Betsy DeVos, a wealthy philanthropist and a Republican fund-raiser for this position. She was highly criticised as she was a major supporter of private schools. Biden’s pick on the other hand is Miguel Cardona, the commissioner of Connecticut’s education department, who attended public schools as a child and taught in them as well during his teaching careers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vs-biden-a-comparison-of-cabinet-picks-101611741124495.html
27-01-2021||World||YouTube suspends Donald Trump indefinitely, stops Giuliani monetizing clips||YouTube has suspended Donald Trump indefinitely from the platform and said it will also prevent the former president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani from being able to monetize his clips, US media reported.It comes a week after the social media giant confirmed it would extend a ban on Trump's channel -- which has just under three million subscribers -- joining other social media platforms in banning his accounts following the deadly January 6 Capitol riot.The Google-owned firm has faced some criticism over its slow response following the violence in Washington, as well as the proliferation of conspiracy theories on the platform."In light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence, the Donald J Trump channel will remain suspended," a YouTube spokesperson told Politico.The company said separately that Giuliani's account would be barred from the Partner Program -- which allows creators to make money off their videos -- after repeatedly violating its policy against posting misleading information about the US election.The 76-year-old has posted videos titled "The Biden Crime Family's Payoff Scheme" and "Election Theft of the Century" to his channel, which has around 600,000 subscribers.The ban on making money off his clips comes as the former New York mayor faces a $1.3 billion lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems after alleging on social media that the firm had engaged in election fraud.According to YouTube, Giuliani will be able to appeal the decision in 30 days -- providing the underlying issues have been fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-suspends-donald-trump-indefinitely-stops-giuliani-monetizing-clips-101611741056730.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden commerce pick Raimondo vows ‘aggressive’ China steps||The US must take “aggressive” steps to combat China’s “unfair” trade practices while also investing to bring manufacturing back to the country, said Gina Raimondo, President Joe Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary.Raimondo pledged to respond to Chinese policies that hurt American workers, while stopping short of a specific game plan. The new administration will take time to review policies carried over from former President Donald Trump, including tariffs, she said.“China has clearly behaved in ways that are anti-competitive -- dumping cheap steel and aluminum into America, which hurts American workers and hurts the ability of our companies to compete,” Raimondo, who has served as governor of Rhode Island since 2015, said Tuesday at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. If confirmed, she said, “I plan to be very aggressive to help Americans compete against the unfair practices of China.”Her comments echo those of other Biden officials, who have signaled they will continue some of Trump’s hard-line China measures, though they’ve so far omitted specifics. Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. is “prepared to use the full array of tools” to address actions such as “dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving illegal subsidies to corporations.”Raimondo and her team will inherit numerous enforcement actions against Chinese technology companies. Most notably, the Trump administration instituted an export ban for Huawei Technologies Co. that requires American firms to obtain government licenses before they’re allowed to sell U.S. tech and intellectual property to the Chinese telecommunications-equipment giant.Raimondo, under questioning, didn’t specifically commit to keeping Huawei on the entity list that requires those licenses. She said she would consult on the matter and make an assessment based on national security.China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that it hoped the U.S. would “respect market economy and fair competition principles and work to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for all countries’ businesses” in response to a question on Raimondo’s comments.“China will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard its businesses’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing.‘Back door’“We can’t have the Chinese or really anyone having a back door into our network and compromising in any way our national or economic security,” Raimondo also said Tuesday. “I will use the bold toolkit at my disposal to the fullest extent possible to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of back-door influence into our network -- and that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company,” she said, referring to China’s ZTE Corp., another telecommunications equipment firm.Raimondo also said that the U.S. will “need to invest in innovation and technology in our manufacturing sector.”Her stated objective of “reshoring” factory jobs to the U.S. is an echo of Trump, though his goal proved elusive. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs stood at 12.3 million in December, little changed from four years earlier. Two decades ago, the figure topped 17 million.Tapped to lead a department with wide-ranging international and domestic responsibilities, Raimondo also underlined the need for “bold” action to help America’s tourism, travel and restaurant industries recover from the pandemic social distancing that crushed business. She told senators that the U.S. needs to step back and devise a national spectrum strategy for transformative 5G communications airwaves.Raimondo said that social media companies need to be held accountable for the content on their platforms, and that she would work with Congress to make changes to Section 230, a liability waiver that the companies depend upon to allow relatively unfettered speech by users. Trump had demanded that the protections be revoked.“We need platform accountability, but of course that reform would have to be balanced against the fact that these businesses rely upon user generated content for their innovation and have created many thousands of jobs,” she said.She also pledged to work to expand broadband access.Raimondo, 49, has been in public office in her home state since 2011, when she was sworn in as state treasurer. Before that, she spent more than a decade working in venture capital, including co-founding Point Judith Capital.The Commerce Department comprises a variety of agencies including the Census Bureau, which runs the decennial count and compiles economic data; the International Trade Administration, charged with monitoring unfair global competition from dumping and subsidies, as well as enforcing U.S. trade laws; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, home to the National Weather Service; and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.Raimondo was national co-chairwoman of Michael Bloomberg’s 2020 presidential campaign. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-commerce-pick-raimondo-vows-aggressive-china-steps-101611738214391.html
27-01-2021||World||Vaccination against Covid in Moscow now possible in shopping centres, theatres||Mass vaccination against coronavirus is taking place in the Russian capital Moscow where people can get vaccinated not only in hospitals and polyclinics but also in large shopping centres, as well as in opera theatres and other popular points where mobile medical teams work.According to TV BRICS, the first such team of doctors from city polyclinics began working in the main department store of the country, GUM. It is very convenient, as customers can visit the store and at the same time, without wasting time, get vaccinated against Covid-19.Nailaya Alibekova, a volunteer, said that she wanted to safeguard herself from getting the virus for the second time as she caught it the first time."We need to safeguard ourselves. In any case, you can catch it for the second time. I was sick once, I didn't like it, I don't want to be sick again, so I need to get vaccinated and protect myself," she said as quoted by TV BRICS.Vaccinations have been taking place at GUM for several days. The vaccination centre at the main department store in Russia is located on the third floor of the first line. And there is a queue there every day.The outlet, headquartered in Moscow, reported that doctors say that even foreigners came to get vaccinated. Everyone who wants to get vaccinated is first given questionnaires regarding their diseases and possible contraindications.Natalia Kuzenkova, Chief physician of Polyclinic No. 68, Moscow said, "Contraindications for vaccination are the following: age up to 18 years, pregnant women, lactating women, persons with serious allergic reactions, I emphasize, in serious condition; persons suffering from cancer and currently receiving immune-compression therapy."Kuzenkova said further, "In the third week after B-2, we expect the antibodies from the Gama-covid-vac vaccine to be safe in the body for about 2 years."It was further reported that on-site vaccination can now be done to older people and people with chronic diseases. In fact, they are in the highest risk group for the incidence of coronavirus. Roman Vasilkevich, one of the volunteers, decided to get vaccinated only after consulting a doctor. He has diabetes and a slight allergy."Almost all my relatives have been ill. I remained one of the few who have not yet had time to experience this disease. I do not want to be on the list of those who have been ill, so I try to avoid it as much as possible," Vasilkevich said.TV BRICS reported that six and a half million doses of the Sputnik vaccine have already been produced in Russia, and another 33 million will be released by the end of March. According to scientists, to bring the pandemic under control, it is necessary to vaccinate more than 60 per cent of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccination-against-covid-in-moscow-now-possible-in-shopping-centres-theatres-101611739987535.html

Aviv Kohavi has described the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as a deal that is unacceptable to Israel both on the strategic and operational levels.Israel itself is not party to the nuclear deal."If the 2015 nuclear deal came through, Iran would eventually be able to move towards getting a nuclear bomb, because the agreement did not include restrictions that could ultimately prevent it. Anything that looks like the current agreement or an improved version of it is bad and should not be allowed," Kohavi said in a lecture delivered at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies.The Israeli military said he had ordered for operational measures to prevent any such deal, contending that "the return to the 2015 agreement or even an improved version of its would be a bad deal from the operational and strategic points of view."The JCPOA was signed in 2015 by Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, stipulating the removal of international sanctions from Tehran in exchange for it scaling down its nuclear program.In 2018, the United States unilaterally withdrew from the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tehran responded by gradually abandoning its own commitments. This past December, the Iranian government passed a law aimed at achieving a full removal of sanctions via a boost of nuclear activities, specifically by increasing the levels of uranium enrichment and limiting the access of the International Atomic Energy Agency to its facilities.Last week, US State Secretary then-nominee Antony Blinken said that the United States would reciprocate Iran's resumed compliance with the nuclear deal, but would seek a broader agreement that also covers its missile program.Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded by ruling out any revisions to the original deal and insisting that Washington remove sanctions first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-army-chief-slams-iran-nuclear-deal-as-strategically-unacceptable-101611736829365.html
27-01-2021||World||China’s Zero-Tolerance Covid Approach Now Includes Anal Swabs||China is ramping up efforts to neutralize the coronavirus as new outbreaks test its already stringent pandemic strategy, with another weapon added to an arsenal of border curbs, mass testing and hard lockdowns: anal swabs.While there is no nationwide policy on use of the technique, some residents in China’s northern regions -- where the flare-up now amounts to more than 1,700 cases -- have been subjected to the anal swabs with little warning. It involves the insertion of a saline-soaked cotton swab about two-to-three centimeters into the anus, with the sample then tested for active traces of the virus.More than 1,000 schoolchildren and teachers in Beijing were given anal, throat and nose swabs last week, along with a separate antibody test, after one asymptomatic virus case was detected on campus, according to local officials.On Monday, passengers on a flight from Changchun, the capital city of Jilin province, to Beijing were told to disembark after officials discovered that someone from an area deemed as high risk for virus transmission was on board. They were then brought to a hotel where health workers took nose and anal swabs, said a passenger who asked to be identified only by his last name, Wang.Some people arriving into Beijing are being asked to undertake anal swabs as well, with one traveler who came from Hong Kong a few weeks ago telling Bloomberg News she was told to do the swab herself while in mandatory hotel quarantine. The person, who didn’t want to be identified citing privacy concerns, also had to do three nose and throat tests, one blood test and her hotel room has been tested twice.More AccurateUse of the new detection technique is based on research that traces of the virus found in the anus can last longer than in the respiratory tract, Li Tongzeng, deputy director of the respiratory and infectious disease department of Beijing You An Hospital said in an interview with state television last week. Anal swabs could be more accurate than throat and nose tests, he said, adding it was only being used on at-risk groups, including at quarantine sites.Still, there’s no evidence that virus transmission is any more common among patients who test positive in the anus area, and anal swabbing has not been conducted in other places that have successfully achieved near-elimination of the pathogen, like New Zealand.Since quelling its original outbreak in the central city of Wuhan last year, China has mounted a relentless drive to stamp out the coronavirus within its vast population, often deploying resources and powers that wouldn’t be viable or even countenanced in other countries.While Western nations like the US and UK still struggle with adequate virus testing, China is not just testing entire city populations every week, but also millions of frozen food imports and the containers that arrive in every day for minute traces of the pathogen. All incoming travelers are subject to multiple tests and lengthy quarantines.That zeal, driven in part by local government officials concerned about repercussions should their cities become the next Wuhan, has worked at keeping outbreaks in check, but the use of techniques like anal swabbing is being questioned by some experts -- even in the country’s state-run media. So far, it appears to be only being used in the north, including the capital.“I don’t understand why Beijing added anal swabs. It’s not like poking the throat. You need a certain place and the risk of such transmission routes is lower,” said Jiang Qingwu, a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at Shanghai’s Fudan University. “Maybe they want to find remnants? It’s true that the virus can be detected there.”Scientists have found that some Covid-19 patients have active and prolonged gut viral infection, even if they don’t manifest gastrointestinal symptoms. For such people, stool samples often test positive even a week after their respiratory samples have gone negative, researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found.Covid-19 May Cause Prolonged Gut Infection, Scientists SayTougher LockdownsChina’s capacity to endure disruption to business and everyday life in its ferocious fight against the coronavirus is a hallmark of its approach.It’s the only country that has repeatedly detected traces of the virus on frozen food imports, with efforts that include disinfecting packaging adding to delays at ports, where containers of produce have been piling up. Local consumers are shunning foreign food for fear of infection, and China’s meat imports are projected to plunge as much as 30% this year from a record in 2020.China’s lockdowns are also getting tougher, rivaling the severity of curbs placed on Wuhan a year ago even as case levels pale in comparison to elsewhere. China has reported just two Covid-19 deaths since April, and new infections at the height of the current flare-up number around 100 a day, compared with hundreds of thousands in the USCovid Lockdowns Are Spreading a Year After China Shocked WorldIn Tonghua, a city of 2 million people in Jilin province bordering North Korea, all residents have been banned from leaving their homes since Jan. 21 after 100 infections were detected. Some have complained on social media of insufficient food supplies after the sudden order, prompting an apology from local officials.There are signs that the central government is trying to encourage some moderation.An editorial from the Xinhua state news agency said Jan. 16 that local authorities should cease using the phrase “wartime measures” to describe their containment efforts. Such slogans could cause unnecessary panic, “paralyze people’s minds” and affect normal activities, the editorial said.But with the Lunar New Year holiday approaching in mid-February, when officials expect 1.7 billion trips to be taken despite pleas for people to stay home, the wartime footing is likely to continue. The country is also doubling down on vaccination, with plans to inoculate 50 million people by the holiday with locally-developed vaccines.“We don’t tolerate the virus circulating. Once we find it, we immediately quash it and outbreaks are not allowed,” said Lu Hongzhou, an infectious disease physician who advises both the central and Shanghai governments on Covid-19 treatment.“Our country has always pursued this strategy and it can’t be adjusted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-zero-tolerance-covid-approach-now-includes-anal-swabs-101611739508716.html
27-01-2021||World||Chinese vaccine trial in Dhaka fell through. Its state media blames New Delhi||Trials for Chinese Covid-19 vaccine Sinovac were halted in Bangladesh last year due to meddling by India, China’s state media has claimed in a report on Tuesday, accusing New Delhi of torpedoing Beijing's efforts to push its vaccine in Dhaka. The claim reported in the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the Communist Party of China, is Beijing’s response to a report in the Hindustan Times that outlined how Bangladesh rescinded its decision to allow Covid vaccine trials last October after a last-minute demand by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech that Dhaka co-fund the trials.The Global Times report said the trials, according to the agreement sealed in July, were to start in August. It also confirmed that according to the initial agreement, Bangladesh did not need to share the cost.“But the clinical trials were delayed until October due to the Indian government allegedly meddling in the two sides' cooperation during the period,” the report - one of the many that China’s tightly-controlled media has published to target vaccines made by India and western companies - said.According to Sinovac Biotech’s 22 September letter to the Bangladesh letter, the trials scheduled in August had to be pushed back due to delay in approvals from Dhaka.The company had, according to this letter seen by Hindustan Times, claimed that it had “reallocated our funds for the trial (in Bangladesh) to trials in other countries, since, at the time, we were uncertain about the ultimate approval of the trial in Bangladesh.”Sinovac Biotech also claimed that it had requested the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organisation set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, to fund the trials in Bangladesh but this application was rejected.“However, we are working on plans to partially rectify the funding situation by the end of October-early November, though we will still require co-funding to complete the entire trial in Bangladesh,” the company said in its letter to Bangladesh’s health minister Zahid Maleque.Maleque told news agency Reuters in October that Dhaka wouldn’t go ahead with the trial because the company’s demand for funding was contrary to their original agreement.“We are not co-funding the trial. That was not in the agreement. They never asked for money when they approached us… As per agreement, they’ll bear all expenses of the trial, they’ll give us 110,000 free vaccines and they’ll share the technology so that our pharmaceutical companies can make the vaccine,” the minister told Reuters on 13 October.In sharp contrast to the Chinese approach, New Delhi sent a gift of two million doses of Covishield vaccine to Dhaka on January 21 and facilitated a commercial contract of 30 million doses with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-meddling-torpedoed-china-s-vaccine-trials-in-bangladesh-chinese-media-101611737215412.html
27-01-2021||World||'Crazy and evil': Bill Gates surprised by pandemic conspiracies about him||Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates says he has been taken aback by the volume of "crazy" and "evil" conspiracy theories about him spreading on social media during the Covid-19 pandemic, but said on Wednesday he would like to explore what is behind them.In an interview with Reuters, Gates said the millions of online posts and "crazy conspiracy theories" about him and about top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci had likely taken hold in part because of the combination of a frightening viral pandemic and the rise of social media."Nobody would have predicted that I and Dr. Fauci would be so prominent in these really evil theories," Gates said."I'm very surprised by that. I hope it goes away."Gates, a billionaire who stepped down as chairman of Microsoft Corp in 2014, has through his philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed at least $1.75 billion to the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. That includes support for some makers of vaccines, diagnostics, and potential treatments.Since the pandemic began a year ago, millions of conspiracies have spread over the Internet, fuelling misinformation about the coronavirus, its origins and the motives of those working to fight it.They include claims that Fauci and Gates created the pandemic to try and control people, that they want to profit from the virus' spread, and that they want to use vaccines to insert trackable microchips into people."But do people really believe that stuff?," Gates asked."We're really going to have to get educated about this over the next year and understand .. how does it change peoples' behaviour and how should we have minimized this?"Excited about BidenGates praised Fauci and Francis Collins, head of the US National Institutes of Health, as "smart" and "wonderful people", and said he looked forward to seeing them able to work effectively and speak the truth under the new administration of President Joe Biden.During former President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, Gates said, it had "sometimes felt like they were the only sane people in the US government.""I'm excited about the team that Biden has picked" to tackle the health crisis, Gates said.Gates said he was also pleased that under Biden, the United States has rejoined the World Health Organization, and "that he's appointed smart people, and the fact that Dr. Fauci won't be suppressed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crazy-and-evil-bill-gates-surprised-by-pandemic-conspiracies-about-him-101611737018547.html
27-01-2021||World||China opposes retention of app ban, says move may damage bilateral cooperation||China on Wednesday opposed India’s decision to retain a ban on 59 Chinese-origin mobile phone applications, saying the move violated WTO’s non-discriminatory principles and had the potential to “further damage” bilateral cooperation. India’s electronics and IT ministry has informed the Chinese firms that the ban on 59 apps, including TikTok, would be retained following a review of the responses provided by them after the imposition of the ban last year. The ban was imposed last June on grounds of national security, months after the India-China military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) emerged into the open. India subsequently took steps to ban a total of 267 Chinese-origin apps and to restrict Chinese investments in critical sectors of the economy. Responding to reports about the retention of the ban on 59 apps, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Ji Rong, contended that India was using national security as an “excuse” to impose restrictions on Chinese firms. “Since last year, the Indian side has repeatedly used national security as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background,” she said in a statement. “These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them,” Ji said. “We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation,” she added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese spokesperson’s comments.The Chinese government, Ji said, always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. “The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies,” she said. “These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature,” she said. Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are currently locked in a face-off in the Ladakh sector of the LAC, taking bilateral ties to an all-time low. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said China’s unilateral efforts to alter the status quo along the LAC have significantly damaged the relationship. Earlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a minor scuffle at Naku La in Sikkim sector of the LAC, resulting in injuries on both sides. The incident highlighted the continuing tensions along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-opposes-retention-of-app-ban-says-move-may-damage-bilateral-cooperation-101611737374678.html
27-01-2021||World||Sanofi to make millions of BioNTech-Pfizer’s Covid vaccine doses||Sanofi agreed to produce millions of doses of BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc.’s coronavirus vaccine in an unusual collaboration to speed vaccination efforts.The French drugmaker will give BioNTech access to a production facility in Frankfurt, which will start to deliver doses this summer, Sanofi said in a statement Wednesday. The deal will produce more than 125 million doses of the messenger RNA vaccine for the European Union.Sanofi’s own effort to develop a vaccine with another big pharma firm, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, stumbled in clinical tests, meaning it won’t be ready by summer as expected. The production agreement allows the region to make up for some of the loss, accelerating the complex process of packaging and distributing a vaccine that needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures.Pfizer and BioNTech have been looking for ways to increase the supply of their immunization, from expanding existing plants to adding suppliers and contract manufacturers.Sanofi said that its own Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start another intermediate clinical trial in February, with the potential to reach the market in the fourth quarter. The experimental product was dealt a blow in December after a study showed it had failed to produce a strong enough response in older people, perhaps because of a formulation error.Sanofi also plans to start early clinical trials for its own messenger RNA vaccine candidate in February or March. The stock showed little change in early Paris trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-to-make-millions-of-biontech-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-doses-101611736159534.html
27-01-2021||World||Bill Gates outlines strategy to prevent the next pandemic||Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates outlined an ambitious plan to stop the next pandemic, calling for a global alert system, massive testing, a cadre of 3,000 “first responders” ready to spring into action and tens of billions of dollars of annual spending.“To prevent the hardship of this last year from happening again, pandemic preparedness must be taken as seriously as we take the threat of war,” Gates wrote in an annual letter Wednesday. “The world wasn’t ready for the Covid-19 pandemic. I think next time will be different.”Bill and Melinda Gates, who oversee the Seattle-based Gates Foundation, set their sights on the next crisis as the globe struggles to slow a pathogen that has infected more than 100 million people. Countries -- mainly wealthy ones -- are ramping up vaccine delivery in a race to catch up with the virus.By the time the next pandemic arrives, Gates said he hopes to see “mega‐diagnostic platforms, which could test as much as 20% of the global population every week.” The overall cost to defend the world sounds huge, though not compared with the $28 trillion estimated cost of Covid-19, he said.“The world needs to spend billions to save trillions,” he said.The success of messenger RNA vaccines in combating Covid-19 should pave the way for huge advances over the next five years in the development of new shots, he said. The technology shows potential to one day help overcome diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Gates Foundation has invested $1.75 billion in the fight against Covid-19, according to their letter.One of the significant concerns is the threat of “immunity inequality,” where only rich people have access to vaccines, Melinda Gates wrote.“Until vaccines reach everyone, new clusters of disease will keep popping up,” she said. “Those clusters will grow and spread. Schools and offices will shut down again. The cycle of inequality will continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-outlines-strategy-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic-101611735592831.html
27-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccinations may be needed for cats, dogs as well: Scientists||Cats and dogs may need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a group of scientists said in an editorial in journal Virulence, reported UK's Daily Mail.As per the scientists, the domesticated animals can become 'reservoirs' of the virus as they can get infected posing a 'significant long-term' threat for the humans with the virus continuously evolving during the transmissions.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19"It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might ... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection," the Daily mail quoted the scientists from the University of East Anglia, the Earlham Institute in Norwich and the University of Minnesota as saying in the editorial.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US had earlier said even though some pets have reported to be tested positive for the coronavirus, the risk of animals spreading Covid-19 to people is considerably low. The CDC had warned people to be healthy around their pets and treat them as family members as close contact with humans can cause infections in pets.The minks farms in Denmark had too witnessed a surge in the number of coronavirus cases leading to mulling of the animals farmed for their fur."It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets... We really need to be prepared for any eventuality, " said Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA, reported the Daily Mail.The author and expert had also pointed out that Russia has begun developing vaccines for the pets.Also Read | Health workers become 1st to get Covid-19 vaccine in NepalThe editor in chief, Kevin Tyler, was quoted as saying cats can be infected by the virus and they can be asymptomatic hence can infect the human too. "The risk is that, as long as there are these reservoirs, that it starts to pass as it did in the mink from animal to animal, and then starts to evolve animal-specific strains, but then they spill back into the human population and you end up essentially with a new virus which is related which causes the whole thing all over again," he had said.The scientists have asked the governments to take necessary actions in order to mitigate the risk of evolution of dangerous and more contagious virus mutants that will pose a greater risk for the human population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccinations-may-be-needed-for-cats-dogs-as-well-scientists-101611735265447.html

In an assessment of its work to counter terror financing and money laundering, the treasury department also provided information of close links maintained by the Afghan Taliban with al-Qaeda, even after the signing of the agreement with the US in February last year. The Haqqani Network, once famously described by former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Admiral Mike Mullen as a “veritable arm” of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, was blamed along with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for last year’s attack on the Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed almost 30 people.Also Read: Pak govt decides to amend Constitution for Senate election“Senior Haqqani Network figures have discussed forming a new joint unit of armed fighters in cooperation with and funded by al-Qaeda,” the treasury department informed the Pentagon in a document dated January 4 but didn’t give further details. The Haqqani Network has often been accused of targeting Indian interests in Afghanistan. Some reports have suggested the attack on the Sikhs in March last year was carried out after the terrorists were unable to target the Indian embassy in Kabul. The document described the Haqqani Network as an “organisation primarily based in North Waziristan, Pakistan” that conducts “cross-border operations into eastern Afghanistan and Kabul”. In May last year, Afghan security forces had arrested eight members of a network grouping the Haqqani Network and the Islamic State in Kabul for the attack on the Sikhs. The National Directorate of Security or the Afghan spy agency had said at the time that the group was also responsible for attacking a gathering of the Shia Hazara minority, and rocket attacks on President Ashraf Ghani’s swearing-in ceremony and on Bagram airbase. Asked specifically about any changes in financial relationships between the Taliban and terrorist groups since February 29, 2020 – the date when the Taliban and the US signed a deal – the treasury department said that as “of May 2020, the Taliban and al-Qaeda maintained a strong relationship and continued to meet regularly”. The treasury department also said that, during the past year, al-Qaeda was “gaining strength in Afghanistan while continuing to operate with the Taliban under the Taliban’s protection”. The assessment assumes significance in light of the new US administration’s decision to review the deal with the Taliban to establish whether the Afghan group has cut its ties with al-Qaeda and other terror groups and is taking steps to reduce violence. The treasury department concluded that al-Qaeda “capitalizes on its relationship with the Taliban through its network of mentors and advisers who are embedded with the Taliban, providing advice, guidance, and financial support”. It further said that “elements of al-Qaeda, including affiliate al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan, such as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), continue to use the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region as a safe haven”. AQIS, which has sought to focus on India and Jammu and Kashmir, “likely receives funding from al-Qaeda senior leadership”, the treasury department said. The treasury department further concluded that the core of the Islamic State has used hawala networks to transfer funds from overseas, and that the Khorasan unit of Islamic State or ISIS-K, which is based in Afghanistan, has “cultivated relationships with particular hawaladars who store tens of thousands of dollars for the group”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haqqani-network-discussed-forming-new-unit-with-al-qaeda-us-document-101611734314505.html

27-01-2021||World||Green shift brings blackout risk to world’s biggest power grid||As biting cold caused power demand to surge across western Europe on January 8, the continent’s power network came close to a massive blackout.Europe’s grid, which is usually connected from Lisbon to Istanbul, split into two as the northwest and southeast regions struggled to keep the same frequency. The problem originated in Croatia and led to the equivalent of 200,000 households losing power across Europe. Supply to industrial sites was cut in France and Italy.While this event hasn’t been linked to a surge in renewable electricity, as Europe replaces big coal and nuclear stations with thousands of smaller wind and solar units -- just as sectors electrify to reduce emissions -- incidents like this will become more frequent.“It is not a question about if a blackout in more than one European region will happen, it is only a question of when it will happen,” said Stefan Zach, head of communications at Austrian utility EVN AG.Transmission grids need to stay at a frequency of 50 hertz to operate smoothly and any deviations can damage equipment that’s connected. Had the frequency swings not been reduced within minutes, it could have caused damage across the entire European high voltage network, potentially causing blackouts for millions.A fault at a substation that caused overloading on other parts of Croatia’s grid has been identified as the cause of the issue, network operators concluded Tuesday.Large amounts of intermittent electricity create huge swings in supply which the grid has to be able to cope with. The issue isn’t confined to Europe. Australia has had teething problems in the transition to a cleaner grid. Wind power was blamed for a blackout in 2016 that cut power to 850,000 homes. The nation is looking to batteries as a solution and was the first country to install a 100 megawatt megabattery in 2017.Read more about the race to build megabatteries hereCalifornia gets about a third of its generation from renewables. Last summer record-breaking heat gripping the state and electricity supplies grew strained in the evenings, as solar plants stopped generating for the day. Grid managers resorted to rolling blackouts for the first time since the state’s electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001. Utilities had begun installing big batteries to take up some of the slack, but not fast enough.“The problem isn’t posed by growing green electricity directly but by shrinking conventional capacity,” said Eglantine Kuenle, chief electricity systems modeler at the EWI Institute of Energy Economics at Cologne University. “The upshot is a gap in secure power generation and grid balancing that must be fixed.”Europe hasn’t come this close to a major blackout since 2006 when more than 15 million households were plunged into darkness for hours. Since that, Europe’s grid operators have put in automatic responses like splitting the grid and triggering standby generation or demand reduction.Spinning turbines of thermal plants connected to the grid create kinetic energy called inertia which helps keep the grid at the right frequency. This spinning can’t be created by wind turbines or solar panels and policy makers need to find ways to incentivize other forms of energy storage or flexible output.Germany is the biggest producer of green power in Europe. The nation is culling a quarter of coal and nuclear power capacity next year, a gap it will need to plug. Instead of building a huge fleet of batteries, Germany plans to rely more on more its neighbors, importing power along huge cables.The event shows that problems in one nation will rapidly cascade between states as they become more reliant on their neighbors for power, said Wolfgang Kroeger, a professor at the ETH university’s Risk Center in Zurich.Continental Europe was separated into two areas due to “outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time,” according to Entsoe, the association of grid operators. “Further detailed investigation” is ongoing.“Longer, harder to fix disturbances that rip across countries are a real threat,” said Kroeger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-shift-brings-blackout-risk-to-world-s-biggest-power-grid-101611733610410.html
27-01-2021||World||Pak govt decides to amend Constitution for Senate election||The Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote.The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan.“The government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,” Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting.He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes.Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past.“The government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,” he said.Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court.Awan said the government had already laid two bills — Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill — in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot.The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament.It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper.Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-govt-decides-to-amend-constitution-for-senate-election-101611731086729.html
27-01-2021||World||Indonesian volcano unleashes river of lava in new eruption||Indonesia’s most active volcano erupted Wednesday with a river of lava and searing gas clouds flowing 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) down its slopes.It was the Mount Merapi’s longest lava flow since authorities raised the volatile volcano's danger level in November, said Hanik Humaida, the head of Yogyakarta’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center.The alert level was being maintained for now at the second-highest level, she said, and people should stay out of the existing 5-kilometer (3-mile) danger zone around the crater as the local administrations in Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces closely monitor the situation.The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) volcano is on the densely populated island of Java and near the ancient city of Yogyakarta. It is the most active of dozens of Indonesian volcanoes and has repeatedly erupted with lava and gas clouds recently.Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people.Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-volcano-unleashes-river-of-lava-in-new-eruption-101611728421894.html
27-01-2021||World||Taliban backs Covid vaccine drive as Afghan govt receives $112 million funding pledge||The Taliban militant movement gave its backing on Tuesday for a coronavirus vaccination campaign in Afghanistan that has received a $112 million pledge from the World Health Organization’s COVAX programme.The immunisation drive will have to take place amid relentless violence in the country despite the government and the Taliban insurgents opening peace talks in September.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters that the group would "support and facilitate" the vaccination drive conducted via health centres. Officials believe the insurgents would not target vaccine teams as they would not be going door-to-door.Announcing the funding, an Afghan health official said the programme would cover the 20% of the country's 38 million population.The COVAX programme is a global scheme to vaccinate people in poor and middle income countries against the coronavirus. It aims to deliver at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 to cover 20% of the most vulnerable people in 91 poor and middle-income countries.Afghanistan's Deputy Health Minister Waheed Majroh told journalists it was going to take six months to get the vaccines but authorities were in discussions to get them earlier.Afghanistan has registered 54,854 infections and 2,390 deaths - but experts say cases are significantly underreported due to low testing and limited access to medical facilities in the war-torn country.Aside from COVAX, the country has also received a pledge of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, Dr Ghulam Dastagir Nazari, head of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation at Afghanistan's health ministry, told Reuters."The AstraZeneca brand which is manufactured in India will arrive soon in Afghanistan," Nazari said, adding that the government was only concerned about the WHO approval of the vaccine and that the pre-qualification process has already started.An Indian government source confirmed that 500,000 doses had been set aside for Afghanistan and another official said the first batch of vaccines would land in February, though Kabul had not yet adopted the protocols to administer them.The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also said they would finance vaccines for another 20% of the population by the end of 2022, health ministry spokeswoman Masouma Jafari told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-backs-vaccine-drive-as-afghan-govt-receives-112-million-funding-pledge-101611727912243.html

By late evening, he had spoken to foreign ministers of Mexico, Japan and South Korea, according to his tweets and state department readouts.In calls with Japan’s Toshimitsu Motegi and South Korea’s Kang Kyung-wha, Blinken said US relations with their countries were the “cornerstone” and “linchpin” of “peace, security, and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region” and across the world, according to state department readouts.Canada and Mexico were also first calls placed by President Joe Biden to his counterparts, reflecting a pattern.But President Biden also called Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, and broached subjects his predecessor Donald Trump had refused to. Biden conveyed strong US support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, raised recent hacking of US government computer networks (for which intelligence agencies suspected Russia), interference in the 2016 US elections, and reports of Russian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.“President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,” the White House said in a statement on their call.Upon assuming office, Blinken tweeted, “American leadership matters, and we have a unique ability to bring other countries together to meet the challenges and opportunities of our time.”He wrote in another post: “We will revitalise American diplomacy to advance our interests and values in the world as it is – not as it was.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-secretary-of-state-blinken-says-committed-to-a-free-indopacific-101611727893981.html
27-01-2021||World||Republicans signal support for Trump in Senate impeachment trial||US Senate Republicans on Tuesday signalled they were ready to hand former president Donald Trump another acquittal when most of them rallied behind a motion that argued his impeachment trial was unconstitutional.The proposal, moved by Republican Senator Rand Paul, was defeated in a 45-55 vote in the Democratic-led 100-member Senate, which cleared the way for the trial to proceed. But the voting pattern revealed that Trump may eventually be acquitted, as a conviction requires a supermajority.Paul had argued that the trial of Trump as a private citizen violated the constitution.“Forty-five votes means the impeachment trial is dead on arrival,” Paul told reporters after the vote. “We’re excited about it. It’s one of the few times in Washington where a loss is actually a victory.”At least 17 Republicans senators will have vote with the 50 Democrats in the impeachment trial in the evenly divided Senate to achieve a two-third supermajority to convict the former president, who is charged with incitement of insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.In a possible sign of things to come, only five Republican senators — Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Pat Toomey and Lisa Murkowski— broke with the party on Tuesday and voted against Paul’s motion. The remaining 45 voted in support of the proposal, including Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate who has been among the most outspoken of Trump’s critics since January 6, saying the rioters had been “provoked by the president and other powerful people”.They may choose to vote differently in the trial, experts have warned, but chances of that were said to be slim.The vote took place shortly after the 100 senators had been sworn in as jurors for the impeachment trial, which is slated to start on February 9.Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on January 13, a week after the storming of the US Capitol, on the solitary charge of incitement of insurrection. He is the only US president impeached twice and the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office. Trump was acquitted the last time by a Republican-led Senate, in January 2020. If he was convicted, he would have had to leave office. This time, as he is out of power already, a conviction would disqualify him from holding a public office in future.Later Tuesday, Senator Patrick Leaky, the Democrat who is presiding over the impeachment trial, was taken briefly to hospital “out of an abundance of caution” after he felt unwell, spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-signal-support-for-trump-in-senate-impeachment-trial-101611726813868.html
27-01-2021||World||China, India's Covid-19 vaccinations to stretch to late 2022: Study||Covid-19 vaccination programmes in China and India will stretch until late 2022 due to the sheer size of their population, and more than 85 poor countries will not have widespread access to vaccines before 2023, a study showed on Wednesday.While rapid development of vaccines has raised hopes for an end to the year-long pandemic, concerns over unequal distribution have also mounted due to production problems and large bilateral deals between wealthy countries and drug makers.US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the United States aims to secure an additional 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech and Moderna Inc by summer.In Europe, the European Commission is setting up a proposal to restrict Covid-19 vaccine exports amid frustration over delays in deliveries of AstraZeneca's vaccine and other supply problems."Most developing countries will not have widespread access to the shots before 2023 at the earliest," Agathe Demarais, director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research division of the Economist Group, said in its study."Some of these countries—particularly poorer ones with a young demographic profile—may well lose the motivation to distribute vaccines, especially if the disease has spread widely or if the associated costs prove too high."Most countries in Africa are unlikely to get widespread vaccination coverage until early 2023, while many Asian countries will have broad access to vaccines by late 2022.The report said vaccine deliveries to poor countries by global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX, backed by the World Health Organization, may be slow due to delays in delivery to wealthy nations first and poor infrastructure in the developing world.COVAX said 1.8 billion doses would be supplied to 92 poorer countries in 2021 and that would correspond to approximately 27% coverage of populations in those countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-india-s-covid-19-vaccinations-to-stretch-to-late-2022-study-101611723110430.html
27-01-2021||World||UK could introduce hotel quarantine for high-risk arrivals||The UK government will introduce a limited hotel quarantine system for passengers arriving from the highest-risk countries, according to a person familiar with the matter.The move is aimed at curbing the spread of new variants of coronavirus that could prove resistant to vaccines, but is expected to apply to arrivals from countries with new forms of the virus, such as South Africa and Brazil.Boris Johnson’s government has so far stopped short of imposing a blanket quarantine system on all arrivals, amid concern about a lack of hotel space near airports and the consequences for a travel industry already on its knees.The decision was made by ministers at a meeting Tuesday night, where they discussed a range of options for tightening border controls. It came as the UK recorded more than 100,000 deaths from coronavirus, the first European country to reach the milestone.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sunday the government wanted to ensure that new, more virulent variants would not derail Britain’s vaccination program -- which has so far seen more than 6.8 million people receive a first dose.The new hotel quarantine policy will only affect Britons arriving from high-risk countries, as travel bans are already in place for non-UK visitors.The Labour opposition party said the move didn’t go far enough and would leave “gaping holes in our nation’s defences against different strains of the virus emerging around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-introduce-hotel-quarantine-for-high-risk-arrivals-101611709423759.html
27-01-2021||World||No local Covid-19 cases in Australia for 10 days in a row||Australia is on track for a 10th day of no new local COVID-19 cases on Wednesday with its most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) hoping to ease coronavirus restrictions this week after controlling a fast-spreading cluster.Australia's most populous state NSW has recorded no local cases for 10 days after low single digit numbers earlier in January.Victoria state, which is hosting the Australia Open tennis tournament, has gone three weeks without a local case.Other states and territories which have mostly been COVID-free, some for months, will report daily case numbers later on Wednesday, but are expected to report zero local infections.Australia's success in curbing small outbreaks, with a total 22,000 local cases since March 2020 and 909 deaths, comes at a time when global coronavirus cases are edging towards 100 million with the death toll surpassing 2 million.An advertising campaign will be launched later on Wednesday to encourage people to take the COVID-19 vaccine after the country's regulator this week approved the Pfizer-BioNtech shot. A rollout is expected in late-February.NSW made masks mandatory in indoor venues such as shopping centres and cinemas, imposed a cap on public gatherings while suspending dance floors even for night clubs to successfully curb outbreaks in Sydney's northern beaches and western suburbs.The outbreaks saw other states and territories close borders or restrict travel from NSW.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklien told the Australian Broadcasting Corp she hoped to receive medical advice later in the day that would allow her to ease restrictions this week."In New South Wales our policy always is don’t keep restrictions or burden our citizens a day longer than you need to. I'm hoping to have confirmation of advice that allows us to announce that later this week," she said.Despite its relative success in handling the pandemic, Australia's international borders will likely remain shut to non-citizens this year although there may be exclusive travel arrangements called "bubbles" with its South Pacific neighbours.Australia had a one-way "travel bubble" with New Zealand where those arriving from the latter didn't have to quarantine, but that arrangement was suspended for 72 hours on Monday after a highly infectious coronavirus strain was found in New Zealand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-local-covid-19-cases-in-australia-for-10-days-in-a-row-101611708796428.html

With these additional doses, the US will have enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of this summer."The Biden-Harris Administration will increase overall, weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses."This increase of 1.4 million doses per week will allow millions more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. The Administration is committing to maintaining this as the minimum supply level for the next three weeks," the release further said.Earlier in the day, US President Joe Biden announced that further measures would be undertaken to ramp up the vaccination campaign in the country."After review of current vaccines supplies and manufacturing plans, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distributions to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses starting next week," Biden said during a White House press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-buy-200-million-additional-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101611706538940.html
27-01-2021||World||Joe Biden targets housing, private prisons in first equality moves||President Joe Biden took a series of high-profile measures intended to improve racial equity across American society, including combating discrimination in housing policies and ending the use of private prisons.In a package of four directives on Tuesday, Biden delivered his first policy response to nationwide protests over institutionalized racism. The measures joined a growing list of executive actions aimed at advancing his campaign promises and rolling back former President Donald Trump’s policies.“Advancing equity has to be everyone’s job,” Biden said Tuesday in remarks at the White House before signing three memoranda and an executive order. Systemic racism, he said, has “plagued our nation for far, far too long.”One memo directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to review and change policies from the Trump administration that undermined protections under the Fair Housing Act, the White House said.Biden wants to end mass incarceration, which disproportionately affects people of color, according to the White House. He ordered the attorney general not to renew contracts with privately operated detention facilities -- reversing the Trump administration’s approach -- saying those prisons profit from keeping inmates in less safe conditions.The move may affect the country’s two largest operators of private prisons, GEO Group Inc. and CoreCivic Inc., which saw their share prices gain significantly after Trump was elected in 2016. Trump ended an Obama-era prohibition on the Justice Department’s use of private prisons and also expanded detention by federal immigration authorities.Both companies slipped on the news. GEO Group fell about 8%, to $7.41, its lowest since March 11, 2009. CoreCivic fell about 6% to $6.26, its lowest price since Nov. 12, after Trump lost re-election.GEO and CoreCivic have sought to diversify from federal contracts by signing deals with states to build and operate prisons.Another Biden memo aims to empower Native American tribal self-determination, and another targets xenophobia against Asian Americans. The action directs the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing guidance to advance language access to the Asian American community in the federal government’s response to Covid-19.The director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, Susan Rice, said at a briefing earlier Tuesday that Biden also intends to address moves by Republican-led state legislatures to roll back voting expansions that contributed to Trump’s loss.“It’s a matter of real concern because we ought to be in the business of encouraging and enabling all Americans who are eligible to vote, to be able to vote,” she said.The killings last year of Black people at the hands of law enforcement -- including George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky -- sparked protests that swept the country, drawing more attention to deep-seated racial disparities.Biden said Floyd’s death was “the knee on the neck of justice.”“In my view, it marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice,” he said.Biden also has indicated he wants to close the racial wealth gap in the U.S., and his economic team includes officials with experience on that issue. He hasn’t proposed specific policies on how to narrow the gap.The coronavirus pandemic has drawn more attention to health and economic disparities that are affecting Black, Latino and Native American populations.The end of 2020 brought the sharpest rise in the U.S. poverty rate since the 1960s, and disproportionately affected Black Americans, according to a study released Monday Economists Bruce Meyer, from the University of Chicago, and James Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame. The poverty rate for Black Americans is estimated to have jumped by 5.4 percentage points, or by 2.4 million individuals.By focusing on racial discrimination, Biden is taking steps to deliver for the people who helped him win the White House. Black voters in particular helped Biden secure the Democratic party’s nomination and then the presidency in November, as well as two Senate seats for Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-targets-housing-private-prisons-in-first-equality-moves-101611704926877.html
27-01-2021||World||US 'actively looking' at mandating Covid-19 testing for domestic air travel||The Biden administration is "actively looking" at expanding mandatory Covid-19 testing to travelers on US domestic flights, a senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said on Tuesday.On a call with reporters, Dr. Marty Cetron, director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at CDC, was asked about whether new domestic travel testing requirements might be employed. Cetron replied that there were "conversations that are ongoing and looking at what the types and locations of testing might be... We're actively looking at it."Last week, President Joe Biden directed U.S. agencies to make recommendations to "impose additional public health measures for domestic travel" and to consider new requirements for people crossing land borders. Reuters reported Friday that administration officials said that could include requiring negative Covid-19 tests before flying domestically."We realize that there's been a dramatic evolution and increase in both testing platforms and testing capacity. I think this is a really important part of our toolkit to combat this pandemic," Cetron said.On Tuesday, new CDC rules took effect requiring nearly all international air travelers aged 2 and older to present a negative coronavirus test taken within three calendar days of travel or proof of Covid-19 recovery to enter the United States.In discussions with airline officials, the CDC has said it is considering requiring domestic testing, too. Some airline officials worry such requirements could curtail already weak demand for air travel.The CDC said Sunday it would not grant waivers to exempt travelers from some countries with limited testing capacity. Numerous U.S. airlines had sought waivers.Acting Assistant Secretary of State Ian Brownlee told reporters CDC was "not at this time issuing federal quarantine orders" but recommends self-quarantining for seven days after returning from a trip and getting post-arrival Covid-19 tests.Brownlee said the "main message to U.S. citizens considering travel abroad remains the same: Seriously reconsider going overseas right now. If you're overseas right now, it's going to be harder to come home for a while."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-actively-looking-at-mandating-covid-19-testing-for-domestic-air-travel-101611704276870.html

27-01-2021||World||100 million cases worldwide, as US seeks to reset its Covid fight||More than 100 million Covid-19 cases have now been recorded worldwide, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday, as newly-inaugurated President Joe Biden pledged to ramp up the United States's struggling vaccine program.The number of cases, compiled from data provided by national health agencies, represents just a fraction of the real infections as the coronavirus has spread around the globe.The United States, which passed 25 million confirmed cases last weekend, remains the country with the largest outbreak -- and the largest death toll of over 420,000.Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump's presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask-wearing and socializing.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected.""This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole," he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire population -- by early fall.In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was "hard to compute" the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 Covid-19 deaths.But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, "did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life."- 'Drastic measures' -The UK has struggled to counter a brutal third wave blamed on a new variant that emerged there before Christmas before spreading to dozens of countries around the world.Neighboring Ireland said Tuesday it would enact mandatory travel quarantines for the first time, as well extending its third national lockdown until March 5.Among other European nations looking to strengthen border controls was Germany, which said it is considering almost completely halting flights into the country."The danger from the numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures," Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild newspaper.Iceland meanwhile started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses.The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday.More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down."You don't capitulate to people who smash shop windows," Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters "scum."Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures.With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified.Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries."Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF). "And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations."- 'Vaccine nationalism' -Europe's vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments -- a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes.AstraZeneca's CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit.The widening gap for vaccine supplies between rich and poor countries led both South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to lash out at "vaccine nationalism."Ramaphosa told the WEF that low- and middle-income countries were being shouldered aside by wealthier nations able to acquire "up to four times what their population needs."The row over access to vaccines at the WEF -- normally held at the Swiss ski resort of Davos -- comes as the pandemic compounds economic inequality.Despite Lebanon being under one of the world's strictest lockdowns, father-of-six Omar Qarhani told AFP he was still selling vegetables on the side of a road in Tripoli because he is desperate to support his family."I'm not scared of corona -- what scares me is being in need and poverty," he said.Brazil banned flights from South Africa -- both countries have their own new variants -- while virus deaths in Mexico passed the 150,000 mark on Monday just a day after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he tested positive.The IMF now predicts a "cumulative output loss" of $22 trillion -- the equivalent of the entire US economy -- over 2020-25.Nevertheless, optimism that vaccines will bring the pandemic under control and allow economic activity to resume, coupled with stimulus in major economies, boosted the IMF's growth forecast this year to 5.5 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-million-cases-worldwide-as-us-seeks-to-reset-its-covid-fight-101611704384843.html
27-01-2021||World||Britain readies for painful lessons as Covid-19 death toll crosses 100,000||(Bloomberg) -- It’s almost exactly a year since coronavirus made its first impression on the UK, when a government-chartered plane flew 83 British passengers home from Wuhan to a wind-swept military airfield west of London.Now in the midst of its third national lockdown, the UK has hit the devastating milestone of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19.For Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the country he leads, it’s a sobering moment. Fatalities are now already five times the 20,000 figure Johnson’s chief scientist once said would represent a “good outcome” for Britain.“It’s hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic,” Johnson said in a televised press conference on Tuesday evening. “I am deeply sorry for every life that has been lost.”While Johnson vowed to learn lessons once the virus is beaten, he offered few answers to the question of what went so wrong over the past year. How did the UK end up with the fifth highest death toll in the world, despite its state-run health service, renowned scientists, and the natural advantages of an island for managing the flow of people?More pressingly, the prime minister faces questions over the future. The government will need to make the most of the head start it has gained over other European nations in vaccinating its people.The political stakes are high: Johnson will be put to the test in local and mayoral elections later this year. He also faces a showdown with Scottish nationalists, and with his own increasingly jumpy Conservative colleagues over the restrictions.The choices confronting Johnson on when to turn off state support for businesses, and how to pay the bill, will determine what kind of an economy is left to revive once the lockdown wreckage has been cleared away.Much of it will come back to the premier’s character. In private his colleagues remark how he makes fewer jokes nowadays, and has struck a more serious tone since the start of the year. Stung by criticism that he has over-promised on when the crisis will be over, he’s now more cautious about a timetable for easing the lockdown.Last March, Johnson breezily brushed aside the threat, openly joking about shaking hands with staff in a hospital treating Covid patients. In April, he was admitted into intensive care with the virus.Major events such as soccer matches and the Cheltenham horse races went ahead, and the premier – a libertarian and a crowd pleaser by nature – was reluctant to curtail individual freedoms.Slow startOfficials argued that locking down the country too soon would be a mistake – people would get tired of the restrictions and start to break the rules, they said. Yet at the same time, countries such as Australia and New Zealand – which are now almost Covid-free with comparatively low fatalities – quarantined all passengers on arrival.“We just dithered too much and didn’t take it seriously enough at the beginning,” Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said in an interview. Other countries “went in hard, they went in fast, they didn’t prevaricate.”One of the biggest problems was the UK’s inability to run an effective test and trace operation to keep track of infections and ensure patients didn’t spread the disease.In the early months of the pandemic, the UK had to give up trying to test people because its maximum testing capacity of just 2,000 a day was nowhere near enough as the virus spread exponentially.A 22 billion-pound ($30.2 billion) mission eventually ramped up the testing and tracing capacity to rates that are among the highest in the world. Earlier this month, 665,000 Covid tests were carried out in one day in the UK But the essential follow-up process of tracing contacts didn’t reach enough people to be effective, although it has improved.British officials insist they simply did not know how helpful mask-wearing would be – even though other countries adopted the policy far earlier. Nor was it clear to the government how easily coronavirus spread among people without symptoms.Even as the death toll passed 100,000, a policy to isolate arriving passengers in hotels was still being debated.Almost 3.7 million people in the UK have tested positive – the fifth largest caseload worldwide and about half a million more than France. The UK has suffered almost twice the number of deaths as Spain and Germany. According to analysis from Johns Hopkins University, the UK ranks fourth in deaths per 100,000 people in the population of any country.Economic carnageIn the early days, Britain won praise from economists for its comprehensive and coordinated approach to supporting the economy.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak rolled out about 300 billion pounds of measures to support companies and prop up workers’ wages, while the Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low 0.1% and doubled its bond-buying program.None of this stopped the UK suffering its deepest recession since the Great Frost of 1709. Recent figures show the British economy is the worst performing among the Group of Seven nations, with output still about 9% below its pre-Covid level. Most economists and the Bank of England expect the economy to contract again.Now Johnson is pinning his hopes on an ambitious vaccination program. A successful rollout would give the government a shot at political redemption, too, and so far the progress has been rapid.“There is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines,” Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, told Bloomberg. With a comprehensive test-and-trace program, and assuming the vaccines are as effective as they seem, “you would hope we would be in a much better position next winter.”The UK has administered 6.85 million first doses of the AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc. vaccine. That puts it largely on target to offer the shot to 15 million of the most vulnerable people by mid-February, and far ahead of the U.S. and Europe. Only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have deployed more vaccines per capita.But there’s another cloud hanging over Britain’s battle with the pandemic: Its own mutant strain of the virus.The recent wave of hospitalizations has been linked to the new variant B.1.1.7 of coronavirus that appears to spread more quickly and officials now believe may be more than 30% deadlier than the original strain. On Tuesday, the government’s medical experts warned the death toll will continue to mount and will only start to fall slowly.Johnson, when pressed on the government’s missteps at Tuesday’s press conference, said: “We truly did everything we could, and continue to do everything we can, to minimize loss of life and to minimize suffering.”Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said the UK “must not and will not forget this day” and needs to understand what went wrong. “As the first nation in Europe to have reached this dark death toll, we must learn the lessons of this tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-readies-for-painful-lessons-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-100000-101611702026345.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden says US will have enough Covid vaccines for entire population||The US government is buying an additional 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine and will have enough to inoculate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.An additional 100 million doses of vaccine are being bought from Pfizer and an additional 100 million doses from Moderna, the two companies whose vaccines have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, Biden told reporters at the White House."Not in hand yet, but ordered," he said. "We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer."The latest purchase would take the total number of Covid-19 doses ordered by the government to 600 million, he said."This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall," the president said.Biden has pledged to provide 100 million Covid vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office and he said the administration was increasing its overall weekly vaccine supply to states and territories.It is increasing the supply from 8.6 million doses a week to a minimum of 10 million doses."This is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated," he said.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge and the vaccine program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected."Ending the coronavirus pandemic would require a "war-time effort," he said."More than 400,000 Americans have already died," he said. "This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole."Biden also said "things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.""The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month, this February. And cases will continue to mount," he added."We didn't get into this mess overnight. It's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear. We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-us-will-have-enough-covid-vaccines-for-entire-population-101611701742867.html
27-01-2021||World||US prez Biden, Vladimir Putin speak over phone, discuss nuke treaty, Navalny||US President Joe Biden spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for the first time since taking office and raised concerns about Russian activities including the treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the White House said.A White House statement said the two leaders agreed to have their teams work urgently to complete the extension of the New START arms control treaty between the United States and Russia by Feb. 5, when the current pact expires.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki announced the phone call between the two leaders at her daily briefing. It came as Biden adjusts US policy in a more robust way toward Russia after his predecessor, Donald Trump refused to take on Putin directly.At the same time, Biden sought to repair the strained alliance between the United States and Europe by stressing in a phone call with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Washington would abide by the NATO treaty's mutual defense pact."President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to collective defense under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and underscored his commitment to strengthening transatlantic security," a White House statement said.In the Putin phone call, Psaki said, topics included Biden's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia for five years and "strong (US) support for Ukraine sovereignty" in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.The arms control treaty limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each.Psaki said Biden also raised the case of Navalny, who was jailed after his return to Moscow from Germany last week, a case that has raised tension between Russia and the United States.Biden further voiced concern to Putin about what the White House called interference in the 2020 presidential election, as well as the massive Solar Winds cyber hack blamed on Moscow and reports that Russians offered bounties to Taliban insurgents for killing US troops in Afghanistan.Biden's phone call with Stoltenberg came a day after he spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel."The president thanked the (NATO) secretary general for his steadfast leadership of the alliance, and conveyed his intention to consult and work with allies on the full range of shared security concerns, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Russia," the White House statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-biden-vladimir-putin-speak-over-phone-discuss-nuke-treaty-navalny-101611692792461.html
