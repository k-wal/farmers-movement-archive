The CIA director is a woman and women head all five of the agency’s branches, including the directorates of science and technology, operations and digital innovation.But while the CIA has been diversifying for years, intelligence agencies still lag the federal workforce in minority representation. With thousands of job applicants annually, the CIA wants to do more to ensure its workforce reflects national demographics.The revamped website has links for browsing CIA jobs complete with starting salaries and requirements, sections on working at the agency, and a streamlined application process.“We’ve come a long way since I applied by simply mailing a letter marked ‘CIA, Washington, D.C.,’” said CIA Director Gina Haspel, who joined the agency in 1985. She said in a statement that she hopes the new website piques the interest of talented Americans and gives them a sense of the “dynamic environment that awaits them here.”Haspel has made recruitment a priority since she became the first female director in May 2018. Since then, the CIA has started advertising on streaming services, launched an Instagram account and an online “onion site,” a feature that makes both the information provider and the person accessing information more difficult to trace.Last year, the CIA designated its first executive for Hispanic engagement, Ilka Rodriguez-Diaz, a veteran of more than three decades with the agency. She first joined after attending a CIA job fair in New Jersey.“The CIA had never been on my radar,” she wrote in an op-ed in The Miami Herald after getting the job in October. “I didn’t think I fit the ‘profile.’ After all, the spies I saw on TV were male Anglo-Saxon Ivy leaguers, not Latinas from New Jersey. Still, I went to my expert life coach, my mother, for advice. She said, ‘No pierdes nada con ir.’ (What have you got to lose in going?) So, I went to the job fair. The rest, as they say, is history.”Across the more than a dozen U.S. spy agencies, including the CIA, 61% of intelligence professionals in fiscal 2019 were men compared with 39% women, according to an annual demographics report compiled by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.In fiscal 2019, the intelligence community saw an incremental increase in the number of minority professionals — 26.5%, up from 26.2%. But that’s still lower than 37 percent in the federal workforce as a whole and 37.4 percent in the civilian labor force, the report said.The largest minority or ethnic group at all the intelligence agencies, including the CIA, was Black or African American at 12% followed by Hispanic at 7% and Asian at 4%. Persons with disabilities represent 11.5% of the workforce at all the U.S. intelligence agencies — up a point from the year before.“Even with all the challenges 2020 posed, it was a standout recruitment year for CIA. Our incoming class is the third largest in a decade and represents the most diverse talent pool, including persons with disabilities, since 2010,” said CIA spokesperson Nicole de Haay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-s-new-recruitment-website-aims-to-diversify-spy-agency/story-cBsQkpuPS5KHk7l6q45mtK.html
04-01-2021||World||‘Truth matters,’ says Georgia official resisting Donald Trump pressure||Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, says he was just following the law when he rejected claims by Donald Trump, his fellow Republican, that the president’s election defeat was the result of widespread fraud.Trump returned the 65-year-old former businessman to the limelight when he called Raffensperger on Saturday to badger him to “find” enough votes to reverse Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the state, according to audio of the call published by the Washington Post on Sunday.As Georgia’s top election official, Raffensperger oversaw multiple recounts of the Nov. 3 ballots, each of which reached the same result - that the southern state had narrowly favored a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in a generation.In the face of Trump’s unsubstantiated claims, Raffensperger echoed the findings of his counterparts across the United States that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud.Interviewed on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Monday, Raffensperger said the White House had pushed him against his better judgment to take Trump’s call.“Did you consider it a lawful request when the president asked you to find the votes?” Raffensperger was asked.“I’m not a lawyer. All I know is that we’re gonna follow the law, follow the process. Truth matters, and we’ve been fighting these rumors for the last two months,” he replied.Having for weeks pushed back against Trump’s unfounded claims of fraud, he told Trump on the call on Saturday that the vote showed Biden was the rightful winner.“Well Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong,” Raffensperger could be heard telling Trump on the recording of Saturday’s call.The White House declined to comment.Raffensperger and his colleagues for weeks had warned that Trump’s rhetoric placed them in danger.“Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone’s going to get hurt, someone’s going to get shot, someone’s going to get killed,” Gabriel Sterling, the manager of the state’s voting systems, said at an emotional Dec. 1 news conference.Noting Raffensperger’s wife had been getting sexualized threats, he added, “It has all gone too far. It has to stop.”It was unclear if the state had taken security measures around Raffensperger after the threats emerged. REPUTATION AS ‘STRAIGHT SHOOTER’After years as a civil engineer and successful businessman, Raffensperger served two years on a city council and four years in Georgia’s House of Representatives before succeeding Kemp in 2018 as the top election official.Acquaintances of Raffensperger in the state House described him as a “straight shooter” who backed traditional Republican priorities, supporting a bill to cut regulations on small businesses, for example, and voting against a tax on gasoline, according to a profile in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.A lifelong Republican, Raffensperger was an early supporter of Trump in 2016, and the president returned the favor by endorsing him for secretary of state. But whatever goodwill existed between the two men has since disappeared.“Brad Raffensperger: he’s not some liberal. Like he’s no hero of mine,” Hillary Rosen, a Democratic strategist, said on CNN. “He is a solid conservative Republican standing up to the president. That’s what makes it so significant.”Trump’s relentless attacks since the Nov. 3 election included an accusation that Raffensperger hid tens of thousands of illegal votes, ensuring Biden’s victory. Georgia’s Republican incumbent senators - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler - have called on Raffensperger to resign.Perdue and Loeffler themselves are locked in tight campaigns ahead of Tuesday run-off elections that will determine which party controls the US Senate.Raffensperger has come under fire from the party establishment across the state for not bending to Trump’s will.Ronald Ham, the Republican party’s head in rural Brantley County, said Raffensperger should take Trump’s allegations about voter fraud more seriously. He said there were discussions among some party leaders about recalling him. “I’ve been a little too critical of Brad, but where there is so much smoke I would want to verify,” Ham said. “He’s a good guy, but he won’t survive re-election if he gets that far.”Raffensperger told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in late November that he and his wife of 44 years had leaned on their faith to cope with the pressure. “We’re straightforward people, simple people,” Raffensperger said. “We’re quiet people in an unquiet role.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truth-matters-says-georgia-official-resisting-donald-trump-pressure/story-YUqWTn6gMrtqyLkQT5ey1I.html

04-01-2021||World||US ‘extremely disappointed’ in Julian Assange extradition ruling||The US Justice Department said Monday that it was “extremely disappointed” in a British judge’s decision not to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States to face trial for publishing US secrets.“While we are extremely disappointed in the court’s ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,” the department said.It pointed to the judge’s rejection of Assange’s claims that he had been exercising free speech rights when he dumped thousands of leaked classified US military and diplomatic files onto the internet in 2010, and that the US was pursuing a political vendetta because of it.Instead, the judge ruled that Assange’s mental health is fragile and that he would be at significant risk of suicide in an American prison. The judge said it was not evident that the United States, keeping him jailed while awaiting trial, would be able to ensure his safety in prisons known for “harsh conditions.”Assange was indicted for violating the US espionage act in leaking the US files, and for hacking, based on the alleged assistance he provided former military intelligence officer Chelsea Manning in obtaining the documents from secure military computer systems.But the US case raised free speech issues, with Assange and defenders maintaining that WikiLeaks enjoys the rights of any other media to publish secret materials.If found guilty on the US charges, he could face spending the rest of his life in prison.But Assange had sought a pardon from President Donald Trump, whose 2016 election campaign benefited from WikiLeaks’ release of materials that damaged Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.The Justice Department said it will appeal the decision and continue to seek Assange’s extradition, while Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his county would offer him asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-extremely-disappointed-in-julian-assange-extradition-ruling/story-Y0a2N8upuAZVIk5Y5RR5sN.html
04-01-2021||World||Vietnam buys Indian rice for first time in decades: Industry officials||Vietnam, the world’s third biggest exporter of rice, has started buying the grain from rival India for the first time in decades after local prices jumped to their highest in nine years amid limited domestic supplies, four industry officials told Reuters.The purchases highlight tightening supplies in Asia, which could lift rice prices in 2021 and even force traditional buyers of rice from Thailand and Vietnam to switch to India - the world’s biggest exporter of the grain.Indian traders have been contracted to export 70,000 tonnes of 100% broken rice for January and February shipments at around $310 per tonne on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, the industry officials say.“For the first time we are exporting to Vietnam,” B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the Rice Exporters Association, told Reuters on Monday. “Indian prices are very attractive. The huge price difference is making exports possible.”Dwindling supplies and continued Philippine buying have lifted Vietnamese rice export prices to a fresh nine-year high. Vietnam’s 5% broken rice is offered around $500-$505 per tonne, significantly higher compared to Indian prices of $381-$387.The shrinking supplies will heighten concerns about food insecurity with sub-Saharan Africa among the areas where import demand has been increasing due partly to population growth.Chronic and acute hunger is on the rise, impacting vulnerable households in almost every country, with the Covid-19 pandemic reducing incomes and disrupting supply chains, according to the World Bank.StockpilingTraders said the global pandemic has also prompted Vietnam and other countries to stockpile rice.Vietnam announced last year it would stockpile 270,000 tonnes of rice to ensure food availability amid coronavirus-driven supply chain disruptions worldwide.Traders in Vietnam said the rice from India had been stockpiled in government reserves since 2016/17 and its relatively cheap price reflected low quality.“The rice quality is so poor that it is not good for direct consumption for humans, but only for producing animal feeds and beer,” said a rice trader based in Ho Chi Minh City.Vietnam’s total paddy output in 2020 fell 1.85% to 42.69 million tonnes, equivalent to around 21.35 million tonnes of rice, preliminary data from the government’s General Statistics Office showed.The country’s rice exports in 2020 were forecast to have fallen by 3.5% to 6.15 million tonnes.Robust demand from Asian and African countries has also been lifting Indian prices but they are still very competitive due to ample stocks, said Nitin Gupta, vice president of Olam India’s rice business.Vietnam could make more purchases as long as the price difference remains, Gupta said.In December, the world’s biggest rice importer China started buying Indian rice for the first time in at least three decades due to tightening supplies from Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam and an offer of sharply discounted prices.In 2020 India exported a record 14 million tonnes of rice, provisional data from the trade ministry showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-buys-indian-rice-for-first-time-in-decades-industry-officials/story-fHUTYpSqePBEDSAjoCSq0N.html
04-01-2021||World||Lockdown looms as Boris Johnson to address UK on Covid-19 crisis||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce new coronavirus restrictions tonight with a third national lockdown for England looking almost inevitable.Parliament will be recalled from recess on Wednesday to debate the latest changes after a surge in cases forced the premier into action. He will speak on television at 8 p.m. on Monday. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appeared to anticipate the move and said she’ll implement a lockdown from midnight.A faster-spreading mutation of the virus threatens to overwhelm hospitals and has thrown the premier’s plan to get English children back into classrooms into disarray. He had hoped Monday’s focus would be on celebrating the delivery of the first shots of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc.“The spread of the new variant of COVID-19 has led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country,” Johnson’s office said in a statement on Monday afternoon. “The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives.”Johnson’s government is back in crisis mode, with new virus cases exceeding 50,000 a day and hospital admissions soaring past the peak of the first wave in April. Johnson, who ended the year on a high by securing a last-minute trade deal with the European Union, on Monday warned a “surging epidemic” means stricter rules are coming.ITV reported the government plans to put the whole of England into Tier 4, the highest level in its system of restrictions, meaning non-essential shops will have to close and further curbs will be placed on socializing. Tier 4 rules effectively mirror the second lockdown in November, and already govern about 75% of England’s population.“If you look at the numbers there’s no question we’re going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview earlier Monday. “We will do everything we can to keep the virus under control.”Sturgeon stole a march on Johnson by ordering people to remain at home and by keeping schools closed. The resurgent virus gave her no choice, she told Scots. “We are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus,” she said.Former Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those calling for Johnson to impose an immediate national lockdown. Writing on Twitter, he said schools and borders should be closed and all household mixing banned.Hunt’s successor Matt Hancock warned Monday there would be “some very difficult weeks ahead.”It’s a far cry from the government’s optimism in early December, when the arrival of vaccines was dubbed the “scientific cavalry” to the rescue. The picture changed dramatically when the emergence of a faster spreading strain of Covid-19 led to the introduction of a stricter fourth tier of regional coronavirus rules that hammered retailers reliant on Christmas shoppers.School DilemmaIn the November shutdown, schools remained open, reflecting the government’s promise to keep in-person classes going. On Monday, Johnson gave mixed messages on schools, saying that while they are safe to open, “all measures” are “under review” because of the role they play in spreading the virus.“The issue is the extent to which the mingling of kids in schools by putting lots of households together cause the epidemic to spread even faster,” Johnson said. “We’ll have to look very hard at what we do with secondary schools later on in the month.”In the meantime, many schools have openly defied orders to open. Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer said the country should immediately return to a full lockdown, and unions on Monday called for employers to offer parents paid time off to cope with childcare if schools remain closed.Matt Ashton, director of public health in Liverpool, said “much stronger national controls” are needed now. “We cannot afford to wait any longer,” he said on Twitter.Government U-TurnsThroughout the pandemic, the government has been forced to backtrack on efforts to reopen the economy, especially as the resurgent virus pushes public health services to the brink. Most recently, Johnson was forced to curtail plans to relax social-distancing over Christmas.But tougher restrictions are likely to cause Johnson more trouble among Conservative Party MPs, many of whom oppose any action that would further damage the economy.Mark Harper, chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs who oppose curbs on people’s freedoms, said on Monday vaccination of the over 65s must mark “a clear threshold for when a substantial relaxation in restrictions can begin.”“The government must urgently set out exactly how the vaccination roll-out will translate into a return to normal life for us all in 2021,” he said in a statement. He called on the government to set out “how and when it will lift restrictions and when our freedoms, economy and health prospects will be fully restored.”Much will now depend on how fast the National Health Service can administer vaccine doses. Johnson said there is a “massive ramping up operation” now going on to vaccinate the UK population, promising that “tens of millions” of doses will have been delivered by the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-looms-as-boris-johnson-to-address-uk-on-covid-19-crisis/story-cyOn4c01RUmONYr0j8CMXN.html
04-01-2021||World||Afghan rivals to resume talks as civilian killings sow suspicion||Afghan government representatives and Taliban officials are due to resume peace talks in Qatar after a three-week break, officials said on Monday, although battlefield clashes and targeted killings risk undermining efforts to end the war.The negotiations, due to get going again on Tuesday, are expected to cover contentious issues such as power-sharing and a ceasefire after the two sides reached an initial agreement on procedural rules in December. The talks began in Qatar in September months after the Taliban reached an agreement with the United States allowing it to pull its troops out of Afghanistan and end its longest war in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.The Taliban have refused to recognise the U.S.-backed government and that was an issue that would have to be tackled, said a member of the team representing the government.“An interim government is an undeniable topic of discussion, because we want a ceasefire and the Taliban aren’t ready to agree to one with the current government,” the delegate, Hafiz Mansoor, told Reuters in Kabul before setting off for Qatar.A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.Under the terms of the agreement the United States struck with the Taliban, the formation of a “new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government” would be determined through negotiations between the two Afghan sides.President Ashraf Ghani’s government was elected in 2019 for a five-year term but the Taliban rejected the election.But relentless violence is over-shadowing the bid to find peace.Government officials have in recent weeks accused the Taliban of a string of high-profile murders, including of bureaucrats and journalists, and bomb attacks.The Taliban have rejected some of the accusations but at the same time, they have made gains against government forces in fighting in various parts of the country.The level of violence has prompted occasional intervention by Western forces.On Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said U.S. forces had conducted air strikes against insurgents, terming it a violation of the agreement between the two sides.A spokesman for U.S. forces, Colonel Sonny Leggett, said the strikes were defensive and not a violation of the agreement, and he called for a reduction in violence.European officials have also urged both sides to reduce hostilities and move quickly towards a settlement.The United States has been scaling back its presence in Afghanistan nearly 20 years after it intervened with its allies to overthrow the Taliban in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.Afghan security officials expect the size of the U.S. force to dwindle to about 2,500 troops early this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-rivals-to-resume-talks-as-civilian-killings-sow-suspicion/story-IJr7aQK1ZfqpUElovKp8rN.html
04-01-2021||World||Nigeria says war crimes probe hampers fight against insurgents||Nigeria’s government condemned the International Criminal Court (ICC) for recommending a full investigation into possible war crimes by the nation’s security forces.ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said last month a preliminary probe concluded that there is “a reasonable basis to believe” members of the Boko Haram militant group and security forces from the West African country committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. Judges at the Hague-based tribunal must approve her request in order for it to proceed.The ICC is acting like “another ‘fighting force’ against Nigeria, constantly harassing our security forces and threatening them with investigation and possible prosecution,” Information Minister Lai Mohammed said in a statement emailed January 4. Bensouda’s actions are an “unbridled attempt to demoralize our security men and women as they confront the onslaught from bandits and terrorists,” he said.Boko Haram insurgents have waged a violent campaign in northeastern Nigeria since 2009 to impose the group’s version of Islamic law on Africa’s biggest oil producer, leaving thousands of people dead and millions displaced. The ICC opened its preliminary investigation a decade ago.The probe found that, while the Islamist group and its splinter organizations are responsible for the “vast majority of criminality,” allegations against Nigerian security forces are “also sufficiently grave to warrant investigation,” according to a December 11 statement from Bensouda’s office.“Nigeria did not join the ICC so it can become a pawn on the court’s chessboard,” Mohammed said. “It beggars belief to see that a nation that is fighting an existential war against bandits and terrorists is constantly being held down by an international body which it willingly joined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-says-war-crimes-probe-hampers-fight-against-insurgents/story-DteRFkRx5Z3NXJVdcoliCL.html
04-01-2021||World||‘Big question mark’: UK scientist on Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against South African variant||As the United Kingdom on Monday rolled out the second vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a leading Oxford scientist said that there was a “big question mark” around the effectiveness of vaccines on the South African variant of SARS-CoV-2. The new Covid-19 strain, named 20C/501Y.V2, has caused a rapid surge in the coronavirus cases in South Africa and two cases of the variant were also discovered in the UK on December 23.Sir John Bell, an Oxford professor working with the UK government on its vaccine program, told Times Radio that there’s no data to suggest that South African variant is more deadly than the one originated in Britain, however, he was concerned about the mutations in the former. Bell said that a team of researchers are looking at how currently available vaccines could tackle the virus variants.“There’s still the research to be done, but if you want my gut feeling, I think the vaccine will be effective against the Kent strain and I don’t know about the South African strain. I think there’s a big question mark about that,” the professor said.Also Read | Africa left with few options for Covid-19 vaccines, says South AfricaThe South African variant was first identified in Nelson Mandela Bay in samples dating back to the beginning of October 2020, and the variant also was identified in Zambia in late December 2020. Bell opined it’s unlikely that the highly transmissible mutations will “turn off the effect of vaccines entirely.”“We’ve got a bit of headroom because the vaccines work, I think, much better than any of us thought they would work,” he said. “We do have some room to manoeuvre. If they worked 20% less well because of a mutation we’d still have good vaccines.”UK health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is “incredibly worried about the South African variant” of the coronavirus, calling it “even more of a problem” than the new UK strain. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no evidence to suggest that the South African variant has any impact on disease severity or vaccine efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-question-mark-uk-scientist-on-covid-19-vaccine-efficacy-against-south-african-variant/story-ZsukFMbtLIqVcChh5RXv9J.html
04-01-2021||World||UK begins Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccination as spike prompts new curbs||An 82-year-old dialysis patient was the first person to receive the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted that stricter measures will be needed to control continuing spikes in new daily cases.For the sixth consecutive day, the UK recorded over 50,000 new cases, prompting new calls for another lockdown by opposition Labour, and health authorities reconsidering the current four-tier alert system that is increasingly assessed as being unable to control the numbers.Health secretary Matt Hancock called the beginning of the Oxford vaccination programme a “pivotal moment”. There are currently over 500,000 doses of the vaccine available, with millions expected soon of the 100 million ordered by the Johnson government.Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, was among the first to receive the vaccine in Churchill Hospital, Oxford. Brian Pinker, who has been having dialysis in the hospital, was the first to receive it, and said he was “really proud” of the vaccine developed in Oxford.Seeing “tough, tough” weeks ahead, Johnson said: “What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course.”Most of England is currently in Tier 4 with the toughest restrictions, but new cases have continued to surge in various areas, including London and south-east England. Hancock admitted that the “old tier system” was “no longer strong enough” to contain the virus. There are also concerns over the new variant detected in South Africa. Hancock said he was “incredibly worried” about it, adding that “this is a very, very significant problem…We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time”.John Bell, professor of medicine at Oxford, the university, said the effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine against the South African variant is currently being studied, adding that it was “unlikely” that the variant would “turn off the effect of vaccines entirely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccination-as-spike-prompts-new-curbs/story-VOKF3mn3x8Z9nd8freCl8I.html
04-01-2021||World||Australia’s influence in Pacific Islands grows as China’s wanes||Australia is moving to boost ties with small island nations off its eastern coastline, pushing back against China’s growing influence in the Pacific Ocean as the virus outbreak hinders travel.Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government has promised to supply its neighbours with Covid-19 vaccines in 2021 as part of a A$500 million package aimed at achieving “full immunization coverage” in the region. It also recently signed a “landmark” deal with Fiji, one of the region’s most populous nations, to allow military deployments and exercises in each other’s jurisdiction.“China has largely been missing in action in regards to providing Covid-related support in the region,” said Jonathan Pryke, who heads research on the region for Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute. “Australia has built up an amount of goodwill by not forgetting about the Pacific in a time of crisis.”Over the past decade, China’s growing influence in the 14-nation Pacific Islands -- whose cumulative population of just 13 million is sprawled over thousands of islands and atolls in a region stretching across 15% of the world’s surface -- has triggered alarm bells in the US and Australia. Diplomats and intelligence officials fear Beijing’s ultimate goal may be to establish a naval base that would upend their military strategies.The battle for influence in the region comes after China hit Australia with a series of damaging trade reprisals following Morrison’s decision to seek an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Australia’s largest trading partner has put curbs on everything from wine to lobsters, prompting Canberra to file a challenge against barley tariffs at the World Trade Organization (WTO).Projects StalledStill, Australia has made inroads in the Pacific after island nations quickly blocked incoming flights and cruise ships to keep the virus away from vulnerable communities in the aid dependent region. China also ordered workers developing projects tied to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to return home, and reduced diplomatic staff in the 10 Pacific nations that recognize Beijing instead of Taiwan.In resource-rich Papua New Guinea, the region’s most populous nation and by far the biggest recipient of China’s financial backing, work on one of the region’s highest-profile infrastructure projects stalled this year, according to Paul Barker, chief executive of Institute of National Affairs, a non-profit economic research group partially funded by the private sector based in Port Morseby.Chinese staff left the marine industrial zone site in Madang on the nation’s north coast, which has received at least $73 million in funding from Beijing and will be used as a base to fish tuna, said Barker, who has lived in Port Moresby for four decades. While other China-backed projects around Papua New Guinea’s capital have also crawled to a standstill this year, he said he expects China’s on-the-ground presence, along with offers of financial aid, to ramp up again when the pandemic is under control.“It’s logical for Papua New Guinea to want to get competitive contractors and finance, and if the Chinese were to offer that going forward, the government will be interested,” he said. “While most Papua New Guineans tend to look to their ‘southern friends’ in Australia because they know them, they also want to be offered more opportunities.”‘Cold-War Mentality’China hasn’t been completely inactive. New Chinese ambassadors to the two countries that recognized it over Taiwan in 2019 -- Solomon Islands, one of the region’s largest economies, and Kiribati. The new envoy in the former British colony raised eyebrows when a photo taken on his arrival seemed to show him walking over about 30 local men lying on their stomach.China Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing in Beijing on Monday China’s relations with Pacific Island countries have been closer since the pandemic began.“We have also considered providing vaccines to the island countries, contributing to the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in the island countries,” Hua said.The nation’s foreign ministry said in an emailed response to questions that Beijing had shared medical experience and provided materials to nations during the pandemic, while Belt and Road projects including a new highway in western Papua New Guinea and a stadium in the Solomon Islands had been “progressing steadily”.“China hopes all other countries could adopt a mutually respectful attitude and open-minded spirit to facilitate the stability and prosperity of the region, instead of maintaining ‘zero-sum’ and Cold-War mentality and building exclusive ‘small groupings’,” the ministry said.Kiribati’s plan to build two major tran-shipment ports looks set to be integrated into the Belt and Road, according to a September report by government-backed think tank Australian Strategic Policy Institute. That would “raise the prospect of Chinese military bases across the center of the Pacific” through major sea lanes and near US bases including Hawaii, the report said.China also signed a memorandum of understanding last month to potentially fund a new $150 million marine base in southern Papua New Guinea, on Australia’s doorstep. The deal may have geopolitical implications, especially as the impoverished area isn’t near rich fishing stocks.‘A Better Choice’“The pandemic is not going to deter China from executing its strategy in the South Pacific because it wants to continue to exert its influence over weak, fragile democracies,” said Paul Maddison, director of the University of New South Wales Defence Research Institute. “Under a Joe Biden administration, there’s an opportunity for the US and like-minded democracies to show sovereign Pacific nations they have a better choice in who they choose to work with.”Lawmakers in Washington and Canberra have warned developing countries to avoid taking Chinese loans, saying that Beijing would use the debt as geopolitical leverage. China has spent at least $1.7 billion in aid and loans to the Pacific Islands in the past decade, much of it on much-needed transport and utility infrastructure, according to Lowy Institute data.In response, Australia -- seen by China as an American puppet -- unveiled a A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) infrastructure fund for the region in 2018. The US, meanwhile, established a Directorate of Pacific Affairs within the White House National Security Council, which provides a hub for coordinating policy in the region with other like-minded countries.With the economic devastation from the pandemic set to linger for years, the geostrategic competition in the region is only set to intensify as nations look to recover, said Pryke from the Lowy Institute.“Beijing will be aware that Covid has shaped an economic crisis that’s made the region even more vulnerable and desperate for foreign aid and loans, creating a better strategic environment to further its interests,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-influence-in-pacific-islands-grows-as-china-s-wanes/story-ZoaRSxj84fNgFKoF6XTuXO.html
04-01-2021||World||‘It’s not social media, it’s Trump Media’: 5 key points from Donald Trump’s phone call||US President Donald Trump on Sunday was recorded on call by Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, putting pressure on the state secretary and his legal counsel to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state. The conversation was mainly between Donald Trump and Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state, but Trump campaign individuals like Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and attorney Cleta Mitchell were also present, as was Ryan Germany, Raffensperger’s counsel.Trump gave a glimpse of how his campaign is arriving at voter fraud numbersOne of Trump campaign’s associates who was part of the call told the state secretary that the campaign came to know dead people voted in the elections through newspaper obituaries. “We took the name, birth year, we have certain information available to us, we have asked your office for the records that you have. Same name and same birth year who have died. To make records available to us.”she said . “4,502 voters who voted but were not the voter registration list, dead people voted,” Trump added. Raffensperger resisted this claim, “The data you have is wrong. The actual number is 2,” he responded. Later, towards the end of the phone call Trump’s lawyer once again pushed for access to the state’s database but Raffensperger and his legal counsels refused to entertain their request, invoking that state data is protected by law. The state secretary stood his ground against Trump, defended the election resultsRaffensperger pushed back against Trump and insisted Biden’s win in Georgia was fair. Responding to Trump’s voter fraud numbers, he said: “Well, Mr President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.” Trump kept alluding to a video where an individual (whose name was bleeped out) was seen committing voter fraud. Raffensperger resisted his claims commenting “I think it is very unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani and his people sliced and diced the video”. His counsel also denied the Trump campaign access to the state’s data for cross-verification purposes, continuously insisting that all data is protected by law.Trump said Raffensperger he might face a criminal investigationTrump intimidated Raffensperger and his legal counsel by warning about a criminal investigation, the Associated Press reported. “You know what they did and you’re not reporting it,” Trump said. “You know, that’s a criminal offence. And you know, you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk.” Trump also commented that even though Raffensperger is Republican his state did not have an accurate election, unfoundedly claiming the election was off by “hundreds of thousands of votes”, reported Reuters. Adding a moment later that he only needs enough votes to flip the state, “Flipping the state is a great testament to our country” he added. He also accused Georgia officials of certifying a faulty election. Towards the end of the phone call Trump could also be heard telling Raffensperger that the only people who like what he has done(defended the election results) are the ones who will never vote for him. Donald Trump told Raffensperger his actions will lead to Republicans losing the Georgia runoffTrump told Raffensperger that if he did not act by Tuesday he would be harming the chances of Georgia Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in this week’s runoff elections, which is set to determine whether the Democrats or the Republicans control the Senate, reported AFP. Referring to the runoffs in the call, Trump said, “It’s going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don’t get it straightened out fast”. He further added that people hate the state’s government and secretary of state, both Republicans and they are not going to vote in Tuesday’s election, because of what has been done to their President. ‘It’s not social media it’s Trump Media’Donald Trump and his legal team once again brought up the issue of shredding of ballots. When one of Raffensperger’s associates tried cautioning him against videos circulating on social media, reported Blomberg. Trump commented that he gets his information from Trump media not social media. “Mr. President the problem you have with social media, is that people can say anything they want”, said the associate, “No this isn’t social media, this is Trump media ‘’ Trump commented, adding that he “does not care about social media”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-not-social-media-it-s-trump-media-5-key-points-from-donald-trump-s-phone-call/story-xMg2sAxLzTQe5gaSoHQnxM.html

Interwoven with the Royal Mint’s history, we also celebrate how we were the change makers in 1971 as we mark the 50th anniversary of decimal day, and wish Her Majesty The Queen a happy 95th birthday as she continues to make a nation proud,” it said.On April 21 this year, the Queen will become the first British monarch to reach the age of 95. As her image already appears on one side of all coins in circulation in Britain, the new set of commemorative coinage will each offer a different depiction from the various stages of her reign.The quote for the 5 pound coin is taken from her speech 64 years ago, when she said: “In the old days the monarch led his soldiers on the battlefield and his leadership at all times was close and personal.“Today things are very different. I cannot lead you into battle, I do not give you laws or administer justice, but I can do something else, I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations.” The new coins will be available in precious metal editions or struck in regular circulating alloys, available to purchase from the Royal Mint’s website.The anniversary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote novels such as ‘Waverley’ and ‘Ivanhoe’, will be celebrated with a 2 pound coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of science fiction author H.G. Wells, who penned works such as ‘The Time Machine’ and ‘The War Of The Worlds’, will also be marked on a 2 pound coin, with a depiction of images from his novels.Two sets of 50-pence coins will mark the 50th anniversary of decimalisation, when Britain’s modern coins came into force, and the 75th anniversary of the death of the inventor John Logie Baird, famous for his early prototypes of the television.“This year’s annual set is particularly special for The Royal Mint as we celebrate one of the biggest milestones in our 1,100-year history, the anniversary of decimalisation,” said Clare Maclennan, of the consumer division at the Royal Mint.“This was one of the largest and most intensive public awareness campaigns ever staged by the government and introduced the coins that we know today. Decimalisation was the birth of modern coin collecting and it is fitting that the anniversary has been celebrated on a 50 pence, which is Britain’s most loved coin,” she said.The Royal Mint said that each of the new sets of coinage capture and tell a story in miniature form on the tiny surface of a coin by skilled artists passionate about their craft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coin-to-commemorate-queen-elizabeth-ii-s-95th-birthday-in-2021/story-jvzLlrgVGeKWvdL0yjwOeP.html
04-01-2021||World||Explained: How close is Iran to producing a nuclear bomb?||A 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is being eroded and efforts to revive the pact face a new challenge with a decision by Tehran to resume 20% uranium enrichment at an underground nuclear facility.The accord’s restrictions on Iran’s atomic work had one objective: to extend the “breakout time” for Tehran to produce enough fissile material for a bomb, if it decided to make one, to at least a year from about two to three months.Iran maintains that it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would. It says its nuclear work only has civilian aims.Tehran began breaching the deal’s curbs in 2019 in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the reimposition of US sanctions.This has shortened the breakout time but reports by the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which polices the deal, indicate that Iran is not moving ahead with its nuclear work as fast as it could.European states have sought to save the nuclear deal, pressing Tehran to comply even as Washington has tightened sanctions, and holding out hopes of a change in US policy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Biden was part of the US administration under Barack Obama that negotiated the 2015 deal.What has Iran done till now?Iran has contravened many of the deal’s restrictions but is still cooperating with the IAEA and granting inspectors access under one of the most intrusive nuclear verification regimes imposed on any nation.* Enriched uranium - The deal limits Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium to 202.8 kg, a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it possessed before the deal. The limit was breached in 2019. The IAEA report in November put the stockpile at 2,442.9 kg.* Enrichment level - The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium at 3.67%, far below the 20% achieved before the deal and below the weapons-grade level of 90%. Iran breached the 3.67% cap in July 2019 and the enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5% since then.* Centrifuges - The deal allows Iran to produce enriched uranium using about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at its underground Natanz plant, which was built to house more than 50,000. It can operate small numbers of more advanced models above ground without accumulating enriched uranium. Iran had roughly 19,000 installed centrifuges before the deal.In 2019, the IAEA said Iran had begun enrichment with advanced centrifuges at an above-ground pilot plant at Natanz. Since then, Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of advanced centrifuges to the underground plant. In November, the IAEA said Iran had fed uranium hexafluoride gas feedstock into the first of those underground cascades.* Fordow - The deal bans enrichment at Fordow, a site Iran secretly built inside a mountain and that was exposed by Western intelligence services in 2009. Centrifuges are allowed there for other purposes, like producing stable isotopes. Iran now has 1,044 IR-1 centrifuges enriching there.On Monday Iran said it was resuming 20 percent enrichment at Fordow, possibly complicating efforts by the Biden administration to rejoin the deal.How close is Iran to having a bomb?The breaches lengthened the breakout time but estimates still vary. Many diplomats and nuclear experts say the starting point of one year is conservative and Iran would need longer.David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who tends to have a hawkish position on Iran, estimated in November that Iran’s breakout time could be “as short as 3.5 months”, although this presumes Iran would use 1,000 advanced centrifuges that were removed under the deal.What more would Iran need to do?If Iran accumulated sufficient fissile material, it would need to assemble a bomb and probably one small enough to be carried by its ballistic missiles. How long that would take exactly is unclear, but stockpiling enough fissile material is widely seen as the biggest hurdle in producing a weapon.US intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted. There is evidence suggesting Iran obtained a design for a nuclear weapon and carried out various types of work relevant to making one.Tehran continues to grant the IAEA access to its declared nuclear facilities and allow snap inspections elsewhere.Iran and the IAEA resolved a standoff in 2020 that had lasted several months over access to two suspected former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-close-is-iran-to-producing-a-nuclear-bomb/story-fJ36D14d1q5d0O2rp0kGmN.html
04-01-2021||World||China asks US to stop interfering with Hong-Kong related issues||In a sharp rebuke, China has asked the United States to stop interfering with its internal affairs and judicial sovereignty on Hong Kong-related issues, Chinese state media Xinhua reported.In a press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China is a country ruled by law and anyone who violates it must be punished.The spokesperson remarks come after US Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo reacted on the sentencing of 10 Hong Kongers who have been detained in China after they tried to flee to Taiwan.Pompeo lambasted the Chinese Communist Party for the treatment to a group of 12 pro-democracy protestors who tried to flee Taiwan in wake of Beijing’s imposition of the draconian National Security Law, called for China to immediately release the ten Hong Kong activists.Out of 12, 10 individuals were sentenced from seven months to three years in prison by a Shenzhen court on Wednesday. The remaining two are underage passengers and were handed over to Hong Kong police, as reported by South China Morning Post.“China is a country ruled by law and everyone should comply with the law. Anyone who violates the law must be punished,” Hua said.She said the Chinese judicial authorities handle cases according to law and the United States has no right to interfere, urging the US side to stop slandering and smearing China.The European Union, Canada and the UK have expressed concerns over the fairness of the trial.“Canada expresses deep concern over the secret trial involving the Shenzhen 12. We urge Chinese authorities to conduct trials in accordance with due process and judicial transparency in line with international Human Rights norms and standards,” the Canadian Government’s foreign policy handle wrote on Twitter.Meanwhile, London said that the defendants were “tried in secret” and were denied access to lawyers of their choosing.We are deeply concerned that members of the Shenzhen 12 were tried in secret today, having been given just three days’ notice of their trial. Diplomats from Britain and a number of other countries, tried to attend the court proceedings but were denied entry, said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in a statement on Monday.The European Union on Tuesday slammed Beijing for human rights violations against 10 political activists from Hong Kong who tried to escape to Taiwan, urging authorities to ensure a fair trial and called for an immediate release of the Shenzen 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-asks-us-to-stop-interfering-with-hong-kong-related-issues/story-31VlLybakeSUgcke1eEQ6O.html
04-01-2021||World||South African Covid-19 strain raises growing alarm in the UK||The new coronavirus strain that emerged in South Africa is even more problematic than a mutated form that prompted new lockdowns across much of the U.K., health authorities said on Monday.“I’m incredibly worried about the South African variant,” U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on BBC radio Monday, citing a conversation over the Christmas holiday with his counterpart in South Africa. “One of the reasons they know they’ve got a problem is because, like us, they have an excellent genomic scientific capability to be able to study the details of the virus. And it is even more of a problem than the U.K. new variant.”The South African variant is driving a surge of infections in the country, and like the U.K. strain, it appears to be more infectious than previous mutations. Still, there’s no evidence yet that the Covid-19 vaccines approved so far won’t work against the new strains.Shots will probably still be effective against the U.K. variant of the coronavirus, while questions surrounding the South African version remain, John Bell, an Oxford professor working with the U.K. government on its vaccine program, told Times Radio on Sunday. It’s unlikely the mutations would “turn off” the effective vaccines entirely, Bell said.“We’ve got a bit of headroom because the vaccines work, I think, much better than any of us thought they would work,” he said. “We do have some room to maneuver. If they worked 20% less well because of a mutation we’d still have good vaccines.”‘Cat and Mouse’Even if the new variants were able to evade the vaccines “it’s perfectly possible” to adapt and make new ones, potentially within six weeks, if necessary, Bell said. “We’re now in a game of cat and mouse. These are not the only two variants we’re going to see.”Young people under the age of 20 may also be more affected by the new U.K. variant, Imperial College London researchers said in a preliminary analysis published Dec. 31. It’s too soon to be able to say why this might be the case, and the results might have been influenced by the fact that the lockdown was keeping more adults home, but schools were open, they said.South African medical scientists are designing studies to ascertain the clinical impact of the new variant of the coronavirus found in that country, said Glenda Gray, president of the South African Medical Research Council.South African doctors have seen anecdotal evidence that more young people without pre-existing conditions are becoming severely ill with the new version, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said last month.There is no evidence that the South African variant is more transmissible or causes more severe disease than the U.K. variant, Mkhize said in a statement on Dec. 24. The two variants developed independently, and there’s evidence that the U.K. strain predates the South African one, Mkhize said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-covid-19-strain-raises-growing-alarm-in-the-uk/story-SmrpGj42snSUJVHPPvTcaL.html
04-01-2021||World||‘Dangerous territory’: Extraordinary warning to Trump by 10 former Pentagon chiefs||In an extraordinary rebuke of President Donald Trump, all 10 living former secretaries of defense are cautioning against any move to involve the military in pursuing claims of election fraud, arguing that it would take the country into “dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.”The 10 men, both Democrats and Republicans, signed on to an opinion article published Sunday in The Washington Post that implicitly questioned Trump’s willingness to follow his Constitutional duty to peacefully relinquish power on Jan. 20. Following the Nov. 3 election and subsequent recounts in some states, as well as unsuccessful court challenges, the outcome is clear, they wrote, while not specifying Trump in the article.“The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived,” they wrote.The former Pentagon chiefs warned against use of the military in any effort to change the outcome.“Efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,” they wrote. “Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.”A number of senior military officers, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said publicly in recent weeks that the military has no role in determining the outcome of US elections and that their loyalty is to the Constitution, not to an individual leader or a political party.The 10 former Pentagon leaders also warned in their Post article of the dangers of impeding a full and smooth transition at Defense Department prior to Inauguration Day as part of a transfer to power to President-elect Joe Biden. Biden has complained of efforts by Trump-appointed Pentagon officials to obstruct the transition.Without mentioning a specific example, the former defense secretaries wrote that transfers of power “often occur at times of international uncertainty about US national security policy and posture,” adding, “They can be a moment when the nation is vulnerable to actions by adversaries seeking to take advantage of the situation.”Tensions with Iran represent just such a moment. Sunday marked one year since the US killing of Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general; Iran has vowed to avenge the killing, and US officials said in recent days that they are on heightened alert for potential Iranian attack on US forces or interests in the Middle East.In a further sign of US-Iranian tension, the acting secretary of defense, Christopher Milller, announced Sunday evening that he has changed his mind about sending the Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, home from the Middle East and instead will keep the vessel on duty. Just last week, Miller announced that he was sending the Nimitz home, a decision that had been opposed by senior military officers.In reversing himself, Miller cited “recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other US government officials.” He did not elaborate, and the Pentagon did not respond to questions.The opinion article in the Post was signed by Dick Cheney, William Perry, Donald Rumsfeld, William Cohen, Robert Gates, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Ash Carter, James Mattis and Mark Esper. Mattis was Trump’s first defense secretary; he resigned in 2018 and was succeeded by Esper, who was fired just days after the Nov. 3 election.The Post reported that the idea for writing the opinion piece began with a conversation between Cheney and Eric Edelman, a retired ambassador and former senior Pentagon official, about how Trump might seek to use the military in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dangerous-territory-extraordinary-warning-to-trump-by-10-former-pentagon-chiefs/story-BiB13X186AasPPnkcNJESO.html
04-01-2021||World||UK court blocks Julian Assange’s extradition to US citing suicide risk||The Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday blocked the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the United States on health grounds, saying that there are concerns over his mental health and risk of suicide. Assange, 49, is wanted in the US over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. According to his defence team, the case is politically motivated. The court’s ruling is expected to appealed by US authorities in the high court.Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that the US was incapable of preventing Assange from attempting to take his own life, adding: “The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future.”“Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge.”Assange has been in jail serving a 50-month sentence since May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after being holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years since 2012.He was arrested in April 2019.He earlier faced extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied.

04-01-2021||World||Iran says it resumed 20% enrichment at Fordow in latest nuclear deal breach||Iran has resumed 20% uranium enrichment at an underground nuclear facility, the government said on Monday, breaching a 2015 nuclear pact with major powers and possibly complicating efforts by US President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal. The move is the latest Iranian contravention of the deal, which it started violating in 2019 in response to Washington’s withdrawal from the agreement in 2018 and the reimposition of US sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.“A few minutes ago, the process of producing 20% enriched uranium has started in Fordow enrichment complex,” government spokesman Ali Rabeie told Iranian state media. The step was one of many mentioned in a law passed by Iran’s parliament last month in response to the killing of the country’s top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel. Such moves by Iran could hinder attempts by the incoming Biden administration to rejoin the deal. The deal’s main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.On Jan 1, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tehran had told the watchdog it planned to resume enrichment up to 20% at Fordow site, which is buried inside a mountain. “The process of gas injection to centrifuges has started a few hours ago and the first product of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas will be available in a few hours,” Rabeie said. “The process has started after taking measures like informing the UN nuclear watchdog.” Iran had earlier breached the deal’s 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can enrich uranium, but it had only gone up to 4.5% so far, well short of the 20% level and of the 90% that is weapons-grade. US intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-resumed-20-enrichment-at-fordow-in-latest-nuclear-deal-breach/story-mQDNe9bmqPDZgtu4jJvOTI.html
04-01-2021||World||Google workers announce union, escalates years of tensions with management||Employees of Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of a union on Monday, escalating years of confrontation between workers and management of the internet giant.The Alphabet Workers Union said it will be open to all employees and contractors, regardless of their role or classification. It will collect dues, pay organizing staff and have an elected board of directors.The unionizing effort, a rare campaign within a major US internet company, is supported by the Communications Workers of America as part of a recent tech-focused initiative known as CODE-CWA. Googlers who join the Alphabet Workers Union will also be members of CWA Local 1400.“We will hire skilled organizers to ensure all workers at Google know they can work with us if they actually want to see their company reflect their values,” Dylan Baker, software engineer at Google, said in a statement.A successful Alphabet union could limit executives’ authority, while inspiring similar efforts across Silicon Valley, which has mostly avoided unionization so far. The group said it plans to take on issues including compensation, employee classification and the kinds of work Google engages in.The announcement did not specify whether the new organization will try to secure majority support among Alphabet’s workforce, formal recognition by Alphabet or collective bargaining with the company, a process that has been aggressively resisted by US corporations. CWA’s membership includes some workers, such as public university employees in Tennessee, who engage in collective action while lacking legal collective bargaining rights.Google has clashed with some employees in recent years over contracts with the military, the different treatment of contract workers and a rich exit package for an executive ousted for alleged sexual harassment.Google worker protests in 2018 forced the company to let a Pentagon artificial intelligence contract lapse. Employee uprisings also led the company to limit the use of forced arbitration that same year.CWA has been supporting Google activists since at least 2019, when the union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging workers were fired for taking collective action. In December, the agency’s general counsel took up some of those allegations, accusing Google of illegally firing, interrogating and surveilling activist employees. Google has denied wrongdoing, saying it supports workers’ rights and that the employees in question were punished for “serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-workers-announce-union-escalates-years-of-tensions-with-management/story-ieRw4ci8am3IujUTF3PiwJ.html
04-01-2021||World||‘Likely to commit suicide’: UK judge cites clinical depression to block Assange’s extradition||A British judge on Monday rejected the United States’ request to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to face espionage charges, saying he was likely to kill himself if held under harsh US prison conditions.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser rejected allegations that Assange is being prosecuted for political reasons or would not receive a fair trial in the United States. But she said his precarious mental health would likely deteriorate further under the conditions of “near total isolation” he would face in US prison.“I find that the mental condition of Mr. Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America,” the judge said.She said Assange was “a depressed and sometimes despairing man” who had the “intellect and determination” to circumvent any suicide prevention measures taken by American prison authorities.The US government said it would appeal the decision. Assange’s lawyers said they would ask for his release from a London prison where he has been held for more than a year-and-a-half at a bail hearing on Wednesday.Assange, who sat in the dock at London’s Central Criminal Court for the ruling, wiped his brow as the decision was announced. His partner Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept.Assange’s American lawyer, Barry Pollack, said the legal team was “enormously gratified by the U.K. court’s decision denying extradition.”“The effort by the United States to prosecute Julian Assange and seek his extradition was ill-advised from the start,” he said. “We hope that after consideration of the UK court’s ruling, the United States will decide not to pursue the case further.”The ruling marks a dramatic moment in Assange’s years-long legal battles in Britain — though likely not its final chapter.US prosecutors have indicted Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse over WikiLeaks’ publication of leaked military and diplomatic documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.Lawyers for the 49-year-old Australian argue that he was acting as a journalist and is entitled to First Amendment protections of freedom of speech for publishing leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan.The judge, however, said Assange’s actions, if proven, would “amount to offenses in this jurisdiction that would not be protected by his right to freedom of speech.”The defense also argued during a three-week hearing in the fall that extradition threatens Assange’s human rights because he risks “a grossly disproportionate sentence” and detention in “draconian and inhumane conditions” that would exacerbate his severe depression and other mental health problems.The judge agreed that US prison conditions would be oppressive. She accepted evidence from expert witnesses that Assange had a depressive disorder and an autism spectrum disorder.“I accept that oppression as a bar to extradition requires a high threshold. ... However, I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the ‘single minded determination’ of his autism spectrum disorder,” the judge said in her ruling.Lawyers for the US government deny that Assange is being prosecuted merely for publishing the leaked documents, saying the case “is in large part based upon his unlawful involvement” in the theft of the diplomatic cables and military files by US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.The prosecution of Assange has been condemned by journalists and human rights groups, who say it undermines free speech around the world.They welcomed the judge’s decision, even though it was not made on free-speech grounds.“This is a huge relief to anyone who cares about the rights of journalists,” The Freedom of the Press Foundation tweeted:“The extradition request was not decided on press freedom grounds; rather, the judge essentially ruled the US prison system was too repressive to extradite. However, the result will protect journalists everywhere.”Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. In 2012, to avoid being sent to Sweden, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of UK and Swedish authorities — but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison, brought to court in a prison van throughout his extradition hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-judge-blocks-extradition-of-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-says-likely-to-commit-suicide-if-sent-to-us/story-AzGxYoLz4AvJX6fkbMbkrK.html
04-01-2021||World||On tape: Trump tells Georgia’s Republican secretary ‘just want to find votes||President Donald Trump pressured Georgia’s Republican secretary of state to “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the state’s presidential election, repeatedly citing disproven claims of fraud and raising the prospect of a “criminal offense” if officials did not change the vote count, according to a recording of the conversation.The phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Saturday was the latest step in an unprecedented effort by a sitting president to press a state official to reverse the outcome of a free and fair election that he lost. The president, who has refused to accept his loss to Democratic president-elect Biden, repeatedly argued that Raffensperger could change the certified results.“All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,” Trump said. “Because we won the state.”Georgia counted its votes three times before certifying Biden’s win by a 11,779 margin, Raffensperger noted. “President Trump, we’ve had several lawsuits, and we’ve had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions,” he said on the call. We don’t agree that you have won.”Audio snippets of the conversation were first posted online by The Washington Post. The Associated Press obtained the full audio of Trump’s conversation with Georgia officials from a person on the call. The AP has a policy of not amplifying disinformation and unproven allegations. The AP plans to post the full audio as it annotates a transcript with fact check material.Trump’s renewed intervention and the persistent and unfounded claims of fraud come nearly two weeks before he leaves office and two days before twin runoff elections in Georgia that will determine political control of the U.S. Senate.The president used the hourlong conversation to tick through a list of claims about the election in Georgia, including that hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously appeared in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. Officials have said there is no evidence of that happening.The Georgia officials on the call are heard repeatedly pushing back against the president’s assertions, telling him that he’s relying on debunked theories and, in one case, selectively edited video.At another point in the conversation, Trump appeared to threaten Raffensperger and Ryan Germany, the secretary of state’s legal counsel, by suggesting both could be criminally liable if they failed to find that thousands of ballots in Fulton County had been illegally destroyed. There is no evidence to support Trump’s claim.“That’s a criminal offense,” Trump says. “And you can’t let that happen.”Others on the call included Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, and attorneys assisting Trump, including Washington lawyer Cleta Mitchell.Democrats and a few Republicans condemned Trump’s actions, while at least one Democrat urged a criminal investigation. Legal experts said Trump’s behavior raised questions about possible election law violations.Biden senior adviser Bob Bauer called the recording “irrefutable proof” of Trump threatening an official in his own party to “rescind a state’s lawful, certified vote count and fabricate another in its place.”“It captures the whole, disgraceful story about Donald Trump’s assault on American democracy,” Bauer said.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in that chamber, said Trump’s conduct “merits nothing less than a criminal investigation.”Trump confirmed in a tweet Sunday that he had spoken with Raffensperger. The White House referred questions to Trump’s reelection campaign, which did not respond Sunday to an emailed request for comment. Raffensperger’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Trump has repeatedly attacked how Raffensperger conducted Georgia’s elections, claiming without evidence that the state’s 16 electoral votes were wrongly given to Biden.“He has no clue!” Trump tweeted of Raffensperger, saying the state official “was unwilling, or unable” to answer questions.Raffensperger’s Twitter response: “Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true. The truth will come out.”Various election officials across the country and Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have said there was no widespread fraud in the election. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden’s victory, have also vouched for the integrity of their state elections. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, which has three Trump-nominated justices.In Georgia, the ballots were counted three times. One was a mandatory hand count and one was requested by Trump.Still, Trump has publicly disparaged the election, raising concerns among Republicans that GOP voters may be discouraged from participating in Tuesday’s runoffs pitting Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff.Rebecca Green, who helps direct the election law program at William and Mary Law School, said that while it is appropriate for a candidate to question the outcome of an election, the processes for doing so for the presidential election have run their course. States have certified their votes.Green said Trump had raised “lots of questions” about whether he violated any election laws.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said Trump has shown “reprehensible and, possibly illegal, conduct.”Trump noted on the call that he intended to repeat his claims about fraud at a rally Monday night in Dalton, a heavily Republican area in north Georgia.“The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry,” he says on the recording.Biden is also due to campaign in Georgia on Monday, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stumped in Garden City, Georgia, on Sunday, slamming Trump for the call.“It was a bald, bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States,” she said.Loeffler and Perdue have largely backed Trump in his attempts to overturn election results. But on Sunday, Loeffler said she hadn’t decided whether to join Republican colleagues in challenging the legitimacy of Biden’s victory over Trump when Congress meets Wednesday to affirm Biden’s 306-232 vote win in the Electoral College.Perdue, who was quarantining after being exposed to a staff member with the coronavirus, said he supports the challenge, although he will not be a sitting senator when the vote happens because his term has expired. Still, he told Fox News Channel he was encouraging his colleagues to object, saying it’s “something that the American people demand right now.”His rival, Ossoff, speaking at the Garden City rally, attacked Perdue and Loeffler for failing to stand up for Georgia’s voters, specifically saying that the state’s Black voters were being targeted.He said: “When the president of the United States calls up Georgia’s election officials and tries to intimidate them to change the result of the election, to disenfranchise Georgia voters, to disenfranchise Black voters in Georgia who delivered this state for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that is a direct attack on our democracy.”___Amy and Brumback reported from Atlanta.

Eum means link in Korean.“We will replace all diesel passenger trains with the KTX-Eum by 2029 and establish eco-friendly railway transport nationwide,” Moon said at a station in the eastern city of Wonju.“By doing that, we will cut 70,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, which is equivalent to planting 10 million pine trees, and advance to a carbon neutral society.”The train, built by Hyundai Rotem Co, only produces some 70% of the emissions produced by diesel-powered trains, which generated 235,000 tonnes of emissions in 2019, according to state-run Korail Railroad Corp.Its top speed is 260 km (162 miles) an hour, slightly slower than the 300 kmh of the regular KTX.Moon is promoting a “Green New Deal”, a six-year plan aimed at boosting jobs and curbing heavy reliance on fossil fuels in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.Moon has declared that South Korea would be carbon neutral by 2050.The initiative focuses on investing in more environmentally friendly energy and transport, such as solar power and electric and hydrogen cars, and building digital infrastructure.Korail chief, Son Byung-seok, told Moon that the company aims to expand high-speed services from 29% of all routes to 52% by 2024, as part of the government’s plans to funnel 70 trillion won ($64.7 billion) into rail networks.Coal makes up 40% of South Korea’s electricity mix and renewable power less than 6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-cut-railway-carbon-emissions-by-replacing-diesel-trains-by-2029/story-Ehk1K1bSOnR370gu3BOLAK.html
04-01-2021||World||Explained: Why are Georgia Senate runoffs extremely crucial for Joe Biden?||US President-elect Joe Biden won the southern state of Georgia with a slim margin but another important election went undecided - the race to Senate. In November, no candidate for two Senate seats from Georgia received a minimum of 50 per cent votes required to win the race, according to the state rules, which meant the top two candidates go through another election, a so-called runoff, on January 5. Both Senate seats from Georgia are currently held by Republicans - David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.Why are Georgia Senate runoffs crucial?The control over the US Senate is important in getting laws passed, confirming Cabinet appointments and Supreme Court justices on to the bench of the highest court for a lifetime. The Georgia Senate runoffs are extremely crucial for Biden’s administration since the upper chamber of the US Congress is currently controlled by Republicans.The Senate has 46 Democrats, 50 Republicans and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - who generally vote along the Democratic lines. If Democrats win the Georgia runoffs, they will have effective control over the Senate with 50 votes and Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris as the deciding vote in case of a tie.Also Read | A record 3 million early votes cast in Georgia’s US senate runoff racesLast week, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected calls from US President Donald Trump and Congressional Democrats to increase coronavirus aid to individuals from $600 to $2,000. Democrats-controlled House had already passed the measure for $2,000 cheques requested by Trump but the Kentucky senator said the money would go to many households that don’t need the aid. If Democrats get effective control over the Senate, they will be able to pass partisan bills.The Supreme Court already has a 6-3 conservative majority after the Senate confirmed the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the top court seat, replacing liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died in September. The Republican control over the Senate has also played an important role in the nominations announced by Biden’s transition team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-georgia-senate-runoffs-extremely-crucial-for-joe-biden/story-yyJxiRfKe4SlTx71QSZZ2O.html

The Philippines, which has the second-highest number of infections in Southeast Asia, is aiming to secure at least 80 million vaccines from pharmaceuticals including AstraZeneca Plc., Novavax Inc. and Pfizer Inc., with deals expected this month and shipments by the second quarter.The military last week confirmed that soldiers in Duterte’s security team were already inoculated, but didn’t say what vaccines were used and how they were obtained. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, in a briefing Monday said the president’s security team will face the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-probes-unauthorized-vaccines-given-to-soldiers-chinese-workers/story-NId1O4ZXrqxl9gZ4pr6o4K.html
04-01-2021||World||Divided US bigger risk to world than Covid-19 in 2021: Survey||With the global economy still in the teeth of the Covid-19 crisis, the Eurasia group sees a divided US as a key risk this year for a world lacking leadership.“In decades past, the world would look to the US to restore predictability in times of crisis. But the world’s preeminent superpower faces big challenges of its own,” said Eurasia Group President Ian Bremmer and Chairman Cliff Kupchan in a report on the top risks for 2021.Starting with the difficulties facing the Biden Administration in a divided US, the report flags 10 geopolitical, climate and individual country risks that could derail the global economic recovery. An extended Covid-19 impact and K-shaped recoveries in both developed and emerging economies is the second biggest risk factor cited in the report.Biden will have difficulty gaining new confidence in US global leadership as he struggles to manage domestic crises, the report said. With a large segment of the US casting doubt over his legitimacy, the political effectiveness and longevity of his “asterisk presidency,” the future of the Republican Party, and the very legitimacy of the US political model are all in question, it added.“A superpower torn down the middle cannot return to business as usual. And when the most powerful country is so divided, everybody has a problem,” said Bremmer and Kupchan.The report warns that the pandemic and its broad impact will not vanish once vaccination becomes widespread. Uneven recoveries, variance in vaccine access and stimulus plans that fall short will push up debt levels, leave workers displaced and fuel opposition toward incumbent leaders.For the US, this will increase the polarization that fed support for Donald Trump. For emerging economies, the debt crunch could lead to financial troubles, the report said.Some concerns are more likely to be “red herring” risks that have been overplayed, the report adds. These include relations between Biden and “Trump’s fellow travelers” such as Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, the UK’s Boris Johnson and Israel’s Binyamin Netanyahu. The Biden administration will engage on shared interests and leaders will adapt to the new status quo, the report says.Fears over a global backlash against US big tech and an Iran-US confrontation are also seen as lower risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divided-us-bigger-risk-to-world-than-covid-19-in-2021-survey/story-ob8rCAZU0H1XJUHml64WbO.html
04-01-2021||World||Tesla poised for expansion after just missing 2020 target||Tesla Inc. came close to meeting its 500,000 vehicle-deliveries goal for 2020, setting the stage for a new year in which it’s expanding in China and poised to open new factories in Texas and Germany.The electric-car maker said Jan. 2 it handed over 180,570 vehicles in the year’s final three months, the most for any quarter but just 450 vehicles shy of the half-million mark Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk sought for the year. Tesla has been ramping up output of its more mass-market models to meet rising global demand for battery-powered cars, with 2020’s total jumping 36% from the prior year.“The good news is Tesla has the formula consumers want,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, wrote to clients. “The bad news is to keep up with this demand, the company needs to quickly build new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany. While they made it look easy in Shanghai, ramping production is difficult and will be one of the most important Tesla topics in 2021.”Musk and Tesla had a remarkable year, with the company joining the S&P 500 Index in December after five consecutive quarters of profit. The shares rallied 743% in 2020, giving the carmaker a $668.9 billion stock-market capitalization. Musk -- who ended the year as the world’s second-richest person -- took to Twitter to praise his team, saying that in its earliest days he thought the carmaker had only a 10% chance of even surviving.Tesla shares rose as much as 2.7% to $725 before the start of regular trading Monday. The stock closed at a record $705.67 on Dec. 31.The quarterly delivery figure is widely seen as a barometer of demand for both Tesla’s vehicles and consumer interest in electric vehicles worldwide. The company says its quarterly deliveries statements should be viewed as slightly conservative and that final numbers could vary by 0.5% or more.“Musk & Co. basically hitting its 500k goal for the year is a major feather in the cap for the company and the bulls as Tesla saw robust Model 3 demand over the last 10 months despite the hurricane-like consumer headwinds seen globally” because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a report.‘Comfortably Exceed’Tesla had predicted in January 2020 -- before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic -- it would “comfortably exceed” sales of half a million cars. The company said in October it still expected to meet that target despite a temporary shutdown of its factories in the spring, and Musk suggested it was within reach in an internal email sent to employees in December.Analysts also predicted Tesla would meet its sales goal for the year, which further buoyed the company’s shares in the waning days of 2020. The surge withstood multiple share offerings that could boost the carmaker’s cash balance to around $20 billion.The company undershot the 181,000-vehicle threshold it needed to clear in the most recent quarter, a 30% jump over the July-September period. The push largely depended on increased output from its China plant and higher output in the U.S. of the newest vehicle in its lineup, the Model Y.Tesla said Model Y production in Shanghai has begun, with deliveries expected to begin soon.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:“Tesla’s miss of a 500,000 delivery goal for 2020 indicates the automaker is still struggling to scale up, as the eighth year of mass-market pursuit still leaves the company about the size of Isuzu globally, even as it eclipses the combined market cap of 10 automakers that deliver more than 50 million units annually. Tesla faces compressing margins as the focus shifts to China and sales by competitors mute the profit contribution of regulatory credits initially, then threaten market share.”-- Kevin Tynan, senior autos analystWhile Tesla is the clear global market leader, its vehicle deliveries are tiny compared to the millions of gasoline-powered cars and trucks sold by established automakers such as General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG. Those two carmakers and others are preparing to flood the nascent EV market with dozens of battery-powered models over the coming years.Quarter-End PushTo capitalize on its head start, Tesla is building two new vehicle assembly operations -- the one outside Berlin that could eventually assemble as many as 500,000 cars annually, and the other in Texas that will make the brand’s first pickup. Both are expected to start production later this year, joining its existing vehicle-assembly facilities in Fremont, California, and Shanghai.Once known for niche luxury models such as its Model S sedan and X sport utility vehicle, Tesla has broadened its appeal with the 3 and Y models priced to start below $50,000. Musk said in September that he plans to start sales of a $25,000 Tesla by 2023.As usual, Tesla delivered many cars during the quarter’s final days. Musk offered an incentive in the final three days of the year, saying in a tweet that buyers would get three months of an optional driver-assistance tool Tesla calls Full Self-Driving.Danielle Watson, a 31-year-old pharmacist, tweeted on Dec. 28 that she had just taken delivery of a Model Y. In a private message, the Greenville, South Carolina, resident said she took delivery in Charlotte, North Carolina -- a sign the lure of Tesla’s brand power in the U.S. is growing well beyond its home state of California.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-poised-for-expansion-after-just-missing-2020-target/story-SYIZ5TluCSPWP53Lj2hdeM.html

Speculation around the Chinese billionaire’s whereabouts surfaced after reports of him not making an appearance in the public for more than two months did the rounds, as per a Business Insider report. The founder of Alibaba was scheduled to appear for the shoot of the final episode of his own talent show Africa’s Business Heroes where he was supposed to be participating as a judge, but was later replaced by another Alibaba executive, according to Yahoo Finance which cited a news report in the UK’s Telegraph.A spokesperson of the company said that the tech tycoon was unable to join the adjudicating panel due to a conflict in the schedule, reported Financial Times.Also Read | China targets Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group, orders probe for ‘monopolistic practices’Buzz around Jack Ma’s disappearance from public space comes after China’s antitrust probe on Alibaba and Ant Group. The antitrust probe on the e-commerce empire of the former school teacher alleging monopolistic practises came after China dramatically suspended Ant Group’s $37 billion initial public offer (IPO), which was on the course to be one of the largest IPO in the world. The IPO was halted just 48 hours before its dual listing on Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges. Ant Group was also under heavy scrutiny by the Chinese government after Jack Ma’s speech that criticised the regulation system of the country and called the banks “pawnshops”. “Today’s financial system is the legacy of the Industrial Age,” Ma added, “We must set up a new one for the next generation and young people.

The city reported 53 new cases for the day, 43 of which were local.Six of Monday’s cases were untraceable, the lowest number since November 19.Hong Kong has been one of the most aggressive places worldwide to close schools despite research from the likes of the United Nations warning about the adverse consequences of doing so. Still, the city has continued to suspend classes as part of its arsenal to bring down case numbers and re-open its economy to travellers, particularly to those from mainland China.Besides schools, the government will extend other social distancing measures by another two weeks until January 20.The city recently banned travellers from the UK in the wake of a more contagious strain of the coronavirus being detected there. An earlier effort to open up quarantine-free flights to and from Singapore — the first major air travel bubble — collapsed last month after a resurgence of cases in Hong Kong.Separately, Hong Kong reported that a pet cat tested positive for Covid-19 after its owner became infected by the virus. So far, eight dogs and eight cats have tested positive in the city, though the government said there’s no evidence that pets are spreading the coronavirus to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-postpones-school-re-openings-to-lunar-new-year/story-INXsYsG0rEHTmvCRcq5MpL.html
04-01-2021||World||China telco shares hit by NYSE delisting announcement||Shares in China’s three biggest telecoms companies fell as much as 5% in Hong Kong on Monday, the first trading session since the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) said it would delist the firms in a move China branded unwise and oppressive.By the close of trade, the shares had mostly recovered.The NYSE said on Thursday it would delist China Mobile Ltd , China Telecom Corp Ltd and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd following the U.S. government’s move in November to block investment in 31 firms it says are owned or controlled by China’s military.Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s foreign ministry, said the US move was “unwise”, oppressive, and reflected how “random, arbitrary and uncertain” US rules can be.“China is firmly opposed to the United States politicisation of the trade issue, the abuse of the state’s power and stretching of the concept of national security to suppress Chinese companies,” she told a regular news briefing on Monday.The American Deposit Receipts (ADRs) listed by the three companies have a combined market value of under 20 billion yuan ($3.07 billion), or 2.2% of the firms’ equity, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has said.The delisting could put short term selling pressure on the stocks as the ADR shareholders may convert their holdings into Hong Kong shares before selling them. The stocks’ potential removal from indexes such as MSCI and FTSE could also lead to selling by index funds, said Citi analyst Michelle Fang.“However, Chinese telcos’ operations are mainly domestic focused and their sound fundamentals along with recovery trends and positive cash flows will not be affected by the delisting,” she said.After tumbling more than 4.5% to their lowest since July 2007, China Mobile shares closed down 0.79% at HK$43.85. China Telecom closed 2.79% lower, while China Unicom ended up 0.45%, versus a 0.89% rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.All three firms said they had not received a delisting notification from the NYSE.Citic Securities analysts played down the impact of the delisting decision.“The three firms on average only have 1.5% of their shares listed in the U.S. and the rest in Hong Kong, have ample liquidity, and haven’t done any fundraising in the U.S. for 20 years. Having shares listed in the U.S. will only pose more risk for them,” they said in a research note.Washington has hardened its stance against China in recent weeks. In December, it added dozens of Chinese firms to a trade blacklist, accusing Beijing of using them to harness civilian technology for military purposes.Hua said China would take any necessary measures to safeguard the legal rights of Chinese firms.“In recent years it’s been quite normal to see Chinese firms delist in the U.S. or have secondary listings in Hong Kong,” the Citic analysts wrote. “With the delisting, the three telcos will get a chance to have their shares re-evaluated and reduce financial disclosure cost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-telco-shares-hit-by-nyse-delisting-announcement/story-uqG7Z0UuVc6M96bOPIMRhO.html
04-01-2021||World||‘It will not work’: Bernie Sanders warns Republicans against delaying Joe Biden’s inauguration||US senator Bernie Sanders joined his Democrat counterparts in criticising Republicans who are planning to vote against accepting the results of the presidential elections unless there’s a 10-day audit. Their move reportedly cannot change the outcome of the elections but can delay president-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration beyond the expected date of January 20. The move to challenge the election results is being led by two prominent Republican figures, Senator Josh Hawley of Montana and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Senators from Alabama, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Wyoming, Louisiana, Kansas and Montana have now joined the coalition to reject the Electoral College tallies unless Congress launches a commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. Hawley is particularly opposing the election results in Pennsylvania, where Donald Trump lost by a margin of 80,000 votes, a state he won in 2016. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit by the Trump campaign to overturn the state’s election over unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud. Sanders invoked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s judgement in his letter stating that all prior attempts to overturn election results have been duly discredited even by judges appointed by President Trump. “In the two months since the election, more than 80 judges, including some who were appointed by the President, have rejected Donald Trump and his allies’ attempts to overturn the election. There are no cases pending that will have any impact on the results. There have been numerous recounts, audits and verifications, including in the most closely contested states. Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security even called this ‘the most secure election in American history’,” he said.“It will not work. Joe Biden will be President at noon on January 20. This spectacle by Republican lawmakers only demonstrates their disdain for voters, democracy and the will of the American people,” Sanders added. The veteran senator from Vermont, who ran for president himself in 2020, tweeted his support of Republican Mitt Romney’s stance on his senate colleagues’ continued efforts at delaying Joe Biden’s confirmation. “I don’t often agree with Sen. Mitt Romney. But in describing the tactics of his GOP colleagues to undermine Joe Biden’s victory, he is right when he says, “I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?”, Sanders tweeted. Bipartisan support against Hawley and Cruz’s attempts have been taking shape in the House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has even warned Republicans against mounting any such challenge, reported Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-will-not-work-bernie-sanders-warns-republicans-against-delaying-joe-biden-s-inauguration/story-XPMUGIdPO1JKMWskcXZPQI.html
04-01-2021||World||Singapore police could access Covid-19 contact tracing data for criminal investigations||Singapore said on Monday its police will be able to use data obtained by its coronavirus contact-tracing technology for criminal investigations, a decision likely to increase privacy concerns around the system.The technology, deployed as both a phone app and a physical device, is being used by nearly 80% of the 5.7 million population, authorities said after announcing its use would become compulsory in places like shopping malls.The TraceTogether scheme, one of the most widely used in any country, has raised privacy fears but authorities have said the data is encrypted, stored locally and only tapped by authorities if individuals test positive for Covid-19.“The Singapore Police Force is empowered ... to obtain any data, including TraceTogether data, for criminal investigations,” Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan said in response to a question in parliament.The privacy statement on the TraceTogether website says: “data will only be used for Covid-19 contact tracing”.Privacy concerns have been raised about such apps in various places, including Israel and South Korea.“Concerns have focused on data security issues associated with the collection, use and storage of the data,” law firm Norton Rose Fullbright said on Singapore’s scheme in a review of global contact-tracing technology last month.Asked about the TraceTogether privacy statement by an opposition MP, Tan said: “We do not preclude the use of TraceTogether data in circumstances where citizens’ safety and security is or has been affected, and this applies to all other data as well.”Dissent is rare in Singapore, which has been ruled by the same party since its independence in 1965, has strict laws, widespread surveillance and restrictions on public assembly.Serious crime is also rare.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has previously said privacy concerns about the tech had to be weighed against the need to curb the spread of the virus and keep the economy open.Singapore has reported only a handful of local Covid-19 cases over the last few months, and its extensive disease surveillance and contact tracing efforts have won international praise including from the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-police-could-access-covid-19-contact-tracing-data-for-criminal-investigations/story-xYKQMG7SjhcMbrY5MLwaaO.html
04-01-2021||World||Germany leads European manufacturing to best month since 2018||Euro-area manufacturing grew the fastest in more than 2 1/2 years in December, bringing some positive news at the end of a horrific year for the region’s economy.Growth was led by Germany, where activity expanded the most in almost three years. With all other countries covered in IHS Markit’s monthly surveys also reporting stronger readings than during the previous month, the euro-area index rose to 55.2 from 53.8.The improvement comes as governments continue to grapple with the coronavirus. The latest restrictions to contain the spread have been mostly confined to services such as bars and restaurants, allowing manufacturing to continue. That’s limiting the downside to the economy compared with the huge slump seen during the initial phase of the pandemic.“Euro-zone manufacturing ended 2020 on an encouragingly strong note,” said Chris Williamson, an economist at IHS Markit. “Rising virus case numbers are nevertheless likely to mean trading conditions remain challenging in the near-term and therefore constrain growth.”Some of the improvement at factories in December, particularly in Ireland and the Netherlands, reflected a temporary boost in demand from U.K. customers stockpiling before the end-of-year Brexit date.The results may not fully capture disruptions in late December. France temporarily closed cross-Channel traffic from the U.K. after a new, more infectious strain of the coronavirus was discovered.In Asia, manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexes saw improvements in some countries, though China’s momentum moderated. Its official manufacturing gauge fell in December from a three-year high. The Caixin Media and IHS Markit PMI dropped to 53 from 54.9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-leads-european-manufacturing-to-best-month-since-2018/story-iGl213pvVg7fth7cYCygZO.html
04-01-2021||World||‘Glimmer of hope’: Fauci on increase in Covid vaccinations||The US ramped up Covid-19 vaccinations in the past few days after a slower-than-expected start, bringing the number of shots dispensed to about 4 million, government health officials said Sunday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, also said on ABC’s “This Week” that President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to administer 100 million shots of the vaccine within his first 100 days in office is achievable.And he rejected President Donald Trump’s false claim on Twitter that coronavirus deaths and cases in the U.S. have been greatly exaggerated.“All you need to do ... is go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people and real deaths,” Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”The U.S. death toll has climbed past 350,000, the most of any country, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, while more than 20 million people nationwide have been infected. States have reported record numbers of cases over the past few days, and funeral homes in Southern California are being inundated with bodies.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the pandemic is getting worse in his city as the virus spreads rapidly within households and people let their guard down with news of a vaccine’s arrival. “This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”Experts believe that the real numbers of U.S. deaths and infections are much higher and that many cases were overlooked, in part because of insufficient testing.Fauci said he has seen “some little glimmer of hope” after 1.5 million doses were administered in the previous 72 hours, or an average of about 500,000 per day, a marked increase in vaccinations. He said that brings the total to about 4 million.He acknowledged the U.S. fell short of its goal of having 20 million doses shipped and distributed by the end of December.“There have been a couple of glitches. That’s understandable,” Fauci said. “We are not where we want to be, there’s no doubt about that.”But he expressed optimism that the momentum will pick up by mid-January and that ultimately the U.S. will be vaccinating 1 million people a day. Biden’s “goal of vaccinating 100 million people in the first 100 days is a realistic goal,” Fauci said.Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the chief science adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the government’s vaccine development and distribution effort, told CBS that 17.5 million doses have been shipped. About 13 million of those have been distributed to clinics, hospitals and other places where they will be administered, according to Fauci.The 20 million-dose goal hasn’t been reached in part because local health departments and medical facilities had to stay focused on testing to handle a surge in cases, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said. And the holiday season meant health workers were taking time off, he said.“I don’t want anyone to think I’m being Pollyannish here. There’s what we delivered, and we hope that those will be translated into vaccinations. That has not occurred to the way that we would like,” Adams said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”On Sunday morning, Trump falsely tweeted that the outbreak has been “far exaggerated” because of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “ridiculous” methodology. He complained, too, that Fauci has been credited by the news media with doing “an incredible job” when Fauci “works for me and the Trump Administration, and I am in no way given any credit for my work.”Fauci and others are warning that an additional surge is likely because of holiday gatherings and the cold weather keeping people indoors.“It could and likely will get worse in the next couple of weeks, or at least maintain this very terribly high level of infections and deaths that we’re seeing,” Fauci said.Arizona on Sunday reported a one-day record of more than 17,200 new cases, eclipsing the previous mark of about 12,000 set in early December. Health officials said the jump appears to reflect infections from Christmas gatherings but was also probably inflated by a reporting lag over New Year’s weekend.North Carolina and Texas reported record numbers of people in the hospital with Covid-19 — nearly 3,600 and over 12,500, respectively..Overseas, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said more onerous lockdown restrictions in England are likely as a variant of the coronavirus has pushed infection rates to their highest levels on record. More than 50,000 new infections have been reported daily over the past six days.Scientists have said the variant is up to 70% more contagious. While Fauci said the U.S. needs to do its own study, he noted that British researchers believe that the mutated version is no deadlier or more likely to make people sicker and that vaccines are effective against it.But Scott Gottlieb, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner who serves on the board of vaccine maker Pfizer, said on “Face the Nation” that the variant “really creates more urgency around trying to get this vaccine out more quickly and get more people vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glimmer-of-hope-fauci-on-increase-in-covid-vaccinations/story-YJ12MaL2WyzyjQugmju7cP.html

An NHS spokeswoman told Reuters the “story is not true”.“As the CMO has said, the main barrier to vaccine delivery will be availability of the vaccine, and it is completely untrue that staffing constraints are currently standing in the way of vaccine rollout, with the NHS ready to deliver vaccine as supply becomes available,” the spokeswoman said in an email.“The NHS is off to a strong start vaccinating one million people and now beginning the rapid rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca, which will enable us to vaccinate millions more people with the support of tens of thousands of vaccinators,” the spokeswoman added.Britain has been at the forefront of approving new coronavirus vaccines, becoming the first country to give emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccines last month.Manufacturers insist doses are being delivered to the timetable agreed with the government, the Telegraph reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nhs-denies-report-it-hasn-t-committed-to-delivering-2-million-covid-19-jabs-a-week/story-V22buX3dXCrffJiAkPJmqI.html
04-01-2021||World||World stock markets kick off 2021 at record highs||World stock markets hit record highs on Monday, the first trading day of the new year, as investors hoped the rollout of vaccines would ultimately lift a global economy decimated by the Covid-19 pandemic.The Chinese yuan surged nearly 1% against the dollar, while the greenback plumbed its lowest levels against a basket of peer currencies since April 2018. Bitcoin hovered above $32,000 on the back of a blistering 800% rally since mid-March.European stocks opened higher, with Britain’s FTSE 100 gaining 1.75%, Germany’s DAX up 1.1%, Spain’s IBEX up 1.3% and Italy’s FTSE MIB rising 0.7%. MSCI’s All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, hit a record high and was up nearly half a percent on the day after the start of trading in London.“The year kicks off as 2020 ended, an everything rally with the double V dichotomy (virus vs. vaccine) seeing the hopes that either things get worse and stimulus ramps up or things get better and, well, things get better so long as there’s no hint of liquidity withdrawal and a taper tantrum,” a trader said.Asian stock markets also gained, although Japan’s Nikkei 225 index shed early gains, falling 0.4% after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed the government was considering a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures as the coronavirus spreads.Despite the optimism over vaccines, investors are still sounding caution over the path of the virus, which continues to spread amidst the discovery of a new strain.“The virus retains the upper hand for a while longer,” said Karl Steiner, chief quantitative strategist at SEB, noting that vaccinations have had an uneven start, characterized by vaccine shortages, vaccine resistance and delays.Britain began vaccinating its population with the Covid-19 shot developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca on Monday.With the lag between a full vaccine rollout and a global economic recovery, investors will count on central banks to keep money cheap.“We continue to believe that equities have further room to rise in 2021 as monetary and fiscal stimulus measures provide a tailwind, and we anticipate significant earnings growth as the global economy recovers,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting are due on Wednesday and should offer more detail on discussions about making their forward policy guidance more explicit and the chance of a further increase in asset buying this year.E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were steady after also touching a record high. PAYROLLS A RISKThe data calendar includes a raft of manufacturing surveys across the globe, which will show how industry is coping with the spread of the coronavirus, and the closely watched ISM surveys of U.S. factories and services.Chinese factory activity continued to accelerate in December, though the PMI missed forecasts at 53.0.Japanese manufacturing stabilised for the first time in two years in December, while Taiwan picked up.Friday sees the U.S. December payroll report where median forecasts are for only a modest increase of 100,000 jobs.Analysts as Barclays are tipping a fall of 50,000 in jobs, which would be a shock to market hopes of a speedy recovery.“A number of incoming indicators on activity point to slower momentum as the economy closes out the year, including data on labour markets where initial claims rose during the December survey period,” said economist Michael Gapen in a note.Such a drop would add pressure on the Fed to ease further, another burden for the dollar which is already buckling under the weight of the massive U.S. budget and trade deficits.In currencies, the euro pushed back up to $1.2281, having run into profit-taking late last week when it reached the highest since early 2018 at $1.2309. It gained almost 9% over 2020.The dollar slipped to 102.80 yen. Sterling firmed to $1.3690, levels last seen in mid-2018.The decline in the dollar has been a support for gold, leaving the metal 1.3% firmer at $1,931 an ounce.Oil prices extended their rise after a couple of months of solid gains, with Brent crossing $53 a barrel. U.S. crude added 2% to $49.52 a barrel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-stock-markets-kick-off-2021-at-record-highs/story-Ux2GvLE3OMgMa3Nxu3NOxO.html
04-01-2021||World||Trump’s last stand on election gives Pence a final loyalty test||President Donald Trump will make his last stand to overturn his election loss on Wednesday when Vice President Mike Pence presides over a congressional session to ratify November’s results, an event that threatens to strain the relationship between the two men.Trump’s refusal to concede and his obsession with overturning the will of voters means the ceremony poses a test for his most loyal subordinate.The vice president’s top aides are developing options for him to acknowledge the reality of the November election result while also nodding, in a possible statement, to the president’s unfounded accusations of vote fraud.Development of the plan has fallen to Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, and General Counsel Greg Jacob, both of whom realize the potential tension in the situation, according to two people familiar with the matter.“Pence just has to play it straight. He has a specific job as defined in the Constitution,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a long time Trump ally. “He doesn’t have the burden of having to force something to happen. All he has to do is preside over it.”In a statement over the weekend, Short said that Pence “shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election.Yet the president himself is unlikely to let the day pass without comment -- and that, along with following the law, is what most concerns Pence’s friends and advisers.Congress ratifies the results of the election in a joint session every four years, as mandated by the Constitution. Typically, the session is routine and brief.Some of Trump’s allies now argue that Pence has the power to single-handedly change the outcome of the election. Last week, several House Republicans, led by Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas, filed a federal lawsuit seeking to force Pence to reject Electoral College votes from several states where Trump has, baselessly, claimed that President-elect Joe Biden won only thanks to vote fraud.On Thursday, the Justice Department, on behalf of Pence, asked a judge in Texas to deny Gohmert’s request. A federal appeals court threw out the Gohmert suit on Saturday after it was first knocked back Friday by a Trump-appointed judge.These recent machinations place enormous pressure on the vice president. Through four years in the White House, he’s remained unfailingly loyal to Trump, neither publicly disagreeing with any policy nor offering the slightest criticism of his boss.Pence, 61, has long been expected to mount his own campaign for president in 2024, a bid that would depend heavily on support from the president’s base. The possibility that Trump himself might run again has complicated that decision for Pence and other potential candidates.One former Trump campaign official called the Wednesday event one final stress test, arguing that it creates another inflection point for Trump supporters to re-litigate the results of the election.Both Trump and his fans -- thousands of whom are expected to gather on the streets of Washington -- may react with anger should Pence stand silently by as Congress ratifies the president’s defeat. Some Republican House members and at least 11 senators have said they’ll challenge Electoral College votes, forcing lawmakers to vote to accept the results.That would place congressional Republicans in the position of either aligning themselves with Trump’s claims, or risking his wrath by affirming Biden’s victory.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated he doesn’t want the ratification of election results to become a spectacle -- especially if it causes discomfort for fellow Republicans up for re-election in 2022. But GOP senators led by Ted Cruz of Texas are planning just that.Constitutional scholars roundly reject the proposition that the vice president plays any substantive role in the process. The Constitution says only that the president of the Senate -- Pence -- shall “open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.”These arguments haven’t swayed the president, who’s spent the past last several weeks consumed by his election loss, even as Covid-19 cases surged, Congress narrowly passed a major coronavirus relief package, and federal agencies dealt with a massive hack of data that has been blamed on Russia.In telephone calls with allies and advisers over the last two weeks, Trump has repeatedly discussed what he regards as rampant voter fraud. On Saturday he was scheduled to address an “election integrity watchdog group” call with state legislators to review alleged “irregularities and lawlessness” in the 2020 election. And he’s recently turned his attention toward the ceremony with Pence, who spent the holidays on vacation in Vail, Colorado.In anticipation of the vote ratification, the right-leaning group Club for Growth spent $25,000 to run a commercial on Fox News last week in the Palm Beach, Florida, market while Trump was staying at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The ad tried to counter a critical ad on Pence created by the Lincoln Project, a Trump opposition group, and highlighted Pence’s loyalty to the president.The Club for Growth is run by David McIntosh, a former member of Congress from Indiana and close friend of Pence, who was governor of the state. McIntosh recently traveled with the vice president to campaign in Georgia’s runoff Senate election, and said that during the flight, he and the vice president discussed the Lincoln Project ad.Pence wanted to make sure the president understood “he remained a good friend,” McIntosh said.Pence has privately tried to steer clear of the more conspiracy-minded advisers in Trump’s orbit, according to people close to him.The relationship between Trump and Pence has always been a delicate one that the vice president and his team have taken great care to manage. During his 2016 campaign, Trump wavered between choosing Pence and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for his running mate.To the Trump team, Pence brought strong conservative credentials and the support of anti-abortion groups and evangelicals -- along with a close-knit group of aides which has been far more disciplined than many of Trump’s West Wing staff.The vice president has amicably accepted Trump’s toughest assignments, including leading the federal government’s response to the pandemic.Yet despite Pence’s loyalty and conservative bona fides, rumors abounded before the 2020 election that Trump had mused about replacing him. A senior administration official said Pence and Trump still talk frequently and over the past week, spoke at least every other day.Wednesday’s election certification ceremony may mark the ultimate loyalty test for the vice president, and one which Trump will watch closely. Biden’s team called the ratification of the election results “merely a formality,” one that Biden himself presided over in January 2017, certifying Trump’s victory.“Regardless of whatever antics anyone is up to on January 6, President-elect Biden will be sworn in on the 20th,” said Jen Psaki, the incoming White House press secretary.Following Wednesday’s ceremony, Pence intends to hold a series of domestic events during which he’ll highlight the president’s legacy, said a second senior administration official, including potential speeches on the economy, China or foreign policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-last-stand-on-election-gives-pence-a-final-loyalty-test/story-UPT3ohIKov590bmz1I6f6H.html
04-01-2021||World||South Korea’s population falls for first time during Covid-19 pandemic||South Korea’s population declined in 2020 for the first time on record as births dropped to a historic low amid the pandemic.The population fell by about 21,000 to 51.8 million, according to the Ministry of Interior and Safety. The number of South Korean births slid 11% compared with the previous year, likely driving down what is already the world’s lowest national fertility rate.With the pandemic hitting jobs and hurting incomes, even more people are delaying marriage and pregnancies, accelerating the country’s aging problems, the Bank of Korea said in a report last month.South Korean policy makers for years have had little success trying to boost birth rates by subsidizing pay during childcare leave and providing free nurseries. A lack of good jobs is the big reason that young people are choosing to have fewer babies, according to Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Seoul’s Yonsei University.“The economy isn’t growing as fast as it used to, and the rigid wage system that rewards employees for seniority keeps employers reluctant to hire new ones,” he said.The jobless rate for South Koreans in their 20s exceeds 9%, even as the figure for all age groups hovers around 4%.The interior ministry’s report, released Sunday, also showed households getting smaller, shrinking to an average of just 2.24 people. People living alone now account for close to 40% of the total, suggesting that the focus of welfare and housing policies needs to change, the report said.With seniors aged 60 and older now making up 24% of the population and the number of working-age people continuing to decline, government finances are likely to come under increasing pressure, especially given all the spending needed to deal with the pandemic.South Korea’s government still has a low debt-ratio compared with other developed economies, but the pace of increase has alarmed some policy makers and President Moon Jae-in’s administration is pushing for legislation to cap borrowing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-population-falls-for-first-time-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-eAj2L4mFDQUI2VSnnkzy0J.html

France, which has a strong anti-vaccination movement, started its inoculation campaign at the end of December, as did many other European countries.But it has only vaccinated hundreds since then, versus tens of thousands in Germany and more a million in Britain, which on Monday became the first country to roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot.“I think that the Moderna vaccine ought to arrive this week,” Dominique Le Guludec, head of the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), told BFM TV, adding that France wanted more information on the AstraZeneca shot.The United States authorised Moderna’s vaccine on Dec. 19, Canada did so on Dec. 23 and the EU’s watchdog is expected to approve it this week.Epidemiologist and government scientific adviser Arnaud Fontanet told France Info radio that France needed to speed up its vaccine rollout and that the spread of the virus in France was too high for the government to ease restrictions.France has the seventh-highest COVID-19 casualty toll in the world, with more than 65,000 deaths.President Emmanuel Macron said in his New Year’s Eve speech that everyone in France should be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine if they wanted it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-regulator-expects-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-to-arrive-this-week/story-7d8BKXobDryiYX0EQhr2TO.html
04-01-2021||World||China’s Covid-19 whistleblower says hospital left her nearly blind||The Chinese doctor who was the first to blow the whistle on the coronavirus emerging in Wuhan has become nearly blind in one eye in a high-profile medical dispute that has sent shares of China’s biggest private hospital chain plunging.Ai Fen, who heads the emergency department at the Central Hospital of Wuhan where Covid-19 patients were first detected, said that a nearly 30,000 yuan ($4,635) cataract surgery in May at the Wuhan branch of the Aier Eye Hospital Group Co. caused deteriorating vision in her right eye. By October, her retina had detached, she said in a video posted on Weibo last week.Aier’s shares dropped as much as 9.5% in Shenzhen on Monday morning before paring losses.The hospital chain, which runs more than 500 hospitals in China and dozens across Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia, said in a statement Monday that there is no link between the surgery and Ai’s retina detachment.Ai’s extreme myopia was a high-risk factor and the detachment occurred five months after the surgery, which went smoothly, the hospital said.The dispute reflects the ongoing crisis of confidence in private medical providers in China amid rapid growth of the industry, as middle-class Chinese clamour for access to better health care. Local access to better drugs and treatments has greatly improved in recent years as China invests billions in expanding care, but patient-doctor disputes have led to doctors being attacked and even killed by bitter patients and their family members.Ai claimed that Aier doctors ignored test results that could have flagged the surgery’s riskiness and that results from one pre-surgery test were doctored to make her cataract problem seem worse.The hospital denied that tests were doctored, though it acknowledged problems like incomplete patient records after surgery and doctors’ failure to report the adverse event in time.The retina detachment could have been prevented if the doctors had detected signs of complications and paid attention to her concerns of dim vision, she said. “When the retina detachment occurred, they pushed me away to my own hospital for surgery,” Ai wrote.“I have been a very optimistic person but this eye problem has made me collapse,” she wrote. “My family needs to accompany me when I walk and I can’t hold my own baby. I feel that I am having a mental breakdown and I’m in agony.”Ai became a household name in China after local media profiled how she shared on social media a picture of test results indicating that a patient had been infected in mid-December 2019 by an unknown virus similar to SARS. It was the first public warning of a pandemic that has now killed more than 1.8 million people globally.The photo she shared went viral and was re-posted by doctors including Li Wenliang, a young physician who was among those later censured by local police for “rumor-mongering.” Li died after contracting Covid-19 in February, and his death sparked the biggest backlash Beijing had seen in years as people vented their fury at delays and cover-ups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-whistleblower-says-hospital-left-her-nearly-blind/story-deas2BhfOoxfekIrAVNoUP.html

It is urgent we establish a time frame to do the same. Ignorance must not prevail over science,” he wrote.There are warning signs the virus is surging again in Brazil.Experts say the country of 212 million people is being hit by a second wave, and areas that once seemed to have brought the virus under control are again facing an onslaught of cases and deaths.That includes the Amazon rainforest state of Amazonas, whose capital, Manaus, was devastated by the virus last year, with haunting scenes of mass graves and corpses piled in refrigerator trucks.After a lull in cases in the second half of 2020 -- leading some experts to wonder whether so many people had been infected that the city reached “herd immunity” -- the virus is now exploding again in the region.With its morgues overwhelmed, Manaus has again deployed refrigerator trucks outside hospitals to store cadavers. A judge on Saturday ordered the Amazonas government to shut down all non-essential businesses and activities for 15 days to slow the spread of the virus.Brazil has recorded more than 196,000 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-private-clinics-seek-deal-for-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin/story-rBcawvZw9YLnoZ3Eks78rK.html

He also said the premier has pushed Pakistan’s economy in shambles with its growth rate fallen below those of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.He also accused the government of pleasing ‘mafias’ by extending bailout packages worth billions of rupees to them.Furthermore, Bilawal strongly condemned the killing of over 10 coal miners in Balochistan and asked the government to ensure the safety and security of the workers, while demanding the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP), reported Dawn.“Ever since the current government has come to power, we have been witnessing escape of terrorists from the custody of law enforcement agencies,” he claimed.He also slammed Imran Khan and Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed for not fulfilling their responsibilities and victimising the opposition and threatening the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) leaders instead.He also reaffirmed PPP’s key role in the struggle against the federal government’s move to occupy provinces’ islands.Bilawal’s statement comes after the PDM held a political rally against the government in Bahawalpur.The 11-party opposition alliance has demanded the resignation of Imran Khan till January 31.

04-01-2021||World||‘Global outbreaks’ caused Covid-19 pandemic, says China’s foreign minister Wang Yi||China’s foreign minister said outbreaks outside of the country may have caused the Covid-19 pandemic, as Beijing steps up efforts to recast the virus narrative amid growing scrutiny over the pathogen’s origins.“More and more research suggests that the pandemic was likely to have been caused by separate outbreaks in multiple places in the world,” Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in comments published over the weekend from an interview with the official Xinhua News Agency and state broadcaster CCTV.China took “immediate actions to carry out epidemiological investigation, identify the pathogen and publicize key information including the genome sequencing of the virus,” Wang said. “All this sounded alarm bells across the world.”Wang’s comments come a year after the first known cluster of novel coronavirus cases emerged in the central city of Wuhan, before spreading around the globe. The country was criticized for initially covering up human-to-human transmission of the disease and for acting too slowly to halt its dispersion, with doctors who blew the whistle on a mysterious new pneumonia accused of spreading rumors by police. With its domestic outbreak largely contained, Beijing is stonewalling efforts to find out more about the virus’s origins, with World Health Organization experts kept out of Wuhan in 2020 and an independent probe rebuffed.Read more: China Making It Harder to Solve the Mystery of Where Covid BeganChina is also seeking to recast its response and the early history of the virus. Officials and state media have alternately pushed theories linking Covid-19 to the U.S. military, that the virus could have entered China on imported frozen food, and jumped on research suggesting cases in the U.S. and Italy pre-dated those in Wuhan. The U.S., led by President Donald Trump, has contributed to the politicization of the debate, pushing one theory that suggests a laboratory in Wuhan may have leaked the virus, either accidentally or intentionally.In the interview, Wang said China had “actively engaged” in the global response to the pandemic.“We have stood at the forefront of fighting misinformation, rebutting attempts of politicization and stigmatization,” he said. “We were determined to make sure that the objective narrative and collective memory of the battle against the pandemic would not be distorted by lies.”While WHO experts have been to China in the past year, they haven’t been allowed into Wuhan, the pandemic’s original epicenter. A spokesperson for the body said last month the WHO hoped its expert committee looking into the origin would be able to visit the city in January. China also leveled trade restrictions on Australia after it called for an independent investigation into the virus’s source.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-outbreaks-caused-covid-19pandemic-says-china-s-foreign-minister-wang-yi/story-jRoJX1SvZvTFSnDAXppbCO.html
04-01-2021||World||‘The 2020 election is over’: Republicans condemn ‘scheme’ to undo election for Trump||The extraordinary Republican effort to overturn the presidential election has been condemned by an outpouring of current and former GOP officials warning the effort to sow doubt in Joe Biden’s win and keep President Donald Trump in office is undermining Americans’ faith in democracy.Trump has enlisted support from a dozen Republican senators and up to 100 House Republicans to challenge the Electoral College vote when Congress convenes in a joint session to confirm President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-232 win.With Biden set to be inaugurated January 20, Trump is intensifying efforts to prevent the traditional transfer of power, is ripping the party apart.Despite Trump’s claims of voter fraud, state officials have insisted the elections ran smoothly and there was no evidence of fraud or other problems that would change the outcome. The states have certified their results as fair and valid. Of the more than 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He’s also lost twice at the US Supreme Court.On a call disclosed Sunday, Trump can be heard pressuring Georgia officials to “find” him more votes.But some senior lawmakers, including prominent Republicans, are pushing back.“The 2020 election is over,” said a statement Sunday from a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Mitt Romney of Utah.The senators wrote that further attempts to cast doubt on the election are “contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans’ confidence in the already determined election results.”Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said, “The scheme by members of Congress to reject the certification of the presidential election makes a mockery of our system and who we are as Americans.”Former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said in a statement that “Biden’s victory is entirely legitimate” and that efforts to sow doubt about the election “strike at the foundation of our republic.”Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, warned in a memo to colleagues that objections to the Electoral College results “set an exceptionally dangerous precedent.”One of the more outspoken conservatives in Congress, Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, said he will not oppose the counting of certified electoral votes on Jan. 6. “I’m grateful for what the president accomplished over the past four years, which is why I campaigned vigorously for his reelection. But objecting to certified electoral votes won’t give him a second term—it will only embolden those Democrats who want to erode further our system of constitutional government.”Cotton said he favours further investigation of any election problems, separate from the counting of the certified Electoral College results.Other prominent former officials also criticized the ongoing attack on election results. In a brief op-ed in The Washington Post, the 10 living former defense secretaries -- half of them having served Republican presidents -- called on Pentagon officials to carry out the transition to the new administration “fully, cooperatively and transparently.” They also asserted that efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes “would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.”Citing election results, legal challenges, state certifications and the Electoral College vote, the former defense secretaries said that “the time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived.”The unusual challenge to the presidential election, on a scale unseen since the aftermath of the Civil War, clouded the opening of the new Congress and is set to consume its first days. The House and Senate will meet Wednesday in a joint session to accept the Electoral College vote, a typically routine process that’s now expected to be a prolonged fight.Trump is refusing to concede, and pressure is mounting on Vice President Mike Pence to ensure victory while presiding in what is typically a ceremonial role over the congressional session. Trump is whipping up crowds for a rally in Washington.The president tweeted Sunday against the election tallies and Republicans not on his side.Biden’s transition spokesman, Mike Gwin, dismissed the senators’ effort as a “stunt” that won’t change the fact that Biden will be sworn in Jan. 20.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues that while there is “no doubt” of Biden’s victory, their job now “is to convince more of the American people to trust in our democratic system.”The effort in the Senate was being led by Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Hawley defended his actions in a lengthy email to colleagues, explaining that his Missouri constituents have been “loud and clear” with their belief that Biden’s defeat of Trump was unfair.“It is my responsibility as a senator to raise their concerns,” Hawley wrote late Saturday.Hawley plans to object to the state tally from Pennsylvania. But that state’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, criticized the attack on Pennsylvania’s election system and said the results that named Biden the winner are valid.Cruz’s coalition of 11 Republican senators vows to reject the Electoral College tallies unless Congress launches a commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. They are zeroing in on the states where Trump has raised unfounded claims of voter fraud. Congress is unlikely to agree to their demand.The group formed with Cruz, which presented no new evidence of election problems, includes Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana. New senators in the group are Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.The convening of the joint session to count the Electoral College votes has faced objections before. In 2017, several House Democrats challenged Trump’s win but Biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert Trump’s victory. Rarely have the protests approached this level of intensity.The moment is a defining one for the Republican Party in a post-Trump era. Both Hawley and Cruz are potential 2024 presidential contenders, cementing their alignment with Trump’s base of supporters. Others are trying to forge a different path for the GOP.Pence will be carefully watched as he presides over what is expected to be a prolonged showdown, depending on how many challenges are mounted.The vice president “welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections,” Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, said in a statement Saturday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned Republicans off such challenges but said little when asked about it as at the Capitol as the Senate opened Sunday.“We’ll be dealing with all of that on Wednesday,” he said.But Republicans simply said they do not plan to join the effort that will fail.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Sunday his colleagues will have an opportunity to make their case, but they must produce evidence and facts. “They have a high bar to clear,” he said.Congress have been loathe to interfere in the state-run election systems, a longstanding protocol. States choose their own election officials and draft their election laws. During the coronavirus pandemic many states adapted by allowing mail voting to ease health risks of voting in person. Those changes and others are now being challenged by Trump and his allies.Trump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of nonpartisan election officials and even Trump’s attorney general that there was none.The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the latest challenge from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Arizona electors, who filed suit to try to force Pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote. The appellate court sided with the federal judge, a Trump appointee, who dismissed the suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-2020-election-is-over-republicans-condemn-scheme-to-undo-election-for-trump/story-Vq2KWcTsl1qt1Ig9b6E2dO.html

Participants will be socially distanced and the Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC), a nonprofit tasked with planning the inauguration, will have vigorous Covid-19 health and safety protocols in place.“This is an exciting opportunity to work with Americans across the country to showcase President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris’ steadfast commitment to a diverse, inclusive, and unified nation. There are many grand traditions to the inaugural, and we plan to honor them by highlighting more of our nation’s people than ever before while keeping everyone safe,” PIC CEO Tony Allen said on Sunday.Thereafter, the President-elect will receive a Presidential Escort from 15th Street to the White House, providing the American people and world with historic images of the President-elect proceeding to the White House without attracting large crowds and gatherings.Every branch of the military will be represented in the escort, including The US Army Band, a Joint Service Honor Guard, and the Commander-in-Chief’s Guard and Fife and Drum Corps from the 3rd US Infantry “The Old Guard”. Participants will be socially distanced and PIC will have vigorous health and safety protocols in place.In light of the pandemic, the PIC will produce a virtual parade across America that will be televised for the American people and feature diverse, dynamic performances in communities across the country, the announcement said.The parade will celebrate America’s heroes, highlight Americans from all walks of life in different states and regions, and reflect on the diversity, heritage, and resilience of the country as the country begins a new American era, it said, adding that the PIC will announce participants in the coming weeks.This programming will honor long-standing inaugural traditions; provide the American people with the iconic images of a new president, a new vice president, and their families making their way to the White House; and feature musical acts, local bands, poets, dance troupes, and more paying homage to America’s heroes on the frontlines of the pandemic, it said.“We are excited about the possibilities and opportunities this moment presents to allow all Americans to participate in our country’s sacred inaugural traditions. This innovative programming will keep people safe and use new ways to bring in Americans across the country — from rural towns and urban cities to younger and older Americans to everybody and everywhere in between,” said PIC Executive Director Maju Varghese.“This is an ambitious goal but we are committed to an inclusive and accessible celebration that brings Americans together and unifies our nation, especially during such a tough time for our country,” he said.Last month, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC) had said Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ inaugurations will be a low-key affair restricted for the public, urging people to participate in the historic event from home in view of the coronavirus pandemic.It said that invitations to members of the 117th Congress will be limited to themselves and one guest.The PIC urged the public to refrain from any travel and participate in the inaugural activities from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-inauguration-to-include-presidential-escort-virtual-parade/story-sULjcXrYqM4NlWbQYn6rlI.html

However, while arguing that the “purpose” of her travel was “deemed essential under the circumstances”, the Brampton West MP “decided to step aside” from her duties as parliamentary secretary to the federal minister of international development. In a statement, Khera said this was “in an effort to ensure my choices do not distract from the important work of our government to continue battling this pandemic.”Delhi-born Khera, who is a trained nurse, had won plenty of praise this spring as she helped out as a volunteer as the coronavirus crisis first came to the country. She was the first Canadian MP to contract the virus. “I hope to be able to do my part in the vaccine roll-out where there may be nursing shortages,” she added in her statement.She said her father passed away in September and her uncle a few weeks later, and she travelled to Seattle for a private memorial service for the latter attended by less than 10 persons, after not being able to attend the funeral at the time of his death. She left Canada on December 23, after the end of the Parliamentary session and returned on December 31.Her Liberal Party colleague Sameer Zuberi, who travelled to Delaware to visit his wife’s ailing grandfather last month, has resigned from parliamentary committee positions that he had held, while New Democratic Party MP Niki Ashton lost her formal parliamentary roles with her party after going to Greece to visit her sick grandmother.The finance minister of the province of Ontario Rod Phillips resigned from that post last week after it emerged that he went to the island of St Barts for a Caribbean vacation in late December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indo-canadian-mp-quits-key-post-after-violating-covid-travel-curbs/story-VYheP0img4fLvN7vu0tK3K.html
04-01-2021||World||US House presents bill to terminate Pak designation as Major non-NATO Ally||On the first day of the 117th Congress, a lawmaker has introduced a bill in the US House of Representatives to terminate the designation of Pakistan as a Major non-NATO Ally.Introduced by Republican Congressman Andy Biggs, the bill removes Pakistan’s designation as a major non-NATO ally, a status that allows for various benefits such as access to excess US defense supplies and participation in cooperative defense research and development projects.The bill also notes that the US President cannot issue a separate designation of Pakistan as a Major NATO ally, unless a presidential certification that Pakistan continues to conduct military operations that are contributing to significantly disrupting the safe haven and freedom of movement of the Haqqani Network in Pakistan.It also seeks a presidential certification that Pakistan has taken steps to demonstrate its commitment to prevent the Haqqani Network from using any Pakistani territory as a safe haven and that the Pak government actively coordinates with Afghanistan to restrict the movement of militants, such as the Haqqani Network, along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.The bill also asks the president to certify that Pakistan has shown progress in arresting and prosecuting Haqqani Network senior leaders and mid-level operatives.Pakistan was named a Major non-NATO ally during the Bush Administration in 2004. Currently, there are 17 Major non-NATO ally. Brazil was the last country to given this designation by President Donald Trump in 2019.The designation gives the countries to entry into cooperative research and development projects with the Department of Defense (DoD) on a shared-cost basis, participation in certain counter-terrorism initiatives, purchase of depleted uranium anti-tank rounds, priority delivery of military surplus (ranging from rations to ships).It also gives them access to War Reserve Stocks of DoD-owned equipment that are kept outside of American military bases, offers them loans of equipment and material for cooperative research and development projects and evaluations and permission to use American financing for the purchase or lease of certain defense equipment.The designation among other things expedites export processing of space technology and permission for the country’s corporations to bid on certain DoD contracts for the repair and maintenance of military equipment outside the United States.However, President Trump in January 2018 suspended all financial and security assistance to Pakistan. The outgoing Trump Administration even considered terminating the designation of Pakistan as a Major non-NATO ally.Under the Obama Administration, US designated India as a Major Defense Partner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-presents-bill-to-terminate-pak-designation-as-major-non-nato-ally/story-9iQUJawmeVzstqyZe4GGIL.html

The 10 members of the module were flown out of the country in a plane arranged by the Chinese government.Hindustan Times had reported the detention of the 10 Chinese nationals by Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) for being part of an espionage module on 25 December. Afghanistan had offered to pardon the 10 Chinese nationals on the condition that Beijing apologise for deploying the 10 persons including at least one woman, believed to be linked to China’s spy agency, Ministry of State Security.The terms of the release of the 10 Chinese spies is not known.Diplomats and security officials in Kabul, however, confirmed to Hindustan Times that the 10 had been allowed to board a chartered aircraft that flew them out of the country on Saturday after clearance from President Ashraf Ghani. The 10-member module, evacuated after 23 days in detention, had not been formally charged.President Ghani, who had been briefed about the detentions when Afghanistan’s intelligence agency made the arrests beginning 10 December, had tasked First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, a former NDS chief who is credited with resurrecting the Afghan intelligence agency, to handle the case.As expected, Amrullah Saleh who releases pointers from his security briefings on his Facebook page, had put out what appeared to be a cryptic denial of the arrest of the Chinese nationals on 27 December.“No foreign citizen has been arrested in an effort operation in the Khairkhaneh area. The arrested are the palmadis that are under the scope. A number of them have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in kidnapping and assassination…,” Afghanistan’s First Vice President said.Also Read: China’s spies, India and the 2013 paper by NSA Ajit Doval that saw it comingAmrullah Saleh had earlier conveyed Kabul’s offer to release the 10 spies to China’s envoy Wang Yu if Beijing submits a formal apology that admits to the violation of international norms and a betrayal of Kabul’s trust. Ambassador Wang Yu is learnt to have insisted at this meeting that Kabul does not declare the detentions. An investigative report by an Australian newspaper in mid-December had already spotlighted how Chinese communist party members had infiltrated some of the world’s powerful and influential agencies, including the consulates of Western nations and security agencies.There has been no statement by the Chinese foreign ministry on the espionage module busted in Kabul.A senior diplomat in Kabul had earlier told Hindustan Times that at least two of the 10 Chinese nationals - Li Yangyang and Sha Hung - were in contact with the Haqqani Network, the terrorist group that doubles as the sword arm of the Taliban. Sha Hung used to run a restaurant in Kabul’s Shirpur while Li Yangyang was learnt to have been operating for the Chinese Intelligence since July-August.The NDS team had seized arms, ammunition and Ketamine powder, a recreational drug , from Li Yangyang’s house in the western Kabul neighbourhood of Kart-e-Char when the first round of raids were carried out on 10 December.The Afghan security establishment believes the 10 detainees were creating a fake East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) module in Afghanistan to entrap ETIM operatives in Afghanistan.ETIM is a small Islamic separatist group alleged to be active in Xinjiang province, home to China’s ethnic minority Uighur Muslims. Its founder Hasan Mahsum, an Uyghur from Xinjiang’s Kashgar region, was shot dead in 2003 by Pakistani soldiers. Islamabad has been playing along with China that has been accused of running camps in Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps. Rights groups say China uses the ETIM threat as an excuse to impose restrictions on Uyghurs and discredit human rights activists outside China.

Hot and windy conditions -- pushing 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) -- are forecast for Perth this week.Western Australia was spared the brunt of last summer’s devastating climate change-fuelled wildfires, which mostly ravaged the country’s two most populous states New South Wales and Victoria.The fires razed more than 24 million hectares of drought-stricken bushland and forest across Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, killing more than 30 people and destroying thousands of homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-lives-and-homes-at-risk-as-bushfire-nears-perth/story-S5M74g0yNspvk7TtQDHpxK.html

Pelosi, who has led her party in the House since 2003 and is the only woman to be speaker, received 216 votes to 209 for Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican, who again will be the chamber’s minority leader.“As we are sworn in today, we accept a responsibility as daunting and demanding as any previous generation of leadership have ever faced,” Pelosi, 80, said in a statement referring to the swearing-in of the 117th Congress. “We begin this new Congress during a time of extraordinary difficulty. Each of our communities has been drastically, drastically affected by the pandemic and its economic crisis: 350,000 tragic deaths, we sadly carry them in our hearts; over 20 million infections; millions without jobs – a toll beyond comprehension.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-narrowly-re-elected-speaker-faces-difficult-two-years/story-7dwPKOI0BtS5Qmr4ndSGSK.html
04-01-2021||World||US Congress passes ‘Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act’ for Pakistani women||The US Congress has passed the ‘Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act’ which will expand the number of scholarships available to Pakistani women to receive higher education under a merit and needs-based programme.Passed by the House of Representatives in March 2020, the bill was passed by the United States Senate by a voice vote on January 1. The bill now heads to the White House for US President Donald Trump to sign into law.The bill requires the US Agency for International Development to award at least 50% of scholarships under a Pakistan-based higher education scholarship programme to Pakistani women, from 2020 to 2022, across a range of academic disciplines and in accordance with existing eligibility criteria.The bill also requires USAID to consult with and leverage investments by the Pakistani private sector and Pakistani diaspora in the United States to improve and expand access to education programmes in Pakistan.Among other thing, it requires USAID to brief Congress annually on the number of scholarships awarded under the programme, including breakdowns by gender, discipline, and degree type; the percentage of recipients who were involuntarily pushed out of the programme for failure to meet programme requirements; and the percentage of recipients who dropped out of school, including due to retaliation for seeking education.On October 10, 2014, Malala shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Indian children’s rights activist Kailash Satyarthi for her “struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education”.In October 2012, Malala was shot in the head by Pakistani Taliban on her way home from school. In late 2008, she began making the case for access to education for women and girls despite objections from the Pakistani Taliban.Since 2010, the USAID has awarded more than 6,000 scholarships for young women to receive higher education in Pakistan. The bill expands this programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-passes-malala-yousafzai-scholarship-act-for-pakistani-women/story-ciQwYln4qxgDLsvMBd9ayI.html

Thailand has also started local production of vaccines developed by AstraZeneca Plc under a technology transfer agreement, which is expected to be ready for distribution in May, the ministry said.Thailand is racing to curb the spread of a new wave of local infections that started from seafood markets near Bangkok, the nation’s capital and the largest city. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha has imposed a new set of restrictions on businesses and gatherings in Bangkok and 27 of its worst-affected provinces from Monday to contain the outbreak.Thailand, which was relatively successful in containing the pathogen after becoming the first country outside China to report the deadly virus, may see cases spike to about 1,000 a day even with strict control measures, according to the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. The country reported 315 new virus cases on Sunday with 294 of them locally transmitted, taking the nation’s total to 7,694.Prayuth’s government has set a target of inoculating 50% of its population, or about 33 million people, by the end of 2021 with vaccines from various sources, including the World Health Organization-backed Covax program. It’s also negotiating with other vaccine developers for additional supplies, according to the health ministry.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-to-get-2-million-doses-of-china-s-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine/story-eCYEP7jhbAxMfPjel1Qe4M.html
04-01-2021||World||Greta Thunberg, Swedish teenage climate activist, turns 18||Sweden’s Greta Thunberg, who pioneered a global climate change campaign as a 15-year-old, turned 18 on Sunday and promised to celebrate by exposing “dark secrets” at her local pub.“Thank you so much for all the well-wishes on my 18th birthday!,” Thunberg said on Twitter.“Tonight you will find me down at the local pub exposing all the dark secrets behind the climate- and school strike conspiracy and my evil handlers who can no longer control me! I am free at last!!.”Thunberg began a climate change campaign that swelled from a one-person school strike to a worldwide movement, drawing in millions of school children, as well as adults.She criticised world leaders over climate change in a speech to the United Nations in 2019, has clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump, and last month called for urgent action five years on from the Paris Accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-swedish-teenage-climate-activist-turns-18/story-cXNvyxnfsL7r2EJ6aTVCMO.html
04-01-2021||World||Trump caught on tape asking to ‘find votes’ in Georgia||US President Donald Trump’s doomed attempts to overturn his electoral defeat to President-elect Joe Biden took a dramatic and potentially damaging twist after he was heard in a leaked audio pressing election officials in Georgia state, which he lost, to “find” him the votes he needed to win.“All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,” Trump said in the leaked recording of a phone call with Georgia state secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, a Republican. Other officials on the call included Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows. Trump lost Georgia by 11,779 votes.The recording was obtained and first reported by The Washington Post hours after Trump first reported the conversation that took place on Saturday, in a tweet, with his own spin on it. Raffensperger tweeted back shortly after disputing the president’s version.“The people of Georgia are angry, the people in the country are angry,” Trump told Raffensperger in the conversation, adding, “And there’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.”Raffensperger responded: “Well, Mr President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.”Georgia has been a solidly Republican state that the president lost in a stunning upset, along with other swing states that put Biden easily across the finishing line in electoral college votes. He won 306 electoral college votes to Trump’s 232; and secured 7 million more popular votes.“There’s no way I lost Georgia,” Trump said. “There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.” For evidence, he offered conspiracy theories and numbers that have not withstood scrutiny. At one point, he cited the size of his election rallies, which attracted large number of supporters, to suggest he could not have lost.Raffensperger and all other elected Republican officials in Georgia have withstood weeks of unrelenting pressure from the president, his lawyers and allies to change the election outcome. The audits and recounts, including one by hand, bore out the initial result, but Trump was not giving up.The outgoing president and his allies have filed more than 60 lawsuits including in the swing states that he had lost by wider margins: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada. The Trump camp lost almost all the cases including two in the Supreme Court, where a third of the justices are the president’s appointees.The final chapter in his attempts to cling to power will be played out at a joint session of US Congress on Wednesday when lawmakers meet, as constitutionally tasked, to deliver the final certification of the election results reported by the states. At least 12 Republican senators and around 140 members of the House of Representatives have announced their intention to oppose the certification, but don’t have the numbers, not even enough Republicans, to block it. It was not immediately known how the objectors will respond to the tape, which was seen by critics as an egregious attempt by the president to steal the election, with votes he did not win.Also on Sunday, the outgoing president was rebuked jointly by 10 former defence secretaries, who had served both Republican and Democratic presidents. “Our elections have occurred. Recounts and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges have been addressed by the courts. Governors have certified the results. And the electoral college has voted,” they wrote. “The time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-caught-on-tape-asking-to-find-votes-in-georgia/story-Hxn7oM1TbzppHMoWP3nTSN.html

The ban on exports, however, means that poorer nations will probably have to wait a few months before receiving their first shots.The vaccine was granted emergency authorization by the Indian regulator on Sunday, but on the condition that Serum Institute doesn’t export the shots to ensure that vulnerable populations in India are protected, Adar Poonawalla, the company’s CEO, said in a phone interview with The Associated Press.Also read | ‘Can deliver vaccines 7-10 days after purchase order’: Adar PoonawallaHe said that the company also has been barred from selling the vaccine on the private market.“We can only give (the vaccines) to the government of India at the moment,” Poonawalla said, adding the decision was also made to prevent hoarding.As a result, he said, the export of vaccines for COVAX — the ambitious initiative created to ensure equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines set up by the World Health Organization, vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI, a global coalition to fight epidemics — won’t begin until March or April.Poonawalla said that Serum Institute was in the process of signing a larger contract with COVAX for 300 million-400 million doses of the vaccine. That is apart from two existing orders of 100 million doses each for the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and another one from Novovax. He said the deal would be finalized in the coming weeks.He said the first 100 million doses of the vaccine were being sold to the Indian government at a “special price” of 200 rupees ($2.74) per dose, after which prices would be higher. The vaccine will be sold on the private market at 1,000 rupees ($13.68) per dose. He said vaccines could be delivered to Indian states where they were needed within seven to 10 days of the company finalizing a deal with India’s government.Poonawalla said his company was planning to give 200 million to 300 million doses of the vaccine to COVAX by December 2021. He acknowledged that the company would have to balance distribution of vaccines between India and COVAX.“We can’t vaccinate everybody right now. We can prioritize,” he said.Serum Institute is also negotiating bilateral agreements with individual countries including Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, Poonawalla said. “So that at least the most vulnerable in the states of our country or in other parts of other countries are taken care off,” he said.Poonawalla said that even if all the plans by different global vaccine manufacturers were to succeed, he still anticipates a global shortage for coronavirus vaccines over the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covishield-vaccine-to-be-sold-to-govt-at-a-special-price-says-adar-poonawalla/story-CQG4XsGWhNFu8VEWpoeNOM.html

On Sunday, India approved its first two Covid-19 vaccines and immunisation drive, likely to be the world’s largest, is expected to begin soon.Here are some latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday announced it had given approval for use in emergency cases of the respective vaccines of Oxford University-AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech International Limited. Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, will be manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), while Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is the country’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine. A third vaccine candidate, ZyCoV-D of Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila, was given the nod for phase 3 trials.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage2. The United Kingdom will on Monday start giving shots of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, which was approved by the country’s health regulators last week. Covishield will be the second Covid-19 vaccine to be used in the UK, which last month became the first country to start a vaccination drive, administering shots of the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE vaccine.3. An association of private health clinics in Brazil confirmed on Sunday it was in talks to procure from India’s Bharat Biotech, five million doses of its Covaxin. The Brazilian Association of Vaccine Clinics (ABCVAC) confirmed on its website it had signed an MoU for Covaxin, which received authorisation in India on Sunday. Brazil is yet to get a Covid-19 vaccine and any deal will have to be approved by the South American country’s health regulator, Anvisa. Brazil is the third worst-hit country in the world, after the United States and India, respectively.4. Jordan’s prime minister Bisher al-Khasawneh on Sunday announced his government had agreed to purchase vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech SE, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). While 1 million doses will be purchased from Pfizer-BioNTech SE, 2 million will be procured from the WHO, under its COVAX programme. However, it was not specified when these vaccines would be received.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-india-approves-first-2-vaccines-uk-to-begin-another-immunisation-drive/story-wTYyBIOlan7h9VxoAlaZAM.html

They are doing very difficult work which is not without risk. Nevertheless, we are making good progress.”Police said the latest body was found near where two others had been recovered, but gave no further details. The teams, backed up by sniffer dogs, helicopters and drones, have now found three bodies on Sunday, one on Saturday and three on Friday.Local residents left candles near the site of the tragedy.Five of the recovered victims have been identified, including a woman in her fifties and her 29-year-old son, and a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter.The first victim to be recovered, on January 1, was a 31-year-old man.Earlier police published the names of all 10 people, including the two-year-old and a 13-year-old, who went missing on Wednesday.Ten people were also injured in the landslide, including one seriously who was transferred to Oslo for treatment.About 1,000 people of the town’s population of 5,000 have been evacuated, because of fears for the safety of their homes as the land continues to move.“It is a completely surreal and terrible situation,” one of the evacuees, Olav Gjerdingen, told AFP.Royal visit The rescuers received a visit Sunday from King Harald, his wife Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon, who lit candles for the victims in a local church.“I’m having trouble finding something to say, because it’s absolutely horrible,” the king said after the visit.“This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,” he said in a televised statement.The authorities have banned all aircraft from the disaster area until 3 pm Monday as they conduct aerial searches.The teams, who are also seeking to rescue family pets, were digging channels in the ground to evacuate casualties.The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) said the disaster was a “quick clay slide” of approximately 300 by 800 metres (yards).Quick clay is a sort of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and turn to fluid when overstressed.On the recommendations of the NVE, the authorities decided to narrow the evacuation, allowing some local people to return to their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7th-body-found-in-norway-mudslide-three-still-missing/story-Tz3SvopN9k0WiprQ0VTFPO.html

Speaking to reporters in his home town Rawalpindi on Saturday, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said: “We have data of 1.5 million Afghan refugees having legal status and about 800,000 Afghans living in the country illegally.” He said corruption in the issuance of visas was being tackled and the government was providing online visa facility to citizens of 192 countries. “To eliminate the chances of corruption, we have launched online visa service as there are chances of corruption in manual processing of visas,” he said, adding that over 200,000 visa applications were received for online visas in a single day. Meanwhile, Rashid said persons targeting the armed forces were doing so at the behest of foreign countries and action would be taken “within 72 hours” against those making “anti-army” remarks. “We would defeat such disinformation against our country and state institutions,” he said. The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) - an alliance of 11 Opposition parties - has been formed against the Pakistan Army’s interference in politics and installing “puppet” Prime Minister Imran Khan through a manipulated election. Already, a case was being registered against Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl leader Mufti Kifayatullah over his remarks on the army, he said. Rashid, who took charge as interior minister last month, said unnecessary checkposts were being abolished in the capital and a new police force, Eagle Squad, equipped with latest technology would be raised soon to provide security in Islamabad. He also said five police officials involved in the killing of a 22-year-old student this week in Islamabad were arrested. The killing shocked the people as the youth was targeted when he failed to stop the car when signaled by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-cancels-200-000-fake-citizen-id-cards-held-by-afghan-refugees/story-PzYqXebTWUWrgyc9gSwEPN.html
04-01-2021||World||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to hear UK judge’s ruling on extradition to US||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will learn on Monday whether a British judge has approved his extradition to the United States to face charges including espionage over the release of secret US military documents.US authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 49, of 18 counts of conspiring to hack government computers and of breaching a secrecy law by releasing vast troves of confidential military records and diplomatic cables over a decade ago.If extradited and then found guilty of espionage, Assange could go to prison for 30 to 40 years, his lawyers say, though prosecutors say he would face no more than 63 months in jail.Whoever loses Monday’s ruling is likely to appeal to London’s High Court and the case could go the United Kingdom’s Supreme Court, further delaying the final outcome.US prosecutors and Western security officials see Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, as a reckless and dangerous enemy of the state whose actions put at risk the lives of agents whose names were in the material.Supporters regard him as an anti-establishment hero who has been victimised because he exposed US wrongdoing in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and say his prosecution is an assault on journalism and free speech.Assange’s legal team said in its closing written submission to Judge Vanessa Baraitser that the prosecution had been politically motivated “during a unique period of US history under the (US President Donald) Trump administration.”The legal team representing the United States has challenged that assertion, saying US federal prosecutors are forbidden to consider political opinion in making their decisions.DIPLOMATIC CABLESWikiLeaks published a US military video in 2010 showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables.The legal saga began soon afterwards when Sweden sought Assange’s extradition from Britain over allegations of sex crimes. When he lost that case in 2012, he fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he spent seven years, during which he fathered two children.When he was finally dragged out in April 2019, he was jailed for breaching British bail conditions although the Swedish case against him had been dropped. Last June, the US Justice Department formally asked Britain to extradite him.Assange’s legal team say the charges are politically motivated, his mental health is at risk, conditions in US prisons breach Britain’s human rights laws, and he and his lawyers were spied on while he was in the Ecuadorean embassy.The US legal team has said many of Assange’s defence arguments are issues that should be addressed in a trial and have no bearing on extradition.There is also a possibility that Joe Biden might reverse the decision to prosecute Assange after Biden succeeds Trump as president later this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-to-hear-uk-judge-s-ruling-on-extradition-to-us/story-Uy2ELB9CYaDBsool5tpPSL.html

04-01-2021||World||Congress opens new session as coronavirus, Joe Biden’s win dominate||Congress convened Sunday for the start of a new session, swearing in lawmakers during a tumultuous period as a growing number of Republicans work to overturn Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump and the coronavirus surges.Democrat Nancy Pelosi was reelected as House speaker by her party, which retains the majority in the House but with the slimmest margin in 20 years after a surprisingly strong GOP performance in the November election.Opening the Senate could be among Mitch McConnell’s final acts as majority leader. Republican control is in question until Tuesday’s runoff elections for two Senate seats in Georgia. The outcome will determine which party holds the chamber.The House and Senate were required to convene Sunday, by law, and imposed strict COVID protocols. Elbow bumps replaced handshakes as senators took the oath of office. Fewer family members than usual joined lawmakers at the Capitol. A special enclosed seating section was designed for lawmakers in COVID quarantine.But by day’s end, House lawmakers were hugging and congratulating one another after taking the oath of office in the crowded chamber, an alarming scene during the pandemic.“To say the new Congress convenes at a challenging time would be an understatement,” McConnell said as the chamber opened.Still, McConnell said with the start of a new year there are reasons for optimism, “let’s make the American people proud.”Pelosi said the top priority is defeating the coronvirus. And “defeat it we will,” she said to applause.It’s often said that divided government can be a time for legislative compromises, but lawmakers are charging into the 117th Congress with the nation more torn than ever, disputing even basic facts including that Biden won the presidential election.Fraud did not spoil the 2020 presidential election, a fact confirmed by election officials across the country. Before stepping down last month, Attorney General William Barr, a Republican appointed by Trump, said there was no evidence of fraud that affected the election’s outcome. Arizona’s and Georgia’s Republican governors, whose states were crucial to Biden’s victory, have also stated that their election results were accurate.Nevertheless, a dozen Republicans bound for the new Senate, led by Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, and even more in the House have pledged to become a resistance force to Biden’s White House, starting with efforts to subvert the will of American voters. These GOP lawmakers plan to object to the election results when Congress meets on Wednesday to tally his 306-232 Electoral College victory over Trump.Vice President Mike Pence, who as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner, is facing growing pressure from Trump’s allies over that ceremonial role.Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, said in a statement Saturday that Pence “welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections.”Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing ahead, eager to partner with Biden on shared priorities, starting with efforts to stem the pandemic and economic crisis. They plan to revisit the failed effort to boost pandemic aid to $2,000 for most people.“This has been a moment of great challenge in the United States of America filled with trials and tribulations, but help is on the way,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said in an interview.“America is a resilient nation, filled with resilient people,” he said. “We will continue to rise to the occasion, emerge from this pandemic and continue to march toward our more perfect union.”Among the House Republican newcomers are Trump-aligned Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has given nod to conspiracy Q-Anon theories, and gun rights advocate Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who circulated a letter of support to retain the right of lawmakers to carry firearms in the Capitol.Greene was among a group of House Republicans led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama who visited with Trump at the White House during the holiday season about their effort to undo the election.The “Jan. 6 challenge is on,” Taylor Greene said in a tweet pinned to the top of her social media account. Boebert also tweeted support for those challenging Biden’s victory.House Republicans boosted their ranks in the November election, electing a handful of women and minorities, more than ever. Some of the new GOP lawmakers are being called the “Freedom Force,” and a counter to the “squad” — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other liberal Democratic women who swept to office in the last session.In a statement Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the minority leader, said the new Republican members “are a strong representation of who America is and where we come from.”Progressive Democrats bolstered their ranks with newcomers aligned with more liberal priorities.The Capitol itself is a changed place under coronavirus restrictions. Lawmakers are arriving in Washington from all parts of the country potentially exposed to the virus during their travel.Several lawmakers have been sickened by the virus and some will be absent Sunday. Also, a memorial was held Saturday for newly elected Republican lawmaker Luke Letlow, 41, of Louisiana, who died of complications from Covid-19 days before the swearing in.The Office of the Attending Physician has issued several lengthy memos warning lawmakers off meeting in groups or holding traditional receptions to prevent the spread of the virus. Masks have been ordered worn at all times and Pelosi has required them to be used in the House chamber. Members are required to have coronavirus tests and have access to vaccines.“Do not engage any in-person social events, receptions, celebrations, or appointments, outside your family unit, and always wear a face covering outside your home,” the physician’s office warned in one memo. “You should strictly avoid any type of office-based reception or celebration during the days ahead.”Even the traditional swearing in ceremonies will be limited in the House.

04-01-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi re-elected as US House speaker amid political uncertainty||Nancy Pelosi was narrowly re-elected speaker of the US House of Representatives on Sunday, as a new Congress took office amid political uncertainty, with Senate control undecided and a Republican fight looming over presidential election results.The House voted 216-209 to reinstate Pelosi, after Democrats lost 11 seats in the November elections to command a narrower 222-212 majority. Five Democrats chose not to support her - two voted for Democratic lawmakers who were not running, while three others simply voted “present.”“As we are sworn in today, we accept a responsibility as daunting and demanding as any that previous generations of leadership have faced. We begin the new Congress during a time of extraordinary difficulty,” Pelosi said in a floor speech that noted the deaths of more than 350,000 Americans from the Covid-19 pandemic.“Now is a time for our nation to heal. Our most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus. And defeat it, we will,” she added, pledging that further aid would follow the latest $892 billion package that Congress passed in December.The Senate remains Republican run ahead of twin elections in Georgia on Tuesday, giving its members a platform to again air President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden was the result of fraud.Multiple state and federal reviews have found no evidence of the sort of widespread fraud Trump claims, but Republican senators and House members plan to challenge the election result when Congress certifies it on Wednesday.A Republican push led by Senator Ted Cruz for an emergency 10-day audit of election results in contested battleground states drew criticism on Sunday from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally.“It appears to be more of a political dodge than an effective remedy,” Graham said in a statement. “I will listen closely. But they have a high bar to clear.”The narrower balance of power in both chambers this year could also encourage moderates from each party to flex their political muscles, especially after Trump leaves the White House on Jan. 20 and Biden, who ran as a centrist, takes office.But leaders in both the House and Senate tried to sound optimistic despite mounting challenges. “From political division to a deadly pandemic to adversaries around the world, the hurdles before us are many and they are serious,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor. “But there is also plenty of reason for hope,” the Kentucky Republican added, citing the ongoing rollout of coronavirus vaccine. “I’d say 2021 looks bright already.” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, also said in a statement he hoped the new Congress would “turn the page” on partisan division “and begin a new chapter of cooperation among Democrats and Republicans.”But the smaller Democratic majority and the still-raging coronavirus pandemic made re-election as speaker trickier for Pelosi, the only woman ever to hold the job.“It’s not personal. It’s not malicious. It just represents a feeling in my district,” Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told reporters before voting “present.” “We need a different crop (of leaders) that represents a broader swath of the country,” Slotkin said. The smaller caucus meant less room for dissident Democrats to vote against Pelosi without risking a possible win for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who opposed her.“We are just (an) extremely slim amount of votes away from risking the speakership to the Republican Party,” said Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive who wants new leadership but still backed Pelosi. “It’s bigger than any one of us. And that is consequential,” she added. In the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence swore in 32 senators on Sunday, administering the oath of office in pairs due to Covid-19 restrictions. A Republican win of one or both Georgia Senate seats up for election on Tuesday would cement the Republican majority led by McConnell.Twin Democratic wins in Georgia would produce a 50-50 Senate, where Democratic Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would hold the tie-breaking vote once she is sworn in on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-re-elected-as-us-house-speaker-amid-political-uncertainty/story-uBb6PKwwAQiLVgs548fB7L.html
04-01-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi narrowly reelected speaker, faces difficult 2021||Nancy Pelosi was narrowly reelected Sunday as speaker, giving her the reins of Democrats’ slender House majority as President-elect Joe Biden sets a challenging course of producing legislation to tackle the pandemic, revive the economy and address other party priorities.The California Democrat, who has led her party in the House since 2003 and is the only woman to be speaker, had been widely expected to retain her post. Pelosi received 216 votes to 209 for Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who again will be the chamber’s minority leader.To gain her victory, Pelosi had to overcome some Democratic grumbling about her longevity, a slim 222-211 edge over Republicans after November’s elections, and a handful of absences because of the coronavirus. There were two vacancies in the 435-member House, and whatever happens Democrats will have the smallest House majority in two decades.The new Congress convened Sunday, just two days after lawmakers ended their contentious previous session and with Covid-19 guidelines requiring testing and face coverings for House members. There was widespread mask-wearing and far fewer lawmakers and guests in the chamber than usual, an unimaginable tableau when the last Congress commenced two years ago, before the pandemic struck.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., formally nominated Pelosi for the job, calling her “a notorious negotiator and a legendary legislator for such a time as this.”Jeffries, a member of House leadership who’s expected to contend for the speakership whenever Pelosi steps aside, said that as Pelosi prepares to work with Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, “Brighter days are ahead in the United States of America. This is the day of great renewal in the House of Representatives.”To be reelected, Pelosi needed a majority of votes cast for specific candidates and could afford to lose only a handful of Democratic votes. House rules give her a bit of wiggle room because lawmakers who are absent or who vote “present” are not counted in the total number of those voting.Sunday’s vote was expected to last perhaps three hours as lawmakers voted in groups of around 72 each to minimize exposure to the virus.With every vote at a premium, workers had constructed an enclosure in a balcony overlooking the House chamber so lawmakers exposed to or testing positive for the coronavirus could more safely vote. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, voted from there.Two Democrats who tested positive for the virus last month and say they have recovered voted for Pelosi from the House floor: Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore and Washington state Rep. Rick Larsen.In a positive sign for Pelosi, newly elected progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., voted for her. “Our country needs stability right now, and it’s really important for the Democratic Party to come together,” Bowman told a reporter.Pelosi won plaudits from many Democrats for two years of leading their opposition to President Donald Trump, largely keeping her party’s moderates and progressives united on their joint goal of defeating him and raising mountains of campaign funds. No Democrat has stepped forward to challenge her, underscoring the perception that she would be all but impossible to topple.But Pelosi is 80 years old, and ambitious younger members continue chafing at the longtime hold she and other older top leaders have had on their jobs. Democrats were also angry and divided after an Election Day that many expected would to mean added House seats for the party but instead saw a dozen incumbents lose, without defeating a single GOP representative.Pelosi recently suggested anew that these would be her final two years as speaker, referencing a statement she made two years ago in which she said she would step aside after this period.The speaker’s election was coming 17 days before Biden is inaugurated. Yet rather than a fresh start for him and Pelosi, there were issues and undercurrents that will be carrying over from Trump’s tempestuous administration.Though Congress enacted — and Trump finally signed — a $900 billion Covid-19 relief package late last month, Biden and many Democrats say they consider that measure a down payment. They say more aid is needed to bolster efforts to vaccinate the public, curb the virus and restore jobs and businesses lost to the pandemic.Many Democrats, with the unlikely support of Trump, wanted to boost that bill’s $600 per person direct payments to $2,000 but were blocked by Republicans. Democrats want additional money to help state and local governments struggling to maintain services and avoid layoffs.Biden’s priorities also include efforts on health care and the environment.Guiding such legislation through the House will be a challenge for Pelosi because her party’s narrow majority means just a handful of defectors could be fatal.In addition, cooperation with Republicans could be made more difficult as many in the GOP are continuing to demonstrate fealty to the divisive Trump, backing his unfounded claims that his reelection loss was tainted by fraud. Congress will meet Wednesday to officially affirm Biden’s clear Electoral College victory over Trump. Many House and Senate Republicans say they will contest the validity of some of those votes, but their efforts that are certain to fail.There was no widespread fraud in the election, which a range of election officials across the country, as well as Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden’s victory, have also vouched for the integrity of the elections in their states. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-nominated justices.Meanwhile, it’s not clear which party will control the Senate, which Republicans will hold unless Democrats win both Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday.In the House, one race in New York is still being decided and there is a vacancy in Louisiana after GOP Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, 41, died after contracting Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-narrowly-reelected-speaker-faces-difficult-2021/story-Uki4t4Lxx65sRLEZCTe70H.html
04-01-2021||World||Trump, on tape, presses Georgia official to ‘find’ votes||President Donald Trump badgered and pleaded with Georgia’s election chief to overturn Joe Biden’s win in the state, suggesting in a telephone call that the official “find” enough votes to hand Trump the victory.The conversation Saturday was the latest step in an unprecedented effort by a sitting president to pressure a state official to reverse the outcome of a free and fair election that he lost. The renewed intervention and the persistent and unfounded claims of fraud by the first president to lose reelection in almost 30 years come nearly two weeks before Trump leaves office and two days before twin runoffs in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate.Trump confirmed in a tweet Sunday that he had spoken with Georgia’s secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, a day earlier.Audio snippets of the conversation were posted online by The Washington Post. A recording of the call was later obtained by The Associated Press from a person who was on the call.The president, who has refused to accept his loss to the Democratic president-elect, is heard telling Raffensperger at one point: “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.”Georgia certified election results showing that Biden won the state’s Nov. 3 election by 11,779 votes.The White House referred questions to Trump’s reelection campaign, which did not respond Sunday to an emailed request for comment. Raffensperger’s office did not respond to a text message seeking comment.Trump has repeatedly attacked how Raffensperger ran Georgia’s elections, claiming without evidence that the state’s 16 electoral votes were wrongly given to Biden.“He has no clue!” Trump tweeted of Raffensperger, saying the state official “was unwilling, or unable” to answer questions about a series of claims about ballot handling and voters that have been debunked or shot down by judges and election authorities.Raffensperger’s Twitter response: “Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true. The truth will come out.”There was no widespread fraud in the election, which a range of election officials across the country, as well as Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, key battleground states crucial to Biden’s victory, have also vouched for the integrity of the elections in their states. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, which includes three Trump-nominated justices.The Senate runoffs pit Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff. With the Senate up for grabs, the candidates and outside groups supporting them have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the contests, deluging Georgia with television ads, mail, phone calls and door-knocking efforts.Loeffler said she had not decided whether to join Republican colleagues in challenging the legitimacy of Biden’s victory over Trump. The Democratic candidates whose wins Tuesday would help clear roadblocks for the new administration’s agenda awaited a campaign visit from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.Trump has persisted in attacking top Georgia Republicans over his election loss in the state, raising fears that his words could cause some Republicans to stay away from the polls.“I believe that we will win on Tuesday because of the grassroots momentum, the unprecedented movement energy in Georgia right now,” Ossoff told CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said “it feels in Georgia like we are on the cusp of a historic victory.”Loeffler, when asked about siding with the growing group of Senate Republicans seeking to contest the Electoral College count, said she was “looking very closely at it, and I’ve been one of the first to say, everything’s on the table.” She told “Fox News Sunday” that ”I’m fighting for this president because he’s fought for us. He’s our president and we’re going to keep making sure that this is a fair election.”Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta who has continued to preach as he campaigns for office, seemed to allude to the runoff in a message delivered Sunday. He told viewers watching remotely due to the pandemic that they are “on the verge of victory” in their lives if they accept that God has already equipped them with the ability to overcome their adversaries.“When God is with you, you can defeat giants,” said Warnock, who ended the early morning service by encouraging Georgians to vote on Tuesday. “It’s so very important that your voice be heard in this defining moment in our country,” he said. “I would not be so presumptuous as to tell you who to vote for.”Loeffler was appointed to fill a vacancy when Republican Johnny Isakson resigned his seat, and she will be in the Senate, win or lose this coming week, until the election is certified. Perdue’s seat will temporarily be vacant after his term expires Sunday at the end of six years.Harris was scheduled to be in Savannah on Sunday afternoon. Trump and Biden plan last-minute, in-person efforts Monday to mobilize voters after more than 3 million people cast ballots early.The president continues to create turbulence for Loeffler and Perdue by questioning Biden’s narrow victory in Georgia and the reliability of the state’s election systems.Trump also tweeted that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, also Republicans, “have done less than nothing. They are a disgrace to the great people of Georgia!”The president last week called on Kemp to resign; the governor dismissed it as a “distraction.”Despite the attacks, Loeffler said she believed voters would heed Trump’s expected plea during his upcoming visit that they should turn out.“He’s going to tell voters the same thing: You have to get out and vote Georgia, because this is too important,” Loeffler said.Perdue, who is in quarantine after being exposed to a staff member with the coronavirus and won’t appear with Trump at Monday’s rally, said he would have joined the electoral challenge in the Senate if he had been in Washington. “I’m encouraging my colleagues to object. This is something that the American people demand right now,” he told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-on-tape-presses-georgia-official-to-find-votes/story-exQF5YAQV0JMNVYEwhH4aN.html
04-01-2021||World||From ‘impotency’ to ‘microchip’: Dangerous conspiracy theories surrounding Covid-19, vaccines||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has claimed over 1.83 million lives worldwide so far, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, overwhelming health facilities around the globe. While the governments and health authorities have been working to contain the virus and slow down its transmission, they have also been struggling to put a lid on wild and baseless conspiracy theories. Several social media platforms scrambled to add labels, warnings and links to trusted news sources to bust the rumours. Here are some of the baseless conspiracy theories around Covid-19:‘Impotency’Samajwadi Party leader Ashutosh Sinha said that his party does not believe in the machinery of the government, suggesting that the vaccine may be used for population control by making people impotent. Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) VG Somani on Sunday rubbished the latest conspiracy theory surrounding Covid-19 vaccine.“The vaccines are 100 per cent safe. Some side effects like mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine. It is absolute rubbish that people may become impotent,” Somani was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.5G causes Covid-19During the initial days of the coronavirus outbreak, an incomprehensible theory about 5G - the next-generation wireless network technology - causing the health crisis made its way to social media platforms. The conspiracy theorists pointed to the installation of 5G towers in Wuhan, China, before the virus outbreak. The Federal Communications Commission of the United States had to release a statement to quell the rumour. “A worldwide online conspiracy theory has attempted to link 5G cell phone technology as being one of the causes of the coronavirus. Many cell towers outside of the US have been set on fire as a result. 5G technology does NOT cause coronavirus,” the statement read.Also Read | ‘Disgraceful’: Health minister Vardhan slams Akhilesh Yadav, Tharoor over Covid-19 vaccine ‘doubts’‘Plandemic’A 26-minute video titled ‘Plandemic’ was uploaded on YouTube which claimed the pandemic was a planned health crisis. In the video, a discredited medical researcher, Judy Mikovits, asserted that face masks “activates your own virus” and vaccines are “a money-making enterprise that causes medical harm”. The video also suggested that powerful elites were complicit in the virus outbreak and stand to profit from it.The video garnered millions of views within hours before it was taken taken down by YouTube and other social media platforms for making false claims. Since then, several medical professionals have also come forward to rubbish the claim and a host of fact-check videos have been uploaded on YouTube to minimise the damage from such baseless theories.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has repeatedly said that wearing masks is a key measure to suppress virus transmission and save lives. According to the UN health agency, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission. It has advised that masks should be used as part of a comprehensive approach.Bill Gates and microchipA Yahoo News/YouGov survey found that 28 per cent of US adults believed a conspiracy theory that suggested Bill Gates, the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation, had planned to use a potential Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips to monitor the movement of billions of people. During a CNN Town Hall interview, Gates called it a “bad combination of pandemic and social media”, adding that people are looking for a very simple explanation. In another TV interview, Gates said that the truth needs to be out there and the conspiracy theories will die down as people get the facts.Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated millions of dollars for Covid-19 vaccine and treatment research programmes. In February, the foundation pledged to donate $100 million to coronavirus vaccine research and treatment efforts and months later, it pledged an additional $1.6 billion to the Gavi vaccine alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-impotency-to-microchip-dangerous-conspiracy-theories-surrounding-covid-19/story-U4zBncQw1erTXmblPskXIM.html
