Sharing his photo, Greta who is not known to be in Donald Trump's good books wrote, "He seems like a very happy old man looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"Follow live updates of the inauguration ceremony of Joe BidenHe seems like a very happy old man looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! pic.twitter.com/G8gObLhsz9One does not have to go back long to trace this comment. When Greta Thunberg's 'How dare you' speech at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 shot her to global fame, then US President Donald Trump had said something very similar. "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" This was exactly what Trump had tweeted after Greta's speech.From then onwards, the two have often been found engaging in passive-aggressive Twitter wars. But interestingly, Greta gave back whatever Trump had told her. And Twitter remained a witness of this amusing back and forth until Donald Trump's account was permanently suspended. For example, Trump's advice to Greta to "chill" found a way to come back to him when Greta advised Trump to chill during the counting of votes of US presidential election 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/so-nice-to-see-how-greta-thunberg-reacted-to-trump-leaving-101611156389506.html

The explosion partially destroyed a building.A nearby nursing home was evacuated although no injuries have been reported among the residents.José Luis Martínez Almeida, who visited the site of the blast, told the local Telemadrid news channel that he couldn’t confirm how many people had been injured.He said that no serious damage had been initially registered in the nearby school.A loud explosion partially destroyed a small building flanked by a school and a nursing home in the center of Spain's capital on Wednesday. It was not clear what caused the blast.Images and footage shared on social media showed a tower of smoke coming out from the six-story building and rubble scattered in Toledo Street, near the city center. Emergency crews could be seen aiding several people on the ground in video aired by Spanish public broadcaster. There were no immediate reports of deaths.The school nearby was empty, according to TVE, because classes had not resumed yet following a record snowfall in the Spanish capital on Jan. 9.In a tweet, the Madrid regional emergency service said that rescue teams, firefighters and police were working in a central area of the Spanish capital following the explosion.Leire Reparaz, an area resident, told The Associated Press that she heard a loud explosion some minutes before 3 p.m. local when she was heading to her home near the Puerta de Toledo, a local landmark.“We didn’t know where the sound came from. We all thought it was from the school. We went up the stairs to the top of our building and we could see the structure of the building and lots of grey smoke,” the 24-year-old Madrid resident said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madrid-blast-mayor-says-2-people-dead-explosion-apparently-linked-to-gas-leak-101611155887771.html

"I will always fight for you."It is my greatest honor and privilege to have been your president," he said. "We will be back in some form."The 74-year-old Trump has hinted at running for president again in 2024, but faces a trial in the Senate over his role in the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters and a potential ban on holding office in the future.Trump boarded Air Force One after his remarks and the presidential jet took off for the two-hour flight to Florida as Frank Sinatra's "My Way" played on loudspeakers on the tarmac on a sunny but chilly day.Trump will be at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida when the 78-year-old Biden is sworn in at noon (1700 GMT) as the 46th president of the United States.He is the first president in more than 150 years to snub the inauguration of his successor.Trump did not address Biden by name in his remarks but said he wishes the new administration "great luck and great success."A White House spokesman said Trump, in keeping with tradition, had left a letter for Biden in the Oval Office.Trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that he won the November 3 election and he was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after his supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to disrupt the certification by Congress of Biden's victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-be-back-in-some-form-donald-trump-s-parting-note-at-washington-101611154531336.html

Taking to Twitter, the whistleblower said that he “would rather be without a state than without a voice.”I am not at all disappointed to go unpardoned by a man who has never known a love he had not paid for. But what supporters of his remain must never forgive that this simpering creature failed to pardon truth-tellers in far more desperate circumstances:https://t.co/luyYyBViYEIn August 2020, Trump had said that he was considering a pardon for Snowden, marking a reversal from his earlier stance that the whistleblower was “a spy who should be executed”. He had told a news conference at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster, that he wasn’t “aware of the Snowden situation”, but assured that he is going to “start looking at it”.“I mean, I’ve seen people that are very conservative and very liberal, and they agree on the same issue; they agree both ways. I’m going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden,” he had said.The American whistleblower is currently at an unknown location in Russia since he was granted the right of asylum after his US passport was revoked. Last year, Snowden, author of the book titled ‘Permanent Record’, had said that the president should end the war on whistleblowers at the stroke of a pen. Speaking at 11th Hour show, Snowden had, however, clarified that he hasn’t asked for pardon for himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-disappointed-us-whistleblower-snowden-after-he-goes-unpardoned-by-trump-101611153427190.html

Recent weeks have seen a new round of saber-rattling, amid fears the Trump administration might attempt to provoke a conflict in its final days.With Biden entering the Oval Office on Thursday, hopes are high for "rapprochement". Rouhani castigated Trump, saying his four years in office "bore no fruit other than injustice and corruption and causing problems for his own people and the world."According to CNN, the Iran Nuclear Deal which was officially titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the landmark agreement was intended to limit Iran's civilian nuclear program, thereby preventing the country from ever developing nuclear weapons.The deal was signed by Iran and six other nations in 2015."Under the deal, the Iranian government agreed to three key things: reducing the number of centrifuges in the country by two-thirds, slashing its stockpile of enriched uranium, and capping ongoing enrichment at 3.67 per cent, an amount sufficient for energy provision but not enough to build a nuclear bomb," CNN reported.Trump pulled out from the deal in 2018, though the agreement itself continues to exist, with Iran, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Russia all still party to it.Since the US walked away, however, Iran has increased uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the deal, sparking concern that Iran could in the future pursue a nuclear weapons program.Biden has expressed a desire to return to the 2015 agreement, writing for CNN last year that Trump had "recklessly tossed away a policy that was working to keep America safe and replaced it with one that has worsened the threat.""I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy... If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rouhani-hopes-joe-biden-will-return-to-obama-era-iran-nuclear-deal-101611149654295.html

Mohammed Abdalla al-Douma's residence in the provincial capital of Genena, but it underscored the heightened tensions in the restive region where a bout of tribal violence has killed around 230 people since last week.A statement from the governor said the attempted attack sought to create "instability and chaos” in the province.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and the statement did not say who the attackers were.A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to reporters, said that the attackers opened fire on the heavily fortified residence, prompting the guards to return fire. The exchange lasted for over an hour.The Darfur 24 news outlet reported heavy gunfire in Genena's neighbourhood of Gamarek where the governor's residence is located.Earlier this week, officials from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum visited Genena to discuss the tribal clashes with the governor.The fighting between members of the Arab Rizeigat tribe and the non-Arab Massalit tribe grew out of a fistfight in Friday in a Genena camp for displaced people. Some 160 people on both sides, including women and children have been killed.The fighting also led to the displacement of at least 90,000 people, who have taken shelter in schools and government buildings and nearby villages, according to the United Nations.Authorities in West Darfur imposed a 24-hour curfew in all of the province and authorised military and police to use “all necessary force” to regain order. The central government in Khartoum also deployed security reinforcements.In South Darfur province, clashes on Monday between the Rizeigat and non-Arab Falata tribe killed around 70 people, according to Gov. Mousa Mahdi.The clashes was sparked by the killing of a shepherd in al-Twaiyel village, 85 kilometers (53 miles) south of Nyala, the provincial capital.Mahdi, who visited the village on Tuesday, vowed to bring to justice those who instigated the violence.The latest bout of Darfur violence poses a challenge to Sudan's transitional government that has been struggling to end civil war in the country's far-flung areas.It is also a major test to the government's ability to protect civilians in the war-torn region following the end of the joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force's mandate in Darfur this month.Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow longtime autocratic Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, after nearly three decades of rule. A military-civilian government is now in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-men-try-to-storm-governor-s-house-in-sudan-s-darfur-101611149632401.html

Physical distancing can be achieved by limiting class sizes, alternating shifts and limiting mixing of classes.- Stronger prevention measures might be necessary in secondary schools, and adolescents should limit their exposure risk outside school.- Teachers "are more likely to be infected" outside schools than inside.- During school closures, remote learning should be set up, regular schools services such as meals and immunisation should be maintained, while mental health support should be enhanced.- Data and 2020 findings -- Under-18s represent 29 percent of the global population but only eight percent of reported cases last year.- They are more likely to have mild or asymptomatic infection and under-20s accounted for only 0.2 percent of Covid-19 deaths.- Studies suggest that among children, under-10s are less susceptible and less infectious. Adolescents aged 16-18 transmit the virus as often as adults.- "The longer vulnerable children are out of school, the less likely they are to return," said the WHO.- School closures have a negative impact on children besides their education, including their physical and mental health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/school-closures-still-last-resort-despite-variants-who-101611148447339.html

But he wasn't on the list announced Wednesday morning.Joe Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was sentenced in January 2020 to 22 years in federal prison for violating federal wildlife laws and for his role in a failed murder-for-hire plot targeting his chief rival, Carole Baskin, who runs a rescue sanctuary for big cats in Florida.

"I feel like there's too many eyeballs on this for the Chinese to not be relatively sure."Sunwoo is part of China's expanding effort to get its home-grown vaccines to key workers, including restaurant workers like him, and increasingly to the general public.China is stepping up its vaccinations as several countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey begin mass vaccination programmes using its vaccines.Inconsistent data disclosures have raised concern that Chinese vaccines are not subject to the same public scrutiny as U.S. and European ones.China's domestic effort is intensifying amid a spate of new outbreaks and with a goal of vaccinating nine key groups before the travel-heavy Lunar New Year in February.China has approved three vaccines for emergency use but only one for the general public. A fourth is only being used by the military.People aged 60 and over will not get a shot until the safety is confirmed. The same goes for children. In many countries, older people, who are more vulnerable to serious illness from Covid-19, are at the front of the vaccine queue.Chinese authorities said on Wednesday 15 million vaccine doses had been delivered, enough for just over 1% of the population.In particular, the campaign has accelerated in the capital, Beijing, according to guidelines published by various authorities. One of the city's biggest districts said this week it had begun vaccinating the general population.Vaccinated delivery personnel, food workers, educators and medical workers told Reuters of a broad and intensifying effort in what could be the world's largest COVID-19 vaccine campaign."If I didn't get the vaccine, I couldn't work. The reality is simple", said a Beijing food delivery worker who was among thousands of couriers vaccinated early this month."No one will refuse it," said the worker, declining to give his name because he is not authorised by his company to discuss the vaccinations.HOLIDAY RUSHBeijing has not announced phases for the campaign beyond the focus on key workers.Guidelines vary, though most large cities have begun to invite people from specific groups including medical workers, couriers, customs staff and cleaners.The city of Beijing has set the tightest deadlines, with plans to vaccinate all key workers before the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 12.Authorities and those who have received vaccines say cities are not adhering strictly to the designated groups, which allows municipalities and districts to set their own priorities.Beijing's Chaoyang district said this week it had vaccinated about 164,000 people outside the key groups.An official from Shanghai's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday that the city had opened vaccine booking for people beyond key groups, including those who plan to go abroad. Just under 50% of Shanghai's 1.77 million designated key workers had volunteered to get a shot."If the country has rolled out this vaccine for everyone, there must be some degree of safety that's guaranteed," said Yi Hongjun, a software researcher at automaker SAIC, who got an initial dose of a vaccine made by Sinovac on Tuesday.Authorities in several major cities including Beijing and Shanghai say supplies are ample.A Shanghai school administrator, who declined to be identified, said in December staff were given 48 hours to decide if they would take a vaccine made by Sinopharm, which has yet to pass Phase III trials but has been approved in China for emergency use.An SAIC worker surnamed Huang who received the vaccine in Shanghai on Tuesday said the process was smooth."Once we're vaccinated, we can have peace of mind," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-steps-up-covid-19-vaccine-drive-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-101611144350258.html

Harris’ late mother was also born in India, before moving to the US to study at the University of California. She married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for “lotus flower.”Ahead of the inauguration, special prayers for her success were held at the town temple during which the idol of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva, was washed with milk and decked with flowers by the priest.Ahead of the US elections in November, villagers in Thulasendrapuram also pulled together a ceremony at the temple to wish Harris good luck. After her win, they set off firecrackers and distributed sweets and flowers as a religious offering.Posters of Harris from the November celebrations still adorn walls in the village and many hope she ascends to the presidency in 2024. President-elect Joe Biden has skirted questions about whether he will seek reelection or retire.“For the next four years, if she supports India, she will be the president,” said G Manikandan, who has followed Harris politically and whose shop proudly displays a wall calendar with pictures of Biden and Harris.On Tuesday, an organization that promotes vegetarianism sent food packets for the village children as gifts to celebrate Harris’ success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-village-cheers-for-harris-before-swearing-in-as-us-vp-101611137873616.html
20-01-2021||World||China's Covid-19 vaccine makers apply to join WHO's COVAX scheme||China said on Wednesday three drugmakers had submitted applications to supply their COVID-19 vaccines to global vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX in the country's first formal move to provide locally developed shots to the initiative.Sinovac Biotech, China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and CanSino Biologics have applied to join the scheme, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference on Wednesday.The COVAX scheme - led by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance - is due to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle-income countries in February, with 2 of 3 billion doses expected to be delivered this year.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that vaccine nationalism had put the world on the brink of "catastrophic moral failure," and urged countries and manufacturers to spread doses more fairly around the world.Vaccines from Sinopharm and Sinovac are already being rolled out in several countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.None of the three companies have released detailed efficacy data of their vaccines to the public yet, but limited early access to rival shots developed by Western drugmakers have prompted many developing countries to sign up for Chinese vaccines.Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino did not have any immediate comments on the timing of COVAX approval of their vaccines, supply amounts and what data they have provided to COVAX.COVAX was not immediately available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-makers-apply-to-join-who-s-covax-scheme-101611137628543.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to issue executive orders reversing Donald Trump's policies on climate, Covid-19 on first day of presidency||In his first hours as president, Joe Biden will aim to strike at the heart of President Donald Trump’s policy legacy, signing a series of executive actions that reverse his predecessor’s orders on immigration, climate change and handling of the pandemic.Biden on Wednesday will end construction on Trump’s border wall, end the ban on travel from some Muslim-majority countries, rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization, and revoke the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, aides said Tuesday. The new president will sign the orders almost immediately after taking the oath of office at the Capitol, pivoting quickly from his pared-down inauguration ceremony to enacting his agenda.The 15 executive actions are an attempt to essentially rewind the last four years of federal policies with striking speed. Only two recent presidents signed executive actions on their first day in office — and each signed just one. But Biden, facing the debilitating coronavirus pandemic, is intent on demonstrating a sense of urgency and competence that he argues has been missing under his predecessor.“I think the most important thing to say is that tomorrow starts a new day,” said Jeff Zients, Biden's choice to lead a new White House office that will coordinate the federal government's revamped response to the pandemic.Follow our live updates on the US presidential inaugurationThe orders reach well beyond the pandemic. Biden intends to order a review of all Trump regulations and executive actions that are deemed damaging to the environment or public health. He will order federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reenforce systemic racism. He will revoke a Trump order that sought to exclude noncitizens from the census, and will order federal employees to take an ethics pledge that commits them to upholding the independence of the Justice Department.Susan Rice, Biden's incoming domestic policy adviser, said the new president would also revoke the just-issued report of Trump’s “1776 Commission” to promote "patriotic education."These actions will be followed by dozens more in the next 10 days, aides said, as Biden looks to redirect the country without having to go through a Senate that Democrats control by the narrowest margin.Notably, the opening actions did not include immediate steps to rejoin the Iran nuclear accord, which Trump abandoned and Biden has pledged to reimplement. Jen Psaki, the incoming White House press secretary, said that while they were not included in Biden’s Day One orders, the new president will in the coming days revoke the Pentagon’s ban on military service by transgender Americans as well as the so-called Mexico City policy, which bans US funding for international organizations that perform or refer women for abortion services.Also read: 'If she supports India, she will be president'Psaki said the actions to be taken Wednesday were focused on providing “immediate relief” to Americans.In another effort to signal a return to pre-Trump times, Psaki said she would hold a news briefing late Wednesday in a symbol of the administration’s commitment to transparency. Trump's White House had all but abandoned the practice of briefing reporters daily.Biden will sign the actions during his first visit to the Oval Office in four years. Since then, presidential order actions were often marked by clumsy announcements and confusion. In their first days in office, Trump’s team was forced to rewrite executive orders by court order and aides took days to figure out how to use the White House intercom to alert press about events. The repeatedly canceled plans to hype new building programs — dubbed “Infrastructure week” — became a national punchline. Biden aides, by contrast, are aiming to demonstrate they are up for the job right out of the gate.Biden senior aides, led by deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and campaign policy chief Stef Feldman, began plotting out the executive action plans in November, just days after Biden won the presidency and drafting began in December. The final documents were reviewed by career staff at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in recent weeks before Biden’s swearing-in to ensure they would pass legal muster.Also read: Washington mayor asks for tightened securityBiden’s team was set begin assuming the reins of power even before the Marine Band finished its rendition of “Hail to the Chief” after the new president takes the oath of office.Aides were due to begin entering the White House complex at the stroke of noon — when Biden officially assumes the office — to begin overseeing national security roles. The urgency was hasten by concerns about security around the Inauguration after the US Capitol insurrection.Covid-19 restrictions, along with tight security surrounding the Inauguration were severely curtailing the number of aides in Biden’s West Wing. Aides, one official said, were told to pack snacks to eat in their offices because of pandemic protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-reverse-donald-trump-s-policies-on-climate-covid-19-on-first-day-101611137213623.html

The president also changed his legal residence from Trump Tower in New York City to Mar-a-Lago in September 2019.The 74-year-old longtime New Yorker purchased the mansion in 1985 for USD 10 million and turned it into a private club, which has become his winter home during the last four years.The 20-acre estate inspired by a Moorish-Mediterranean structure, now with 128 rooms, was built in 1927 by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.The massive property features direct views of the Atlantic Ocean and is open to people who purchase a membership at the club. The property includes a 20,000-square-foot ballroom, five clay tennis courts and a waterfront pool.Trump holds private quarters on the property in a separate, closed-off area. It has been labelled the second-largest mansion in the sunshine state of Florida.Forbes estimated the value of the estate at around USD 160 million following extensive renovations and the exclusivity of the location. However, according to US media reports, neighbours are questioning whether it can become his permanent home.Nearby Palm Beach residents recently sent a letter to town leaders, citing a 1993 agreement they say prohibits anyone from living permanently on the property because it is a social club, cbsnews.com reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-make-mar-a-lago-estate-permanent-home-after-leaving-white-house-101611137139863.html

The study was published on preprint server BioRxiv prior to peer review.Unlike the earlier study, which focused on one crucial mutation, the new research tested all 10 mutations located on the virus’s spike protein, which helps it bind to cells in the host.Antibodies in the blood of 16 volunteers in a previous German trial of the vaccine were just as effective against the lab-created mutant strain as they were against the original virus. The result “makes it very unlikely that the U.K. variant viruses will escape” protection from the vaccine, wrote the research team, led by BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin.“Unlike for influenza vaccines, the reduction in neutralization that might indicate the need for a strain change has not been established for Covid-19 vaccines,” the team wrote. Still, they added, it’s “prudent” to be prepared to adapt the vaccine if needed in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-shot-likely-to-defeat-mutant-new-study-shows-101611136778697.html

Anything that’s flagged is brought to the attention of the command,” Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman told reporters at a briefing. “We’re not even asking what the flag was, we’re just removing them.”The two National Guard troops with links to extremism were flagged to the military by law enforcement and an anonymous tip about inappropriate text messages and comments. Hoffman declined to characterize the communications or say if they represented threats against President-elect Joe Biden or other dignitaries.The other 10 were flagged by law enforcement as they underwent background checks and their removal from service doesn’t necessarily mean the troops were suspected of committing a crime or otherwise unfit for future duty, Hoffman said.He declined to specify what caught the attention of law enforcement in those cases.The soldiers were among 25,000 National Guard members sent to secure Wednesday’s inauguration following a Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol and fears of more violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-people-removed-from-us-capitol-duty-after-background-checks-pentagon-101611133741255.html

"There's no one factor as to why we have such a horrendous and tragic death rate.""I don't think this is the time to talk about mismanagement," Patel said when asked by the BBC if the government had mismanaged the crisis.When pressed on the international comparisons of death tolls, Patel told LBC the data was "not comparable".The British government reported a record rise in deaths on Tuesday with 1,610 people dying within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.Currently 37,946 people are in hospital with Covid, 3,916 of them on ventilation. Currently the United Kingdom has vaccinated 4.27 million people with a first dose of the vaccine, among the best in the world per head of population.The Covid-19 death toll and the level of hospital admissions means it is far too early to speculate about when the lockdown may be lifted or eased, Patel said."We are still in a perilous situation," Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky. "We have a long way to go."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-death-toll-horrendous-says-minister-as-it-nears-grim-100-000-mark-101611132062815.html

20-01-2021||World||Trump visited only one DC restaurant in last 4 years, that too his own||Donald Trump who leaves his presidency has never in his four-year term in office attempted to be part of the local community. A case in point is that unlike his predecessors, Trump has visited only one restaurant - the one in his own Pennsylvania Avenue hotel.While former President Barack Obama was known for hitting all the trendy hotspots for date nights, Trump, who is known for his love of fast food, has never stepped into a DC fast-food joint. He, however, had once sent a former bodyguard to make McDonald's runs and even catered White House events with Burger King and Domino's.According to a report in Washingtonian, Trump is a creature of habit as when he does venture out for a meal at the Trump hotel's steakhouse, BLT Prime, he pretty much always orders the same thing: shrimp cocktail, fries and well-done steak.He did this because here he knows he will get exactly the food he wants in the way that he wants, along with fans cheering him on.In 2016, he had told attorneys that "there aren't that many" great restaurants in Washington as part of a deposition in a lawsuit with celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian. In 2017 he said in an interview on the Larry O'Connor Show, "In Washington, you do have some great restaurants, and I'm going to start going to them," Washingtonian said.He said that he would start visiting other restaurants too."I was accused the other day. Well, when I leave the White House, which is seldom, I always go to my hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, and they say, 'He should go to other places.' And I never thought of it. And I'm going to start doing that. I'm going to go around."In 2019, Trump said that he along with First Lady Melania Trump would stop by at the Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington while awarding the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal to Chief Patrick O'Connell. However, he is yet to step into the restaurant.The magazine Washingtonian opined that "there aren't a lot of places around DC where he would have been welcomed"."If he wasn't outright asked to leave--like former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at Virginia's Red Hen--he'd likely have been met with booing and cursing from other diners. And any restaurant that hosted him--no matter its bipartisan stance--would have no doubt faced backlash by mere association," the magazine opined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-visited-only-one-dc-restaurant-in-last-4-years-that-too-his-own-101611130898670.html

20-01-2021||World||Roaring stocks, weaker dollar, tons of debt: Trump's parting gift to Joe Biden||When he assumes office on Wednesday, President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a stock market near all-time highs, along with a gaping budget deficit, a weakening dollar, elevated economic uncertainty and a Federal Reserve that may have less ammunition to fight the next crisis.Here is a look at what has changed in markets over the last four years and what investors have to look forward to over Biden’s term.1. MARKETS UNDER TRUMPThe S&P 500 is up about 68% since President Donald Trump took office. Its 73% surge since late March has been aided by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as expectations that a Covid-19 vaccine will spur economic reopening.Ultra-low Treasury yields - which plunged after the Fed cut interest rates to near-zero - have also increased the allure of stocks.2. 100 DAYSIf history is any guide, the stock market should give Biden a warm welcome. The S&P 500 has risen in the first 100 calendar days in eight of the last 10 presidential terms.Still, Biden’s first 100 days may be more fraught than those of his predecessors: while he needs to stimulate the economy quickly, the slender Democratic majority in Congress means the final size and timing of a proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package remain uncertain.3. DOES THE BUCK STOP HERE?Biden is also inheriting a dollar that’s fallen 12% from last year's highs. A weaker dollar aids exporters by boosting the competitiveness of US. products abroad and increases the appeal of US stocks by making them more affordable to foreign buyers.Rallying US yields have recently lifted the dollar off its lows, and a more sustained move in the greenback risks sparking an unwind of the market’s near-record bearish dollar position and sparking more gains in the currency.Regardless of where the dollar goes, the incoming administration has signaled it will be less likely to comment on the currency’s fluctuations than Trump, who periodically railed against a strong dollar.4. MORE DEBTThe national debt ballooned by almost 40% under Trump to nearly $28 trillion, fueled by the passage of tax cuts in 2017 and a flood of spending to counter the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic last year.Some investors worry the country's exceedingly cloudy fiscal picture risks tarnishing the appeal of US government debt over the long term, an outcome that may eventually weigh on the US dollar's attractiveness as a reserve currency.In July, Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on the United States’ triple-A rating to negative from stable, citing eroding credit strength.The US national debt is likely to continue growing under Biden. Janet Yellen, his nominee for Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers on Tuesday to "act big" on the next coronavirus relief package, adding that the benefits outweigh the costs of a higher debt burden.5. BLOATED BALANCE SHEETBiden will inherit a Federal Reserve balance sheet that is bigger than ever, thanks to ramped-up spending in the wake of the pandemic.Some worry that interest rates already at rock-bottom levels and asset purchases currently at $120 billion a month may give the central bank less scope to maneuver if the economy worsens or a fresh crisis hits, putting an additional focus on fiscal policy.The Fed’s balance sheet is expected to grow to $9.1 trillion by the end of 2021, a December Reuters poll showed.6. UNCERTAIN TIMESThe coronavirus pandemic ratcheted up economic concerns during the last year of Trump's term. Earlier years of his presidency were marked by flaring trade frictions between the United States and China that rocked asset prices.Policy-related economic uncertainty as measured by Economic Policy Uncertainty, based on mentions of economic uncertainty in news articles, is currently higher than it was following 9/11 or the Great Financial Crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roaring-stocks-weaker-dollar-tons-of-debt-trump-s-parting-gift-to-joe-biden-101611125423172.html
20-01-2021||World||US-Canada relations on slippery ground over Keystone XL oil pipeline issue||Canada and the United States may be headed for a clash over the contentious Keystone XL pipeline in the early days of the Joe Biden administration.The new administration has already indicated that the project will be cancelled and that announcement could be made soon after Biden assumes charge as US president.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that Ottawa will attempt to persuade Washington, DC to allow the oil pipeline to proceed. Keystone XL was approved by the Donald Trump administration, after it had originally been denied permission by his predecessor Barack Obama on environmental grounds.During a media interaction on the eve of Biden’s swearing-in, Trudeau said, “We’ve had a clear and consistent position supporting this project for years. Our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered by the incoming administration at the highest levels.” First envisaged in 2008, construction for the project has begun and the proposed 2,700km pipeline is expected to carry nearly 80,000 barrels of oil from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas via multiple midwestern American states.Given how critical the project is to Alberta, the premier of the province, Jason Kenney, has already warned of legal action in case the Biden administration carries out its threat of cancelling the project.Trudeau spoke to Kenney on Tuesday night and a readout issued by the PMO said that “Canada has made the case for the project, including recently to President-elect Biden”, adding that Canada’s ambassador to the US “and others in government have also been speaking with high-level officials in the incoming administration”.According to a statement cited by CBC News, Canada’s natural resources minister Seamus O’Regan came out strongly in favour of the pipeline. He said, “Canadian oil is produced under strong environmental and climate policy frameworks, and this project will not only strengthen the vital Canada-US energy relationship, but create thousands of good jobs for workers on both sides of the border.”In the readout from the Canadian PMO, Trudeau said he “looked forward to working with the incoming administration of president-elect Biden to fight climate change, protect jobs and grow the economy”. Trudeau was the first to congratulate Biden over phone after the results of the US presidential elections became clear. The Canadian PM had raised the Keystone pipeline matter during that conversation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscanada-relations-on-slippery-ground-over-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline-issue-101611126364137.html

And it is hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal,” Biden said. “It is important to do that as a nation.”At noon on Wednesday, Biden will be inaugurated at the Capitol, at the other end of the National Mall, as the 46th president of the United States, with Kamala Harris as his vice-president, a historic figure as the first woman, African-American, Indian-American and Asian-American elected to the high office.“Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we have lost,” Biden said.The US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic crossed 400,000 on Tuesday, marking yet another grim milestone, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.

20-01-2021||World||Outgoing US President Donald Trump pardons 73 people: White House||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned 73 people, including his former aide Steve Bannon and other allies, just hours before he was due to leave office."President Donald J. Trump granted pardons to 73 individuals and commuted the sentences of an additional 70 individuals," the White House said in a statement.The president and his children were not on the list.Bannon was granted clemency having been charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall that was a flagship Trump policy."Mr. Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen," the statement added.US media earlier reported that the president made his last-minute decision after speaking to Bannon by phone.Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.Rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.President-elect Joe Biden, who beat Trump in an election last year, was due to be sworn in as his successor later Wednesday.Before that, Trump will fly to his home in Florida, skipping the inauguration ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outgoing-us-president-donald-trump-pardons-73-people-white-house-101611123939536.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden's return to Paris Agreement just a first step on US climate action||As Joe Biden leads the United States back into the Paris Agreement on climate change, after taking office Wednesday, diplomats and green groups will breathe a collective sigh of relief - before urging him to step up cuts to U.S. emissions.Soon after his inauguration, Biden is expected to issue an executive order to begin rejoining the 2015 climate pact, reversing a decision by climate-change skeptic Donald Trump.The process to re-enter the international accord takes a month, meaning the United States will only officially have been out of the deal for a short time, since exiting in November.But Trump's hostility to the U.N. climate process and his support for polluting fossil fuels have left Biden's team a lot of catching up to do at home and abroad, policy analysts said."Rejoining the Paris Agreement is really the floor, not the ceiling, for the Biden administration on climate," said Jennifer Morgan, CEO of Greenpeace International.If the U.S. government then moves to help drum up more global ambition to curb rising temperatures, it must be done in a spirit of "partnership and humility, not coming back in and telling everyone what they should be doing", Morgan said.Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), said there would be a number of opportunities in 2021 for Biden to help advance "a progressive climate agenda" on the world stage.Those include the G7 and G20 leaders' summits, and the U.N. climate talks in November.Biden and his international climate envoy John Kerry should also pursue meetings with other major emitters - as Biden has indicated he will do - "to solidify ways to collectively tackle the climate crisis head-on", she said in a statement.2030 TARGETOne key task for Washington, after re-entering the Paris climate deal, will be to set a U.S. emissions reduction target for 2030 and produce a stronger national climate action plan.Signatories to the Paris accord were meant to submit updated plans to cut emissions and adapt to worsening extreme weather and rising seas by the end of 2020 - but due to delays caused by the pandemic only about 70 have done so.The rest of the plans are expected to be delivered by the time of the postponed COP26 U.N. climate conference, set to be hosted by Britain in November.The good news for Biden is that support for climate action is growing among U.S. voters.A December survey of nearly 950 registered voters across the political spectrum found 75% supported U.S. participation in the Paris accord.As well, 64% said the United States should reduce planet-heating emissions regardless of what others countries do, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found.Last week, the Rhodium Group of researchers and analysts said U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell 10.3% in 2020, the largest drop in the post-World War II era, as coronavirus crippled the economy.But it warned the dip was not a clear indication that the United States could meet its more ambitious pledge under the Paris Agreement, to cut emissions 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.Biden has said he plans to set the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, something a growing number of major economies are now promising to do.But he will first need to announce an emissions-cutting target for 2030 - one experts say must be in the order of 50% below 2005 levels to give the world a chance of holding global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower Paris goal.Youth activists and some green groups have called for even more ambitious targets, saying the United States should aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 if it is to do its "fair share" to fight climate change."The United States is the second-largest emitter of carbon emissions from fossil fuels annually and the largest source of cumulative emissions to date. Yet for decades it has not done its fair share to rein in emissions," said Cleetus of the UCS.CLIMATE FINANCEDipti Bhatnagar, coordinator of climate justice and energy programs for Friends of the Earth International, said high-carbon lifestyles in the United States had contributed to "untold suffering" for families in the developing world."Droughts are destroying crops, cyclones are leveling homes, and whole nations are literally disappearing," the Mozambican said."The livelihoods and dignity of billions of people who didn't create the climate crisis require the Biden administration to take immediate and far-reaching climate action, driven by justice, equity and science.”Climate finance experts want Biden's government to make good on a promise to the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing nations adopt clean energy and adapt to a warmer world.Trump refused to deliver $2 billion of an earlier pledge to the fund - and campaigners are now hoping to see this money come through, as well as increased finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and build their resilience to climate impacts.Greenpeace's Morgan said the United States should commit in its new climate action plan not to back further development of dirty energy - coal, oil or gas - both on its own territory and overseas."Fossil fuels are like weapons of mass destruction - they need to be kept in the ground," she said.

20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s global leadership ambitions 'complicated' by US Capitol riot||When followers of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago, countries with questionable democratic track records seemed to relish the chance to denounce the United States."Yesterday’s events showed that the U.S. has no moral right to punish another nation under the guise of upholding democracy," tweeted Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, calling for Washington to end "painful" economic sanctions it imposed over human rights and rule of law concerns.While unlikely to convince the world, the barbs from Harare - and other capitals antagonistic to Washington - underscore the fragile state of America’s global reputation as Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Wednesday.Trump, who for months made false claims that the Nov. 3 election was stolen from him, encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying Biden's victory. A riot led to the evacuation of the building and five deaths."Let us not be naive that a lot of damage has been done to the American image for the last four years, and more specifically, what happened," on Jan. 6, said David O’Sullivan, former European Union ambassador to Washington.Biden, vice president under Barack Obama and a former senator with decades of foreign policy experience, has pledged to repair tattered strategic alliances, while also attempting to re-establish U.S leadership on climate change and take a more prominent role on the global response to the coronavirus.But veteran diplomats and foreign policy experts said a sharply divided American society - one at risk of political violence - will make Biden’s job harder and distract from the hard work of restoring U.S. leadership.Biden’s transition team believes the Capitol violence underscores one of his main messages before taking office: that U.S. domestic and foreign policy cannot be fully separated.'DOUBLE STANDARDS'Biden has said he will recommit the United States to NATO and assemble leaders of democracies within his first year to counter rising authoritarianism around the world.But U.S. diplomats are likely to face cries of hypocrisy when they call out governments for failing to uphold democratic norms."It’s going to weaken the American word," said Gerard Araud, a former ambassador for France in Washington. "Every time they will try to lecture the world ... there will be people who are going to try to drag them down to the reality. It will be used by the bad guys."After the scenes at the Capitol, the Chinese Communist Party-run Global Times newspaper lashed out at what it described as “double standards” among U.S. politicians who praised pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.The Biden transition team has stressed that his administration will work with allies to stand up for universal values and principles and democratic rights.Tony Blinken, a Biden confidant whom he nominated to become secretary of state, told Congress on Tuesday the United States needed both “humility and confidence” in dealing with the world.“Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world’s problems are not about us, even as they affect us,” Blinken said in prepared testimony. "Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone – even one as powerful as the U.S."'LANDMINES'Biden foreign policy officials will be inheriting several immediate challenges thanks to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who laid "landmines" on his way out that could box Biden in, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.For instance, the Trump administration has been piling on sanctions related to Iran and Pompeo on Jan. 10 designated Yemen’s Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, moves that seemed designed to make Biden’s goal of reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran more difficult.Similarly on China, Pompeo has unleashed one sanctions package after another and lifted restrictions on U.S. contacts with Taiwan, an apparent attempt to lock in a tough approach to China before Biden's inauguration. On his last full day in office, Pompeo determined that China's repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang amounted to "genocide", delivering a massive parting shot to Beijing.Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that he agreed with Pompeo's assessment.As long as the U.S. domestic political discourse remains bitterly divided, any attempts to reverse Trump administration policies will be viewed with caution.Washington's allies increasingly see U.S. foreign policy coming in two or four-year cycles contingent on domestic politics, said Brian Katulis, who works on national security at the Center for American Progress."That won't be easily fixed as long as Republicans and Democrats continue to tear each other apart over national security questions like China and Iran," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-global-leadership-ambitions-complicated-by-us-capitol-riot-101611123130539.html
20-01-2021||World||'When will I get Covid-19 vaccine? Are there side effects?' Top UNICEF official answers big questions||As several nations across the world have begun the roll-out of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people have various queries regarding the distribution and side effects of the dose, the answers for which they have been looking on the internet.Dr Robin Nandy, the principal advisor and chief of immunisation at UNICEF, has answered the most pressing questions concerning the vaccination programmes. Here are the excerpts from his online session:Who should get the Covid-19 vaccine first and why?The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other technical agencies are recommending prioritisation of the limited Covid-19 vaccine for healthcare workers and the high risk groups, which include the elderly and those with comorbidities, as the primary aim is keep the health workers and the health system functioning and to prevent severe disease and death. As more vaccines become available, we'll follow a tiered system which will extend vaccination to other population subgroups like essential non-health workers and gradually to other members of the community.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereIt's really important that those who need the vaccine get it first and we must wait for our turn, and it will come.Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe?For vaccines, we have robust criteria to determine whether a vaccine is ready for widespread use. There are protocols within the pharmaceutical industry overseen by the WHO and various independent vaccine safety bodies looking at data. These form the opinion of regulatory authorities like the FDA in the cases of the United States, so all sorts of data are considered before making a determination whether a vaccine is safe for use.A post shared by Priyanka (@priyanka_pruthi)For a new vaccine, some of the protocols remain the same. The aim of clinical trials is to look at the efficacy of the vaccine, i.e, whether it works, and the safety of the vaccine to ensure that it doesn’t do any harm to the recipient.Safety monitoring does not end when a vaccine is licensed for emergency use or licensed for use more broadly. Safety surveillance of vaccines continues right through the course of vaccine implementation.Are there side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine?Vaccines, like any other biological product, like drugs and so on, all have potential side effects. However, in the case of Covid-19 vaccines, through the course of clinical trials we have not seen high frequency of any dangerous side effects. We will continue to monitor side effects.Also Read: Scientists debate naming of new Covid-19 variants, want to avoid stigmaThe common side effects are rather temporary. They include swelling at the site of injection, a little bit of pain, things that can be controlled with paracetamol or Tylenol. In some cases, people experience a little bit of fatigue and weakness for a couple of days.Will children be administered the Covid-19 vaccine?In the initial vaccine trials, very few trials included children so we do not have efficacy and safety data on children. That's going to emerge as we roll out the vaccine among the elerderly and health workers. Trials will continue to assess the impact of the vaccine.Can pregnant women, or those who are breastfeeding get the vaccine?At this stage, we don't see any warning signs to prevent vaccine use among women who are breastfeeding because some of the advanced vaccine candidates are not live viral vaccines, they use different platforms. They're the mRNA vaccine, so no live substance. So we don't see too many contraindications to use with breastfeeding women. In terms of pregnancy, we don't expect a negative impact but this is an area we’re still learning. It also depends on the level of risk. If they're a frontline health worker with huge exposure then you've got to trade off and risk the benefit. But if you are not at high risk of infection, it changes your decision making.Dr Robin Nandy concluded by saying that the fact that there is a vaccine must not make people complacent. “We need to continue to do everything we can to prevent Covid-19 transmission. We need to continue to use masks, practise physical distancing, and need to keep washing our hands.The vaccine goes along with all these measures and not at the cost of any of these others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-i-get-covid-19-vaccine-are-there-side-effects-top-unicef-official-answers-big-questions-101611119860937.html
20-01-2021||World||UK coronavirus strain detected in at least 60 countries: WHO||The UK coronavirus strain has been detected in at least 60 countries, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, 10 more than a week ago.With the global death toll now well past two million, and new variants of the virus causing deep concern, countries across the world are grappling with how to slow infections until vaccines become widely available.The South African strain, which like the UK one is believed to be more infectious, has now been reported in 23 countries and territories, the WHO also announced in its weekly update.It added that the number of new deaths climbed to a record high of 93,000 over the previous seven days, with 4.7 million new cases reported over the same period.The arrival of mass vaccination campaigns in the US and Europe had brought hope that the end of the pandemic was in sight; the European Union said Tuesday it was aiming to inoculate 70 percent of its adult population before the end of August.But many EU countries -- and other nations including India and Russia -- have struggled to get their inoculation programmes off the ground.The United States remains home to the world's worst outbreak in overall numbers, and US President-elect Joe Biden made clear he would be taking no chances following his inauguration on Wednesday.Recent days have also seen a renewed focus on the initial outbreak a year ago, with China defending its handling of the virus on Tuesday after independent experts criticised the speed of its response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-strain-detected-in-at-least-60-countries-who-101611120060386.html
20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump wishes bitter rival Joe Biden ‘luck’||Outgoing US President Donald Trump on Tuesday wished the incoming administration of Joe Biden “luck” and said he would be praying for its success.But Trump could still not bring himself around to name President Biden and congratulate him directly.Trump and first lady Melania Trump will leave the White House on Wednesday morning for their Florida resort, with a stopover for a farewell at a military base outside Washington, DC. They are not staying to either to attend Biden’s inauguration or receive him and his wife at the White House as has been a transfer-of-power ritual.“This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,” Trump said in a recorded video farewell address. “We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck - a very important word.”The outgoing president then went on to claim overwhelming success in what he had set out to achieve. “With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close,” he said.A president who divided Americans on numerous issues went on to claim that his “agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation”.Trump may be leaving town, but not politics. The Wall Street Journal has reported he is thinking of floating a new political party, and has discussed it with some associates. He reportedly has a name for it - Patriot Party.It was not immediately clear if it was this new party he had in mind when he said in his farewell address, “I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.”Trump is still polling well among Republicans and retains his grip on the party’s base, but political pundits wonder if that will last long. He is leaving office as the only American president to be impeached twice.Party seniors have already begun distancing themselves from him and his legacy tainted indelibly by the January 6 riot at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.“The mob was fed lies,” said Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, on the floor of the chamber on Tuesday. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.”With Trump out of town and their way, Republicans are displaying a new-found desire to work with his successor. McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, will join Biden and top Congressional Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer at a prayer service before the inauguration.Vice-President Mike Pence, a Republican with presidential ambitions of his own, has already signalled estrangement from his boss. He will not attend Trump’s farewell and will be at Biden’s inauguration instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-wishes-bitter-rival-joe-biden-luck-101611120063178.html
20-01-2021||World||As he leaves office, Trump pardons former top strategist Steve Bannon||US President Donald Trump has granted clemency to former White House aide Steve Bannon as part of a wave of pardons and commutations he will issue during his final hours in office, a senior administration official said.Trump was not expected to pardon himself, members of his family or lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was at the forefront of unsuccessful efforts to get the results of the 2020 presidential election overturned, according to sources.Trump leaves office on Wednesday, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the nation's next president.Trump also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, as well as former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges, a senior administration official said.Bannon, who was a key adviser in Trump's 2016 presidential run, was charged last year with swindling Trump supporters over an effort to raise private funds to build the president's wall on the US-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty.White House officials had advised Trump against pardoning Bannon. The two men have lately rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said.Bannon, 67, is the latest prominent political ally to receive clemency from Trump, who has often used the powers of the executive branch to reward loyalists and punish his enemies.Trump previously pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about his conversation with the former Russian ambassador, and he commuted the prison term for Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Bannon can still be charged in state court in New York, where a pardon would not help him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Alonso said.Lil Wayne, 38, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., pleaded guilty in federal court in December to illegally possessing a firearm and faced up to 10 years in prison. He has expressed support for Trump's criminal justice reform efforts.Kodak Black, 23, who was born Bill Kahan Kapri, is in federal prison for making a false statement in order to buy a firearm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pardons-former-white-house-adviser-steve-bannon-101611119602639.html

There were no reported injuries,” the statement added.The two men have been remanded in custody and will appear at the Isleworth Crown Court on February 15.The Met Police is appealing to witnesses to come forward as their enquiries in the case continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-british-sikhs-charged-for-street-fight-with-swords-and-knives-in-uk-101611118928149.html
20-01-2021||World||Trump likely to pardon Steve Bannon, accused of defrauding donors||President Donald Trump is leaning toward granting his former strategist Steve Bannon a pardon, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would end the ex-aide’s federal prosecution for allegedly defrauding donors to a group that sought to build a wall on the Mexico border.Trump could still change his mind, the people cautioned. They asked not to be identified because the White House hasn’t announced any clemency decisions.The president’s term ends Wednesday at noon, and he’s expected to issue a number of pardons before leaving office. A White House spokesman declined to comment.Bannon was among a group of four Trump supporters accused last year of using money donated to the “We Build The Wall” campaign for personal gain.His indictment represented a remarkable fall from grace for the onetime leader of Breitbart News who was a key architect of Trump’s 2016 election victory and an adviser during the president’s first months in office. Bannon has denied the charges.Despite portraying the “We Build the Wall” campaign as a volunteer effort, Bannon received more than $1 million from the group and used some of it to pay personal expenses, prosecutors said. Donations were used to pay a salary to the group’s founder, a disabled Air Force veteran named Brian Kolfage, who’d promised he would “not take a penny,” prosecutors said.“The defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,” acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.Bannon pleaded not guilty during an August court hearing and had been free on a $5 million bond while awaiting trial. He faced as many as 20 years in prison on each of the two counts against him, though it’s rare for the maximum sentence to be imposed.Long before the arrests, the wall-building project had drawn criticism, including claims that sections were being constructed in floodplains and creating erosion. The project was backed by high-profile Trump boosters like Blackwater founder Erik Prince and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Donald Trump Jr. once called it “private enterprise at its finest.”The president had largely avoided commenting publicly on the case, saying only the project “sounded to me like showboating” and that the arrest was a “sad thing for Mr. Bannon.”Trump’s relationship with Bannon turned frosty after his dismissal from the White House amid controversy over Trump’s handling of violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 and accusations that Bannon frequently leaked to the news media. But Bannon had found his way back into Trump’s circle by forcefully advocating against his first impeachment and for his re-election in a podcast, “War Room.”The two men repeatedly discussed the president’s effort to overturn his election defeat in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-likely-to-pardon-steve-bannon-accused-of-defrauding-donors-101611118617130.html

20-01-2021||World||Climate crisis can be new area of cooperation for India, US: Antony Blinken||Antony Blinken, the nominee for US secretary of state, on Tuesday said there was a “very strong potential” for the United States and India to deepen ties by cooperating on the climate crisis, and building on the work done by previous administrations in other spheres such as civil nuclear cooperation and defence.“One area I think that has a lot of promise, and maybe even necessity, is actually climate,” Blinken said at his confirmation hearing by the Senate foreign relations committee. “At the current rate things are going, India is poised over the next two or three decades to catch up to China in terms of the emissions that it produces.”“At the same time, as you know, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has been a very strong advocate for looking at renewable energy and different technologies, I think there’s a very strong potential for our countries to work together in that area,” he said.As president, Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday on his first day in office to return the US to the Paris Agreement on climate change, reversing outgoing President Donald Trump. And that could in itself be an opportunity for the Biden administration to start working with India on the climate crisis right away.Blinken and four other members of Biden’s incoming cabinet appeared before US Senate committees for their confirmation hearings. The others were Lloyd Austin III, nominee for secretary f defence; Janet Yellen, nominee for treasury secretary; Avril Haines, nominee for director of national intelligence; and Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee for secretary of homeland security.Blinken’s remarks on the climate crisis as the new area for cooperation came in response to a question from Mitt Romney, a Republican senator, on the Biden administration’s plans for India in the wake of border clashes with China.The secretary of state-designate described India as a “bipartisan success story” over successive administrations, and went on to recount the upward trajectory in ties starting towards the end of Bill Clinton’s term, when the two countries were able to put behind the tensions following India’s nuclear tests in 1998. Then came the civil nuclear deal under George W Bush, defence procurement and information sharing under Barack Obama, and then the concept of the Indo-Pacific under Trump, along with efforts to ensure no country, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and a shared commitment to combating terrorism.“So, I think there are many ways in which we can deepen that cooperation to pursue the path that successive administrations have put us on,” Blinken said, offering the climate crisis as the new area of cooperation.Blinken, notably, used the phrase “Indo-Pacific” for the region, instead of “Asia-Pacific”, which should reassure Indian commentators who have been alarmed by the use of the latter term by Biden and some members of his team as a concession to the Chinese. Beijing dislikes the phrase “Indo-Pacific” and its official state media has openly called for the incoming US president and his team to use “Asia-Pacific”.Indian foreign policy experts and commentators are closely watching the incoming administration’s remarks on China for clues to future policy.China was a top issue of concern for senators at Blinken’s hearing also, along with Russia and Iran. Biden and his team have characterised China as a competitor, and Blinken and Haines both stated at their hearings that it will be the incoming administration’s goal will be to “outcompete” China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-crisis-can-be-new-area-of-cooperation-for-india-us-antony-blinken-101611117242898.html
20-01-2021||World||Scientists debate naming of new Covid-19 variants, want to avoid stigma||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been rapidly spreading across the world. It has so far killed millions of people and severely affected major economies.There are a few variants of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which are spreading faster and are deadlier. One such variant was identified in the United Kingdom last year.The scientists are now grappling with what to call these variants. A meeting was held at the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week (January 12) where discussion happened at a new naming system but confusion still prevails.According to Nature, the fast-spreading UK variant was initially called Variant Under Investigation or VIU for short. After a risk assessment, it was renamed as Variant of Concern or VOC.The main cause of concern is the stigma for a country or region if a variant is named after it. 'UK variant', 'South African variant' etc are popular in news reports, but scientists say such things should be avoided.“The last thing we want to do is dissuade any particular place from reporting they’ve got a new concerning variant - in fact, we want to do the opposite,” Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, told Nature.It's not necessary that a variant named after a particular country emerged from there, say the scientists.

Initial vaccinations went to health care workers.The couple travelled from northern Kentucky to University of Cincinnati Health's drive-through vaccination site and they will return in three weeks to get the second vaccine dose.“We want to get back to normal as soon as possible,” Gene Record said. “I'm a square dance caller, and we have not been able to get together since March. We're looking forward to people getting vaccinated and getting back to normal, where we can once again square dance and have fun again.”UC Health is among more than 750 locations across the US state of Ohio to provide COVID-19 vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-couple-celebrates-73rd-wedding-anniversary-with-vaccinations-101611109745682.html
20-01-2021||World||Trump 'provoked' Capitol siege, says Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell||Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday explicitly blamed President Donald Trump for the deadly riot at the Capitol, saying the mob was “fed lies” and that the president and others “provoked” those intent on overturning Democrat Joe Biden’s election.Ahead of Trump's historic second impeachment trial, McConnell's remarks were his most severe and public rebuke of the outgoing president. The GOP leader is setting a tone as Republicans weigh whether to convict Trump on the impeachment charge that will soon be sent over from the House: “incitement of insurrection.”“The mob was fed lies," McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”The Republican leader vowed a “safe and successful” inauguration of Biden on Wednesday at the Capitol, where final preparations were underway amid heavy security.Trump's last full day in office Tuesday was also senators’ first day back since the deadly Capitol siege and since the House voted to impeach him for his role in the riots — an unparalleled time of transition as the Senate prepares for the second impeachment trial in two years and presses ahead with the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet.Three new Democratic senators-elect are set to be sworn into office Wednesday shortly after Biden's inauguration, giving the Democrats the barest majority, a 50-50 Senate chamber. The new vice president, Kamala Harris, will swear them in and serve as an eventual tie-breaking vote.The Democrats, led by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, will take charge of the Senate as they launch a trial to hold the defeated president responsible for the siege, while also quickly confirming Biden’s Cabinet and being asked to consider passage of a sweeping new $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.“The inauguration of a new president and the start of a new administration always brings a flurry of activity to our nation’s government,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. “But rarely has so much piled up for the Senate as during this particular transition.”Making the case for Trump's conviction, Schumer said the Senate needs to set a precedent that the “severest offense ever committed by a president would be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution — impeachment,” and disbarment from future office.McConnell and Schumer conferred later Tuesday about how to balance the trial with other business and how to organize the evenly divided chamber, a process that could slow all of the Senate's business and delay the impeachment proceedings.There were signs of an early impasse. McConnell expressed to Schumer “his long-held view that the crucial, longstanding, and bipartisan Senate rules concerning the legislative filibuster remain intact, specifically during the power share for the next two years,” according to spokesman Doug Andres. Eliminating the Senate filibuster, a procedural move that requires a higher bar for legislation to pass, has been a priority for Democrats who will now control the House, Senate and White House.But a spokesman for Schumer, Justin Goodman, said the Democratic leader “expressed that the fairest, most reasonable and easiest path forward” was to adopt an agreement similar to a 2001 consensus between the parties, the last time the Senate was evenly divided, without “extraneous changes from either side.”Five of Biden's nominees had committee hearings Tuesday as the Senate prepared for swift confirmation of some as soon as the president-elect takes office, as is often done particularly for the White House’s national security team. Many noted the harrowing events at the Capitol on Jan. 6.The nominee for Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, testified of her own “eerie” feeling coming to the Capitol complex after “how truly disturbing it was” to see the attack on the building unfold. Biden’s nominee for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, vowed to get to the bottom of the “horrifying” siege.The start of the new session of Congress was also forcing lawmakers to come to terms with the post-Trump era, a transfer of power that Trump’s mob of supporters tried to prevent after he urged them to storm the Capitol as Congress was tallying the Electoral College vote confirming Biden’s election.Seven Republican senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tried to overturn Biden’s election during the Electoral College tally. Cruz was presiding over the Senate Tuesday while McConnell delivered his blistering remarks.Hawley continued to embrace his role in the opposition, saying on Tuesday that he will block a quick confirmation of Mayorkas, the Homeland Security nominee, to protest Biden's immigration plan to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people. Hawley said Mayorkas “has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border.”As they begin the year newly in the minority, Republican senators face a daunting choice of whether to convict Trump of inciting the insurrection, the first impeachment trial of a president no longer in office — but one who continues to hold great sway over the party's voters.Some Republicans want to halt the impeachment trial. Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn was among those Republicans casting doubt on the legal ability of the Senate to convict a president no longer in office, though legal scholars differ on the issue.“It’s never happened before and maybe that’s for a good reason,” he said.The House impeached Trump last week on the sole charge, incitement of insurrection, making him the only president to be twice impeached. A protester died during the riot and a police officer died later of injuries; three other people involved died of medical emergencies. He was first impeached in 2019 over relations with Ukraine and was acquitted in 2020 by the Senate.The three new Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California, are to be sworn into office Wednesday, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss planning.Warnock and Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents in this month's runoff elections. Georgia's secretary of state certified the election results Tuesday. Padilla was tapped by California's governor to fill the remainder of Harris' Senate term.___Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-provoked-capitol-siege-says-senate-majority-leader-mitch-mcconnell-101611109232493.html
20-01-2021||World||Capitol rioters hold out long-shot hope for a Donald Trump pardon||In what could be the longest of legal long shots, several of those arrested for storming the U.S. Capitol are holding out hope that President Donald Trump will use some of his last hours in office to grant the rioters a full pardon.Longtime advisers to Trump are urging him against such a move but the rioters contend their argument is compelling: They went to the Capitol to support Trump, and now that they are facing charges carrying up to 20 years in prison, it’s time for Trump to support them.“I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there. So I was doing what he asked us to do,” said Jenna Ryan, a Dallas-area real-estate agent who took a private jet to the Jan. 6 rally and ensuing riot to disrupt the certification of the election of President-elect Joe Biden.Ryan — who prosecutors say posted a now-deleted video of herself marching to the Capitol with the words, “We are going to f---ing go in here. Life or death” — told Dallas television station KTVT: “I think we all deserve a pardon. I’m facing a prison sentence. I think I do not deserve that.”Perhaps the most high-profile rioter, the so-called “QAnon Shaman” who broke into the Senate chamber and posed at the dais with a spear, wearing a horned fur hat and animal skins, is also pleading for a pardon.Jacob Chansley’s lawyer told The Associated Press that he reached out to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about a possible pardon on behalf of the Arizona man, acknowledging it might be a reach but that there’s nothing to lose in seeking one.If Chansley is not granted a pardon, attorney Albert Watkins said, it could offer the added benefit of further awakening his client to the fact that his devotion to Trump has not been reciprocated, comparing it to being a jilted lover or even a member of a cult.“The only thing that was missing at the Capitol was the president, our president, stirring up the Kool-Aid with a big spoon,” Watkins said.Dominic Pezzola, a Rochester, New York, man and far-right Proud Boys supporter who was seen in a video using a clear police shield to shatter a Capitol window, also explored seeking a pardon but his attorney said there was not enough time to make it happen.“To believe the president is going to carte blanche issue these pardons is kind of a fantasy,” defense attorney Mike Scibetta told the AP. “I think it would cast a shadow on his own impeachment defense.”Trump, who has long reveled in suspense, was expected to spend his last full day in office issuing a flurry of pardons to as many as 100 people, two people briefed on the plans told the AP.But if Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz has his say, the more than 150 rioters arrested so far and the thousands more suspected should not be among them.Dershowitz, who represented Trump in his first impeachment last year, told the AP he has not been approached by any of the rioters about seeking a pardon but even if he had, “it would be wrong to pardon rioters who committed crimes.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who speaks often with Trump, was among the confidantes urging the president not to go there.“I don’t care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, you breached the security of the Capitol, you interrupted a joint session of Congress, you tried to intimidate us all,” Graham said on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” “You should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and to seek a pardon of these people would be wrong.He warned that such a move “would destroy President Trump.”Pardons normally go through an extensive vetting process within the Department of Justice. The Office of the Pardon Attorney, which handles these reviews, did not respond to a request for comment, but former federal prosecutors said Trump giving clemency to those at the Capitol would be highly unusual.Such pardons would be “a slap in the face to the law enforcement officers who protected the Capitol and our leaders who were inside,” said Joe Brown, who until last year was a U.S. attorney in Texas.Not all of those charged in the Jan. 6 riot are in the market for a pardon. Victoria Bergeson of Groton, Connecticut, who faces charges of violating curfew and unlawful entry wants her case to “just go away” but sees accepting a pardon “as an admission that she knowingly did something wrong,” said her attorney Samuel Bogash.“She does not want to do that due to a justifiable fear of how the public would perceive it,” he said. “She is already being trolled online.”Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said Trump’s use of his clemency powers has set up a “spoils system” for his allies and pardoning the insurrectionists would just be a more extreme version.“That this president might be willing, even to pardon those who rose up against the United States," he said, “would be the ultimate statement of his perversion of the purpose behind pardons.”___Bleiberg reported from Dallas, Mustian from New York. AP White House reporter Jill Colvin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-rioters-hold-out-long-shot-hope-for-a-donald-trump-pardon-101611108962869.html
20-01-2021||World||Italy PM Conte survives close Senate vote, vows to forge ahead||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte narrowly won a confidence vote in the upper house Senate on Tuesday, allowing him to remain in office after a junior partner quit his coalition last week in the midst of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.However, Conte failed to secure an absolute majority, meaning he now heads a minority government that will struggle to implement its policy programme at a time of severe national emergency.Having overcome a similar confidence motion in the lower house on Monday, Conte won in the 321-seat Senate by 156 to 140, with 16 abstentions.Looking to head off speculation he might resign following the close vote, Conte said he would seek to bolster his support in parliament. In the meantime, he promised to focus on tackling the country's twin health and economic crises."Italy doesn't have a minute to lose," he said on Twitter.The small Italia Viva party, headed by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, abandoned the cabinet in a row over Conte's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent recession. It abstained on Tuesday, leaving the door open for a possible return to the coalition if its policy demands are met.Conte and his main partners, the 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), appeared unwilling to kiss and make up.Addressing the Italia Viva senators, Conte said, "You have chosen the path of aggression and media attacks... this is not the best choice for the interests of the country."Hoping to entice centrist and liberal lawmakers currently outside the coalition, Conte has promised to revamp his policy agenda and shake up his cabinet, saying he wants to modernise Italy and speed up implementation of an economic recovery plan.In the event, only two members of the opposition centre-right Forza Italia party switched sides on Tuesday, while a number of unaligned politicians who had come under heavy pressure to help the government ended up voting against Conte.Italy has had several minority governments in recent times, but history has shown they are highly vulnerable to ambush in parliament and risk collapse at any divisive vote."There will be lots of drama and it will be hard to get anything done," said Giovanni Orsina, head of LUISS university's school of government in Rome.He predicted the government would collapse in the summer, when a six-month moratorium on national elections kicks in ahead of the end of President Sergio Mattarella's seven-year mandate.Analysts say many lawmakers want to avoid an early ballot, fearing they will not be re-elected next time around. As a result, some of them played it safe this week and helped Conte stay in office. But as soon as the moratorium kicks in, removing any threat of a vote, they would move to oust Conte and try to form a new administration, Orsina said.

The existing lockdown runs until Jan. 31."Now is the time to take preventive measures against the threat of this virus," Merkel told reporters after a meeting with the premiers of Germany's 16 federal states.New infections have been decreasing in recent days and pressure on intensive care units has eased slightly, but virologists are worried about the possible spread of more infectious variants of the virus.Merkel said all countries in Europe must make similar efforts to fight the pandemic. Otherwise, Germany may consider restricting border entry to avoid highly transmissible strains being brought in from abroad.She and the state leaders also agreed that companies must allow employees to work from home until March 15 where possible, Merkel said.Aid for hard-hit companies is to be improved, and retailers' writedowns on seasonal goods - which could include winter coats or ski equipment - will be taken into account.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen by 11,369 to 2.05 million, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The death toll was up 989 to 47,622.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-lockdown-to-feb-14-on-fears-of-covid-19-variants-101611108252996.html
20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump ends where he began, fighting release of tax returns||President Donald Trump’s lawyers made a preemptive move to stop congressional Democrats from obtaining his tax returns once President-elect Joe Biden takes power, asking a judge for an Inauguration Day hearing in a case that could threaten the secrecy of his closely guarded financial information.The Democrats in the last Congress have run out of time in their demand for Trump’s tax information from the Treasury Department, but the new Congress could re-issue it in the coming days. At the same time, Biden will take power, making it possible that the Justice Department could reverse its position in the case and simply hand over the records.The lawyers requested a hearing on Wednesday before a Washington federal judge to discuss next steps in the litigation. They said they were hoping the judge would guarantee them at least 72 hours’ notice before the new administration hands over any documents to Congress, giving them a window to block the handover in court.If the House got Trump’s tax information, Democrats could vote to release the material or a summary to all 435 members of the House, effectively making the information public.The last-minute legal maneuvering stems from a case that began in 2019, the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Ways and Means sued to enforce its subpoenas for six years’ worth of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, after the Trump administration refused to turn over the information.Trump’s lawyers said they contracted both the House committee and the Justice Department “in an attempt to resolve this issue.” The House declined to say whether it would renew its request for the tax returns, while the Justice Department said it was “not in a position at this time to speak for the incoming administration,” according to the Trump lawyers’ court filing.A lawyer for the House Democrats didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Meanwhile, two other tax cases -- involving the president’s accountants and bankers -- reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress could not compel the release of the financial records, at least for the time being. The cases were sent back to the lower courts to assess whether Congress should narrow the scope of the information it sought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ends-where-he-began-fighting-release-of-tax-returns-101611107358948.html

"It is hard sometimes to remember, but that is how we heal. It is important to do that as a nation. That is why we are here today. Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all that we have lost."Biden and Harris held their first inauguration-related event in Washington on Tuesday night (local time). They were accompanied by their spouses, the incoming first lady and gentleman Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff.Speaking at the memorial, Harris said she hopes Americans emerge from the ordeal of the pandemic "with a new wisdom -- to cherish simple moments, to imagine new possibilities and to open our hearts just a little bit more to one another.""We gather tonight, a nation in mourning, to pay tribute to the lives we have lost: a grandmother or grandfather who was our whole world; a parent, partner, sibling or friend who we still cannot accept is no longer here," she said. "And for many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together."There are 400 lights illuminating the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in tribute to the more than 400,000 people who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 in the US, CNN reported.Hundreds of towns, cities and communities across the country plan to join in the solemn tribute with lighting ceremonies of their own at buildings from the Empire State Building in New York to the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington.Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who in November became the first Black American to earn the rank of cardinal, delivered the invocation. Gospel singer Yolanda Adams sang "Hallelujah," and Lori Marie Key, a Covid-19 ward nurse from Michigan, sang "Amazing Grace."

20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden returns to Washington DC to be sworn in as the 46th US President||Four years after he left the Beltway for his hometown in Delaware, Joe Biden returned to Washington DC a day before his swearing-in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday with the message of unity and the enormous task of healing a bitterly divided country.“I am honoured to be your next President and Commander in Chief,” Biden, 78, told his fellow Delawarians before boarding a private plane for Joint Air Force Base Andrews on his way to Washington DC. “I will always be a proud son of the state of Delaware,” he said.In public life for nearly five decades ever since he was elected as the youngest United States Senator from Delaware in 1973, Biden noted that history is in the making as he will be sworn in as the President and Indian-origin Kamala Harris as the Vice President.“My family and I, about to return again to Washington, to meet a Black woman of South Asian descent, to be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States,” Biden said.Harris, 56, will be the first ever woman Vice President and also the first African American and India-origin person to occupy the second most powerful position in the US.During his short speech, Biden became emotional with tears rolling down his face. "This is kind of emotional," Biden said as we wiped a tear from his eye. "It's deeply personal that our journey to Washington starts here," he said, talking about the national guard building named after his son Beau.Biden said that 12 years ago Barack Obama, a Black man, greeted him at the train platform before he became his Vice President, and now he departs to "meet a Black woman of South Asian descent" to become President and Vice President.He was accompanying the incoming First Lady Jill Biden, several grandchildren and family members, as well as son Hunter Biden who was holding his baby Beau. From there he drove down to the National Mall where he visited a memorial to Covid deaths at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. More than four lakh Americans have lost their lives in one year of the pandemic.At the Covid-19 memorial, he was joined by his wife Jill, Vice President-elect Harris, and the incoming Second Gentlemen Douglas Emhoff. He was also joined by Cardinal Wilton Gregory, Archbishop of Washington, who delivered the Invocation; Yolanda Adams, a nationally-recognized gospel singer who sang Hallelujah; and Lori Marie Key, with Saint Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan who sang Amazing Grace.Earlier, he thanked the residents of his home state Delaware. “My fellow Delawareans, on behalf of the entire Biden family, we will never be able to fully express what you mean to us. In our family, the values we share, the character we strive for, the way we view the world — it all comes from home, from Delaware,” Biden said before he departed from his hometown for the national capital.“The state that gave my mother and father a home and a livelihood when they needed it the most. The state that made my brothers and sister and I understand that we could do whatever we dreamed. That gave me a chance when I was just a kid, and elected me and believed in me ever since,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-returns-to-washington-dc-to-be-sworn-in-as-the-46th-us-president-101611104427809.html

The latest increase tops the previous record of 1,564 fatalities set on January 13.According to government data, 91,470 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of testing positive for the coronavirus disease, giving the country the world's fifth-highest death toll.Additionally, 33,355 new positive tests for Covid-19 were registered by the department over the past 24 hours, taking the country's case total past 3.46 million.The United Kingdom's four nations are currently under various degrees of lockdown measures as ministers look to curb the rapid spread of the new Covid-19 strain, which is thought to be up to 70 percent more transmissible.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced earlier on Tuesday that he would be self-isolating for the next six days after receiving an alert by the National Health Service's Covid-19 contact tracing application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-registers-largest-single-day-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-to-1610-101611104399054.html

20-01-2021||World||Bells and candlelight to honor 400,000 Covid-19 dead on eve of Trump's departure||From the Lincoln Memorial to the Empire State building, landmarks across the United States will be illuminated on Tuesday evening as part of a ceremony led by President-elect Joe Biden to honor the nearly 400,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19.The commemoration comes just hours before President Donald Trump leaves the White House and hands over a country in crisis. The ceremony, spearheaded by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, will be the federal government's first nod to the staggering death toll from the pandemic.Biden and Harris will lead a lighting ceremony at the Reflecting Pool at the Lincoln Memorial at 5:15 p.m. ET (2215 GMT), followed by a moment of silence and 400 bell tolls at the National Cathedral to symbolically honor the Covid-19 dead."Hundreds of towns, cities, tribes, landmarks, and communities all across the country have committed to joining the tribute in a national moment of unity," Biden's inaugural committee said in a statement.The United States surpassed 24 million Covid-19 infections on Tuesday and was on track to pass 400,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. The country has recorded more than 200,000 new cases and 3,220 deaths on average over the last seven days. Among the other landmarks participating in the lighting ceremony were the Empire State building in New York City and the Space Needle in Seattle, according to the statement. The inaugural committee said it was encouraging Americans to light candles in their windows and churches to ring their bells in a show of unity.Local officials from Miami, Florida, to San Diego, California, said buildings in their cities would be lit for the occasion.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City was inviting the public to light a candle on its front steps on Tuesday evening before a solemn bell toll.NEW CHAPTER IN PANDEMIC RESPONSEThe ceremony marks the beginning of a new era in the country's battle against Covid-19 under Biden, who has pledged to make coronavirus relief a top priority when he takes office on Wednesday under unprecedented security measures in the nation's capital.Biden will inherit a grieving and sickened nation from Trump, who critics say was to blame for a disjointed and ineffectual response to the pandemic, resulting in the United States having the highest Covid-19 death toll in the world.On Tuesday, his last full day as president, Trump had no public events scheduled, although US Vice President Mike Pence was planning to convene the White House Coronavirus Task Force for its last meeting under his watch.Many of Biden's policy plans fly in the face of the Trump administration's approach to combating the pandemic. They include a mask mandate that would apply to federal properties, planes and buses and a recommitment to the World Health Organization after Trump's withdrawal from the agency.Biden will also face the daunting task of overseeing the nation's Covid-19 vaccine distribution and administration. The United States is trailing in its vaccination goal, with only 12.3 million shots administered out of more than 31 million distributed as of Jan. 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.States, tasked with rolling out their own vaccine programs, have lamented a lack of funding and support from the federal government. Some localities say they do not have adequate supply to meet demand.Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday warned New York City will run out of vaccine doses as soon as Thursday and will be forced to cancel many appointments if it does not get resupplied quickly."We will have literally nothing left to give as of Friday," de Blasio told a news conference.Biden has said he will seek a $1.9 trillion spending proposal that includes funding for accelerating the distribution of coronavirus vaccines, and Democrats, who now hold a slight majority in Congress, hope to prioritize state and local aid in the next stimulus deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bells-and-candlelight-to-honor-400-000-covid-19-dead-on-eve-of-trump-s-departure-101611102061089.html
20-01-2021||World||US, India have 'very strong' potential to work together, says State Secretary nominee Blinken||India and the United States have "very strong" potential to work together and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a "very strong" advocate of renewable energy and different technologies, said US Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken on Tuesday.At his nomination confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, Blinken said that India has been a bipartisan success story of the US successive administrations, adding that there are "many ways in which we can deepen that corporation"."India has been a bipartisan success story of our successive administrations. It started towards the end of the Clinton administration... During the Obama administration, we deepened cooperation on defence procurement and information sharing and the Trump administration carried that forward including its concept of Indo-Pacific and to make sure we were working with India so that no country in the region including China could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism. There are many ways we can deepen that cooperation that successive administrations have put us on," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."One area that has a lot of promise and necessity is Climate. Prime Minister Modi has been a very strong advocate of renewable energy and different technologies. I think there is very strong potential for our countries to work together," he added.The hearing comes a day ahead of US President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to take oath as the 46th president of the United States.In November, US President-elect Biden nominated Antony Blinken, one of his closest and longest-serving foreign policy advisers, as Secretary of State to serve in his administration.Blinken, 58, has been advising Biden on foreign policy for years.As a run-up to the presidential election, Blinken made some statements that give a sense of his approach towards India.On August 15, Blinken participated in a panel discussion on Indo-US ties. Addressing Indian American Democrats on India's Independence Day at the US-India Relations and Indian Americans in Joe Biden's America virtual event, Blinken affirmed how Biden would be a champion of India-US relations.He had said that Joe Biden sees India and the US as natural partners and that the vision, he will help to make real as the president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-have-very-strong-potential-to-work-together-says-state-secretary-nominee-blinken-101611103046876.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden intelligence pick favors 'aggressive' stance on China threat||The United States should take an "aggressive stance" toward the threat posed by the aggressive and assertive China that it faces today, Avril Haines, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for the top US intelligence job, said on Tuesday.Biden's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) also said she thought it would be some time before Tehran returned to strict compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and that the Democratic Biden administration might itself return to the agreement, which outgoing Republican President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018.Haines, a former CIA deputy director, said her priorities include restoring trust and confidence within the US intelligence community, which Trump at times denigrated, as well as among the American people.Pressed by both Republican and Democratic senators on the importance of the Chinese intelligence threat, Haines said she would make it a priority to devote more resources to China."Our approach to China has to evolve and essentially meet the reality of the particularly assertive and aggressive China that we see today," she said. "I do support an aggressive stance, in a sense, to deal with the challenge that we are facing."Haines also told the committee that US agencies have "not solved the issue" of deterring cyber attacks and have not yet figured out how to handle such asymmetric threats.She said President-elect Biden has indicated the United States should find a way to impose costs on attackers for the recent SolarWinds attacks, attributed to Russia, on U.S. government agencies and businesses. Russia has denied responsibility.Speaking to the Senate Intelligence Committee that will vote on her nomination, Haines drew an implicit contrast to the Trump administration, which at times has been accused of politicizing intelligence agency findings."The DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power — even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult," she said. "The DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics — ever."Haines' confirmation was expected to move rapidly, a Democratic congressional official said, though some activists have questioned her role in helping to manage the CIA's response to probes of its past use of harsh interrogation techniques.In a possible effort to neutralize that issue, Haines told the panel she would not permit their use and that she believed "waterboarding in fact constitutes torture under the law."In a written answer to panel questions, she said she believed that post-Sept. 11, 2001, interrogation methods used on suspected extremists "included torture, which violates US commitments and obligations" under US laws and international conventions.Senator Mark Warner, the panel's incoming chairman, praised Haines in a statement. He said the committee would schedule a vote on her nomination as soon as possible, and urged the full Senate to confirm her "without any unnecessary delay."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-intelligence-pick-favors-aggressive-stance-on-china-threat-101611101678177.html
20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump leaves town an outcast, trailed by Covid-19 pandemic, job losses||Donald Trump departs Washington on Wednesday with Americans more politically divided and more likely to be out of work than when he arrived, while awaiting trial for his second impeachment -- an ignominious end to one of the most turbulent presidencies in American history.Trump intends to leave in the morning for his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, arriving before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. There, the ex-president will begin his post-presidency life attended at least temporarily by a handful of former White House staffers.The last president who chose not to attend his successor’s inauguration was Andrew Johnson in 1869, another impeached leader. While Trump’s absence will break more than a century of precedent that has reinforced the peaceful transfer of power in the US, Biden has said it’s a “good thing” Trump won’t observe his swearing-in.Biden arrived in Washington on Tuesday, where Trump isn’t expected to give him a meeting, according to people familiar with the matter, even though the president-elect is staying at Blair House across the street. All of the nation’s other living ex-presidents except Jimmy Carter, who is 96, will join Biden at Arlington National Cemetery after the inauguration to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.The outgoing president has been transformed into a political pariah in Washington among all but his most loyal supporters in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, which was inspired by Trump’s refusal to accept defeat and recognize Biden’s victory in the November election.Unemployment is more than a third higher than when he entered office, and more than 400,000 Americans have died of Covid-19.Even with the damage inflicted by the pandemic, US equity markets retained their swagger and posted solid returns during the Trump years. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 66% through Friday; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 135%.Trump has left the door open for a second act in national politics, buoyed by the 74 million people who voted for his re-election despite his failure to contain the US coronavirus outbreak.Yet his popularity has fallen considerably since the election and the Capitol riot, however. Several polls have shown that as he leaves office, record low numbers of Americans -- less than 40%, according to an average by RealClearPolitics -- approve of his performance as president.The final Gallup poll of Trump’s presidency, released Monday, found him with 34% support on Monday -- tied with Carter and George W. Bush, who left office with the country mired in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and Americans disillusioned with the Iraq War.Trump’s attempts during his final weeks in office to tout his achievements, including his border wall and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East, were drowned out by the fallout from the riot. The violent storming of the Capitol left five people dead and showed the danger of Trump’s weeks-long campaign to whip his supporters into a frenzy over the election outcome.Three quarters of Americans, including more than half of Republicans, say Trump bears some responsibility for the attack, according to a Pew Research Center survey.Military PresenceThe Washington that Trump leaves behind now looks more like a military base than the seat of the world’s longest-standing democracy. Thousands of National Guard troops patrol the streets, while the Capitol, White House and large areas around them are fenced off to protect against another attack by Trump’s supporters.And Trump can’t altogether escape the place himself. Rather than being fully unburdened from the pressures of the presidency upon leaving office, he’ll have to eventually defend himself in his historic second impeachment trial in the Senate over his incitement of the Capitol riot.Barack Obama, by comparison, spent part of his first few weeks as a former president kite surfing in the Caribbean with British business mogul Richard Branson.The tumult is a fitting coda for a presidency that constantly pushed the boundaries of normal and exacerbated the nation’s political and racial divisions. Trump’s ability to instigate an attack on the Capitol by his loyalists with baseless claims about the election illustrated how, wittingly or not, he unleashed dark forces that previously inhabited the fringes of American life.9/11 Every DayThe coronavirus pandemic, which Trump all but ignored as he sought to overturn his election defeat, has grown much worse in the final weeks of his presidency, with the recorded death toll reaching 400,000 on Tuesday.Daily US deaths from Covid-19 have topped 4,000 multiple times since the start of the new year -- more dead Americans, each day, than the number killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Hospitals across the country are bursting with patients suffering from the disease.Trump claims the development of a coronavirus vaccine as one of his administration’s greatest achievements, but its rollout has been beset by distribution and bureaucratic failures. After top administration officials promised that more than 100 million doses of vaccine would be delivered by the end of the year, only about 15.6 million shots had been administered as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker.Trump has deflected blame, as he did throughout the crisis, instead faulting governors for not inoculating more people, faster. “They’re calling it a medical miracle,” Trump said of his administration’s vaccine effort in a speech last week near a segment of border wall in Alamo, Texas.It will be the incoming Biden administration’s responsibility to speed up vaccinations and revive an economy still reeling from pandemic-related shutdowns. The president-elect has said 100 million people will receive a shot in the first 100 days of his term, a goal Trump administration officials call a low-ball figure since the nation is up to almost 900,000 doses a day already.Jobless Rate HigherAt its peak, the Trump economy could boast one of the best job markets in decades. The unemployment rate was at a 50-year low, and women, people of color and the disabled all shared in the gains.But as a result of the pandemic, he leaves behind a jobless rate almost double what it was a year ago -- and substantially higher than when he took office -- with more than 10 million Americans unemployed. And as the pandemic rages on, people continue to lose their jobs.In the week ended Jan. 9, nearly 1 million applications for state unemployment insurance were filed -- as well as more than a quarter-million for a federal program covering those not traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits, like gig workers.The Covid-19 crisis has also left a swath of the country struggling to pay bills and put food on the table. Almost 30 million Americans reported sometimes or often not having enough to eat, according to a Census Bureau survey in mid-December, and more than 17 million had little or no confidence in their ability to pay next month’s rent.Taken together, the data show how the pandemic that crushed Trump’s chances of re-election will also serve as Biden’s foremost challenge as president.Garden of HeroesTrump enters his post-White House life with key figures from the world of politics unwilling to associate with him following the Capitol riot. He has been cut off from major social media platforms, including Twitter, which will hurt his ability to grab the spotlight once he is out of office.Before departing, the president issued a handful of last-minute executive actions. They include an order to create a statue garden for people Trump designated as American heroes, ranging from presidents to game show host Alex Trebek, and an order to discourage government agencies from seeking criminal prosecutions of regulatory violations. Both orders could be overruled by Biden.Trump’s White House even released a new history of the country’s founding, written by a commission Trump appointed last year. The report, published on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, defended the nation’s founders’ handling of slavery and argued that modern identity politics “creates new hierarchies as unjust as the old hierarchies of the antebellum South.”He’s expected to issue a number of pardons on Tuesday, though White House Counsel Pat Cipollone has resisted preparing preemptive grants of clemency for the president himself, family members or White House aides, according to people familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, Trump has struggled to find legal representation for the upcoming impeachment trial, with some attorneys who represented him during his first impeachment no longer willing to associate with him.He won’t have much time to cobble together a team. The Senate could begin its trial soon after Biden takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.If convicted, Congress may bar him from running for federal office ever again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-leaves-town-an-outcast-trailed-by-covid-19-pandemic-job-losses-101611101265007.html
20-01-2021||World||As WHO fumes at western drugmakers, China fills void on Covid-19 vaccines||For months, the World Health Organization has called on countries to come together to ensure a fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines among rich and poor nations. Now it’s starting to lose patience.On Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said drug manufacturers had prioritized regulatory approval in rich countries, where profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to get the greenlight from the global health body. He said that could delay distribution through Covax, a WHO-backed initiative that aims to supply vaccines to poorer countries.“The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure,” Tedros said. “Even as they speak the language of equitable access, some countries and companies continue to prioritize bilateral deals -- going around Covax, driving up prices and attempting to jump to the front of the queue. This is wrong.”The WHO’s struggles have opened the door for China to start ramping up its vaccine diplomacy, with foreign minister Wang Yi pledging last week to hand out more than a million doses during a swing through Southeast Asia. That amounted to a geopolitical win just before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has vowed to put the US back in the WHO following Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the organization last year.“China’s ‘mask diplomacy’ in 2020 is being followed in 2021 by ‘vaccine diplomacy,’” said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “The aims remain the same: to win friends and influence countries in Southeast Asia and bury the memory that the pandemic started in China a year ago.”Antony Blinken, Biden’s pick for secretary of state, told lawmakers on Tuesday the US is preparing to join Covax and look at “how we can help make sure the vaccine is equitably distributed.” Biden officially takes over on Wednesday in the US.China’s vaccines have received some high-profile endorsements, with Indonesian President Joko Widodo receiving the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. shot on live television last week in the world’s fourth-most populous nation despite inconsistent efficacy data. Brazil also began distributing 6 million Sinovac doses on Monday -- an about-face for President Jair Bolsonaro, who had been an outspoken critic of Chinese vaccines last year.‘Can No Longer Wait’Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who last month said his country wouldn’t use any vaccines that weren’t approved by the WHO, last week reversed course and accepted one million vaccine doses from China. He cited widespread use in places like Indonesia, Egypt and China, noting that Wang had received the vaccine and is still “in good health and can travel places.”“For the need to defend our nation and protect our people from this deadly epidemic, we can no longer wait,” Hun Sen said in a message published in a cabinet newsletter on Friday. “We are reversing what I said last time about accepting only vaccines recognized by the World Health Organization.”Because they lack regulatory bodies with the capacity to scrutinize scientific data, many developing countries have traditionally relied on the WHO’s list of approved vaccines to know which shots they can permit for local vaccination drives.At the end of 2020, the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine was the first, and so far only, shot to receive emergency validation from the WHO since the outbreak began a year ago. With no low-income countries producing their own vaccines, richer nations have secured 85% of Pfizer’s vaccine and all of Moderna Inc.’s, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.While China has pledged to support the WHO’s efforts, its vaccines are not among those procured by Covax. A spokesperson for Sinovac said the company has began submitting data to the WHO for a pre-qualification of its coronavirus vaccine, known as CoronaVac. A group of WHO inspectors has also traveled to China and will inspect its production facilities after completing quarantine, the spokesperson said.Covax still plans to distribute 2 billion doses around the world by the end of this year, with enough to protect 3% of the population in all participating countries by July, according to an emailed response to questions. The facility has said it will consider procuring any candidate vaccine that meets global standards set by the WHO.Among the 11 candidates that it can tap for distribution, two -- Moderna Inc.’s shot and the one developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford -- are ready for rollout and are being administered in countries like the U.S. and U.K. It’s unclear why Covax has not yet started distributing those vaccines as well.Tedros’s statements castigating companies for prioritizing rich countries where they can make the most profit indicates that the global health body sees the delay as stemming from the companies.AstraZeneca said on Dec. 30 that it was seeking the WHO’s greenlight, known as the body’s Emergency Use Listing, “for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low and middle-income countries.” A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what stage the process is at.Covax’s rollout could begin “as early as February pending favorable regulatory outcomes and the readiness of health systems and national regulatory systems in individual participating economies,” said Iryna Mazur, a spokesperson at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading Covax.Thailand bought 2 million doses from Sinovac, and China promised to donate a total of 800,000 doses to the Philippines and Myanmar during Wang’s diplomatic push last week.During a visit to Manila, Wang drew praise from Philippine officials after committing to completing China-funded infrastructure projects including a $400 million bridge and a $940 million cargo railway project.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week chided a group of senators who scrutinized the government’s plans to buy Sinovac, after previously threatening to terminate a Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S. if it failed to deliver at least 20 million vaccines immediately. “No vaccine, no stay here,” Duterte said last month of the military deal -- a threat he has made before without following through on.“Coronavirus vaccines have clearly become a political football in the increasing U.S.-China cold war,” said Paul Chambers of Naresuan University’s Center of Asean Community Studies, who has researched geopolitics in Southeast Asia for about two decades. “The daunting delay in the launching of Covax is exactly the opportunity that China is using to initiate and expand its supply of Sinovac to developing countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-who-fumes-at-western-drugmakers-china-fills-void-on-covid-19-vaccines-101611100877542.html
20-01-2021||World||US to join Paris deal, lift Muslim travel ban||On the first day of his presidency, Joe Biden will roll back some of President Donald Trump’s most controversial policies — withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on climate crisis and restrictions on immigration from some Muslim-majority countries — his incoming chief of staff said.Biden will sign executive orders to get the US back to the Paris pact and rescind the travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries, which will be among roughly a dozen actions the President-elect will take on his first day in the White House, incoming chief of staff Ron Klain said on Saturday in a memo to senior staff, outlining a 10-day plan of action.“We face four overlapping and compounding crises: The Covid-19 crisis, the resulting economic crisis, the climate crisis, and a racial equity crisis,” Klain wrote. “All of these crises demand urgent action. In his first 10 days in office, President-elect Biden will take decisive action to address these four crises, prevent other urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world.”The other orders that Biden is likely to sign include the launch of a “100 masking challenge” that will mandate masks on federal property and interstate travel, and extending the pause on student loan payments and actions meant to prevent evictions and foreclosures — all related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden will take oath as the US President on January 20 amid unprecedented security with more than 25,000 National Guard troops deployed in Washington DC in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol on January 6. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of “armed protests” in the days leading up to the inauguration.President Trump announced in June 2017 that the US will exit the Paris Agreement — a legally binding international treaty on climate change — saying it disadvantaged the country, blunted its competitive edge, and favoured India and China.America’s return to the Paris Agreement was one of Biden’s key campaign promises.So was revoking of the Muslim ban.Just a week after his inauguration in 2017, Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning foreign nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries — including Iran, Iraq and Yemen — from entering the US. It was struck down by the courts, but a much-diluted version remains in force.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-join-paris-deal-lift-muslim-travel-ban-101610914114610.html
