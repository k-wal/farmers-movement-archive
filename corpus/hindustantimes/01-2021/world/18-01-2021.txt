In an arrest warrant filed late Sunday, the federal agency said that it is seeking Riley June Williams on charges related to the breach of Capitol, adding that the feds are also investigating a claim that the woman stole a laptop or hard drive from Pelosi’s office.According to the affidavit, a witness, described as a former romantic partner of Williams, dialled FBI’s telephone tip line, claiming that he saw Williams in video footage taken from inside the US Capitol building. The caller said that Williams “intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence service.” The witness further added that the plan fell through "for unknown reasons" and that Williams "still has the computer device or destroyed it."The FBI has reviewed a video report from ITV News, a British television network, in which Williams, wearing a green t-shirt and brown trench coat, is believed to be present. The agency stated that the woman can be seen physically directing other intruders to proceed up a staircase by repeatedly yelling “Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs.” The agency has confirmed with the Capitol police that the staircase depicted in the video leads to Pelosi’s office.“It appears that WILLIAMS has fled. According to local law enforcement officers in Harrisburg, WILLIAMS’ mother stated that that WILLIAMS packed a bag and left her home and told her mother she would be gone for a couple of weeks,” the affidavit says.The woman did not provide any information to her mother about her intended destination and changed her telephone number. She has also reportedly deleted her social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and Parler. Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff had earlier confirmed that a laptop was stolen from a conference room but was only used for presentations.A laptop from a conference room was stolen.

18-01-2021||World||China calls Pompeo 'Mr. Liar'; dismisses charge against Wuhan’s bio-lab||China on Monday vented out its anger against outgoing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling him "Mr. Liar" and dismissed as "conspiracies and lies" the allegations by the State Department that the COVID-19 may have emerged from Wuhan’s bio-lab and had links to the Chinese military.China, which faced global criticism after the virus became a pandemic claiming over two million lives, has been vehemently asserting that the coronavirus has emerged in several places in the world, while it only reported it first.But Beijing is more resentful of outgoing US President Donald Trump and Pompeo for alleging that the virus may have emerged from the premier Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which researches Zoonotic diseases.A latest document issued by the US State department reinforcing its previous allegation that the virus may have emerged from the WIV, coinciding with the visit of a WHO inquiry team of scientists to Wuhan has further riled Beijing.Reacting angrily to the US document, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing here on Monday that "the statement and the list are full of conspiracies and lies, which are consistent with certain US officials who have dealt with the pandemic in a passive way and constantly shifted the blame to others. The list is another US-made list of lies".The US document said "for more than a year, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has systematically prevented a transparent and thorough investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic’s origin, choosing instead to devote enormous resources to deceit and disinformation"."The US government does not know exactly where, when, or how the COVID-19 virus - known as SARS-CoV-2 - was transmitted initially to humans. We have not determined whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, China," it said."The virus could have emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, spreading in a pattern consistent with a natural epidemic," it said."Alternatively, a laboratory accident could resemble a natural outbreak if the initial exposure included only a few individuals and was compounded by asymptomatic infection. Scientists in China have researched animal-derived coronaviruses under conditions that increased the risk for accidental and potentially unwitting exposure," it said."The US government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illnesses."This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli’s public claim that there was ‘zero infection’ among the WIV’s staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses," it said.Significantly, China has honoured Shi who has earned the moniker of 'Bat Woman' for her passionate research into bats and viruses as an "advanced worker of the Chinese Academy of Sciences".The honour coincides with the arrival of the WHO team which is expected to visit the WIV.Shi now has alleged in the official media here that mink, not the bat or pangolin could be a possible host of the origin of the novel coronavirus, and called on the world to probe samples from more susceptible animals to determine when the virus moved to humans.The state department document also alleged that "for many years the United States has publicly raised concerns about China’s past biological weapons work, which Beijing has neither documented nor demonstrably eliminated, despite its clear obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention".Pompeo’s latest tweets against China on a host of issues, including its political system, official media, Beijing’s response to COVID-19, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea, "fully showed that some US politicians ignored public safety and lives, go against science and are obsessed with making propaganda about conspiracies and spreading 'the political virus'," Hua said."This is also the final madness staged by Pompeo, this Mr. Liar," she said."What I want to emphasise is if the US truly respects science and facts, it should open the Fort Detrick laboratory and make questions about its over 200 overseas labs open to the public, while inviting WHO experts to look into the origins and answer the international community's suspicions," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-calls-pompeo-mr-liar-dismisses-charge-against-wuhan-s-biolab-101610987958538.html

There is no threat to the public," the US Secret Service said on Twitter.The lockdown follows the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump, some calling for the death of Republican Vice President Mike Pence as he presided over the certification of Democrat Biden's November election victory.The Capitol Police earlier said that as a precautionary measure its acting chief shut down the complex, which consists of the Capitol, its grounds and several buildings.The city's fire department posted on Twitter that firefighters put out a fire outside near the Capitol complex."There were no injuries," the department said. "This accounts for smoke that many have seen."Participants in the rehearsal for Biden's inauguration were held in the Capitol rotunda and other indoor areas, according to a Reuters witness.

It faces a multi-faceted threat from several armed groups, including the Taliban and other movements, seeking the province’s secession from Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-pitches-for-border-markets-with-afghanistan-iran-101610987725065.html
18-01-2021||World||Biden aims for unifying speech at daunting moment for US||President-elect Joe Biden will take the stage for his inaugural address at perhaps the most difficult starting point for a president since Franklin Roosevelt began his first term by assuring a nation scarred by the Great Depression that “we have nothing to fear but fear itself.”But memorable turns of phrase like Roosevelt's are more the exception than the rule when it comes to inaugural addresses.Former President Barack Obama in his memoir noted that singer Aretha Franklin's showy hat and a glitch in Chief Justice John Roberts' administration of the oath of office got more attention than his speech in the days following the first Black president's address, delivered as the nation was mired in recession and a growing malaise over two intractable wars.Now, with the coronavirus raging, unemployment claims soaring and partisan divisions sharpening, Biden faces a fraught moment as he prepares to deliver a speech that aides say he wants to use to “call Americans to unity.” “The situation he faces is absolutely brutal,” said Cody Keenan, who served as a chief speechwriter for Obama and assisted with his two inaugural addresses.He added that Biden in many ways is ”the perfect president for the moment, because he is not hyperbolic, he's not a bomb thrower, he's surrounded himself with policy wonks who already have all these plans. I think what we are going to hear him talk about is 'Here's where we are, here's what we have to get done.' I think that's going to go a long way just to making people feel better."With the current mood of the country, Biden's consistent focus on restoring “the soul of America” may be of greater value to the nation than any soaring oratory, in the view of some Democratic allies of the incoming president.“It is entirely possible that this inaugural is one we remember for generations to come, because of the gravity of this moment” said David Litt, who served as an Obama speechwriter and wrote the comedic memoir, “Thanks, Obama: My Hopey Changey White House Years.” “But I also think it's possible that the signature speeches of the Biden administration come at less expected moments and that would be par for the course.”The inaugural address is as much a celebration of the peaceful handover of power as it is a set piece for a new or reelected president to lay out a vision for the nation. In recent memory, inaugural addresses have followed a predictable structure: The nation has challenges but there is hope to solve the problems if the president's agenda is embraced.One tradition dating back at least to Jimmy Carter's 1977 inaugural is for the incoming president to offer the nation's gratitude to the outgoing president — a moment of graciousness intended to put aside the strife of the political campaign and signal to Americans that it's time to come together as a nation.President Donald Trump won't be there to hear it. He's already said he won't attend the inauguration — the first outgoing president to skip his successor's swearing-in since Andrew Johnson did not attend Ulysses S. Grant's inauguration in 1869.Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President George W. Bush, said there are still ways that Biden's speechwriting team can continue the tradition of honoring the peaceful transition of power by simply giving a nod to the past presidents and Vice President Mike Pence, who are expected to be at the Capitol for the address.Biden chief of staff Ron Klain said during a recent event hosted by The Washington Post that the president-elect has been chipping away on the address through the entire transition — taking time every few days to write and rewrite his thoughts. His speechwriting team is led by longtime Biden collaborator Vinay Reddy.More important than flowery oratory is substantively demonstrating how Biden will take steps to begin unifying a country that remains emotionally raw because of the pandemic and a divisive election cycle that culminated with the violent insurrection at the Capitol, Fleischer said.“Don't dwell on today's difficulties. Focus on tomorrow's answers,” Fleischer advised. “Soaring oratory is just not Joe Biden. The effectiveness of his speech is going to be much more about what he says than how he says it.”Edward Frantz, a presidential historian at the University of Indianapolis, said Biden's daunting moment has parallels to what Roosevelt faced in 1933 as he sought to rally support for his agenda, as well as to Rutherford B. Hayes, who delivered his inaugural address in 1877 after winning by a single Electoral College vote in an election in which he and his allies alleged fraud in several states.In addition to pushing a message of unity for Americans, Biden should signal to the world that the United States will recalibrate after four years of Trump, Frantz said. That may be easier said than done, though.“How do you talk about returning to new normal while also not seeming arrogant about the United States' position in the world — especially after what's transpired over the last four years of the Trump administration and also with what foreign observers watched in horror as the riots transpired,” Frantz said. “There really is no parallel to what Biden faces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aims-for-unifying-speech-at-daunting-moment-for-us-101610985117374.html

His Majesty was informed by the GoI that they value the old ties with Bhutan and will help Bhutan. We have told GoI that we plan to vaccinate the whole eligible population in one go and they said they understand," PM Tshering was quoted by The Bhutanese."GoI (Government of India) has announced that they will provide vaccines for free and if we have to procure vaccines then His Majesty has said he would even provide from his personal resources," he added.As per the Bhutanese daily, Tshering also informed that Bhutan King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck has commanded that all Bhutanese abroad to get vaccinated."His Majesty has commanded that all Bhutanese abroad should be vaccinated too and if required then the embassies and missions will provide the resources if the vaccine has to be paid for," said Bhutan PM.This comes after the Nepal Government approved the emergency use of the 'Covishield' vaccine last week, which is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).The Indian side assured that the "requirements of Nepal would be in priority consideration after the roll-out of vaccines", said the Nepal Embassy following the approval of the vaccine.Last week, Nepal Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali had said that India is a frontrunner in starting vaccinating people against Covid-19 and this "has given us great hope.""Today as we wait for the availability of Covid-19 vaccines, India is one of the frontrunners. This has given us great hope. I take this opportunity to congratulate India and its innovative companies for success. Being next door, we believe we too will be availing these vaccines," Gyawali said in a speech during an event organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs at Sapru House here.He also lauded India's achievements in infrastructure, industrialisation and decades of successful democratic practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-to-receive-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-from-india-101610986039039.html

Nishantha had consumed the locally-produced anti-Covidtonic along with several other parliamentarians last month, the official said, adding that the political parties represented in Parliament have agreed to limit this week's sessions due to pandemic concerns.Despite ongoing fears, the government will open the airports for foreigners from January 21.Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said the authorities had learned lessons from a pilot project which brought in groups of Ukrainian tourists."The pilot project has been a success and there were over 1500 Ukrainian tourists who came, bringing in 42 million rupees", Ranatunga said.Sri Lanka was hit by the second coronavirus wave in October. Earlier last month, Sri Lankan authorities said they would resume international flight operations from December 26.However, the latest date for re-opening international travel was also deferred. Chair of Airports Authority GA Chandrasiri said the delay was caused by the new strain of coronavirus, which has forced parts of Europe into tougher virus restrictions.The Sri Lankan government incentivised air travel in the months following the COVID-19-induced air travel break, offering zero parking fees and landing costs for international operators.Sri Lanka had seen a major surge in Covid-19 infections since early October.

At a court hearing on Sunday, a judge ruled that the Orange, California, man could be released if he paid $1,000, but said that Singh was prohibited from setting foot in the airport.As of Monday morning, Singh remained in the Cook County Jail.Assistant Public Defender Courtney Smallwood said Singh does not have a criminal record. She also said it was unclear why Singh, who is unemployed, came to Chicago or if he has ties to the area.During the hearing, Assistant States Attorney Kathleen Hagerty said that Singh was spotted by two United Airlines employees, who asked him for identification, the Chicago Tribune reported. Singh lowered his mask and showed a badge that actually belonged to an operations manager at the airport who had reported it missing in late October, Hagerty said.The employees called police, who took Singh into custody. Singh was “scared to go home due to COVID,” Hagerty said, and told authorities that he'd found the badge and that other passengers at the airport had given him food.Before she granted Singh bail, Cook County Judge Susana Ortiz was clearly troubled that someone could remain in a secured area for so long at the airport without anyone noticing.“The court finds these facts and circumstances quite shocking for the alleged period of time that this occurred,” the judge said. “Being in a secured part of the airport under a fake ID badge allegedly, based upon the need for airports to be absolutely secure so that people feel safe to travel, I do find those alleged actions do make him a danger to the community."Singh is scheduled to return to court Jan. 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-arrested-after-allegedly-hiding-3-months-at-chicago-airport-due-to-covid19-101610983854434.html
18-01-2021||World||How might EU react after Russia arrests opposition leader Alexei Navalny||European countries have criticised the arrest of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny on his return home after being poisoned and some have called for European Union sanctions against Moscow.Here are some of the measures which the EU might consider taking, based on proposals mooted in previous cases when the West considered sanctions against Russia.Targeted travel bans/asset freezesWestern countries may consider targeted sanctions on Russian individuals deemed to have been involved in Navalny's arrest and any decision to jail him.The EU and the United States already have travel bans and asset freezes in place against Russians accused of responsibility for human rights abuses, including Navalny's poisoning and the 2009 death in jail of Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer arrested after accusing Russian officials of tax fraud.Economic sanctionsThe EU already has sanctions in place on Russia's energy, financial and arms sectors, and a ban on doing business with Crimea, over Moscow's seizure of the peninsula.Toughening such sanctions would require unanimity among the EU's 27 member states. While some, such as Poland, are open critics of Moscow, others, such as Hungary, might be less willing to back tougher economic sanctions against Russia.Nord stream 2Berlin faces calls to take punitive steps over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that is being built to carry natural gas directly from Russia to Germany. Most of its construction is complete.Some EU countries say the pipeline will undermine the traditional gas transit state, Ukraine, and increase EU reliance on Russia for energy.The United States, keen to increase shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe, opposes the pipeline and this month told EU companies it suspects are helping build Nord Stream 2 that they face a risk of sanctions. Zurich Insurance Group decided to drop out of the project following the call.Germany has supported the project so far, arguing it is a commercial venture, and government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday that had not changed.TurkstreamTurkStream is another pipeline project, which will carry Russian natural gas to southern Europe through Turkey.Russia started gas exports via TurkStream to Turkey last year and supplied the first gas via Bulgaria to Serbia in early 2021. Any action considered over TurkStream would be intended in effect to suspend its further expansion to Europe.The Russian foreign ministry has said that sanctions threats against pipelines amount to "political pressure" and "unfair competition".Sovereign debtAnother possible response that might be considered is limiting foreign investors' ability to hold Russia's sovereign debt.OFZ bonds are an important source of cash for state spending.Disconnecting Russia from SWIFTAnother possible step that could be considered is disconnecting the Russian financial system from global SWIFT interbank payments, which would make international financial transactions nearly impossible.Andrey Kostin, chief executive of Russia's second largest bank, VTB, has said such a move would be comparable to a declaration of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-might-eu-react-after-russia-arrests-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-101610983528329.html

18-01-2021||World||Started process of appointing Turkey representative after new law, says Facebook||Facebook Inc said on Monday it had started the process of appointing a legal entity as a local representative in Turkey in compliance with a new social media law which critics have said will muzzle dissent.The law allows authorities to remove content from platforms, rather than blocking access as they did in the past. The move has caused concern as people turn more to online platforms after Ankara tightened its grip on mainstream media.The company said its decision did not change its community standards, which outline what is and what is not allowed on Facebook, nor its process for reviewing government requests."We will withdraw the representative if we face pressure on either," the company said in a statement, adding that it remains committed to maintaining free expression and other human rights in Turkey.Other companies have also appointed representatives in line with the recently amended Internet law. YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, said a month ago it had taken such a decision..In previous months Facebook, YouTube and Twitter had faced fines in Turkey for not complying with the law.Companies that do not follow the law will ultimately have their bandwidth slashed by 90%, essentially blocking access.Twitter said in a report this month that Turkey, which has historically been responsible for the highest number of content removal requests, ranked fourth in the first half of last year, accounting for 10% of all global legal demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/started-process-of-appointing-turkey-representative-after-new-law-says-facebook-101610979388112.html
18-01-2021||World||EU to push member states to target vaccinating 70% of population by summer||The European Union’s executive arm will urge member states to set a target for vaccinating at least 70% of the bloc’s population by this summer, according to a draft of the latest pandemic response recommendations due to be released Tuesday.The European Commission will also vow to agree with member states by the end of this month on a protocol for vaccination certificates “which can be recognized and used in health systems across the EU -- and which could be scaled up globally in coordination with the World Health Organization,” according to the draft of the document seen by Bloomberg.Such certificates could replace quarantines and test-requirements, proving that “you are no longer high-risk for travel.”The draft policy paper, which is still subject to changes until it’s formally adopted on Tuesday, comes amid an increase in infections that has forced EU governments to prolong recession-inducing lockdowns. It also follows an underwhelming rollout of vaccinations across the continent that has left the EU lagging behind the US, the UK and other developed nations.EU leaders will seek ways to up their game when they hold a video conference on Thursday, which is meant to be informed by the latest commission proposals. Among the most controversial issues on the table is a push for the introduction of vaccination certificates that would allow travel to resume -- at least for those who receive the jab.The idea, which the commission paper appears to adopt, reflects the eagerness of tourism-dependent economies like Greece to salvage this summer’s tourism season. Countries such as France, however, are reluctant to adopt the use of such certificates for the time being, as they would appear to make vaccines mandatory, at a time when they aren’t available to everyone due to supply constraints.Travel Ban“To ensure an ambitious vaccination effort concrete targets are essential,” the commission’s document also says. “By March 2021, member states should have vaccinated a minimum of 80% of health and social care professionals and people over 80 years old,” and “by summer 2021, member states should have vaccinated a minimum of 70% of the adult population.”The commission’s recommendations, which aren’t binding for member states, also include:The commission will also vow “to speed up the approval process for new production facilities” and help member states set up vaccination centers and electronic reservation systems for vaccination. The proposals reflect concerns among member states that current production capacity for the approved vaccines is insufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-push-member-states-to-target-vaccinating-70-of-population-by-summer-101610978877526.html
18-01-2021||World||Russia prepares earliest-ever Arctic LNG shipment to Asia||Russia is preparing to make the earliest-ever shipment of liquefied natural gas to Asia, taking advantage of thinning ice in the Arctic Ocean and paving the way for a record-long navigation season this year.The super-chilled cargo from Novatek PJSC’s Yamal LNG facility in early May will beat last year’s record for the start of eastbound voyages through the Northern Sea Route by almost two weeks if the plan works out, according to people familiar with the situation. It will travel with an ice-breaker.The Northern Sea Route, stretching more than 3,000 nautical miles (5,556 kilometers) between the Barents Sea and the Bering Strait, is the shortest passage between Europe and Asia. Yet its eastern part is usually shut for navigation for several months at the start of the year due to thick ice, limiting shipment potential. Its increased use underscores how quickly the pace of climate change is accelerating in the Earth’s northernmost regions.The exact timing of the LNG shipment will depend on the thickness of the ice and weather conditions, said the officials, who asked not to be identified as the schedule is not public or finalized.“The possibility of such a voyage in May is under discussion,” Nikita Sekretarev, spokesperson for Russian shipping company Sovcomflot PJSC, said declining to provide further details. Sovcomflot provides the Christoph de Margerie tanker to Novatek’s Yamal LNG project.Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which operates the Northern Sea Route, declined to comment on the schedule.Russia expects the passage to rival the Suez Canal as Arctic ice thins out. But climate experts warn that an increase in ocean-going vessels through the route could cause more damage to the environment.Last year saw another period of intense heat. Especially in parts of the Arctic and northern Siberia, where temperatures in some regions were more than 6 degrees Celsius higher than average.The warming allowed Novatek to send an eastbound LNG cargo via the NSR with ice-breaker support in late May in 2020 -- the earliest start to the navigation season in the area so far. Shipments continued to Asia through January, a record-long navigation season in the eastern Arctic.February RecordEarlier this month, Novatek sent two LNG ice-class tankers, the Christophe de Margerie and the Nikolay Yevgenov, to China through the NSR. The vessels don’t need ice-breaker support as the current conditions in the eastern Arctic are mild, according to Rosatom.The Christophe de Margerie crossed the Arctic and reached Cape Dezhnyov, located between the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Strait, late Saturday evening Moscow time, sailing 2,474 nautical miles in almost 11 days, according to Sovcomflot’s statement emailed on Monday.The voyage confirms that “commercial transportation of cargoes in the eastern area of Russia’s Arctic in autumn-winter season is possible for one to two months longer, bringing the year-round navigation via the Northern Sea Route one step closer,” Sovcomflot said.However, the tankers, scheduled to deliver the super-chilled cargoes to China in late January, will use an ice-breaker on their return to Russia across the passage in February, according to the industry officials.Until now, a cargo ship has never made a February voyage in the eastern Arctic, according to Sovcomflot, who owns the Christophe de Margerie.Sovcomflot confirmed the plans for the tanker. The U.S.-based Teekay LNG Partners LP, the owner of the Nikolay Yevgenov, did not respond to Bloomberg’s request for a comment.The planned February return voyage is part of “the systemic efforts to gradually extend transit navigation in the eastern sector of the Arctic,” the Sovcomflot spokesman said. “In the future, the goal is to set up a safe round-the-year navigation” across the Northern Route, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-prepares-earliest-ever-arctic-lng-shipment-to-asia-101610977624710.html

An additional 23 branches are now temporarily under lock and key in response to a strict 30-day lockdown that started on Jan. 5, the Zimbabwe Bankers’ Allied Workers Union said.“There is a high possibility that some may never be re-opened in the foreseeable future,” Shepherd Ngandu, the assistant secretary-general of the union, said by text message.While banking is deemed an essential service and is exempt from a total shutdown, lenders have opted to downscale to minimize infection risks. The companies rotate half their branch staff every two weeks.The nation’s economy has been in decline for the past two decades amid shortages of everything from foreign exchange to pay for imports to food. Public hospitals are under strain due to a shortages of beds and equipment, according to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights.Zimbabwe Health Minister Denies Hospitals Overwhelmed by VirusOwing to the thrust to offer more digital services, the labor union estimates that about 100 workers were made redundant last year. In the prior year, nearly 300 out of the 4,000 employees in the industry were dismissed, five times more than in 2018.“For now, there are no direct job losses related to Covid-19, but we are beginning to see banks perfecting their digitalization platforms during these times, leading to possible job losses this year and beyond,” said Ngandu.Ralph Watungwa, the president of the Bankers’ Association of Zimbabwe, didn’t respond to a text message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zimbabwe-banks-shut-17-of-branches-as-virus-drives-digitization-101610970974462.html

Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) said that the opposition leader has been arrested over his failure to report to them as per the terms of a suspended sentence and probation period.Navalny has been at the forefront of the anti-corruption struggle in Russia and has organised several demonstrations in the past against President Vladimir Putin and his political allies. The 44-year-old Kremlin critic has been jailed several times over various charges, including embezzlement and holding unauthorised protests, which the Russian leader has repeatedly denounced as politically motivated.Here’s how the world reacted over Navalny’s arrest:United StatesThe outgoing secretary of state Mike Pompeo said that the detention was the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny and other opposition figures who are critical of Russian authorities. The top US diplomat urged the Russian government to provide a “level playing field” for candidates seeking to compete in the electoral process.“Confident political leaders do not fear competing voices, nor commit violence against or wrongfully detain political opponents,” Pompeo said in a statement.Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor for president-elect Biden, called for the immediate release of Navalny, demanding that the perpetrators of the poison attack must be held accountable. Taking to Twitter, Sullivan said that the attacks on Navalny are not only a violation of human rights, but also an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard.Mr. Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable. The Kremlin’s attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard.GermanyGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday condemned Navalny’s “arbitrary” arrest and demanded his immediate release. According to news agency AFP, Merkel’s spokesperson Steffen Seibert said that the Navalny’s arrest violates the principles of the rule of law.German foreign minister Heiko Maas also called on Russian authorities to immediately release Navalny, denouncing the arrest as “utterly incomprehensible”. Maas told German public television that Navalny consciously chose to return to Russia because he feels the country is “his personal and political home”, adding that the obligations to civil liberties should also apply to the prominent critic of Putin.United KingdomCalling Navalny a victim of “despicable crime”, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said that the arrest of the Russian leader was “appalling”. “Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,” Raad said in a statement, referring to the poison attack on Navalny in which nerve agent from the Novichok group was used.European UnionUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, condemned Navalny’s arrest and called on Russian authorities to immediately release him. She highlighted that the detention of political opponents is against Russia’s international commitments. “We also continue to expect a thorough and independent investigation on the attack on Alexei Navalny's life. We will monitor the situation closely," von der Leyen said in a statement. European Council president Charles Michel also made a similar appeal.The detainment of Alexey #Navalny upon arrival in Moscow is unacceptable. I call on Russian authorities to immediately release him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/appalling-world-leaders-react-to-alexei-navalny-s-arrest-in-russia-101610977155737.html

Fewer than 10 individuals required medical attention over the span of 24 hours," Pan said in a California Department of Public Health statement.More than 330,000 doses of this particular lot were distributed to 287 health care providers across California earlier this month, the statement said.Moderna, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US Food and Drug Administration are currently undertaking a review of the batch in question.The epidemiologist acknowledged that getting any vaccine is not without risk, but available data on similar vaccines show that one severe allergic reaction per 100,000 inoculations can be expected, well below the current posting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-health-official-calls-for-pausing-moderna-vaccine-101610976722414.html

"All of these patients have had serious underlying illnesses. We can’t say that people die from the vaccine. We can say that it may be coincidental. It is difficult to prove that it’s the vaccine which is the direct cause," Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA), was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Sigurd Hortemo, the chief physician at the NMA, also said that "reports suggest that common adverse reactions to mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients."As of Friday, Norway had been using Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine shots. The Pfizer shot is based on the mRNA technology that guides the cells of the host body to fight off the virus. The first Europe-based report on the safety of the Pfizer shot is to come by the end of January.Also Read | Norway says Covid-19 vaccines may be too risky for elderly, terminally sickNorway has till date vaccinated around 42,000 people with the first dose of the Pfizer shot, especially to those considered at high risk including the elderly.Hortemo had also said that Norway is vaccinating elderly and people in nursing homes with critical underlying conditions, therefore it is expected that deaths close to the time of inoculation may occur. In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, NMA added.NMA and the National Institute of Public Health have been jointly assessing the cases of adverse effects after the vaccine. The Nordic country's medicine agency also emphasised on the evaluation of every person to assess if the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risk of its adverse effects.Madsen believed the results won't be any different with the Moderna vaccine too. He said that it is possible that the side effects of the vaccination in some cases, "tip the patients into a more serious course of the underlying disease. We can’t rule that out." However, he added, that almost all nursing home patients have been vaccinated and the deaths account for "one under 1000."Norway has reported total 58,651 coronavirus cases and 521 deaths till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-direct-cause-says-norway-over-death-of-33-people-after-covid-19-vaccination-101610976556571.html

PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz would lead a rally from Rawalpindi on that day, said the PML-N spokesperson."On January 19, lawyers, doctors, nurses and farmers will all have to leave their homes and join PDM (protest)," she said. Furthermore, Marriyum stated that the deadline for the resignation of the "selected government" was January 31."Setting the date of the foreign funding case on February 13 is a result of our pressure. I hope the Election Commission will not come under pressure to make a decision in the case," she added.Last week, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asserted that the only way to remove Prime Minister Imran Khan and his government was to table a no-confidence motion.Bilawal had vowed to convince the members of the PDM on the strategy, while also calling on the premier to voluntarily step down because of his "failure at all fronts," Dawn reported."It is the only way out... We are not anarchists. We believe in democracy and legal process. This is the only way out, I think. We need to go through the parliament for every move," he said at the press conference."We will try to bring the PDM and allied parties on one page on this option. We believe in democratic norms and this is why we always resist the role of the establishment in making or breaking governments," Bilawal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-under-immense-pressure-to-resign-by-jan-31-says-pmln-101610974982717.html

18-01-2021||World||From the Bubonic plague to 2021, why lockdowns look set to stay||A year after the lockdown imposed in the Chinese city of Wuhan shocked the world, the tactic is turning out to be an enduring tool for quelling the coronavirus almost everywhere.When the first large-scale lockdown in modern times was implemented in China on Jan. 23 at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was then deemed unproven and unthinkable, particularly by democratic governments who balked at the implications for human rights violations of limiting citizens’ freedom of movement on such a huge scale.Yet almost 12 months on, the U.K. is in the midst of its third nationwide lockdown as it battles a mutated strain of the coronavirus. In Australia, the recent discovery of one case in Brisbane prompted a three-day lockdown. And China, which is experiencing its biggest outbreak since the start of the pandemic with over 500 cases, locked down three cities surrounding Beijing this month.“Prior to Covid-19 there was a strong global health discourse that argued against lockdowns and similar mass quarantines. This is but one area of thinking that the current pandemic has overturned,” said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.“As far as is possible, lockdowns are going to become part of the essential toolkit for governments to use in addressing the ongoing as well as future outbreaks,” he said.Wartime measuresThe speed with which China locked down millions of people when the pandemic broke out marked the first time that the measure had been taken on such a massive scale in modern times.Until last year, severe lockdowns were synonymous with the waves of bubonic plague that swept through Europe from the 14th century. Even during the Spanish Flu of the early 20th century, no lockdowns were centrally imposed. China did, however, impose three major lockdowns in recent history: during a bubonic plague outbreak in its northeast in 1901, and two short ones following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake and another amid a bubonic plague outbreak in Gansu province in 2014.Foreign countries who were taken aback at the Wuhan lockdown found themselves doing much the same just months later as the virus spread uncontrollably.After an infectious disease reaches a certain number of people, lockdowns can’t be avoided because no other measure can stem spread, said Jiang Qingwu, a professor of epidemiology at Shanghai’s Fudan University.Though it’s clear that there remains a large gulf between what the Chinese government is able to impose on its citizens during a lockdown compared to democratic countries. Ever quick to declare what the government routinely refers to as “wartime” measures in response to relatively low numbers of infections, local authorities also ensured compliance by actions such as totally sealing off residential compounds. In some cases, people are not allowed to leave to get food, with deliveries arranged to them instead.China’s unproven antiviral solution: quarantine of 40 millionAccording to the authors of a study conducted by Bloomberg Economics comparing how democratic countries fared against more authoritarian ones in dealing with the pandemic, “a rapid and stringent lockdown is the kind of knee-jerk reaction that comes more naturally to authoritarian than democratic regimes.”In China’s latest lockdown in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, the stringent measures are reminiscent of those from the Wuhan lockdown, which ended on April 8 after infections dwindled to zero. Residents in the northeastern city, 180 miles (290 kilometers) southwest of Beijing, are required to stay home for seven days as the city embarks on a second round of mass testing for the entire population of 11 million as cases in the region exceed 500. Flights and trains into and out of the city have been halted, as well as almost all public transport.In contrast, democracies such as the U.K. in their versions of lockdowns have generally allowed people to leave the house to purchase essentials such as food and medicine, walk their dogs or exercise. Schools remained open in France’s autumn lockdown, while in its latest two-week lockdown this month, Israel is allowing people to gather outdoors in groups of up to 10, with exemptions for religious activities.U.K. faces harder lockdown restrictions as Covid infections soarBut there’s also been examples of democratic governments imposing extreme rules. One state government in Australia, where officials have reacted fiercely to flareups, banned even outdoor exercise and dog-walking during a brief lockdown in November.Winter resurgenceChinese authorities argue that the country’s bounceback from the crisis proves that their approach works. And a winter resurgence of the virus in countries like South Korea, Japan and Sweden, which originally saw success with a minimal-disruption approach that avoided lockdowns, buttresses the argument for stricter measures, particularly as fatigued citizens flout stay-at-home advice.The best and worst places to be in Covid: U.S. sinks in ranking“Given the huge number and high density of China, we have proved that [these measures] are very effective,” Mi Feng, spokesperson at the country’s National Health Commission, told Bloomberg News.In addition to concerns over civil liberties, many governments remain hesitant to impose the sorts of full lockdowns as seen in China because of the economic cost -- though research by the International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook showed that if countries were decisive in taking such measures, they performed better in terms of protecting the economy. New Zealand is one such example, recording just 25 deaths after quickly imposing lockdowns, with life resuming to near normality soon after.Early lockdowns saved jobs in government responses to pandemicHowever, even China, whose economy has roared back to life, is cognizant of economic pressure. Since the Wuhan lockdown, authorities have tellingly steered clear of shutting down economically significant cities like Beijing despite substantial flareups. Officials turned largely to aggressive contact-tracing during an outbreak in the capital last summer.“Effective as lockdowns are, they are costly,” said Yanzhong Huang, Director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University. “Even for China, it’s unsustainable in the long term,” he added, likening reflexive lockdown decisions to “shooting cannonballs at mosquitoes.”With vaccinations drives now being rapidly rolled out across major western countries and China, the hope is that lockdowns will be far less common in 2021, though substantial uncertainty remains over how long it’ll take to vaccinate enough of the world population to safely re-open the global economy.Despite the economic implications, Covid-19’s legacy is likely that lockdowns will continue to be deployed during outbreaks of highly communicable diseases in the future, especially since they’re now a familiar concept to people everywhere for the first time in a century.“Restrictive quarantine itself is not a new invention and its application dates back to the Black Death in the medieval times,” said Huang. “But it’s ironic that such an old method remains the most effective despite the tremendous progress in medical sciences.”Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-the-bubonic-plague-to-2021-why-lockdowns-look-set-to-stay-101610955893874.html

That was more than 5,000 less cases then the week before.The reported death toll rose by 214 to 46,633, according to the tally.Foreign Minister Heiko Maas fuelled discussions regarding privileges for people who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 on Sunday by saying those should be allowed to go to restaurants and cinemas earlier.His comments contrasted with other German ministers, who have opposed such special rights, fearing it could lead to inequalities in society at a time when not everyone has the opportunity to get inoculated.Maas's proposal were "out of the question" as long as it is not proven that a vaccination stopped people from transmitting the virus too, a justice ministry spokesman said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-prepares-for-further-coronavirus-measures-101610961323433.html
18-01-2021||World||China’s economy grows by 2.3% in 2020, bucking global Covid-19 slowdown trend||China's economy, which was the first to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic and early to recover from its impact, grew 2.3 per cent in 2020, registering the lowest annual growth rate in 45 years, but bucking the trend of slowdowns being experienced by major world economies.The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the world's second-largest economy grew by 2.3 per cent, expanding to USD 15.42 trillion in dollar terms in 2020, according to the data released by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday.In the local currency, the GDP exceeded 100-trillion-yuan (USD 15.42 trillion) threshold to 101.5986 trillion yuan, it said.The Chinese economy which suffered a 6.8 per cent slump in the first quarter in 2020 after it went into lockdown following the emergence of the deadly coronavirus in Wuhan staged a steady recovery after quickly containing the Covid-19, while the virus turned into a global pandemic, hitting all major economies around the world, including India.Aided by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the Chinese economy staged a steady recovery.In the fourth quarter of 2020, China's GDP expanded 6.5 per cent year on year, faster than the 4.9-per cent growth in the third quarter, the NBS said.The country's economic operation has recovered steadily with employment and people's well-being effectively guaranteed, the NBS said, adding that the major tasks of economic and social development have been completed better than expected.Partly, China’s global exports of medical supplies, specially relating to coronavirus, has also contributed to growth in manufacturing and exports.China's job market grew at 5.6 per cent but below the government's annual target of around six per cent.According to the data, a total of 11.86 million new urban jobs were created in 2020, completing 131.8 per cent of the target set for the whole year, the NBS said.In December, the surveyed urban unemployment rate was 5.2 per cent, flat with the same period of the previous year.But the emerging new clusters of coronavirus in the country prompted China to strengthen controls, casting a shadow over higher growth projections for this year.Ning Jizhe, the head of the NBS, said that "the main targets of economic and social development (in 2020) have been completed better than expected"."China is expected to become the only major economy in the world to achieve positive economic growth throughout the year," he said, adding that quarterly GDP growth "have returned to the normal level".Analysts say with global bodies like the International Monetary Fund projecting growth rate above eight per cent this year, China's economy could be picking up pace."The GDP data shows the economy has almost normalised. This momentum will continue, although the current Covid-19 outbreak in a couple of provinces in northern China might temporarily cause fluctuation," said Yue Su, the Principal Economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)."The government's strong anti-coronavirus measures that help effectively contained the spread of the virus, the flexible countercyclical macroeconomic policies, as well as the efforts taken to deepen reform and opening up to the outside world, have all contributed to the better-than-expected economic results in 2020," Cao Heping, a professor at the School of Economics of Peking University, told the state-run Global Times.Observers say the nature of the recovery of the Chinese economy has been distinctly lopsided as the industrial prong of China's economy vastly outgrew consumption, with exports helping power growth, even as imports struggled to gain momentum.Consumption plays an important role as China's 14th Five-Year Plan being implemented envisages massive overhaul of the country's domestic market to boost consumption in order to reduce China's reliance on shrinking exports markets.According to the NBS data, China's retail sales of consumer goods, a major indicator of consumption growth, fell 3.9 per cent year on year in 2020. Sales of consumer goods reached 39.2 trillion yuan (about USD 6.05 trillion) last year.As per the NBS data, China's value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 2.8 per cent year on year in 2020.The growth accelerated from a rise of 2.3 per cent registered in the first 11 months of last year.In Q4, the industrial output grew 7.1 per cent year on year, 1.3 percentage points higher than that recorded in Q3. December alone saw the output growth rise to 7.3 per cent, up by 0.3 percentage points from November, the NBS data showed.The output of the manufacturing sector went up 3.4 per cent year on year last year, the fastest among the three major sectors, which also include mining and the production and supply of electricity, thermal power, gas and water, the NBS data said.The mining output edged up 0.5 per cent year on year, while the production and supply of electricity, thermal power, gas and water reported a year-on-year growth of 2 per cent.Industrial structure continued to improve last year, with the output in high-tech manufacturing and equipment manufacturing industries expanding by 7.1 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-economy-grows-by-2-3-in-2020-bucking-global-covid-19-slowdown-trend-101610970878460.html

Lobby Day always falls on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a national holiday honoring the civil rights leader assassinated in 1968.Boogaloo boys also walked the perimeter of the statehouse on Sunday, striking poses with semiautomatic rifles for photographers.Philip Van Cleave, leader of the defense league, said demonstrators would come from as far away as New York and Texas. The group says it plans to petition state lawmakers to loosen gun curbs, as it has done during many Lobby Days in the past."We've been doing this for 25 years," Van Cleve added. "We've never had a single problem. No arrests, nothing."Police estimated last year's crowd at 22,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virginia-capital-braces-for-pro-gun-demonstration-in-wake-of-capitol-siege-101610970019497.html

The Russian Foreign Ministry quickly rejected those calls, telling them to mind their own business."Respect international law, do not encroach on national legislation of sovereign states and address problems in your own country," Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook.Navalny's case could trigger new sanctions against Russia, especially against an $11.6 billion project to build a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, with some EU countries saying they want the bloc to swiftly impose such measures.The rouble weakened as investors weighed the risk of new sanctions against Moscow.The foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, France and Italy called for Navalny's release. Lithuania said on Sunday it would ask the EU to swiftly impose new sanctions on Russia. Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek said he wanted the bloc to discuss possible sanctions.Jake Sullivan, one of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's top aides, told Moscow to free Navalny, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter he was deeply troubled by Moscow's decision to arrest Navalny.Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, told a news conference that Western countries' expressions of outrage over the detention were designed to distract their own citizens from domestic problems.He said the Navalny case had gained artificial resonance in the West and that Moscow was unfazed by potential damage to its image."We should probably think about our image, but we're not young ladies going to a ball," Lavrov told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/detained-kremlin-foe-navalny-rushed-to-court-moscow-tells-west-to-butt-out-101610970234386.html

She is also the first Black woman and a woman of South Asian descent to hold the office. Harris has broken every possible glass ceiling and now has to live up to the expectations of her boss, president-elect Joe Biden, and all those who voted her in.The incoming administration has set out four key priorities of turning around the economy, tackling Covid-19, addressing climate change and racial justice. “She [Harris] has a voice in all of those. She has an opinion in all those areas,” Harris’ chief spokeswoman Symone Sanders was quoted by the Associated Press.Covid-19: Harris had promised that the first 100 days of her term in office would focus on getting control of the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring equitable distribution of the vaccine for all. “The Biden-Harris Covid-19 response plan will include: Setting up community vaccination sites nationwide, Scaling up testing and tracing, Providing paid sick leave to contain spread of the virus, Addressing health disparities,” she had tweeted on January 16.The Biden-Harris COVID-19 response plan will include:✓Setting up community vaccination sites nationwide✓Scaling up testing and tracing✓Providing paid sick leave to contain spread of the virus✓Addressing health disparitiesEconomic revival: Joe Biden announced a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill last Thursday to revive the US economy. Harris had been consistent in her support for increasing the limit of the stimulus check given to Americans to $2000 from $600 given presently. She has also been interacting with small business owners across many states expressing her support. “Our economic team members have track records of not only standing up for workers and unions, but spurring innovation, and creating opportunity for small business owners,” she has said.Also read: Indian-Americans nominated for key roles in Biden administrationRacial justice: An active proponent of racial justice and equality, Harris has been vocal in her support to the minority communities across America. She expressed her anguish about the killing of George Floyd in May 2020, following which widespread protests against police brutality erupted in the US.“We’ll show every child in America—regardless of their color or gender—that there are no limits to who can lead and hold positions of power in our country,” she referred to her election to the office.Climate Change: The US witnessed an active hurricane season, damages caused due to the wildfires in California and Oregon. “Starting on January 20th, we'll tackle this crisis [climate crisis] head-on here and around the world,” she had promised. She had also promised to invest in science and technology and restore trust in scientists in tackling climate change..@JoeBiden and I will listen to the scientists. pic.twitter.com/N0JloKI44w(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-roof-shattering-victory-kamala-harris-faces-daunting-challenges-101610968993038.html
18-01-2021||World||England aims to ease lockdown measures by early March under vaccine plan||The UK government will aim to start lifting the pandemic lockdown in the first half of March, after stepping up its mass vaccination program this week.Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said a gradual easing of restrictions could begin in the “first, second week of March.” He said it needed to be two to three weeks after the mid-February target to vaccinate the four most vulnerable groups so that the shots could take effect.From Monday, millions more people will be offered the vaccine -- including over-70s and those deemed “clinically extremely vulnerable” -- which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called a “significant milestone” in the immunization effort.England is in its third national lockdown, with schools closed and people ordered to stay at home as the government attempts to control a surge in cases. There are currently more than 37,000 coronavirus patients hospitalized, and the daily death toll remains high -- with another 671 deaths recorded Sunday.Johnson’s government is pinning its hopes on the vaccination program to end the crisis. The National Health Service will begin delivering injections to the two new groups this week because some areas of England have already vaccinated the top two priority groups: the over-80s and front-line health and care workers.Ten new mass vaccination centers will open this week -- including at a racecourse, cathedral and rugby ground -- taking the total in England to 17, with more to follow. There are also 1,200 hospitals and GP-led sites offering injections.Zahawi said there would be a “gradual lifting” of the “non-pharmaceutical interventions.” He told Times Radio: “You’re talking about the first, second week of March, where you should be seeing very clear evidence of a break in the correlation between infection rates and hospitalization and obviously death, because this is a race against death.”The profound impact of 10 months of restrictions on businesses and workers means the government is under increasing pressure to do more to help the poorest families.The UK’s main opposition Labour party will turn up the heat Monday by forcing a vote in the House of Commons on extending a boost in benefit payments -- worth more than 1,000 pounds ($1,355) a year -- beyond March 31. A group of Conservative lawmakers, the Northern Research Group, has also insisted ministers must extend the benefits uplift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-aims-to-ease-lockdown-measures-by-early-march-under-vaccine-plan-101610968715556.html

It compared full-time workers of the same age and with a permanent contract working for medium-sized companies. In Germany, ETUC said, women in the white goods sector earn €865 less per month in gross income than men making cars, for jobs requiring similar skills.In Romania, where wages are significantly lower, the average difference in net income is €244, ETUC said.“Comparing the pay of women and men in the manufacturing sector shows clearly how women are paid less even when their jobs require the same levels of skill and physical effort as those of men,” ETUC deputy general secretary Esther Lynch said. “The COVID crisis has also exposed the deep-rooted bias behind wages for professions dominated by women, with carers and cleaners recognized as ‘essential’ despite being amongst the lowest paid.”Last year, using data from the EU's statistical office, the trade union organization said women would have to wait for another 84 years and the next century to achieve equal pay at the current pace of change.ETUC called on the European executive commission to quickly come forward with its pay transparency directive. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had planned to present measures to introduce binding pay transparency measures in the first 100 days of her mandate, but the proposals have yet to be unveiled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-gender-pay-gap-still-significant-warn-trade-unions-101610967718377.html
18-01-2021||World||Pakistan, Turkey are two countries but one nation: Pak Air Force chief||Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan said that Pakistan and Turkey are "two countries, one nation" as the Imran Khan government desperately seeks to salvage its relations with Ankara amid deteriorating relations with middle east and gulf countries.According to Geo News, the Air Chief was addressing a meeting comprising board members of the Association of Justice Defenders and Strategic Studies Center (ASSAM) in Turkey on Friday.The Air Chief said that Pakistan fully supports Turkey on Cyprus and other regional issues and also stands by Ankara in its war against terrorism.Pakistan's declining relations with its two biggest sources of foreign remittances and foreign exchange-- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-- is "bad news" for its already ailing economy, said scholar Salman Rafi Sheikh.The Khan regime's tilt towards Turkey is reflected in his recent foreign policy choices, including its stated willingness to revive the dormant transnational rail service linking Istanbul, Tehran and Islamabad (ITI) in 2021.The ITI transnational railroad is expected to enhance connectivity via China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) by providing a direct rail connection between China and Turkey via Iran. China's presence in the line's revival is of central importance.In an opinion piece in Asia Times, Salman Rafi Sheikh said Pakistan is tentatively reorienting its foreign policy away from Saudi Arabia and the UAE towards China's New Silk Roads.Last August, Saudi Arabia asked Pakistan to repay early a USD 3 billion soft loan, Islamabad tried to defuse the tensions by quickly dispatching its current army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa."While Pakistan tentatively expands its ties with Iran and Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have applied clear pressure on Pakistan's two biggest sources of foreign remittances at a delicate economic juncture, undermining - at least for now - Islamabad's ability to chart a truly independent and perhaps more forward-looking foreign policy," the scholar noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-turkey-are-two-countries-but-one-nation-pak-air-force-chief-101610967763386.html

It said last year it had cut 4,300 jobs, or around 20% of its staff."SIA (Singapore Airlines) can be the first vaccinated international airline of the world. Try to get that done," Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung told aviation workers at a vaccination drive at the airport on Monday.More than 5,200 SIA employees have signed up to be vaccinated since staff started being inoculated last week, according to a memo sent to staff by CEO Goh on Monday.An SIA spokesman said that represented about 50% of those eligible for the vaccine, which is being offered for free to residents by the government on a voluntary basis."Vaccinations are widely expected to be the game-changer in facilitating the opening of borders once again," Goh said."This will also be an important differentiator in the airline industry...I strongly urge everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated as soon as possible."Unlike other mass vaccination programmes in the United States and Britain, Singapore is administering the jabs having largely contained the disease locally.The plans have stirred rare hesitancy among some due to the low risk of infection and concern about any possible side effects from rapidly developed vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-urges-national-airline-to-be-first-to-vaccinate-all-staff-101610967099636.html
18-01-2021||World||Italian PM Conte seeks to save his government from falling||Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte was fighting for his political life Monday with an address to the lower chamber of Parliament that aims to shore up support for his government, which has come under fire from an ally over plans to relaunch the country's pandemic-ravaged economy.Conte lost his majority with the defection of Cabinet ministers belonging to former Premier Matteo Renzi’s tiny but key Italia Viva (Italy Alive) party. Renzi has faced harsh criticism for the power play during a pandemic. But with billions of European Union pandemic funds expected to flow into the country, he has defended the move as necessary to prevent Conte from amassing too much power.Conte will address the lower house on Monday and the Senate on Tuesday. Each speech will be followed by a voice vote that is tantamount to a confidence vote. The Senate vote, where Renzi’s party has 18 members, is expected to be decisive.Conte, a lawyer by training hailed for his mediation skills, was tapped by Italy's 5-Star Movement to run the government after the indecisive 2018 election led to a governing coalition of the 5-Stars with a right-wing group led by League party leader Matteo Salvini.That government fell when Salvini, then interior minister, mounted a failed power grab. Conte was able to form a new government with the support of the left-wing Democratic Party, which then included Renzi, a former Italian premier. Renzi later defected from the party he once ran, giving himself the ability to shake up the government by yanking loyal ministers.While Conte enjoyed broad support during the first phase of the pandemic, which overwhelmed Italy first in the West after emerging in China, he has come under criticism for making decisions and policy without consulting Parliament. Renzi acted after Conte unveiled a plan to manage the EU recovery funds himself, which was widely seen as accumulating too much power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-conte-seeks-to-save-his-government-from-falling-101610966596782.html

"We originally planned to use 22 hours to complete the work of surface sampling, but, in fact, we stopped after 12 hours."But China is still open to cooperating with all nations in studying the samples, he said, including the United States.For years, US laws have limited its space agency NASA from directly cooperating with China."We didn't set restrictions between countries," Pei said. "Whether or not two countries could carry out related cooperation is a matter for two sides."China has not yet received any access request for samples, he said, adding that the rocks were still in a pre-treatment stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-chang-e-5-lunar-probe-retrieved-samples-weighing-lesser-than-2kg-target-101610966177855.html

18-01-2021||World||China locks down another three million after travelling salesman spreads virus||Nearly three million people were put under lockdown in China Monday after a surge in coronavirus cases linked to a travelling salesman in the country's northeast.While China has largely brought the virus under control, a sharp rise in cases in the past few weeks has prompted fresh lockdowns, travel restrictions and multiple rounds of mass testing.Monday saw three million residents of two cities in northeastern Jilin province placed under new measures, as China reported 109 new infections.More than 19 million people across China's northeast are now barred from leaving their homes, and in some cases can only apply for permission to go grocery shopping once every three days.Authorities have traced over a hundred infections in Jilin province to an asymptomatic travelling salesman from neighbouring Heilongjiang, where authorities last week declared a state of emergency.The salesman had travelled to two different cities, now locked-down, and given healthcare workshops to middle-aged and elderly residents, according to local officials.An investigation has been launched into the health care centres that hosted the workshops to determine whether their operations constitute illegal business activities.Health care workshops which sometimes market products claiming to boost "longevity" have been accused of preying on vulnerable groups in China, particularly the elderly.The People's Daily, a state-run newspaper, ran a commentary on Monday lambasting the workshops as "risking lives for money, under the guise of caring about the health of the elderly".Lockdowns were also extended across other areas of China's northeast over the weekend, including one district of Harbin, currently hosting a popular ice sculpture festival that is usually a big draw for tourists.But local authorities partially lifted lockdowns in two cities in Hebei province outside Beijing -- which has accounted for the majority of cases in recent weeks -- though some 12.5 million are still being told to stay home.Over 20,000 residents of villages in the area have been sent into quarantine in a centralized location, state media reported last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-locks-down-another-three-million-after-travelling-salesman-spreads-virus-101610966606261.html

The resident of Newport, Wales has once again started his search for the drive and urged local city officials to let him dig through landfill sites.What had happened?The man claims that he had two identical-looking hard drives and threw away the one which had the 'private key' required to access and spend the 7500 units of cryptocurrency stored on his computer while cleaning his office in 2013.A private key is a form of encryption, a digital signature that provides an algorithmic proof that the transaction was done by the owner. Bitcoin has a decentralised system operated by a network of computers. Every transaction is done through a wallet with a 'private key to encrypt and decrypt information.Why is it trending today?Howells has again raised his demand to dig the landfill to locate his drive. Even in 2021, he is confident that he will find his gold at the end of the trash, however, local civil authorities have again rebuffed his demand citing the cost involved sans any guarantee."The cost of digging up the landfill, storing and treating the waste could run into millions of pounds — without any guarantee of either finding it or it still being in working order," the Newport City Council's spokesperson was quoted as saying by CNBC.In order to locate his long lost drive, Howells has also promised 25 per cent of the bitcoins to his city's 'Covid Relief Fund', with an added promise to fund the excavation with an unknown hedge fund. If found, the promised donation would amount to $70.8 million.Also Read | Bitcoin retreats from $40,000 level strategists view as key"As far as I am aware they have already rejected the offer,” Howells had told CNBC in an interview. “Without even having heard our plan of action or without being given a chance to present our mitigations to their concerns regarding the environment, it’s just a straight-up ‘no’ every time," he added.The cryptocurrency has been booming since March last year and had on Monday from a record level of $40,000. The analysts believe dollar weakness, probability of faster inflation in recovering the global economy could be the factors driving quadrupling pace of the largest cryptocurrency, Bloomberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-on-a-mission-to-find-long-lost-hard-drive-with-bitcoin-worth-280-million-101610965635075.html

During a briefing on internal security last Friday, the FBI director had said that the agency is tracking calls for potential armed protests and activity leading up to the inauguration. “If we find that an individual poses a violent threat, then we and our partners will take advantage of every lawful authority and method we’ve got to disrupt any attempt or attack,” Wray told the briefing.Watch | Biden swearing-in: Security beefed up at statehouses in US amid small protestsAround 25,000 members of the National Guard from across the United States have started entering Washington to secure the inaugural event scheduled for January 20, which is at least two and a half times the number for previous inaugurals. US army secretary Ryan McCarthy told the Associated Press on Sunday that he has warned commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks. “We’re continually going through the process, and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation,” McCarthy was quoted as saying by the news agency.However, McCarthy said that he has not seen any evidence of threats, so far, and officials vetting the security personnel hadn’t flagged any issues, adding that National Guard members also receiving training on how to identify the threat of potential insider attack. General Daniel R Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, reportedly said that there are good processes in place to identify any such potential threats.“If there’s any indication that any of our soldiers or airmen are expressing things that are extremist views, it’s either handed over to law enforcement or dealt with the chain of command immediately,” Hokanson was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/insider-attack-threat-looming-on-biden-inauguration-what-do-we-know-so-far-101610964396975.html

He was illegally detained," the group wrote on Twitter.The 44-year-old's arrest by police at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport Sunday sparked a wave of calls for his release from Western countries.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Monday that the international condemnation was an attempt to divert attention from domestic problems in Western countries."It looks like Western politicians see this as an opportunity to divert attention from the deepest crisis the liberal development model has found itself in," he said.jbr/mm/bp||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-lawyer-says-denied-access-to-moscow-police-cell-101610962827751.html
18-01-2021||World||Kamala Harris prepares for central role in Joe Biden's White House||Kamala Harris will make history on Wednesday when she becomes the nation's first female vice president — and the first Black woman and the first woman of South Asian descent to hold that office.But that's only where her boundary-breaking role begins.With the confluence of crises confronting Joe Biden's administration — and an evenly divided Senate in which she would deliver the tie-breaking vote — Harris is shaping up to be a central player in addressing everything from the coronavirus pandemic to criminal justice reform.Symone Sanders, Harris' chief spokeswoman, said that while the vice president-elect's portfolio hasn't been fully defined yet, she has a hand in all aspects of Biden's agenda.“There are pieces that Biden may specifically ask her to champion, but outside of that she is at the table for everything, involved in everything, and giving input and feedback and being a supportive partner to him on all pieces," she said.People working closely with Harris on the transition resist the idea of siloing her into any specific issue early on, because the sheer number of challenges the Biden administration faces means it will be “all hands on deck” during their early months.They say she'll be involved in all four of the major priorities they've set out: turning around the economy, tackling COVID-19, and addressing climate change and racial justice.“She has a voice in all of those. She has an opinion in all those areas. And it will probably get to a point where she is concentrating on some of the areas more specifically,” Sanders said.“But right now, I think what were faced with in this country is so big, its all hands on deck.”Harris has been closely involved with all of Biden's biggest decisions since winning the election in November, joining him for every one of his key meetings focused on Cabinet picks, the Covid-19 relief bill, security issues and more.The two talk over the phone nearly every day, and she travels to Delaware sometimes multiple times a week for transition events and meetings.Those involved in the transition say both have taken seriously Bidens insistence that he wants Harris to be the “last voice in the room” on key decisions.Biden is known to turn to Harris first during meetings to ask for her opinion or perspective on the matter at hand.Biden and Harris knew each other prior to the 2020 presidential campaign in part through Harris friendship with Biden's deceased son, Beau. But they never worked closely together.Since joining the ticket, and particularly since the election, Harris has made efforts to deepen their relationship and is in frequent contact with the president-elect, people close to Harris say.That personal relationship, according to presidential historian Joel Goldstein, will be key to their success as working partners.“The relationship of the vice president to the president is the most important relationship. Establishing mutual understanding and trust is really a key to a successful vice presidency,” Goldstein said.Goldstein pointed to Biden and President Barack Obama's relationship as a potential model for the incoming team.Biden and Obama were from similarly different backgrounds and generations and also entered the White House with a relatively fresh working relationship.But their relationship and mutual understanding grew throughout the presidency, and Obama trusted Biden with some of his administrations biggest endeavors, like the implementation of the 2009 Recovery Act and the troop withdrawal from Iraq.Harris is said to be looking at Biden's vice presidency as a guide for her own.But unlike Biden during his first term, Harris will face constant questions about her political future.While Biden has skirted questions about whether he plans to run for reelection, at 78 hell be the oldest president in history, leaving questions about whether he'll retire at the end of his term.That would make Harris the immediate frontrunner in any 2024 Democratic presidential primary.Early in the vice presidential vetting process, her potential presidential ambitions gave some Biden allies pause. But since her selection, Harris has proven a loyal partner to Biden, rarely if ever contradicting him publicly.Still, California Rep. Barbara Lee, who was the first Congressional Black Caucus member to endorse in the primary when she backed Harris, said the vice president-elect is not afraid to speak her mind.“Shes no shrinking violet," Lee said. "If she believes that one decision should be made versus another she's going to weigh in and give her thoughts and opinions.”Biden has a personal affection for the work of diplomacy and deep relationships with global leaders that Harris can't match. But aides say she'll be deeply involved in the administration's diplomatic priorities simply because of the sheer amount of issues that will take up Biden's time.She may also be given a particular aspect of the administration's coronavirus response to oversee.One of her main priorities early on is certain to be the passage of the USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that Biden announced Thursday.Those working with Harris on the transition say that while Biden will be intimately involved with ushering the package through the Senate because of his longstanding relationships with longer-serving lawmakers, Harris knows the newer members and can help build fresh relationships in Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-prepares-for-central-role-in-joe-biden-s-white-house-101610961268655.html
18-01-2021||World||UK’s vaccination programme expands to cover over-70s||Millions of people aged 70 and over and those clinically extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 will be invited to get their vaccinations as the National Health Service (NHS) expands the rollout of the vaccines to the next priority groups from Monday.The NHS has so far been working to vaccinate the first two priority cohorts recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which are care home residents and staff, and those aged 80 and over and frontline health and care staff.Vaccinating these groups will remain the priority, but vaccination sites which have enough supply and capacity for vaccinating further people are allowed to offer vaccinations to the next two cohorts – those aged 70 and over and clinically extremely vulnerable people.“Today is a significant milestone in our vaccination programme as we open it up to millions of more people who are most at risk from Covid-19,” said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“We are now delivering the vaccine at a rate of 140 jabs a minute and I want to thank everyone involved in this national effort. We have a long way to go and there will doubtless be challenges ahead – but by working together we are making huge progress in our fight against this virus,” he said.The expansion means that areas that have already vaccinated the majority of care home residents, frontline health and care staff and people aged 80 and over to keep up the momentum and start vaccinating further at-risk people, helping the NHS to reach the government’s commitment of offering vaccinations to the top four JCVI priority groups by the middle of February.“Now that more than half of all over-80s have had their jab, we can begin vaccinating the next most vulnerable groups. Where an area has already reached the vast majority of groups 1-2, they can now start opening up the programme to groups 3-4,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“We are working day and night to make sure everyone who is 70 and over, our health and social care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable are offered the vaccine by the middle of February and our NHS heroes are making huge strides in making this happen," Hancock said.It comes as the NHS staff start delivering the two available Covid vaccinations – Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca – at a rugby ground, racecourse, food court and cathedral from Monday as 10 new large-scale Vaccination Centres open up.The new sites mean there will be 17 Vaccination Centres offering people an alternative to the around 1,200 hospitals and GP-led services offering the vaccine service. Latest data released shows that the NHS has delivered more than 3.79 million jabs so far, including vaccinating more than one in three people aged 80 and over.“The NHS vaccination programme has got off to a strong start with our hard-working staff delivering more than 3 million vaccinations while also dealing with the latest wave of coronavirus infections,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England’s medical director.“The rapid progress we have already made is testament to NHS staff who are pulling out all the stops to vaccinate the most vulnerable while caring for so many people who are seriously ill with Covid. In the most challenging of circumstances we are seeing the very best of the NHS,” he said.The message for eligible people is that anyone who cannot or does not want to travel to Vaccination Centres can wait to be vaccinated by their local GP service or hospital. The priority groups are being invited when it is their turn and the NHS has cautioned that people must wait for intimation and cannot just turn to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-vaccination-programme-expands-to-cover-over70s-101610962057743.html

It was unclear from Hua's reply on Monday whether the Hong Kong-related sanctions were new.Hua also did not specify the names of the US officials under sanction and the nature of the sanctions.Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn in as president on Wednesday, and a new team will take over at the State Department, including a new secretary of state.China says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relationship with the United States, and has previously announced sanctions on US companies selling weapons to Taiwan, though it has not been clear how, or if, they were enforced.Beijing has responded to increased US support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits by senior US officials, by stepping up military activity near the island, including flying its air force aircraft nearby.Relations between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, have plunged to their lowest level in decades, with disagreements on issues including Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, the South China Sea, trade and espionage.China last year unveiled sanctions on 11 US citizens, including lawmakers from Trump's Republican Party, in response to Washington's sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials accused of curtailing political freedom in the former British colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-sanction-us-officials-for-nasty-behaviour-over-taiwan-101610960499943.html

That's the average so some areas are doing better," Zahawi told Sky."You'll see that improve as we open more of the large vaccination centres, 17 in total by this week and 50 by the end of the month.""Today, in some areas where they've done the majority of their over 80s, letters are going out to the over 70s and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable," he said.He said the 24-hour vaccine offering would begin to be piloted in London by the end of the month.Key workers such as teachers, the police and shopworkers could move to the top of the list for a vaccine once all those over 50 have been offered a shot, Zahawi said."Teachers, police officers, shop workers, those who through no fault of their own other than the work that they do may come into contact with the virus in much greater volume, should be top of the list," Zahawi told Times Radio.Britain is currently rolling out the vaccine to the most vulnerable first, starting with those who are in care homes or over 80 years of age.Zahawi said he would work with the Joint Committee on Vaccination to establish who gets the shot next in phase two of the roll out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-is-vaccinating-140-people-per-minute-on-average-says-minister-101610958573872.html

Western experts concluded he was poisoned with the Soviet-designed nerve toxin Novichok.The Kremlin denies any involvement and Russian investigators have said there are no grounds to launch a probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-calls-for-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-s-immediate-release-101610956699659.html
18-01-2021||World||West condemns Putin critic Alexey Navalny’s detention in Moscow||Russian police detained opposition leader Alexey Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, as he arrived in Moscow after being treated in Germany for poisoning, drawing immediate criticism from the U.S. and Europe.Navalny, 44, was met by officers at passport control as he landed in Moscow on a plane from Berlin Sunday, according to a live video feed on his YouTube channel. The Federal Penitentiary Service said he had been detained for violating the terms of a suspended sentence, state-run Tass reported.“This is my home,” he told reporters who’d traveled with him Sunday shortly before he was detained. “I’m not scared of anything.” Navalny boarded the flight knowing that he could face a lengthy prison term if he returned.U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo -- who departs with the rest of the Trump administration on Wednesday -- condemned Russia’s decision and called for Navalny’s immediate and unconditional release, echoing similar demands from the European Union and Biden’s incoming national security adviser.“We note with grave concern that his detention is the latest in a series of attempts to silence Navalny and other opposition figures and independent voices who are critical of Russian authorities,” Pompeo said in a statement on Sunday.Navalny, whose anti-corruption exposes and success in galvanizing anti-government votes have increasingly needled the authorities, had been recovering in Germany from a nerve-agent attack in August that he and Western governments blamed on Putin.Surrounded by Russian law enforcement upon landing in Moscow, Navalny kissed his wife, Yuliya, goodbye before walking off with police. Authorities said he would be held pending a court decision on his sentence set for Jan. 29. He spent the night in a cell in a police station in Khimki, a Moscow suburb near the airport, but hadn’t been given access to a lawyer, his allies said.Dozens of his supporters were detained by police at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport, where he had appealed to them to meet him. The flight was diverted to another airport shortly before arrival.Read More: Putin, Poison and the Importance of Alexey Navalny: QuickTakeThe move to imprison the most prominent opponent of the Russian president marks the biggest crackdown by Putin in recent years. Coming days before U.S. President-elect Biden takes office, it could trigger an immediate clash with the new Democratic administration.Jake Sullivan, incoming President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, blasted the Kremlin and called for Navalny’s release.Navalny returned home amid rising political tension ahead of Russian parliamentary elections this autumn and support for the Kremlin falters amid the coronavirus downturn. Putin, 68, whose two-decade rule makes him the longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, last year overturned term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Speculation that he may step down far sooner is building.“There were only two choices for Navalny -- to stay in Germany or come home. If he remained an émigré, in Russia people would quickly lose interest in him,” said Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. “His calculation is he’ll become a symbol of resistance behind bars and a big risk for Putin.”European Council President Charles Michel, who speaks for the EU on foreign affairs, called Navalny’s detention unacceptable. It’s “yet another attempt to intimidate the democratic opposition in Russia,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Facebook.Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are calling on the EU to “consider imposition of restrictive measures” on Russia if Navalny isn’t freed, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Twitter.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the comments by Sullivan and other officials as “prepared ahead of time,” calling on them in a Facebook post to “respect international law, don’t infringe on the national legislation of sovereign countries and deal with the problems in your own country.”Russia issued an arrest warrant for Navalny after accusing him of violating the conditions of a 3 1/2 year suspended fraud sentence by not appearing in person for regular summons. It asked a Moscow court on Jan. 11 to replace it with a prison term. The opposition politician also potentially faces separate charges of embezzlement punishable by as many as 10 years in prison.While for years Navalny was repeatedly jailed for weeks at a time and faced assaults on the street -- at one point nearly losing his eye -- the poisoning attack marked the most serious attempt to kill him. Russia denied any involvement and said it found no proof the opposition politician was poisoned, accusing him of fabricating it as part of working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.With Navalny ignoring the threat to arrest him, the Russian authorities’ response looks set to further sour ties with a once-close partner, Germany, and other European states led by France.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country offered treatment to Navalny after his near-fatal poisoning during a campaign trip to Siberia, visited him in the hospital and provided personal security guarantees. The EU sanctioned six Russian officials in October for the use of the banned Novichok chemical weapon in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-condemns-putin-critic-alexey-navalny-s-detention-in-moscow-101610956087789.html
18-01-2021||World||Trump administration plans to designate Houthis as terrorists||In what could be the last act of President Donald Trump, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on 10 January that the US Administration would designate Yemen's Ansar Allah movement (Houthis) as a terrorist organization.He added that the designation would take effect on 19 January, i.e. the day before Trump leaves office and (President-elect Joe) Biden is sworn in. This move is expected to exacerbate further the grave humanitarian situation in Yemen, this poor, worn-torn country in the Arabian Peninsula, about which the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that "now is in imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades."Pompeo insisted that the move would "deter further malign activity by the Iranian regime", while he stressed that the US administration plans "to put in place measures to reduce their impact on certain humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen."He added that the US is prepared to work with the United Nations and aid groups to help the humanitarian effort. Pompeo said that licenses and guidance would also apply to certain humanitarian activities conducted by non-governmental organizations in Yemen and to certain transactions and activities related to exports to Yemen of critical commodities like food and medicine.Houthis, who profess a sect of Shiite Islam, captured Yemen's capital Sanaa, along with much of the country's north-western territory in late 2014 and 2015. The region borders Saudi Arabia, which together with the United Arab Emirates, supports militarily the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi that was ousted by the Houthis, who are backed by Iran. The conflict escalated in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition launched a military operation to defeat the Houthis and restore PresidentHadi's rule. In the ensuing civil war, it is believed that more than 110,000 people were killed.The lack of safe drinking water, caused by depleted aquifers and the destruction of the country's water infrastructure, has also caused the largest, fastest-spreading cholera outbreak in modern history, with the number of suspected cases exceeding 1 million. Yemen is also facing an outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic.Mark Lowcock, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, speaking during a recent Security Council videoconference meeting, said that the most urgent priority in Yemen right now is to prevent a massive famine. Sixteen million Yemenis are poised to go hungry this year, and about 50,000 already find themselves in the midst of a small famine, he said, adding: "Every decision the world makes right now must take this into account." He also stressed the fact that Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food -- with nearly all that food entering through commercial channels that aid agencies cannot replace.David Beasley, Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP), has said that even without the designation of Houthis as terrorists, famine looms, with 11 million people already in crisis and 5 million at an emergency level. "To stave off famine, at least USD 1.9 billion is needed for 2021, as only USD 386 million in confirmed contributions have been received... The shortage means 9 million people now receive half-rations, and without required assistance, starting in February, only quarter-rations can be provided. The designation (of Houthis as a terrorist organization) is going to be a death sentence to hundreds and thousands, if not millions."What is quite disappointing, is that every time there is a glimmer of hope in Yemen, it is almost immediately frustrated by an adverse event or action, which overturns any progress made. This happened again on December 30 2020, when a plane carrying members of the recently formed Yemeni government landed at Aden International Airport in the southwest of Yemen.As passengers disembarked, there were explosions and gunfire, leaving 28 people dead and 107 others injured. None of the passengers were hurt in the attack and the Yemeni cabinet members were quickly transported to Masquid Palace for safety. Later, an attack also occurred near the Palace.Yemen's Foreign Minister Ahmad Awad bin Mubarak initially blamed the Houthis for the attack, but provided no evidence substantiating the claim. The Houthis denied responsibility and put blame on the continued infighting between the government and the Southern Transitional Council, which they said was the party most likely to have carried out the attack.On 10 January US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he intended to designate the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, using the airport attack as an example of the Houthis' terrorist capabilities.Mark Lowcock, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, has said that the most urgent priority in Yemen right now is to prevent a massive famine. He added that he was not questioning the intent of the US administration's decision.However, he emphasized that its likely humanitarian impact will be "a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years. Licences and exemptions for aid agencies will not prevent that, but a reversal of the decision will", he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-plans-to-designate-houthis-as-terrorists-exacerbating-the-humanitarian-crisis-in-yemen-101610955325954.html
18-01-2021||World||Italy’s PM Giuseppe Conte may not have enough votes to halt political turmoil||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte risks emerging weakened from a parliamentary showdown this week even if he can muster enough votes to hold on to power.Conte faces a confidence vote in the lower house of parliament late Monday, which he’s likely to win, but he could face a similar vote in the Senate on Tuesday, where he has less room for maneuver after former ally Matteo Renzi withdrew his backing.Conte needs about a dozen more votes in the Senate to restore an outright majority in the 321-strong upper chamber after the defection of Renzi’s party. Renzi, a former premier, told Rai television on Sunday that his 18 senators will probably abstain, which would be enough for Conte’s government to survive, but with its authority seriously damaged.Without an absolute majority in the Senate, Conte could soldier on for several weeks while he seeks to win over more lawmakers. But he might have to forge a new coalition and negotiate a new program to remain premier, officials said. All this while battling to keep the Covid-19 pandemic in check and seeking to revive the country’s battered economy.If the attempt to garner more support fails, early elections could possibly take place in June, the officials said. But the fact that many coalition lawmakers would lose their seats in a vote, with the center-right opposition poised to triumph, makes a ballot a remote prospect for now, they said.Conte in a 12 p.m. lower-house speech will appeal to centrists and pro-European forces, as well as any lawmakers who could break from Renzi’s party, as he attempts to forge a pact lasting until the end of the legislature in 2023, newspaper Corriere della Sera reported Monday. He will prioritize the European Union’s recovery fund, the need for a wider budget deficit, and the coronavirus vaccination campaign, Corriere said.“Our goal was never to kick Conte out,” Renzi said on Rai. He said he’s open to negotiations if his red lines, including a demand to tap credit lines linked to the European Stability Mechanism for health spending, are taken into account.While officials from the main parties in the coalition, the Democrats and the Five Star Movement, view it as difficult to patch things up with Renzi, governing without a firm parliamentary majority would put key legislation in jeopardy, including budget laws.One scenario would see Conte submitting his resignation to seek a new mandate as prime minister and have more time to negotiate with parties, although some officials have ruled out the possibility he would do it before any vote.President Sergio Mattarella, who would oversee the process of forging a new government, has pressured Conte to ensure a quick resolution to the crisis and has insisted he must have a stable majority if he is to remain premier, officials with knowledge of the matter said.A group of centrists courted by the majority said on Saturday they wouldn’t back Conte’s government, Ansa news agency reported, citing the UDC party.To bring senators on board, Conte’s supporters -- chiefly from the center-left Democrats and other centrists -- have been warning of the risk of a snap election, which would likely lead to a center-right alliance taking power, according to officials campaigning of behalf Conte, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential deliberations.They’ve also argued that calling a general election in the midst of a global pandemic would damage Italy’s international credibility and risk unnerving investors. Instead, Conte’s backers have urged senators to focus on approving a plan to spend the windfall from the European Union’s recovery fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-pm-giuseppe-conte-may-not-have-enough-votes-to-halt-political-turmoil-101610953399070.html
18-01-2021||World||Israel trades medical data with Pfizer to maintain supply of Covid-19 vaccines||After sprinting ahead in the race to inoculate its population against the coronavirus, Israel has struck a deal with Pfizer, promising to share vast troves of medical data with the international drug giant in exchange for the continued flow of its hard-to-get vaccine.Proponents say the deal could allow Israel to become the first country to vaccinate most of its population, while providing valuable research that could help the rest of the world. But critics say the deal raises major ethical concerns, including possible privacy violations and a deepening of the global divide that enables wealthy countries to stockpile vaccines as poorer populations, including Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, have to wait longer to be inoculated.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who is stumping ahead of the country's March elections as Israel's vaccinator-in-chief — said earlier this month that he reached the deal with Pfizers chief executive to speed up vaccine deliveries to Israel.“Israel will be a global model state," he said. "Israel will share with Pfizer and with the entire world the statistical data that will help develop strategies for defeating the coronavirus.”Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told The Associated Press the government will turn over data to “see how it influences, first of all, the level of the disease in Israel, the possibility to open the economy, different aspects of social life, and whether there are any effects of the vaccination.”Pfizer's vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, has received emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Union's regulatory agency and is believed to provide up to 95 per cent protection against Covid-19. But much remains unknown, including its long-term protection and whether it can prevent transmission of the virus.Israel, home to some 9.3 million people, is considered an ideal place for studying these questions. Its mandatory universal health care is provided by four publicly funded HMOs with meticulously digitized medical records. This centralised system has helped Israel administer more than 2 million doses of the vaccine in under a month. Israel has also purchased doses of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines.The inoculation blitz is a matter of national pride. It also is at the center of Netanyahus reelection campaign as he seeks to deflect attention from his ongoing corruption trial, Israel's deep economic crisis and the latest virus surge.The Health Ministry has recorded over 543,00 cases since the beginning of the pandemic and nearly 4,000 deaths. Israeli officials say they aim to have most of the country vaccinated by the end of March, just around election day.But the exact quid pro quo between Israel and Pfizer is unclear, even after a redacted version of the agreement was released by the Israeli Health Ministry on Sunday.Neither Israel nor Pfizer would say how much Israel has paid for the vaccines, though Edelstein called it a “classical win-win” for both sides. Israeli media have reported that Israel paid at least 50 per cent more than other countries. The data is reportedly being shared with the World Health Organisation, but the global body did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Earlier this month, the head of the WHO appealed to drugmakers and wealthier countries to “stop making bilateral deals,” saying they hurt a U.N.-backed effort to widen access. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus did not single out any countries or companies.Last week, Dr. Siddhartha Datta, WHO Europes program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization, said the agency is trying to collect “disaggregated” data — based on age, gender, local area, employment and other factors — and reporting on any safety issues as the vaccines are deployed.Israel had already announced the acquisition of millions of vaccine doses before the Pfizer deal was announced. It's unclear how the quantity or pace of deliveries has changed, or whether the vaccines have been diverted from other countries.The arrangement has drawn attention to the unequal distribution of vaccines between rich and poor nations. A recent estimate from the International Rescue Committee said that the WHO's global COVAX campaign is likely to vaccinate only 20% of the worlds lower-income countries by the end of 2021.“This is a shady, under-the-table deal that preferences certain countries over others without any transparency,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University in Washington. “In the end, its going to be low- and middle-income countries that are going to be left behind."Dr. Nadav Davidovitch, head of the school of public health at Israel's Ben Gurion University and an adviser to the government on coronavirus policy, said the deal has raised troubling concerns about the deepening disparity of vaccination efforts.“In order to eradicate Covid-19 or at least control it in an efficient manner, we need to see the global picture,” Davidovitch said.That disparity is particularly striking in the case of Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who live under varying degrees of Israeli control and have yet to receive any vaccines.While vaccinating its own Arab citizens and Palestinian residents of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, Israel says it is not responsible for inoculating the Palestinians. Edelstein said Israel will consider helping once it takes care of its own citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-trades-medical-data-with-pfizer-to-maintain-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-101610952804171.html
18-01-2021||World||Samsung’s billionaire heir Lee Jae-yong ordered back to prison for bribery||Billionaire Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong was sent back to prison on Monday after a South Korean court sentenced him to two and a half years over his involvement in a 2016 corruption scandal that spurred massive street protests and ousted South Korea’s then-president.WATCH | Samsung scion jailed for bribery in South Korea corruption scandalIn a much-anticipated retrial, the Seoul High Court found Lee guilty of bribing then-President Park Geun-hye and her close confidante to win government support for a 2015 merger between two Samsung affiliates that helped strengthen his control the country’s largest business group.Lee’s lawyers had portrayed him as a victim of presidential power abuse and described the 2015 deal as part of “normal business activity.”Wearing a mask and black suit and tie, Lee was taken into custody following the ruling. He didn’t answer questions by reporters upon his arrival at the court.Injae Lee, an attorney who leads Lee Jae-yong’s defense team, expressed regret over the court’s decision, saying that the “essence of the case is that a former president abused power to infringe upon the freedom and property rights of a private company.”He didn’t specifically say whether there would be an appeal. Samsung did not issue a statement over the ruling.Lee Jae-yong helms the Samsung group in his capacity as vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, one of the world’s largest makers of computer chips and smartphones.In September last year, prosecutors separately indicted Lee on charges of stock price manipulation, breach of trust and auditing violations related to the 2015 merger.It isn’t immediately clear what his prison term would mean for Samsung, Samsung didn’t show much signs of trouble during previous time Lee spent in jail in 2017 and 2018, and prison terms have never really stopped South Korean corporate leaders from relaying their management decisions from behind bars.Samsung is coming off a robust business year, with its dual strength in parts and finished products enabling it to benefit from the coronavirus pandemic and the prolonged trade war between United States and China.Samsung’s semiconductor business rebounded sharply after a sluggish 2019, driven by robust demand for PCs and servers as virus outbreaks forced millions of people to stay and work at home.The Trump administration's sanctions against China's Huawei Technologies have meanwhile hindered one of Samsung's biggest rivals in smartphones, smartphone chips and telecommunications equipment.Lee, 52, was originally sentenced in 2017 to five years in prison for offering 8.6 billion won ($7 million) in bribes to Park and her longtime friend Choi Soon-sil. But he was freed after 11 months in February 2018 after the Seoul High Court reduced his term to 2½ years and suspended his sentence, overturning key convictions and reducing the amount of his bribes.The Supreme Court last week confirmed a 20-year prison sentence for Park, who was convicted of colluding with Choi to take millions of dollars in bribes and extortion money from some of the country’s largest business groups, including Samsung, while she was in office from 2013 to 2016.The ruling meant that Park, who also has a separate conviction for illegally meddling in her party’s candidate nominations ahead of 2016 parliamentary elections, could potentially serve 22 years behind bars until 2039, when she would be 87.Choi is serving an 18-year prison sentence.In a news conference Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he has no immediate plans to grant presidential pardons to Park and another imprisoned former president, Lee Myung-bak, who’s serving a 17-year term for corruption.Conservative politicians and some members of Moon’s liberal party have endorsed the idea of pardoning the former presidents for the sake of “national unity” as the country’s deeply split electorate approaches the presidential elections in March 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/samsungs-billionaire-heir-lee-jae-yong-ordered-back-to-prison-for-bribery-101610952725285.html
18-01-2021||World||Vaccine disparities raise alarm as Covid-19 variants multiply||Global gaps in access to Covid-19 vaccines are raising concerns that the continued spread of the coronavirus will breed more dangerous versions of the pathogen, weakening medical weapons and further crippling economies.In a race to catch up with emerging coronavirus variants, wealthy countries are already benefiting from potent vaccines. While the U.S., Britain and European Union have given citizens about 24 million doses so far -- more than half of the shots administered globally -- vast numbers of countries have yet to begin their campaigns.Disparities in immunity pose a threat to both have and have-not states. Giving the coronavirus an opportunity to advance and generate new mutants would have significant economic and public-health consequences, adding to the pain as the death toll surpasses 2 million.Growth Forecast“We cannot leave parts of the world without access to vaccines because it’s just going to come back to us,” said Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at health research foundation Wellcome. “That puts everyone around the world at risk.”Countries are relying on effective immunizations to save lives and revive businesses. The World Bank’s projection for 4% growth this year depends on widespread deployment of vaccines. Surging Covid cases and a delay to the delivery of inoculations, however, could limit expansion to just 1.6%.High-income countries have secured 85% of Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine and all of Moderna Inc.’s, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd. Much of the world will be counting on U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, whose vaccine is cheaper and easier to distribute, along with other manufacturers such as China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.Of 42 countries rolling out Covid vaccines as of Jan. 8, 36 were high-income countries and the rest were middle-income, according to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. A growing number of countries are pursuing their own supply deals, in addition to participating in a global collaboration known as Covax.Future MutantsUrgency is increasing as the pandemic extends into a second year. New variants that surfaced in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil appear to spread significantly faster than earlier versions. Just in the past month, a “new dimension of risk has opened up for the world,” said Rajeev Venkayya, president of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.’s vaccines business.Reducing deaths and illnesses has been seen as the main driver of delivering vaccines rapidly, said Venkayya, who worked in the George W. Bush administration to develop a U.S. pandemic flu plan and directed vaccine delivery for the Gates Foundation.“We now understand it’s also very, very important to control transmission,” he said, “not just to protect those most vulnerable populations, but also to reduce the evolutionary risk associated with this virus.”While there’s no evidence to suggest the current crop of vaccines are ineffective against those variants, future mutants may be less responsive, Wellcome’s Weller said.Drugmakers say they could tweak their shots to counter new variants within weeks if needed. The likelihood that such adaptations will be necessary has increased, Venkayya said.“The longer the virus is allowed to continue in different parts of the world where we don’t have a vaccine,” said Anna Marriott, health policy adviser at the anti-poverty group Oxfam, “the greater the danger of new variants that could be more aggressive, more virulent or transmissible.”Covid shots have been tested for their ability to prevent symptoms, not transmission. Still, their performance in clinical trials gives an indication of how effective they might be against spread.Effectiveness GapThe rollout of shots from Pfizer-BioNTech SE and Moderna that achieved efficacy levels of about 95% has raised questions about whether everyone will have access to such high levels of protection.“The gap isn’t just about access to vaccines,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s also about access to effective vaccines.”One of the shots lower- and middle-income countries are relying on, from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, sparked worries in Australia that it may not be effective enough to generate herd immunity. Health authorities there, however, said they believe it will be comparable to the Pfizer and Moderna shots in preventing people from getting seriously ill.The vaccine developed by the U.K. partners, introduced in the country earlier this month, delivered an average efficacy rate of 70%. That appeared to climb to 80% with a longer gap between doses, based on limited data available, according to regulators. Lengthening that period to as many as three months from one allows more people to get protected faster, while data show the level of antibodies also increases, an AstraZeneca spokesman said.“An optimized regimen which allows the vaccination of many more people upfront, together with a robust supply chain, means we can have a real impact on the pandemic,” he said in an email.Four vastly differing protection rates have been released on Sinovac’s shot, ranging from about 50% to more than 90%. The Chinese developer said the lower number seen in a trial in Brazil is due to participants being medical workers facing a high risk of contracting Covid.“Despite the difference in efficacy rate, they all point to the vaccine’s ability for protection, especially against mid- and severe disease,” Sinovac said.While the picture is still coming into focus, cleared vaccines are likely to be similarly effective in preventing serious sickness and death, said Takeda’s Venkayya. Where they could diverge is on side effects, the duration of protection and impact on transmission, an even more critical factor in light of new variants, he said.Even shots with a lower efficacy level could have a considerable impact. U.S. regulators set a 50% threshold for deeming a candidate effective. But they would require a higher percentage of people willing to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, Huang said.If less-effective vaccines are distributed to emerging markets, it could have significant economic implications, too, and “sharpen differences in pandemic outcomes across countries,” Justin-Damien Guenette, a senior economist at the World Bank, wrote in an email.Many countries are depending on Covax, which aims to deploy vaccines equitably to every corner of the planet. Yet not all lower- and middle-income nations are waiting for a lifeline. Countries such as South Africa and Malaysia are also pursuing their own supply deals through direct talks with manufacturers, and some regions are set to receive Pfizer’s vaccine as well.‘Losing Patience’“There seem to be indications that countries are losing patience,” said Huang of the Council on Foreign Relations.Covax has secured access to almost 2 billion doses, with deliveries due to begin in the first quarter, and set a goal of vaccinating up to a fifth of countries’ populations by the end of the year. That’s far short of the levels of two-thirds or more that many nations are targeting. Some may not get vaccines until 2024, researchers estimate.The mobilization is ramping up. India, a nation of more than 1.3 billion people, kicked off a massive inoculation drive on Saturday, an effort expected to encounter challenges as it extends into rural areas.Vaccine advocates have called on rich countries to share while pushing companies to scale up manufacturing capacity. While it’s early, the trends are concerning, Venkayya said.“Success is defined as getting vaccines to people everywhere,” he said, “and we’re not yet successful in that endeavor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-disparities-raise-alarm-as-covid-19-variants-multiply-101610948424837.html
18-01-2021||World||Global methane emissions equaled Europe’s carbon footprint in 2020||Emissions of planet-warming methane fell last year as oil and gas production declined, but they were still equivalent to the European Union’s total carbon dioxide emissions. Oil and gas operations emitted just over 70 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest edition of its annual Methane Tracker report released on Monday. Emissions were 10% lower than the estimate for 2019 amid production cuts and the introduction of new methane regulations. “The task now for the oil and gas industry is to make sure that there is no resurgence in methane emissions, even as the world economy recovers, and that 2019 becomes their historical peak,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. “Early action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change.” Methane emissions are the second-largest cause of global warming after carbon dioxide. While methane is less abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, and has a shorter lifetime, it absorbs much more energy than CO₂, so it’s a more powerful greenhouse gas. Agriculture remains the largest source of human-caused methane emissions, while the energy sector comes next. Oil production is responsible for around 40% of the energy industry’s methane emissions, with the natural gas value chain accounting for the remaining 60%. Detecting methane emissions has been a challenge in the past because they are mostly caused by hard-to-detect leaks, but over the last few months new satellites have provided a way to identify large discharges.Methane emissions need to fall 70% over the next decade, a decline equivalent to eliminating CO₂ emissions from all cars and trucks across Asia, according to the report. Fixing methane leaks would be cost-effective for energy companies because the captured methane can be sold as natural gas. The cost of repairs and maintenance needed to capture methane can often be paid for by the value of the additional gas brought to the market. Still, lower natural gas prices during 2020 made methane abatement less appealing. While that could change if natural gas prices rise, as they have done in recent weeks, regulatory action will be essential to tackle emissions, IEA said. The organization called for governments to address the issue during United Nations climate talks in Glasgow in November. The gathering, known as COP26, should be an opportunity for governments and companies to include methane emissions in their promises to lower their environmental footprints in order to slow down climate change. “One important avenue, especially for countries with large oil and gas sectors, will be to include commitments on methane in their new or updated pledges in advance of the COP meeting,” Birol said. “This is the moment for governments to raise ambitions not only on CO₂ but also on methane.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-methane-emissions-equaled-europe-s-carbon-footprint-in-2020-101610947978219.html
18-01-2021||World||Donald Trump's farewell planned for Wednesday morning ahead of Joe Biden's oath||White House officials are planning a farewell ceremony for Donald Trump as he leaves Washington on Wednesday morning for the last time as president, according to a copy of the invitation seen by Bloomberg News.The event is scheduled for 8 am at Joint Base Andrews just outside the nation’s capital, where the outgoing president will make his departure aboard Air Force One for Florida. Invitations have been circulated to supporters, including former administration officials and other backers, asking them to arrive by 7:15 am.Trump has decided to skip the January 20 inauguration of his successor, Joe Biden, at the US Capitol, becoming the first living US president in more than a century to choose not to attend the regular exchange of power. Trump will instead be at his Mar-a-Lago resort as the incoming president is sworn in at noon that day.A White House spokesman declined to comment.Some White House aides will be on the South Lawn for the lift-off of the presidential helicopter with Trump aboard, though the attendance will be limited. Strict security measures throughout downtown Washington and especially near the White House will make it too difficult for outside guests to access the campus.Trump’s decision not to attend the inauguration was announced on Jan. 8 by the president, two days after a mob of his loyalists ransacked the Capitol in a riot that left five people dead.

In 2018, a devastating 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.The country’s meteorology agency has warned of aftershocks in Sulawesi, along with the risk of extreme weather and other flood dangers in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-quake-death-toll-at-81-as-country-battles-series-of-disasters-101610944931588.html
18-01-2021||World||Many Australians urge PM Morrison to rebuke MP for Covid disinformation||Three-quarters of Australians have called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to censure a member of parliament over Covid-19 disinformation.A poll published by the think tank Australia Institute on Monday found that 76 per cent of Australians agreed that Morrison "has a responsibility to clearly and publicly criticize" members of his governing Liberal National Party coalition who spread misinformation about the pandemic.It comes after government MP Craig Kelly shared posts on social media earlier in January likening mask mandates for children to child abuse."Forcing children to wear masks is causing massive physical & psychological harm - that can only be defined as child abuse," he wrote.The poll found that disapproval of Kelly was strong across party lines with 77 per cent of coalition voters agreeing that he should be censured.In the wake of the post the peak body for Australian doctors, the Australian Medical Association (AMA), called on Morrison to publicly condemn Kelly and others who were "torching the foundation of community health and science.""Hopefully we can get the leaders being very strong and clear in their advice and strong about supporting science," AMA Vice President Chris Moy said.The Australia Institute also found that 56 per cent of voters agreed that Morrison should criticize or condemn outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the capitol hill riots.Morrison condemned participants in the riots for the "terribly distressing" scenes but has not addressed Trump's role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-australians-urge-pm-morrison-to-rebuke-mp-for-covid-disinformation-101610944399864.html
18-01-2021||World||Donald Trump, so far, not planning to pardon himself: Reports||U.S. President Donald Trump at this point is opting not to issue a pardon for himself as he prepares an expansive list of more than 100 pardons and commutations for release on Tuesday, a source familiar with the effort said.White House advisers have said Trump has privately debated with advisers whether to take the extraordinary step of issuing a pardon for himself but some administration officials have cautioned Trump against a self-pardon because it would make him look guilty.Many scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case.Others have argued that a self-pardon is constitutional because the pardon power is very broadly worded in the Constitution. Historical texts made clear that the nation’s 18th century founders discussed self-pardons, but opted not to include an explicit limitation on that power.Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last week on charges of inciting the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by pro-Trump protesters. His case is to face a Senate trial and if convicted, he could be disqualified from seeking another run for the presidency in 2024.The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said so far Trump does not plan to pardon himself and also does not plan to issue preemptive pardons for members of his family, another subject he has discussed privately with advisers.Trump, who has already issued two waves of pardons in the past month, met advisers on Sunday to finalize a list of more than 100 pardons and commutations, the source said.CNN reported that Dr Salomon Melgen, a prominent eye doctor from Palm Beach who is in prison after being convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud, is expected to be on the clemency list.The source said the clemencies were expected to be issued on Trump's last full day in office on Tuesday. Skipping the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, Trump leaves on Wednesday morning to begin his post-presidency at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. His presidency ends at noon on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-so-far-not-planning-to-pardon-himself-reports-101610941721626.html
18-01-2021||World||Biden expected to pick FTC member Chopra to head consumer financial regulator||U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rohit Chopra to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), according to two people familiar with the new administration's plans.Also Read | Biden swearing-in: Heavily fortified statehouses around US see small protestsChopra, whose consumer advocacy views align with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, had been considered a top candidate for the job running the agency created after the 2008-2009 financial crisis.A spokeswoman for Biden's transition office did not respond to a request for comment.Also Read | FBI vetting Guard troops in DC amid fears of insider attackThe CFPB, championed by Warren, has been beloved by Democrats as a watchdog to help level the financial playing field for middle-class Americans but reviled by Republicans as too powerful and unaccountable. Millions of Americans who lost jobs and income due to the coronavirus pandemic are turning to help from the financial institutions the CFPB seeks to regulate.The Trump administration, which ends on Wednesday, weakened the agency's enforcement powers and won a Supreme Court ruling to allow the president discretionary authority to fire its director.That could backfire now. Chopra's expected nomination suggests that Biden intends to fire current CFPB director Kathy Kraninger, a Trump appointee whose term officially ends in 2023.Chopra helped Warren set up the CFPB and served as the agency's first student loan ombudsman. Progressives have sought to return it to a tougher stance, reversing Trump's rules on payday lending and debt collection agencies as well as scrapping proposals that could prevent low-income Americans from getting mortgages.Other liberal priorities include stamping out exorbitant lending rates, addressing the student debt burden and gaps in minorities' access to credit as well as overhauling the credit reporting system. As a presidential candidate, Biden proposed letting the CFPB offer its own credit ratings for consumers."Rohit has a proven record of challenging corporate abuse on behalf of everyday families who don't want to be cheated," said the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy group that had promoted Chopra, on Twitter.Chopra's appointment would take a key advocate for strong regulation of big technology companies off of the FTC.Chopra backed a lawsuit last month by that agency that accused Facebook Inc of using a "buy or bury" strategy with competitors that may force the company to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.In 2019, he voted against a $5 billion fine against Facebook for privacy failures, saying that while it "sounds like a lot," the settlement did not go far enough to prevent repeated abuses. He has also pressed social media companies for more information on how they use personal data and warned lawmakers that consumer data posed a threat to competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-expected-to-pick-ftc-member-chopra-to-head-consumer-financial-regulator-101610941141591.html
18-01-2021||World||FBI vetting Guard troops in DC amid fears of insider attack||US defense officials say they are worried about an insider attack or other threat from service members involved in securing President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, prompting the FBI to vet all of the 25,000 National Guard troops coming into Washington for the event.The massive undertaking reflects the extraordinary security concerns that have gripped Washington following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters. And it underscores fears that some of the very people assigned to protect the city over the next several days could present a threat to the incoming president and other VIPs in attendance.Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press on Sunday that officials are conscious of the potential threat, and he warned commanders to be on the lookout for any problems within their ranks as the inauguration approaches. So far, however, he and other leaders say they have seen no evidence of any threats, and officials said the vetting hadn't flagged any issues that they were aware of.”We’re continually going through the process, and taking second, third looks at every one of the individuals assigned to this operation,” McCarthy said in an interview after he and other military leaders went through an exhaustive, three-hour security drill in preparation for Wednesday’s inauguration. He said Guard members are also getting training on how to identify potential insider threats.About 25,000 members of the National Guard are streaming into Washington from across the country — at least two and a half times the number for previous inaugurals. And while the military routinely reviews service members for extremist connections, the FBI screening is in addition to any previous monitoring.Multiple officials said the process began as the first Guard troops began deploying to D.C. more than a week ago. And they said it is slated to be complete by Wednesday. Several officials discussed military planning on condition of anonymity.“The question is, is that all of them? Are there others?” said McCarthy. “We need to be conscious of it and we need to put all of the mechanisms in place to thoroughly vet these men and women who would support any operations like this.”In a situation like this one, FBI vetting would involve running peoples’ names through databases and watchlists maintained by the bureau to see if anything alarming comes up. That could include involvement in prior investigations or terrorism-related concerns, said David Gomez, a former FBI national security supervisor in Seattle.Insider threats have been a persistent law enforcement priority in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But in most cases, the threats are from homegrown insurgents radicalized by al-Qaida, the Islamic State group or similar groups. In contrast, the threats against Biden’s inauguration have been fueled by supporters of President Donald Trump, far-right militants, white supremacists and other radical groups. Many believe Trump’s baseless accusations that the election was stolen from him, a claim that has been refuted by many courts, the Justice Department and Republican officials in key battleground states.The insurrection at the Capitol began after Trump made incendiary remarks at the Jan. 6 rally. According to McCarthy, service members from across the military were at that rally, but it’s not clear how many were there or who may have participated in the breach at the Capitol. So far only a couple of current active-duty or National Guard members have been arrested in connection with the Capitol assault, which left five people dead. The dead included a Capitol Police officer and a woman shot by police as she climbed through a window in a door near the House chamber.Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, has been meeting with Guard troops as they arrive in D.C. and as they gather downtown. He said he believes there are good processes in place to identify any potential threats.“If there’s any indication that any of our soldiers or airmen are expressing things that are extremist views, it’s either handed over to law enforcement or dealt with the chain of command immediately,” he said.The insider threat, however, was just one of the security concerns voiced by officials on Sunday, as dozens of military, National Guard, law enforcement and Washington, D.C., officials and commanders went through a security rehearsal in northern Virginia. As many as three dozen leaders lined tables that ringed a massive color-coded map of D.C. reflected onto the floor. Behind them were dozens more National Guard officers and staff, with their eyes trained on additional maps and charts displayed on the wall.The Secret Service is in charge of event security, but there is a wide variety of military and law enforcement personnel involved, ranging from the National Guard and the FBI to Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department, US Capitol Police and US Park Police.Commanders went over every aspect of the city’s complicated security lockdown, with McCarthy and others peppering them with questions about how the troops will respond in any scenario and how well they can communicate with the other enforcement agencies scattered around the city.Hokanson said he believes his troops have been adequately equipped and prepared, and that they are rehearsing as much as they can to be prepared for any contingency.The major security concern is an attack by armed groups of individuals, as well as planted explosives and other devices. McCarthy said intelligence reports suggest that groups are organizing armed rallies leading up to Inauguration Day, and possibly after that.The bulk of the Guard members will be armed. And McCarthy said units are going through repeated drills to practice when and how to use force and how to work quickly with law enforcement partners. Law enforcement officers would make any arrests.He said Guard units are going through “constant mental repetitions of looking at the map and talking through scenarios with leaders so they understand their task and purpose, they know their routes, they know where they’re friendly, adjacent units are, they have the appropriate frequencies to communicate with their law enforcement partners.”The key goal, he said, is for America’s transfer of power to happen without incident.“This is a national priority. We have to be successful as an institution,” said McCarthy. “We want to send the message to everyone in the United States and for the rest of the world that we can do this safely and peacefully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-vetting-guard-troops-in-dc-amid-fears-of-insider-attack-101610940769441.html
18-01-2021||World||Biden swearing-in: Heavily fortified statehouses around US see small protests||Small groups of right-wing protesters — some of them carrying rifles — gathered outside heavily fortified statehouses around the country Sunday, outnumbered by National Guard troops and police brought in to prevent a repeat of the violence that erupted at the U.S. Capitol. As darkness fell, there were no reports of any clashes.Security was stepped up in recent days after the FBI warned of the potential for armed protests in Washington and at all 50 state capitol buildings ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.Crowds of only a dozen or two demonstrated at some boarded-up, cordoned-off statehouses, while the streets in many other capital cities remained empty. Some protesters said they were there to back President Donald Trump. Others said they had instead come to voice their support for gun rights or decry government overreach.“I dont trust the results of the election,” said Michigan protester Martin Szelag, a 67-year-old semi-retired window salesman from Dearborn Heights. He wore a sign around his neck that read, in part, “We will support Joe Biden as our President if you can convince us he won legally. Show us the proof! Then the healing can begin.”As the day wore on with no bloodshed around the U.S., a sense of relief spread among officials, though they were not ready to let their guard down.The heavy law enforcement presence may have kept turnout down. In the past few days, some extremists had warned others against falling into what they called a law enforcement trap.Washington State Patrol spokesman Chris Loftis said he hoped the apparently peaceful day reflected some soul-searching among Americans.“I would love to say that its because weve all taken a sober look in the mirror and have decided that we are a more unified people than certain moments in time would indicate,” he said.The security measures were intended to safeguard seats of government from the type of violence that broke out at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, when far-right Trump supporters galvanised by his false claims that the election had been stolen from him overran the police and bashed their way into the building while Congress was certifying the Electoral College vote.The attack left a Capitol police officer and four others dead. More than 125 people have been arrested over the insurrection.Dozens of courts, election officials and Trumps own attorney general have all said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the presidential race.On Sunday, some statehouses were surrounded by new security fences, their windows were boarded up, and extra officers were on patrol. Legislatures generally were not in session over the weekend.Tall fences also surrounded the U.S. Capitol. The National Mall was closed to the public, and the mayor of Washington asked people not to visit. Some 25,000 National Guard troops from around the country are expected to arrive in the city in the coming days. U.S. defense officials told The Associated Press those troops would be vetted by the FBI to ward off any threat of an insider attack on the inauguration.The roughly 20 protesters who showed up at Michigan's Capitol, including some who were armed, were significantly outnumbered by law enforcement officers and members of the media. Tensions have been running high in the state since authorities foiled a plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last year.At the Ohio Statehouse, about two dozen people, including several carrying long guns, protested outside under the watchful eyes of state troopers before dispersing as it began to snow.Kathy Sherman, who was wearing a visor with “Trump” printed on it, said she supports the president but distanced herself from the mob that breached the U.S. Capitol."Im here to support the right to voice a political view or opinion without fear of censorship, harassment or the threat of losing my job or being physically assaulted,” she said.Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said he was pleased with the outcome but stressed that authorities "continue to have concerns for potential violence in the coming days, which is why I intend to maintain security levels at the Statehouse as we approach the presidential inauguration.”Utah's new governor, Republican Spencer Cox, shared photos on his Twitter account showing him with what appeared to be hundreds of National Guard troops and law enforcement officers standing behind him, all wearing masks. Cox called the quiet protests a best-case scenario and said many ”agitating groups" had cancelled their plans for the day.At Oregon's Capitol, fewer than a dozen men wearing military-style outfits, black ski masks and helmets stood nearby with semiautomatic weapons slung across their bodies. Some had upside-down American flags and signs reading such things as “Disarm the government.”At the Texas Capitol, Ben Hawk walked with about a dozen demonstrators up to the locked gates carrying a bullhorn and an AR-15 rifle hanging at the side of his camouflage pants. He condemned the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and said he did not support Trump.“All we came down here to do today was to discuss, gather, network and hang out. And it got blown and twisted completely out of proportion,” Hawk said.At Nevada's Capitol, where demonstrators supporting Trump have flocked most weekends in recent months, all was quiet except for a lone protester with a sign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-swearing-in-heavily-fortified-statehouses-around-us-see-small-protests-101610940836797.html

Several governors declared states of emergency, and others closed their capitols to the public until after Biden's inauguration.Some legislatures also cancelled sessions or pared back their work for the coming week.Even before the violence at the Capitol, some statehouses had been the target of vandals and angry protesters during the past year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/small-numbers-of-protesters-gather-at-fortified-us-capitols-101610938829146.html
18-01-2021||World||WHO team probes coronavirus origin in Wuhan; says 'world may never find patient zero'||The World Health Organization's emergency committee called Friday for globally-ramped up coronavirus sequencing studies in order to combat troubling new variants stalking the globe.The meeting was dragged forward by two weeks for urgent talks on the emerging, seemingly more contagious strains of the virus, as the death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic topped two million, according to an AFP count.The emergency committee came out against countries requiring proof of vaccination from incoming international travellers.However, it said it was time to overhaul recommendations on travel guidance given what was now known about the virus.The WHO said it wanted Covid-19 vaccination under way in every country within the next 100 days, amid concerns that rich nations are hogging the first batches coming off the production lines.And while it sounded the alarm on a new virus variant circulating in Brazil, the WHO warned that the current infection spikes in some countries could be blamed on lapses in behaviour rather than simply the new mutations.Variants and vigilanceThe recently-discovered variants can only be identified by sequencing their genetic code -- an analysis that is not possible everywhere."On variants, (the committee) called for a global expansion of genomic sequencing and sharing of data, along with greater scientific collaboration to address critical unknowns," the WHO said in a statement after the virtual meeting.The committee also called on the WHO to come up with a standardised system for naming new variants to keep them geographically and politically neutral, in a bid to avoid stigmatisation.In its epidemiological bulletin earlier this week, the WHO said the coronavirus mutation first found in Britain had spread to 50 territories, while a similar South African-identified strain has now been found in 20.A third mutation originating in the Brazilian Amazon, is currently being analysed and could impact the immune response, according to the WHO.The situation in northern Brazil's Amazonas state, and particularly its capital Manaus, has deteriorated significantly, with hospitals pushed to the limit said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan."If this continues, we are going to see a wave that is greater than what was a catastrophic wave in April and May in Amazonas," he told a press conference in Geneva.But Ryan stressed it was "too easy to just lay the blame on the variant" -- saying people and authorities need to accept their share of responsibility for their actions which were driving up transmission.Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's Covid-19 technical lead, added: "This virus is dangerous on its own -- variant or not."'Defining moment'On travel, the emergency committee recommended that countries do not require proof of vaccination from incoming travellers, given that the impact of vaccines on reducing transmission is not yet known and the availability of vaccines remains limited.Committee chairman Didier Houssin said that given the disparity of countries' approaches to visas, quarantine and travel bans, it is "really time" for the WHO to reassess what guidance could be provided on international air, land and sea travel.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the world was at a "defining moment in the pandemic", as he called for vaccines to be distributed equitably across the globe.Some 46 countries have started their vaccination campaigns, of which 38 are high-income nations."I want to see vaccination under way in every country in the next 100 days so that health workers and those at high risk are protected first," Tedros said.The first cluster of Covid-19 cases was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan in China.A WHO team of experts arrived in Wuhan on Thursday to start an investigation into the origins of the virus."We may never find who the patient zero was," said Van Kerkhove.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-probes-coronavirus-origin-in-wuhan-says-world-may-never-find-patient-zero-101610935040072.html
18-01-2021||World||In last blow to China, Trump admin halts Huawei suppliers||The Trump administration notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel, that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the Chinese company and intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the telecommunications firm, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.   The action - likely the last against Huawei Technologies under Republican President Donald Trump - is the latest in a long-running effort to weaken the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which it says is a threat to US national security and foreign policy interests.   The notices came amid a flurry of US efforts against China in the final days of Trump's administration. Democrat Joe Biden will take the oath of office as president on Wednesday.An Intel Corp spokesman had no immediate comment, and a Commerce Department spokesman did not immediately return requests for comment.In an email seen by Reuters documenting the actions, the Semiconductor Industry Association said on Friday the Commerce Department had issued "intents to deny a significant number of license requests for exports to Huawei and a revocation of at least one previously issued license." Sources familiar with the situation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was more than one revocation. One of the sources said eight licenses were yanked from four companies.Japanese flash memory chip maker Kioxia Corp had at least one license revoked, two of the sources said. The company, formerly known as Toshiba Memory Corp, could not immediately be reached for comment.The semiconductor association's email said the actions spanned a "broad range" of products in the semiconductor industry and asked companies whether they had received notices.    The email noted that companies had been waiting "many months" for licensing decisions, and with less than a week left in the administration, dealing with the denials was a challenge.   A spokesman for the semiconductor group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Companies that received the "intent to deny" notices have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise the companies of any change in a decision or it then becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal.The United States put Huawei on a Commerce Department "entity list" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling US goods and technology to the company.But some sales were allowed and others were denied while the United States ratcheted up the restrictions against the company, including expanding US authority to require licenses for sales of semiconductors made abroad with American technology.Before the latest action, some 150 licenses were pending for $120 billion worth of goods and technology, which had been held up because various US agencies could not agree on whether they should be granted, a person familiar with the matter said.Another $280 billion of licenses for goods and technology for Huawei still have not been dealt with, the source said, but now face a higher likelihood of denial.An August rule said that products with 5G capabilities were likely to be denied, but sales of less sophisticated technology would be decided on a case-by-case basis.The United States made the latest decisions during a half dozen meetings starting on Jan. 4 with senior officials from the departments of Commerce, State, Defense and Energy, the source said. The officials developed detailed guidance with regard to which technologies were capable of 5G, and then applied that standard, the person said.By doing that, the officials denied the vast majority of the roughly 150 disputed applications, and revoked the eight licenses to make those consistent with the new denials, the source said.The US action came after pressure from a recent Trump appointee in the Commerce Department, Corey Stewart, who wanted to push through hard-line China policies after being hired for a two-month stint in the agency at the end of the administration.The United States has targeted Huawei in other ways during the administration. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada in December 2018, on a US warrant. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the company itself were indicted for misleading banks about the company's business in Iran.Meng has said she is innocent. Huawei has denied the claims of spying and has pleaded not guilty to the indictment, which also includes charges of violating US sanctions against Iran and conspiring to steal trade secrets from American technology companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-last-blow-to-china-trump-admin-halts-huawei-suppliers-101610929460346.html

"Because we're not leaving here. We're going to carry on. I want to get through because it's horrible in our country. There's nothing in Honduras."The coronavirus pandemic has battered Honduras' economy, which last year suffered its worst contraction on record.The large contingent of Guatemalan security officers managed to stop the migrants from advancing beyond Vado Hondo, with perhaps as many as half of the people in the caravan dispersing into the nearby hills or heading back the way they came, according to a Reuters witness.Elmer Espinal is traveling with his months-old daughter. He said they were tear gassed by the Guatemalan security forces."My daughter almost choked," said Espinal, a Honduran native. "I want a future for my girls ... there's no work over there in Honduras."Authorities sent buses and trucks for migrants who wanted to voluntarily return home."They keep trying to pass, but we're not allowing them to," said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's immigration agency.Even if the migrants do get past, Mexico is preparing to stop them at its southern border with hundreds of security forces, arguing it must contain the spread of the virus.Guatemalan authorities said that after they administered coronavirus tests, one Honduran migrant tested positive for Covid-19.The robust response suggests that Democratic President-elect Joe Biden may initially benefit from the hard-line policies of outgoing Republican President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority of his administration.Video footage shared by the Guatemalan government showed hundreds of migrants, bounded by a hillside, pressing into a wall of security forces, which used sticks to repel the surge. An unspecified number of people were injured, authorities said.During the chaotic melee, security forces fired off a tear gas canister and used a stun grenade to disperse the crowd, a Reuters photographer said.Between Friday and Saturday, Guatemala had sent back almost 1,000 migrants entering from Honduras, the Guatemalan government said, as the caravan tried to advance toward Mexico.On Saturday evening, the Mexican foreign ministry pressed Central American authorities to halt the caravan's progress, pointing to the need to contain the spread of Covid-19.Mexico, it said, was committed to orderly and regulated migration and would oppose any form of unauthorized entry.The first migrant caravan of the year comes less than a week before Biden takes office on Wednesday promising to adopt a more humane approach to migration than Trump.Still, a Biden transition official, speaking on background, advised people not to make for the United States."Overcoming the challenges created by the chaotic and cruel policies of the last four years, and those presented by Covid-19, will take time," said the official."In the meantime, the journey to the United States remains extraordinarily dangerous, and those in the region should not believe anyone peddling the lie that our border will be open to everyone next month," the official added.The incoming administration will work to address the root causes of migration, expand lawful pathways and rethink asylum processing, the official said.Mexican and Central American authorities have coordinated security and public health measures in a bid to deter mass movement of people across the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guatemalan-forces-clash-with-migrant-caravan-biden-team-seeks-to-halt-exodus-101610928668727.html
18-01-2021||World||Fragile Italian government faces do-or-die votes in parliament||Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte faces two days of parliamentary votes that will decide if his fragile coalition can cling to power or has lost its majority, pushing Italy into deeper political turmoil.Conte will address the lower house on Monday and the upper house, the Senate, on Tuesday about the future of his government after a junior partner quit the cabinet in a row over his handling of the twin coronavirus and economic crises.Votes will be held in both chambers, with Conte struggling to fill the hole left by the defection of former premier Matteo Renzi and his small Italia Viva party.Attention is especially focused on the 321-seat Senate, where Conte could be 10 votes short of an absolute majority after his efforts to persuade centrists in opposition ranks to rally to his side looked to have failed.Renzi has said his 18 senators will probably abstain on Tuesday. If they do, the coalition will likely win the ballot, but without an absolute majority, the government will be inherently instable and it is not clear if President Sergio Mattarella would let Conte limp on in such a scenario.Further muddying the waters, the co-ruling Democratic Party (PD), will want a cabinet reshuffle and a renegotiation of the coalition pact should the prime minister overcome the challenge in parliament, said a PD official who declined to be named.Italia Viva has said it would return to the coalition if its policy demands are met. "Our problems can be sorted out in two hours," party lawmaker Ettore Rosato told Sky Italia TV.However, both the centre-left PD and its coalition ally, the 5-Star Movement, have said they want nothing more to do with Renzi, accusing him of betrayal.There also seems little chance that 5-Star will accept a key Renzi demand - that Italy apply for a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - to help its health service deal with COVID-19. The pandemic has killed almost 82,000 Italians, the sixth highest toll in the world."I will never vote for a government that considers itself the best in the world, that has seen 82,000 deaths and has not taken the ESM," Renzi told state broadcaster RAI on Sunday.Critics of the loan scheme say it could come with unwelcome conditions and note that no other EU state has tapped the fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fragile-italian-government-faces-do-or-die-votes-in-parliament-101610928431045.html
18-01-2021||World||Anxious US sees subdued weekend after girding for unrest||Smothered in security ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration, the US and state capitals remained mostly peaceful Sunday despite law enforcement’s concerns about widespread protests and violence.Officers from the federal Bureau of Prisons patrolled the sidewalks along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, which connects the White House and Capitol Hill, the scene of chaos on Jan. 6. Workers erected extra fencing around FBI headquarters. The National Mall, typically a flurry of tourist activity, remained in full lockdown as stunned Washingtonians said the barriers, checkpoints and National Guard troops resembled a scene out of wartime Iraq.Across the country, most protests were subdued, even in places where demonstrators came with weapons -- like in Michigan, one of six states where the FBI had warned last week of the potential for large-scale, armed unrest.“I’m out here essentially to be peaceful and also show people that even armed protesters can be peaceful,” said a protester who called himself Preacher outside the state capitol in Lansing. Carrying an assault rifle and several magazines of ammunition on his chest, he said he supported President Donald Trump but refused to give his real name.“The majority of us are peaceful and condemn the riots at the Capitol building,” he said, adding that the turnout was thin because many right-wing groups had advised people to stay away.In recent days, some armed groups called on members to overwhelm law enforcement. But they may have been spooked by authorities’ response to the Capitol seizure, said Jared Holt of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. With more than 100 of those who attacked the Capitol arrested, purported plans to attack state capitols have been replaced with calls for peaceful protest.In both publicly accessible social media channels and private platforms, users were expressing a commitment to avoiding physical conflict. Holt and other researchers are hopeful that Sunday’s muted protests portend well for Wednesday’s inauguration.“Even in extremist communities, there’s a really big push to discourage attendance at state capitol protests,” he said. “I can’t pretend to have a crystal ball, but what we’re seeing play out so far today is reassuring.”The crowds who turned out in Michigan on Sunday to oppose Biden’s inauguration were small -- fewer than 100 people -- compared with those that gathered in May to protest quarantine orders by Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who also was the target of a kidnapping plot foiled months later.Lansing Mayor Andy Schor, a Democrat, said he was pleasantly surprised the protest was tame, but stressed that police and the National Guard will remain on duty.“We heard people wanted to inflict chaos on our city, and we wanted to be prepared,” Schor said in a telephone interview. “I’d rather be over-prepared. Up to now, I’m glad we have a nonviolent protest. We’ll stay vigilant.”Insurrection? Sedition? Incitement? D.C. Riot Guide: QuickTakeIn Salem, Oregon, a handful of armed demonstrators gathered outside the Capitol on Sunday morning. Conditions remained civil even when counterprotesters showed up, according to the Oregonian newspaper.At a small protest in Salt Lake City, shouts of “You are redcoats!” were directed at Utah National Guard and police stationed at the Capitol, according to local TV station KUTV. One of the 20-some demonstrators, some of whom were armed, said through a bullhorn: “We do not support keeping the dictator Donald Trump in office.”In Madison, Wisconsin, National Guard troops armed with automatic weapons, shields and body armor deployed near the Capitol. A man who drove a vehicle up the steps of the building was arrested overnight for driving while intoxicated, but no political motivations were cited in the incident.In Georgia’s Capitol in downtown Atlanta, an expected armed militia rally never materialized after the building was heavily fortified with National Guard troops and vehicles parked in front of all entrances. And an expected march in the city by gun-rights supporters didn’t occur.As a gentle snow fell Sunday in Montpelier, the capitol of Vermont, troopers patrolled a mostly deserted landscape by the gilded dome of the state house.About 50 counterprotesters gathered at City Hall, They were hardly a fearsome presence, according to a reporter from the Burlington Free Press. The demonstrators waved at passersby and ate pancakes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anxious-us-sees-subdued-weekend-after-girding-for-unrest-101610928098302.html
18-01-2021||World||Russia detains Vladimir Putin critic Alexei Navalny on return to Moscow||Russian police detained opposition leader Alexei Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, as he arrived in Moscow after being treated in Germany for poisoning, an arrest that’s set to pose an early test for Joe Biden’s incoming administration.Navalny, 44, was met by officers at passport control as he landed in Moscow on a plane from Berlin Sunday, according to a live video feed on his YouTube channel. The Federal Penitentiary Service said he had been detained for violating the terms of a suspended sentence, state-run Tass reported.Navalny, whose anti-corruption exposes and success in galvanizing anti-government votes have increasingly needled the authorities, had been recovering in Germany from a nerve-agent attack in August that he and Western governments blamed on Putin.“This is my home,” he told reporters who’d traveled with him Sunday shortly before he was detained. “I’m not scared of anything.” Navalny boarded the flight knowing that he could face a lengthy prison term if he returned.He kissed his wife, Yuliya, goodbye before walking off with police. Authorities said he would be held pending a court decision on his sentence this month.Dozens of his supporters were detained by police at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport, where he had appealed to them to meet him. The flight was diverted to another airport shortly before arrival.The move to imprison the most prominent opponent of the Russian president marks the biggest crackdown by Putin in recent years. Coming days before U.S. President-elect Biden takes office, it could trigger an immediate clash with the new Democratic administration.Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, blasted the Kremlin and called for Navalny’s release, a demand echoed by the European Union. State Department officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Navalny returned home amid rising political tension ahead of Russian parliamentary elections this autumn and support for the Kremlin falters amid the coronavirus downturn. Putin, 68, whose two-decade rule makes him the longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, last year overturned term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Speculation that he may step down far sooner is building.“There were only two choices for Navalny -- to stay in Germany or come home. If he remained an émigré, in Russia people would quickly lose interest in him,” said Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. “His calculation is he’ll become a symbol of resistance behind bars and a big risk for Putin.”European Council President Charles Michel, who speaks for the European Union on foreign affairs, called Navalny’s detention “unacceptable.” It’s “yet another attempt to intimidate the democratic opposition in Russia,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Facebook.Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are calling on the EU to “consider imposition of restrictive measures” on Russia if Navalny isn’t freed, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Twitter.Russia issued an arrest warrant for Navalny after accusing him of violating the conditions of a 3 1/2 year suspended fraud sentence by not appearing in person for regular summons. It asked a Moscow court on Jan. 11 to replace it with a prison term. The opposition politician also potentially faces separate charges of embezzlement punishable by as many as 10 years in prison.While for years Navalny was repeatedly jailed for weeks at a time and faced assaults on the street -- at one point nearly losing his eye -- the poisoning attack marked the most serious attempt to kill him. Russia denied any involvement and said it found no proof the opposition politician was poisoned, accusing him of fabricating it as part of working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.With Navalny ignoring the threat to arrest him, the Russian authorities’ response looks set to further sour ties with a once-close partner, Germany, and other European states led by France.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country offered treatment to Navalny after his near-fatal poisoning during a campaign trip to Siberia, visited him in the hospital and provided personal security guarantees. The EU sanctioned six Russian officials in October for the use of the banned Novichok chemical weapon in the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-critic-alexei-navalny-detained-by-russia-on-return-to-moscow-101610927751124.html
