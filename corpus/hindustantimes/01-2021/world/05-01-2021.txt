05-01-2021||World||China has been waging ‘cognitive warfare’ against Taiwan, warns think tank||China has been waging “cognitive warfare” against Taiwan by using misinformation and an army of online trolls as weapons to sway public opinion in Beijing’s favour, a local think tank reported.The report was published by the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a government-funded think tank. It asserted that the effect of the warfare had been limited due to strong-anti Beijing sentiment, however, urged the Taiwan government to remain on guard in case it started to influence public sentiment to the extent that it influenced policy decisions, reported South China Morning Post.The think tank said that Beijing was trying to use both officials and unofficial channels, including Taiwanese and international media organisations and social media, to feed the public disinformation in an attempt to stoke resentment towards President Tsai Ing-wen’s government.“The cognitive warfare launched by the Chinese Communists became more aggressive in 2020 as reflected by its employment of social media platforms to spread misinformation and create cognitive confusion through stepping up of military intimidation,” the think tank said in its annual report issued in late December.China has tried to sell Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” as a model for cross-strait unification - a mission mainland leader Xi Jinping hopes to accomplish before he leaves office - but seeing what has happened to Hong Kong has scared Taiwanese away and undermined the efforts to sway opinion, Su Tzu-yun, a senior researcher at the institute, said.“The growing military intimidation of Taiwan and the introduction of the national security law that abuses human rights and sabotages the so-called ‘one country, two systems’ in Hong Kong serves only to create a counter effect as people in Taiwan become more resentful of Beijing than ever,” said Su.He said the government should set up a comprehensive fact-checking system to prevent misinformation.Alexander Huang Chieh-cheng, a professor of international relations and strategic study at Tamkang University in Taipei, said: “Cognitive warfare is part of the ‘grey zone conflict’ targeting the human brain to deceive, alter the enemy’s perceptions, and crush the will to defend via cyberspace, traditional media and shows of force (short of waging war).”He said the growing anti-Beijing sentiment in Taiwan had expanded the psychological distance across the Taiwan Strait.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.For several months, China’s People’s Liberation Army has been increasing military pressure on the island, sending warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone and stepping up military exercises on nearby islands, moves widely interpreted as a threat to Taipei, reported CNN.In order to bolster its defensive capabilities, Taiwan is building a submarine fleet to mitigate Chinese nefarious designs to invade the island or install a naval blockade.Chinese President Xi Jinping has already made his intentions clear about Taiwan as he has vowed to never allow the island to become independent and has refused to rule out the use of force if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-been-waging-cognitive-warfare-against-taiwan-warns-think-tank/story-mZHXiKnj9qK0riir7tnApK.html

(KFCC), saying it specialized in the manufacture of carbon materials and provided thousands of metric tonnes of materials to Iranian steel companies between December 2019 and June 2020.Among the 12 Iranian companies blacklisted are the Pasargad Steel Complex and the Gilan Steel Complex Co, both of which were designated under Executive Order 13871 for operating in the Iranian steel sector.The others are: Iran-based Middle East Mines and Mineral Industries Development Holding Co (MIDHCO), Khazar Steel Co, Vian Steel Complex, South Rouhina Steel Complex, Yazd Industrial Constructional Steel Rolling Mill, West Alborz Steel Complex, Esfarayen Industrial Complex, Bonab Steel Industry Complex, Sirjan Iranian Steel and Zarand Iranian Steel Co.The Treasury said it was also designating MIDHCO’s Germany-based subsidiary GMI Projects Hamburg GmbH, its China-based World Mining Industry Co Ltd and UK-based GMI Projects Ltd for being owned or controlled by MIDHCO.“The Trump Administration remains committed to denying revenue flowing to the Iranian regime as it continues to sponsor terrorist groups, support oppressive regimes, and seek weapons of mass destruction,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. Trump’s term ends on Jan. 20, when Democrat President-elect Joe Biden is to be sworn in to succeed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-iran-with-fresh-sanctions-as-trump-term-nears-end/story-4Me2JwZi8KW32QZynrZkpI.html

Its efforts however have not paid off and the app currently only has 2% of China’s music streaming market, behind KuGou Music, QQ Music, KuWo, and NetEase Cloud Music, according to Beijing-headquartered data intelligence company TalkingData.Xiami’s closure also comes after Chinese regulators announced that they had launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, which beyond its core e-commerce business also operates in sectors such as financial services, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.However, it does not mark the end to Alibaba’s participation in the online streaming market. In September 2019, Alibaba invested $700 million in one of Xiami’s competitors, NetEase Cloud Music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-alibaba-to-shut-down-xiami-music-app-next-month/story-S1Q6kzKkOt4Q4aQUvVIwfI.html
05-01-2021||World||US Attorney in Eastern Virginia announces resignation||The leader of one of the nation’s most prominent US Attorney’s offices said Tuesday he is resigning after nearly three years of prosecuting terrorists, spies and political operatives.G. Zachary Terwilliger, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is joining the private sector with a post at the Vinson and Elkins law firm.Terwilliger, 39, is the youngest US Attorney in the country and has led the office since 2018, but his connections to the office go back to 1999, when he worked there as an intern. He also served for years there as a line prosecutor.It is common for US attorneys to resign their posts during presidential transitions, giving the new president an opportunity to appoint his own prosecutors.The office routinely handles high-profile prosecutions. Last year, the office obtained indictments against accused Islamic state members Alexanda Amon Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, British nationals known as the “Beatles” because they were two members of an English-accented foursome that allegedly participated in holding and executing Western hostages.Building the case and bringing the pair to Virginia required years of work, domestically and internationally, with competition from other US Attorney offices looking to build the case.“To have those two individuals sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia — innocent until proven guilty — but to have them here on US soil knowing everything that went into the charges being built, getting the evidence we needed from the U.K. and then the lengths to make sure they were safely in custody during a global pandemic ... Iogistically, that was probably one of most difficult cases I’ve ever seen,” he said.Terwilliger, a Republican whose father, George Terwilliger, was a a deputy attorney general and acting attorney general in GOP administrations, is leaving at a time when the Justice Department faces criticism that it became politicized during the Trump administration and particularly under US Attorney General William Barr.Terwilliger said he expects some people will always hold it against him that he was an appointee of President Donald Trump, but he does not think most people feel that way, and he said his independence as a prosecutor was never compromised.“I didn’t see things done out of politics,” he said in an interview. “I can’t think of a single instance where someone turned around said ‘You will do this. This is your decision.’”Before his time as US Attorney, he served as chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote the memo that laid out justification for firing FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, when most people believe Trump wanted Comey fired for pursuing the investigation into Russian election interference.Rosenstein’s memo specifically faulted Comey for a news conference he held in 2016, without informing the attorney general, that the investigation had concluded with insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges, but still commenting that Clinton and her team had been “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information.“We all shared in the same belief that that press conference was highly inappropriate and just wrong,” Terwilliger said. “Those reasons were absolutely legitimate. .. The FBI director is not an independent contractor. There’s an org chart. He or she may be appointed for 10 years but they report to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, and that was the problem with what Director Comey did.”National security cases like the Beatles prosecution, and successful espionage prosecutions of Chinese spies Kevin Mallory and Jerry Lee, have always been a priority in the Eastern District of Virginia, home to the Pentagon and CIA. Terwilliger also sought to make violent crimes and white-collar crimes a priority. He brought multiple fraud cases related to the coronavirus pandemic. He focused on violent crimes in the Tri-Cities region south of Richmond and in Hampton Roads, where he says some beleaguered communities needed federal partners to help chip away at unacceptable crime rates.“He helped put actual boots on the ground here in Petersburg. He traveled to the city, walked the streets and met with citizens, and ensured them that he was committed to providing the city with the necessary resources,” said Petersburg police Chief Travis Christian in a statement.Sometimes his priorities drew criticism. Early in his tenure, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema criticized the number of cases he brought for illegal entry into the US Terwilliger, though, defended the policy, saying the majority of those cases originated because of some other underlying crime, like domestic violence or drunken driving.Terwilliger’s resignation takes effect Jan. 15. First Assistant Raj Parekh will serve as acting US Attorney and is the first minority to lead the office in its 232-year history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-in-eastern-virginia-announces-resignation/story-NaKBBFcxzHdPUj7ocOSJkK.html

05-01-2021||World||Georgia votes to decide who controls Senate||The US state of Georgia will wrap up polling on Tuesday evening in two key elections that will determine which party will control the 100-member Senate.If Democrats win both the seats that are up for grabs, the Senate will have a split majority of 50 seats each for the two parties, which will put Democrats in control of the chamber – given that the tie-breaking vote will come from vice president-elect Kamal Harris, a Democrat. Democrats already control the House of Representatives. President-elect Joe Biden will have an easier time pursing his legislative agenda if his party wins these two seats in Georgia.If Republicans win the two seats, the GOP will continue to hold sway over the Senate that they currently control.Democrats Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Reverend Raphael Warnock, a preacher, are running to unseat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.“Georgia, there is no one in America with more power to make it happen than you, the citizens of Georgia,” Biden said at an election rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Monday. “By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the Senate, we’ll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs and health care and justice and the environment and so many other things.”More than 3 million voters in Georgia have already cast their votes in the runoff election through early in-person and mail-in voting.Also Read | Georgia’s economic might on display in race to control SenatePresident Donald Trump held an election rally for Loeffler and Perdue, who is in quarantine after exposure to a person infected with Covid-19, in another part of the state. He spent more time airing unproven claims of election fraud that he has alleged caused his defeat in the state, a Republican stronghold.“Hello, Georgia. By the way, there is no way we lost Georgia. There’s no way,” Trump said as he took the stage. “That was a rigged election. But we are still fighting it.”The outgoing US president used the rally to drum up support from Republicans for his election fraud charges that lawmakers allied to Trump are planning will cite on Wednesday to force congress to overturn his poll defeat. The Senate and the House will meet in a joint session to certify election results sent in by the states - the last stage in the presidential election process. The efforts are expected to fail because they don’t have the numbers and or the constitutional authority to block the certification of Biden’s victory. Many Republicans, too, are opposed to this bid.Trump will also address a rally in Washington, DC to further his case. The US capital is bracing for violence, and as his supporters have begun arriving there, city officials have called in the National Guard, arrested a leader of the group Proud Boys, and prohibited firearms at the site of the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-votes-to-decide-who-controls-senate/story-iN8mDe7fbtkef5h7bwH3VK.html

Representatives for YouTube didn’t respond to requests for comment, and it’s not yet clear what triggered the suspension.Blocking a news brand run by billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch marks one of YouTube’s highest profile suspensions. It’s previously taken down swathes of content including the account of the Trump-supporting One America News Network, citing breaches of rules.Murdoch’s News Corp. bought TalkRadio’s owner Wireless Group in 2016, and has recently expanded its digital broadcast media offering further. He’s been an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley technology firms as he pushes for what he deems a fairer share of their advertising revenue.TalkRadio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer complained about the move on Twitter. Without naming YouTube specifically, she asked government Minister Michael Gove about big tech “censorship” on her Tuesday morning show.TalkRadio calls itself the “home of free speech” in its Twitter biography and its presenters have questioned the wisdom of government lockdown measures aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.“We regularly interrogate government data and we have controls in place,” TalkRadio said. “We use verifiable sources and give space to a careful selection of voices and opinions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-suspends-murdoch-backed-radio-station-in-uk/story-8oT8agl7DEQ5OeFLg0H6wO.html
05-01-2021||World||Divorces and marriages tumbled in US during Covid, study shows||The number of Americans getting divorced plummeted last year, while the marriage rate also dropped precipitously as thousands of weddings were postponed or cancelled, according to a new study.The early look at Covid-19’s effect on US divorce and marriage statistics comes from Bowling Green State University’s Center for Family and Demographic Research, which analyzed five states that have released monthly numbers for much of last year.The data contradict early predictions that Covid-19 and the stresses of quarantine would cause divorce rates to surge.In Florida, the largest state analyzed, marriage numbers from March through September were 33% lower than researchers would have expected based on previous years’ trends. Divorces in the Sunshine State dropped 28%.If trends in Florida and other states -- Arizona, New Hampshire, Missouri, and Oregon -- were repeated nationwide, the US had an estimated “shortfall” of 339,917 marriages and 191,053 divorces, according to the paper by Bowling Green’s Wendy Manning and Krista Payne. In 2019, there were roughly 2.2 million marriages in the US, and about 1 million divorces.The sharp decline in divorce doesn’t mean couples are necessarily happier together in lockdown. Instead, the pandemic may be forcing dissatisfied spouses to stay together for practical reasons.“Divorce can be expensive, and couples may be reluctant while facing economic uncertainty and/or health issues,” said Manning, a sociology professor who’s director of the Center for Family and Demographic Research. “These folks may feel ‘stuck’ and they could be delaying divorce until life feels more normal.”Both divorce and marriage rates have been declining for years, as Americans have changed how they approach the institution of matrimony. Young people are waiting longer to tie the knot, and many couples are forgoing marriage entirely, choosing to live together without a wedding. Those who do marry tend to be better educated and more affluent, a self-selected group that’s also likelier to stay together.In 2019, the US divorce rate was 15.5 per 1,000 married women, according to the National Center for Family & Marriage Research, down from its peak of 22.6 in 1980.A dearth of weddings and divorces in March and April of 2020 was probably inevitable. Government offices were closed and Americans were being told to stay home. However, the data don’t show a big rebound in the summer and autumn -- when states mostly re-opened -- that would reflect a large pent-up demand from the spring.One exception is Arizona, where divorce numbers did bounce back over the summer to bring the state slightly above expected levels. In New Hampshire, meanwhile, data from March through November show a 10.1% drop in marriage and a 36% plunge in divorce.In the first half of 2020, there were signs of an impending spike in divorce, with reports of a surge of filings in China as it came out of quarantine, and a disturbing rise in domestic violence arrests and calls to the police while US cities were under stay-at-home orders in March. But Manning said surveys conducted at Bowling Green show most couples report little change in the amount of conflict in their marriages.Even if couples want a divorce right now, “for lots of people, it’s just not practical,” said Linda Ravdin, an attorney at Pasternak & Fidis in Bethesda, Maryland. While couples with relatively simple divorces have been able to reach deals, she said, Covid-19 makes other negotiations difficult. Child custody decisions are hard when schools and daycare centres are closed. Financial settlements are trickier when spouses are out of work or uncertain what the economy holds for their jobs or businesses.“People are not ready to make big decisions,” Ravdin said. “People are -- to their credit -- trying to do the right thing by their children, by themselves, realizing we’re all in this predicament together.”For marriage in the US, a key question is how many weddings called off in 2020 will eventually go ahead. If a significant number don’t, Covid-19 could have a lasting impact on a generation that was already cautious about tying the knot. In 2019, Bowling Green’s figures show, there were just 30.5 marriages per 1,000 unmarried American women, about a third of the rate’s peaks in the early and mid-20th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divorces-and-marriages-tumbled-in-us-during-covid-study-shows/story-LNUJHIFvHOhQ1n81sUW7EP.html
05-01-2021||World||How safe is it to switch and space Covid-19 vaccine doses?||Britain and other nations are considering ways to stretch scarce supplies of Covid-19 vaccines, including by delaying second doses, reducing dose sizes and switching vaccine types between the first and second shots.The proposals have generated fierce debate among scientists. Here is the rationale behind, and criticism of, these alternative strategies:WHY DELAY THE SECOND DOSE?In clinical trials, companies tested specific doses of their vaccines at precise time intervals to generate evidence showing how well they work. All Covid-19 vaccines approved, so far, are designed to teach the immune system to recognise and defend against the virus with a first dose, and then provide a second booster dose to reinforce that lesson.Faced with a fast-spreading pandemic and new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, some countries are hoping to widen immunisation by giving some protection to as many people as possible with a first dose, and delaying second doses.Maximising the number of people who have partial immunity “should reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases and thus alleviate the burden on hospitals”, said Michael Head, a global health expert at Britain’s University of Southampton.WHAT ABOUT SWITCHING BETWEEN Covid VACCINES?Mixing or switching between Covid-19 vaccines is largely driven by the same aim - vaccinating as many people as possible as the pandemic still rages.Giving a priming dose of one vaccine and a booster dose of another offers flexibility to offer whichever shots are available, rather than holding shots back so individuals always get both doses of the same vaccine.HAVE THESE STRATEGIES BEEN TESTED IN RIGOROUS TRIALS?No.None of the late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trials compared these dose-sparing strategies or the effects of mixing vaccine types, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).Officials have cited limited evidence from trials that the Pfizer/BioNTech , the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and the Moderna vaccines all confer some protection against Covid-19 after the first dose.Britain’s MHRA health regulator said on Dec. 30 it had found an 80% success rate for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine when two full doses are administered, three months apart, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found.The UK government’s vaccine advisory committee said on Dec. 31 that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine conferred 89% protection from two weeks after the first dose, and that for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine “the evidence shows that the initial dose ... offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus”. It did not give detailed data.Moderna reported its vaccine was 80% protective after one dose, with efficacy peaking two weeks after the first shot.But there is no long-term evidence that any of these vaccines will offer lasting immunity based on just one dose, or how effective they will be if the second dose is delayed.BioNTech and Pfizer warned on Monday they had no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first.Evans said that ideally “it is safest and most cautious” to use vaccines in conditions exactly matching those of their trials, but added: “In the real world, this is never so.”Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday the United States was unlikely to delay giving second doses.“We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing,” he said.Likewise, scientists have raised concerns over the idea of mixing two different types of vaccines. Some experts speculate that, because all of the vaccines target the same outer “spike” protein of the virus, they could work together to train the body to fight off the virus.But there is no evidence this approach will work.“There is literally zero data. It has not been tested, or if it has been tested, the data have not been made available,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.WHAT ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF VACCINE IN EACH DOSE?In the United States, some health officials are considering offering half doses of Moderna’s vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 55. There is some clinical trial data backing this strategy.Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the U.S. vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed, told CBS on Sunday that evidence from a Moderna trial showed the half dose induced an “identical immune response” to the higher 100 microgram dose in adults aged 55 and under. He said the U.S. government was discussing the issue with Moderna and regulators.Slaoui said he believed injecting half of the volume of vaccine was “a more responsible approach that would be based on facts and data”.Several U.S. scientists agreed, but noted the data was not publicly available. “It’s very fuzzy. I want to see that data,” said Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.SO ARE THESE STRATEGIES SAFE? AND WILL THEY WORK?It’s not clear.While there is no scientific evidence on the impact of delaying Covid-19 vaccine doses, some experts believe it could be safe to wait and the potential payoff in protecting a larger swath of the population may be worth it.Others aren’t so sure.“There’s just no data,” said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain’s Reading University.The British Society of Immunology said in a statement on Monday that delaying a second dose by eight weeks “would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response”. It added that it would not expect any extra safety risks from the delay beyond the potential increased risk of disease during the interim between doses.Some scientists also said that while there was no evidence to support the strategy of mixing vaccine doses from different manufacturers - a method known as heterologous prime-boost - evidence from other vaccines provided some reassurance.“Based on previous studies which combine different vaccine types, a combination of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines is likely to be safe,” said Helen Fletcher, a professor of immunology at LSHTM.Topol called the mix-and-match strategy “a big mistake” with “unpredictable” results - including the potential for adverse reactions or a significant drop-off in efficacy. “It makes no sense whatsoever,” he said.Some worry about safety issues, particularly with delaying the second dose for several weeks. The gap could allow time for the virus to evolve and develop resistance to the vaccine.Weak antibody protection could also increase the risk of having an abnormal immune response - such as antibody-dependent enhancement - when people encounter the real virus, Topol said.HOW PRACTICAL IS IT TO PROLONG DOSING TIME SCHEDULES?Extending the interval poses adherence risks, raising the chance people may forget or fail to return for a second dose.It also increases the length of time during which they are less than optimally protected, and it could make it harder for health authorities to keep track of who has had which vaccine, when, and how often.Given these risks, immunology and public health experts say clear communication is imperative to ensure people understand that although dosing schedules may be subject to change, two Covid-19 vaccine doses are needed to give the best protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-safe-is-it-to-switch-and-space-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-iflA8aePa8M3aZrperjMbJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Pandemic haunts new year as virus growth outpaces vaccines||Despite growing vaccine access, January is looking grim around the globe as the virus resurges and reshapes itself from Britain to Japan to California, filling hospitals and threatening livelihoods anew as governments lock down businesses and race to find solutions.Mexico City’s hospitals hold more virus patients than they ever have. Germany reported one of its highest daily death tolls to date Tuesday, and South African undertakers are struggling to keep up with virus mortalities. Even pandemic success story Thailand is fighting an unexpected wave of infections.And as doctors face or brace for rising numbers of Covid-19 patients after end-of-year holiday gatherings, more and more countries are reporting cases of a new, more contagious virus variant that has already swept across Britain.January is going to be “a tough one,” Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, told The Associated Press. “This idea that seems to be ‘Ah, we’re all sick of it. We want to look at something else. Oh, this doesn’t apply to me’ .... That’s got to go away. It really is all hands on deck.”While Britain rolled out a second vaccine this week and some US states are starting to give booster shots from the country’s first vaccine, access to inoculations globally is sharply unequal. The supply also isn’t remotely close to meeting the massive demand needed to fight a microscopic foe that has already killed over 1.85 million people.“We’re at intense pandemic in Europe, intense pandemic in the US,” Harris said. “The more you can bring the transmission down, the better chance you have of your vaccine vaccination strategy working.”England is facing a third national lockdown that will last at least six weeks, as authorities struggle to stem a surge in Covid-19 infections that is threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a tough new stay-at-home order for England that takes effect at midnight Tuesday and includes shutting schools, restaurants and all non-essential shops, and won’t be reviewed until at least mid-February. Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon imposed a lockdown that began Tuesday.The two leaders said the restrictions were needed to protect the National Health Service amid the emergence of new, more contagious virus variant that has sent daily infections, hospitalizations and deaths soaring.The NHS “is going through probably the toughest time in living memory,″ said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst of the King’s Fund think-tank. He said some UK emergency rooms have waiting times of 12 hours and doctors were treating people lined up in ambulances outside.Elsewhere in Europe, Italy extended its Christmas lockdown, Spain is restricting travel and Germany’s chancellor was meeting Tuesday with state governors to decide how long to extend the latest lockdown. Cyprus and France are likely to announce tougher measures Thursday, and Ukraine is closing schools and restaurants starting Friday.In Latin America, some warn the worse is yet to come.Mexico’s capital has more virus patients than at any point in the pandemic and is flying in doctors from less hard-hit states. Its beach resorts are readying for more cases after thousands of US and European tourists visited over the holidays.“Probably in the third week of January, we are going to see the system stressed more, that there will be more ambulatory cases and cases requiring hospitalization,” said Dr. Mauricio Rodriguez of Mexico’s National Autonomous University. He blamed the rise on fatigue with social distancing, mixed messages from public figures and Mexicans lowering their guard during the holidays.Beach parties were blamed for surging cases in Argentina, notably among young people, and the government is considering new restrictions.In South Africa, the continent’s hardest-hit nation, authorities re-imposed a curfew, banned liquor sales and closed most beaches.

05-01-2021||World||Switzerland says residents who want a Covid-19 shot should get one by summer||Everyone in Switzerland who wants to be vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to get a shot by summer, a Swiss health official said on Tuesday, as the nation anticipates imminent approval of a second vaccine, this one from Moderna. With 233,000 doses delivered by Pfizer and BioNTech, so far, the country is expecting vaccine deliveries to hit at least 1.5 million doses by the end of February, provided Moderna’s shot wins the regulator’s blessing.The shots require two doses several weeks apart, to confer maximum protection shown in clinical trials to be around 95%. Switzerland is concentrating initial shots on older people, including in nursing homes, and those with chronic diseases. Switzerland has ordered a total of about 15 million doses, including from other manufacturers whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) to buy shots. High global demand from virtually everywhere, combined with limited production, means there is too little to go around.“We continue to be in negotiations, to see how we can boost volumes,” said Nora Kronig, head of the Swiss Federal Health Ministry’s international division that is leading talks with companies, during a press conference in Bern.Kronig declined to say if talks extend to companies including Johnson & Johnson, which is due shortly to release results of clinical trials of its one-dose vaccine in tens of thousands of volunteers.Switzerland has, so far, recorded 28 documented cases of Covid-19 infections caused by an especially infectious variant of the new coronavirus that has been circulating rapidly in Britain. That’s up from just a handful reported late last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-says-residents-who-want-a-covid-19-shot-should-get-one-by-summer/story-LJyd50b3fMXYiJs0Njh9qJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Japan weighs state of emergency in Tokyo area as Covid-19 cases surge||Japan will decide this week whether to impose a state of emergency in the Tokyo area, a top official said on Tuesday as daily Covid-19 infections hit a record, a move some derided as too little, too late in a nation set to host the Olympics.The government’s top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said a decision would likely come on Thursday, after local media said a state of emergency, the second since the pandemic began, would take effect by Friday and last about a month. A panel of experts advising Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga later recommended that restriction to curb a surge in coronavirus cases be imposed as soon as possible.“There is a risk of nationwide and rapid spread of infections taking place if the infection situation in Tokyo and surrounding regions does not subside,” Shigeru Omi, head of the panel, told a news conference. New cases in Tokyo surged to 1,278 on Tuesday, the second highest daily total since the pandemic began, with the national daily tally reaching a record 4,670, public broadcaster NHK reported.Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures, which have requested an emergency declaration, asked residents to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings after 8 p.m. from Friday until at least the end of the month, and said restaurants must close by that time.But measures are likely to be far less sweeping than they were during last year’s roughly month-long state of emergency, during which schools and none-essential businesses shut down, as the government seeks to keep economic damage to a minimum.A second lockdown in and around Japan’s capital could cause the economy to contract in the first quarter of this year, analysts said. Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda said the government wouldn’t seek to close all schools, leaving that decision to local authorities.Senior ruling party lawmaker Hiroshige Seko said later on Tuesday the government should declare the state of emergency for a month and later extend it if needed. Suga said on Monday that “limited, concentrated measures” would be most effective, but details remained unclear, including whether sports venues, theatres and cinemas would close.A lack of legal teeth to enforce measures means they must be couched as “requests”, although a bill may be submitted later this year to rectify this. Frustration reignsFrustration reigned on social media, with many questioning the piecemeal measures, especially as the country is still planning to host the Olympics, postponed from 2020 but set to open in under 200 days.“Do you really think you can extinguish a fire by leaving it until it’s big and then just splashing it with water from a bucket?” wrote user Kei Koike.Suga’s initial political honeymoon after taking up his post last September has ended, his support rating battered by criticism of his response to the virus and his decision to attend a group steak dinner in defiance of his own calls for caution.He has also drawn criticism for his initial reluctance to pause a domestic travel subsidy programme.“They asked us to stay home and promoted travel, they ask us to eat in small groups and promote restaurants. Their deeds are the exact opposite of their words,” wrote another Twitter user, Jinrui Minakyou.Since the start of the pandemic, Japan has recorded more than 245,000 cases and about 3,600 deaths - far fewer than many other countries. But the numbers have been climbing rapidly.Though Suga has pledged to have enough vaccine supply for the nation’s population of 126 million, Japan has yet to approve any for use and only aims to begin inoculations by the end of February.Pfizer Inc last month became the first drugmaker to apply for Japanese approval of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Japan has arranged to buy 120 million doses, or enough to inoculate 60 million people. But when those shots will be available remains unclear, as Pfizer has encountered production and roll-out snags in other parts of the world where its vaccine has already been approved for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-weighs-state-of-emergency-in-tokyo-area-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-c2SCzpRgCA96KldlgdIjBJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Fake Covid-19 vaccines are flooding the dark web as slow vaccine rollout frustrates||As millions of people await their turn to get a Covid-19 vaccine that could be months away, scammers online, in emails and on messaging apps are luring victims with claims they can deliver shots within days for as little as $150.Covid-19 vaccine scams are on the rise, according to European and US government officials who are warning the public of fraudsters out for money and personal data.A Reuters search online, in dark web forums and on messaging app Telegram found seven different offers for alleged Covid-19 vaccines.Scams include emails promising entry to supposedly secret lists for early vaccine access and robocallers impersonating government agencies. Message boards on the so-called dark web have added Covid-19 vaccines to more traditional illicit goods for sale. The US FBI and Interpol, among others, have warned of emerging pandemic-related fraud schemes, saying false cures and vaccines advertised on fake websites could pose cyber threats and a significant risk to peoples’ health, or even lives.Website domains containing the word vaccine in combination with Covid-19 or coronavirus more than doubled since October to roughly 2,500 in November, when the first legitimate vaccines were nearing regulatory approval, according to cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, which is tracking Covid-19 fraud online.“So far a lot of these domains just appear to be opportunistic registrations, but some are going to be used for phishing attempts to have people click on (malicious) links,” said Lindsay Kaye, director of operational outcomes at Recorded Future.Kaye said her team, which also scours the dark web, so far has not come across any legitimate vaccine diverted from healthcare facilities or national stockpiles.The scams are preying on concerns about the far slower-than-promised rollout of vaccines to protect against the virus that has claimed more than 1.8 million lives worldwide so far. Most people will likely have to wait well into the spring, or even summer, to get their shot.In the United States, only about 4.5 million people had received their first shot as of Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. That is a fraction of the 20 million who were supposed to have been vaccinated by the end of 2020, according to earlier government forecasts. Vaccines, guns, and moneyOn dark web forum Agartha, fake Covid-19 vaccines were offered next to cocaine, opioid medication, “super high quality fake money,” hand guns and gift cards. Posts showed stock photos of vaccines and offered vials for $500 and $1,000, or the equivalent in Bitcoin.On another dark web site, a seller claiming to be from the “Wuhan Institute of Science” offered Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for a donation, and asked buyers to provide their medical history.On Telegram, several channels claimed to offer Covid-19 vaccines, accompanied by stock images. One user offered supposed Moderna Inc vaccines for $180, and claimed the vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE could be had for $150 and AstraZeneca’s for $110 per vial.Asked how the vaccines would be shipped, the account creator said they were transported in “regulated temperature packs” and ice packs within a few days, or overnight for an additional charge. Actual Covid-19 vaccines, particularly the Pfizer/BioNTech offering, must be temperature controlled to remain effective, with drugmakers equipping shipments with temperature trackers to ensure the cold chain. Vaccine shipments and distribution are also tightly controlled by officials and will be administered at no cost.The United States has so far authorized two CovidD-19 vaccines for emergency use - the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The European Union to date has authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and is expected to clear the Moderna vaccine this week.The UK has already authorized those two and just added the vaccine developed by Oxford University with AstraZeneca.Asked about vaccine scams, Pfizer said it had taken meticulous steps to reduce the risk of counterfeiting and tracked trends very carefully.“Patients should never try to secure a vaccine online - no legitimate vaccine is sold online - and only get vaccinated at certified vaccination centers or by certified healthcare providers,” a Pfizer spokesman said in a statement.Moderna referred a request for comment to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which did not respond. AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment.The HHS, FBI and US Department of Justice have urged the public to report any Covid-19 vaccine scams, including people asking for out-of-pocket payments for the vaccine and online vaccine advertisements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-covid-19-vaccines-are-flooding-the-dark-web-as-slow-vaccine-rollout-frustrates/story-np5obyVikJ2TkLE8g65KSM.html
05-01-2021||World||EU says it will redouble efforts to save Iran nuclear deal||The European Union says it will redouble its efforts to save the Iran nuclear agreement despite what it calls Tehran’s “important breach” of commitments made in the 2015 deal by starting to enrich uranium to new levels.EU spokesman Peter Stano said that Iran’s actions “will have serious implications when it comes to nuclear nonproliferation.” Stano said it was in everyone’s interest to rescue the deal and said the 27-nation bloc “will strengthen” its attempts to make sure all adhere to the commitments made in the landmark deal.Iran began enriching uranium Monday to levels unseen since its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The decision appeared aimed at increasing Tehran’s leverage in the waning days in office for US President Donald Trump, whose unilateral withdrawal from the atomic accord in 2018 began a series of escalating incidents.Increasing enrichment at its underground Fordo facility puts Tehran a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the action was “fully reversible” if other partners in the deal fully complied too, without elaborating.Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency of its plans to increase enrichment to 20% last week.Iran’s decision to begin enriching to 20% purity a decade ago nearly triggered an Israeli strike targeting its nuclear facilities, tensions that only abated with the 2015 atomic deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-it-will-redouble-efforts-to-save-iran-nuclear-deal/story-n3kaJzYcrDUzGXMqSyznUL.html

Seven others have died.The dog was found late Monday “in good condition” in an area where rescuers had been working, said police spokesman Ivar Myrboe.“It is a joy for us and gives motivation to further work hard,” said rescuer Goeran Syversen.But just before midday Tuesday, a smaller landslide forced rescuers to evacuate the site in the village of Ask, 25 kilometer (16 miles) northeast of Oslo. No one was injured, police said. Rescuer Kenneth Wangen said the landslide was “not dramatic,” adding they were warned by drones and other rescuers. They would wait for an assessment from geologists before continuing their search.Search teams with dogs have been looking through the rubble in below-freezing temperatures while helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras flew over the ravaged hillside.The village of 5,000 people was hit Dec. 30 by the worst landslide in modern Norwegian history, which destroyed at least nine buildings with more than 30 apartments. At least 1,000 people were evacuated. Some buildings are now hanging on the edge of a deep ravine, which grew to be 700 meters (2,300 feet) long and 300 meters (1,000 feet) wide.The exact cause of the landslide isn’t yet known but the area has a lot of quick clay, which can change from solid to liquid form. Experts said the quick clay, combined with excessive precipitation and damp winter weather, may have contributed to the landslide.In 2005, Norwegian authorities warned people not to construct residential buildings in the area, saying it was “a high-risk zone” for landslides, but houses were eventually built there later in the decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dog-found-alive-raises-hopes-in-deadly-norway-landslide/story-2RHNPi6NrxTPNsfUnDsZkK.html
05-01-2021||World||‘We’d had enough’: Why are Google employees unionizing?||More than 400 employees of Google and the parent organization Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of an employees union on Monday. Dubbed the Alphabet Workers Union, it is a watershed moment in staunchly anti-union Silicon Valley, where no other union of this kind exists. This union is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a union that represents workers in telecommunications and media in the United States and Canada.The group has already received an outpouring of support with both Senator Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “I stand in solidarity with @AlphabetWorkers who are organizing to form a union at Google. What these workers are fighting for is not radical. They want fair wages and a workplace free from abuse, retaliation, intimidation and discrimination. And that is exactly what they deserve.” tweeted Sanders. Google software engineer Kimberly Wilber, an activist with the new group, told Bloomberg that the union was their way of building power “so executives can’t ignore us”. “We’d had enough,” wrote the union’s vice chair and executive chair in an op-ed piece in the New York Times. Here’s everything you need to know about what led to the formation of Alphabet Workers Union 1.The Alphabet Workers Union is a minority union because only 400 out of more than 260,000 full-time employees and contractors of the company formed the union. This means the group cannot ask the company to the bargaining table for negotiating contracts. However, the union’s primary aim lies in giving shape to the long-standing demands of employees and not simply negotiating contracts.2.The union is seen as a culmination of the 2018 walkout at Google, where some 20,000 employees staged a walkout after Google had paid tens of millions of dollars to two executives who had been accused of sexual misconduct by employees, letting the accused execs off the hook without any consequences. 3.Google has been accused of racial bias towards minority employees. Timnit Gebru, who worked as artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at Google was fired after she pointed out the racial bias inherent in the company’s AI system. The union’s vice chair Chewy Shah wrote an op-ed in the New York Times where he used Gebru’s treatment at the hands of Google as one of the reasons for unionizing. “Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offence? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale A.I. models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts,” he wrote. 4.Google employees have long criticised the company’s involvement in projects with the Pentagon and plan to launch a censored search engine in China. The New York Times reported in December that the US federal authorities had wrongfully terminated the employment of two employees who had spoken out against the company’s work with immigration authorities in 2019. 5.The union is open to all employees of all Google in North America regardless of their role and position. “We are the workers who built Alphabet. We write code, clean offices, serve food, drive buses, test self-driving cars and do everything needed to keep this behemoth running. We joined Alphabet because we wanted to build technology that improves the world. Yet time and again, company leaders have put profits ahead of our concerns. We are joining together — temps, vendors, contractors, and full-time employees — to create a unified worker voice. We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in.” said the union’s vice and executive chairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-d-had-enough-why-are-google-employees-unionizing/story-p8oZa0VjKoyzbKEPoaRlUM.html
05-01-2021||World||10 people to stand trial in deadly Brussels attacks case||Ten people including the lone known surviving suspect in the 2015 deadly Paris attacks have been ordered to stand trial in connection with the suicide bombings which killed 32 people and injured hundreds in the Brussels subway and airport nearly five years ago.According to the federal prosecutor’s office, the Brussels Chamber of the Council also decided on Tuesday that charges against three others suspects should be dismissed.Earlier this year, prosecutors requested that eight of the 13 main suspects should be referred to the criminal court of assizes — the court that tries the most serious crimes — for charges of assassinations and attempted assassinations in a terrorism context, and for belonging to a terror group.But the Council Chamber decided to refer to the court all 10 people who were ultimately charged, meaning that only one trial related to the case should take place.Among those to stand trial is Salah Abdeslam, who is also suspected of playing a major role in the Paris attacks, and Mohamed Abrini, the Brussels native who walked away from Brussels’ Zaventem airport after his explosives failed to detonate.Abdeslam was captured in Brussels on March 18, 2016, and his arrest may have prompted other members of the Islamic State group cell to rush attack plans already in motion. Four days later, suicide bombers detonated their explosives in the Brussels airport and metro during the morning rush hour. In Paris, the network of French and Belgian fighters killed 130 people in attacks at the Bataclan concert hall, the national stadium and in bars and restaurants.Around 900 people are among those who suffered physical or mental trauma in the Brussels attacks, which were claimed by IS.The case will now be transferred to the Court of Appeal, which will decide when the case will be heard by the Chamber for Indictments. A date has yet to be set for the trial, which is expected to start in the autumn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-people-to-stand-trial-in-deadly-brussels-attacks-case/story-jjlT778jI4u6sNSUczfHqL.html
05-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s Iran problem is getting worse by the day. Here’s why||Joe Biden has an Iran problem. And, it’s getting more complicated by the day.Thanks to provocative moves by Iran and less-than-coherent actions by the outgoing Trump administration, the president-elect is facing an increasingly uncertain situation when it comes to Iran, a decades-long American nemesis that has been a target of blame for much of the Middle East’s instability.In the past week alone, President Donald Trump’s team has dispatched B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to alleged Iranian attack planning and reversed an order to bring home the USS Nimitz, the only US aircraft carrier in the region.On Monday, Iran not only announced it had resumed advanced uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal but also seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker and its crew. This combustible combination coming just two weeks before the president-elect’s inauguration threatens to derail or at least delay Biden’s hopes to return the U.S. to the nuclear accord that Trump withdrew from in 2018.A look at the latest developments:Does this amount to a dangerous escalation of tensions?Concerns have run high for some weeks about Iran stoking tensions, particularly around the Jan. 3 one-year anniversary of the US killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq. US officials have been on heightened alert for possible retaliation from Iran, including from allied militia in Iraq that have previously launched rockets at US facilities in the country.Although neither the enrichment announcement nor the seizure of the South Korean-flagged ship appeared linked to the death of the general, the two moves did raise tensions in the region, which has long been unpredictable.Does military action seem likely?Part of the worry is that a single wrong move — or intentional provocation — has the potential to trigger war.There is no sign the US is planning an attack on Iran, although Trump has said he would respond to any attack by Iran or its affiliated militias in Iraq that resulted in the death of an American. The US military has long had a wide variety of weapons and troops in the Middle East that could be called on if hostilities broke out. But Trump himself has derided the idea of getting further mired in Middle East wars.The scenario that worries US military officials is Iran conducting an attack, either inside Iraq or elsewhere in the Gulf region, that would prompt Trump to retaliate, leading to escalation that could spark a wider war. That is part of the reason the US has kept an aircraft carrier in the region on a near-continuous basis since May 2019, when the White House first asserted that Iran was planning attacks on US personnel.Why would the Nimitz be ordered home, then sent back?The highly unusual Nimitz flip-flop by the acting secretary of defense, Christopher Miller, seemed to undercut US Central Command’s efforts to convince Iran that it would not pay to launch an attack on US forces.The huge vessel, with a complement of attack and support aircraft, was literally leaving the region when it received word to turn around and head back.Sending the Nimitz home had been on the table for weeks, since the carrier was on a lengthy deployment and was scheduled to be home by the end of 2020. Its tour was extended by a few weeks to provide backup for US troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. But as tensions with Iran rose in mid-December, Central Command wanted to keep the Nimitz nearby. Instead, on Dec. 31, Miller announced that he had ordered it to return home. Three days later, he reversed himself and said it would stay.Cancelling the go-home order for the Nimitz took some defense officials by surprise, suggesting that the decision may have been made at the White House rather than as a result of new arguments from military officers.What’s the point of flying B-52 bombers in the Gulf?These long-range bomber flights aren’t commonplace, but they’ve become a bit more routine in recent weeks as a show of military might. There have been three B-52 bomber missions to the region in less than two months, most recently on Dec. 30.The roundtrip flights from the United States are meant to show how quickly bombers can get to the area. They can be equipped with either conventional or nuclear missiles. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East, made the message clear this week, saying, “We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack.”What does all this mean for Biden’s Iran policy?Biden’s transition team has declined to comment in detail about the latest developments and what they may mean for their plans. But, Biden and his top national security aides have laid out their approach to Iran in broad strokes. Top of that list is bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal and then expanding that pact to take into account non-nuclear behavior that wasn’t covered by the initial agreement.Iran, however, has said it will only return to compliance if the US rejoins the deal and rescinds sanctions that Trump reimposed over the past two years. At the same time, Biden aides have said Iran cannot win sanctions relief unless and until it respects the deal.Iran’s latest actions, coupled with the Trump administration’s movement of forces, complicate diplomacy and raise the risk of miscalculation, particularly as tensions continue to run high between Iran and its neighbors.The increased tensions, which have triggered the highest alert levels for US personnel in Iraq, may make it difficult for the incoming Biden administration to pivot the military more aggressively toward Russia and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-iran-problem-is-getting-worse-by-the-day-here-s-why/story-FS8pWmNZqlZ5EtYOdMPojK.html

Sri Lanka joined the COVAX facility last year and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has accredited the nation, making it eligible to receive the vaccines through the programme.The Lanka Cabinet will sign part two of the COVAX agreement with the WHO this week, enabling the country to obtain a limited quantity of the COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of this year, according to an official statement.The signing of the second part has to be done by January 8, it said. Eligible countries are required to submit request applications under two phases to receive the vaccine facility. The first part -- which include information regarding the target group, storage capacity and technical information -- was required to be submitted before December 7 and Lanka has done it on time, the statement said.The Lankan government had earlier said that it would also opt for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia.There has been a surge in COVID-19 infections in Lanka since early October. The number of deaths which stood at just 13 till October has now passed the 200-mark.

Australian camping retailer Boating Camping Fishing store (BCF) released an advert designed to encourage people to explore their own backyard while there remain several travel restrictions around the world. In the video, a man jokes that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was caused by someone eating a bat.A spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Bureau told the BBC that the ad watchdog has received several complaints about the BCF’s commercial. The spokesperson added that Ad Standards is in the process of assessing these complaints to see if they raise an issue. A BCF spokesperson had earlier told Australian media that they understand the severity of the pandemic, adding that the camping commercial was a light-hearted marketing campaign. The YouTube video has garnered over 250,000 views so far but the bat sequence has been edited out for TV.“Over the years BCF has established a tradition of irreverent campaigns in the spirit of good-natured fun,” the spokesperson said. “They will have their detractors and we recognise that.Also Read | China doubles down on Covid-19 narrative as WHO investigation loomsWhile the initial coronavirus outbreak was reported from a wildlife market in Wuhan, there has not been any definitive proof of how the virus originated. However, preliminary studies suggested that the bats could be the source since the coronavirus present in bats has a genome that is 96 per cent identical to SARS-CoV-2.Australia was one of the first countries to a demand an independent inquiry into the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, triggering a decline in its relationship with China. China punished Australian beef producers and barley farmers in apparent retaliation and asked Chinese students to reconsider studying Down Under. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison maintained that the call for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak was reasonable and not meant to target any country. The call for a probe was followed by China launching another investigation into the alleged subsidies on Australian wine imports and, in November, Beijing imposed taxes on Australian wine of up to 212%. The commercial currently under scanner could further strain the bilateral relations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-camping-advert-of-man-eating-bat-sandwich-investigated-in-australia/story-F0dXPV3WvbgmPDtpfjQbeN.html

PM Modi also hoped that the UK would overcome Covid-19 challenges successfully, the people said, adding that both leaders reaffirmed commitment to work towards deepening bilateral relationship. The British government has been grappling with continuing spikes in Covid-19 infections, especially since the recent detection of a new and fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus. Johnson was to be the first British prime minister as the chief guest on India’s Republic Day since John Major was invited in 1993. The British PM’s India visit was expected to see a major change in bilateral relations over the next decade, as the post-Brexit UK embarks on a new path free from the obligations of being a member of the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-worries-force-uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-to-call-off-india-visit/story-ETJBL85nfEgFDoxlxSbibP.html
05-01-2021||World||Georgia’s economic might on display in race to control Senate||As Republicans and Democrats battle over who will run Georgia’s economy the best, the state itself is an example of how government intervention in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis has aided its recovery.Georgia’s economy has rebounded, and unemployment has dropped below the national average in the wake of more than $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve cutting rates to near zero. That’s lifted the housing industry, fueling development in metro Atlanta and the US carpet capital of Dalton, as well as auto manufacturing in the state. One weak spot, that none of the country escaped, has been tourism.More stimulus could be on the way with $2,000 checks for Americans if Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win, President-elect Joe Biden pledged in a campaign stop Monday. Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, by contrast, won support by President Donald Trump in a rally in Dalton, where unemployment has plunged to 5.2% from 20% in April.“Georgia has more leverage than most states from the housing boom,” said Jeffrey Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business. “We are seeing a V-shaped recovery in housing and vehicles. That is working to Georgia’s advantage.”Meanwhile, the results of the Senate race on Tuesday also could determine the near-term direction of the US economy. If Democrats gain control of the upper chamber and Congress quickly passes $2,000 stimulus checks, it would add 1.1 percentage points per quarter on annualized growth in 2021, according to Bloomberg economists.Here are some ways that economists cite that Georgia’s economy is doing well compared to much of the USEmployment“The Georgia economy is weathering the pandemic better than most other states,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Employment through November is down 3% from the pre-pandemic peak, which is less than half the over 6% drop in employment nationwide. Georgia’s unemployment rate at 5.7% is a full percentage point below the nation’s.”Industry“The Georgia economy is doing relatively well, particularly Northern Georgia,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. “The floor coverings business -- which used to be carpets but now includes hardwoods and laminates too -- is doing extremely well. The poultry industry is doing well and the state continues to attract new industry. Economic development was fairly strong this past year.”Migration“The state is less urban than the rest of the country, Atlanta notwithstanding, which has mitigated the economic fallout of the virus,” according to Zandi. “The state is also likely benefiting from the work-from-anywhere phenomena, as it attracts migrants from big urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest due its lower living costs and the allure of its resort towns on the coast.”Government Coffers“State and local governments in Georgia face less daunting fiscal challenges than in many other states. So state and local government is not the headwind to growth here that it will be in a lot of other states,” said Humphreys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-s-economic-might-on-display-in-race-to-control-senate/story-n9fMeGT1F75GuiQFGhi5IM.html
05-01-2021||World||Iran says South Korea holding $7 billion Iran funds ‘hostage’||Iran denied on Tuesday it was using a South Korean ship and its crew as hostages, a day after it seized the tanker in the Gulf while pressing a demand for Seoul to release $7 billion in funds frozen under US sanctions.The seizure of the MT Hankuk Chemi and its 20-member crew near the strategic Strait of Hormuz has been seen as an attempt by Tehran to assert its demands, just two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in the United States.Iran wants Biden to lift sanctions imposed by outgoing President Donald Trump. Tehran’s critics have long accused it of capturing ships and foreign prisoners as a method of gaining leverage in negotiations.“We’ve become used to such allegations,” Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a news conference. “But if there is any hostage-taking, it is Korea’s government that is holding $7 billion, which belongs to us, hostage on baseless grounds.”South Korea summoned the Iranian ambassador, called for the ship to be released and said it was dispatching a delegation to Iran to discuss it. Iran says the ship was held over environmental violations.Iran’s ability to challenge shipping in the Gulf is one of its main points of leverage in what is expected to be a difficult negotiation when the Biden administration takes office on Jan. 20. In 2019, Iran held a British tanker for two months.South Korea, like other countries, is required to limit Iran’s access to its financial system under the US sanctions, which were imposed by Trump after he abandoned a nuclear agreement reached with Iran under his predecessor Barack Obama.Iran says the sanctions are illegal and have hurt its economy, including its ability to respond to the worst outbreak of Covid-19 in the Middle East.Biden aims to revive the nuclear agreement, but any thaw is likely to pose a diplomatic challenge. Since Trump abandoned the deal, Iran has taken steps that violate it; Biden says Iran must be fully compliant before the deal can be restored, while Iran says Washington must first lift the sanctions.On Monday, Tehran announced it had stepped up uranium enrichment at an underground facility, its latest move in violation of the nuclear deal’s terms.Crew ‘safe’South Korea’s Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday she was making diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the tanker and had made contact with her counterpart in Tehran.Iran’s ambassador in Seoul, Saeed Badamchi Shabestari, asked about the status of the ship’s crew before his meeting at the foreign ministry, told reporters “all of them are safe”.In addition to a South Korean delegation expected to go to Iran as soon as possible to try to free the ship, South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister, Choi Jong-kun, is scheduled to visit Iran on Sunday. Iranian state TV cited a Tehran government official as saying the visit had been scheduled earlier, to discuss the frozen funds.‘Armed Soldiers’The ship’s Busan-based operator, Taikun Shipping Co. Ltd., told Reuters there had been nothing to indicate before the vessel was seized that Iranian authorities were probing possible violations of environmental rules.“If it really was marine pollution, as they say, the coastguard was supposed to approach the ship first,” Taikun’s management director, Lee Chun-hee, said by telephone. “But instead, armed soldiers approached the crew and said they needed to be investigated.”Last Sunday, the Tehran Times newspaper reported Iran was hoping to negotiate an agreement to use the frozen funds to trade for commodities, including coronavirus vaccine doses.According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, a foreign ministry official said the Iranian government had tried to secure vaccines through the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization. Tehran had been in talks with the ministry and the US Treasury to pay for the doses with South Korean won.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-south-korea-holding-7-billion-iran-funds-hostage/story-PXqKLEZ2v1GSwSr56zEy1M.html
05-01-2021||World||Speedy distribution of Covid-19 vaccine a major challenge for global govts: WHO experts||As India launches the world’s most ambitious and biggest vaccination drive against Covid-19, the country will encounter the formidable challenge of rapidly scaling up distribution of the vaccines to secure immunity for its entire population, two prominent Indian scientists at World Health Organization (WHO) have said.This daunting challenge is not only for India but also for all the governments across the globe as they start inoculating their populations to tackle the pandemic, noted Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist of WHO, and Dr Hamsadvani Kuganantham, Consultant, WHO. On Sunday, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO),India’s drugs regulator, had approved Oxford vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use for the frontline warriors and senior citizens in the country.Currently, there are 45 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 156 candidate vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation, the WHO scientists said. COVAX,a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 treatments and vaccines,is jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance set up by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and WHO. “It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure Covid-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries,” they wrote in an article for Manorama Yearbook 2021. “The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification, by the end of 2021.These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritizing healthcare workers, then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions,” the scientists pointed out.Further doses will then be made available based on a countrys need, vulnerability and Covid-19 threat.The scientists said it is equally important to ensure sustained surveillance, tracing, test and treat. “Vaccines will help us achieve herd immunity but, until then we need to keep practicing the non-pharmacological measures to prevent infection and spread,” said Dr Swaminathan and Dr Kuganantham. “What is clear is that the virus has a foothold in most parts of the world, and transmission increases as soon as public health control measures are relaxed. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing and mask-wearing will reduce spread and, ideally, keep infection and death rates down,” they observed. Quoting the global health security index published last year, they said no country is prepared to handle an epidemic or a pandemic. It concluded that most countries lack foundational health systems capacities vital for epidemic and pandemic response. With regard to reopening of schools, the scientists said schools operate not in isolation but within the community.Thus, anything that affects the community affects the schools too. Data shows that even though the schools have moved online, around 463 million children across the world have no access to remote schooling, the article said adding that education of one-third of the world’s children has been affected and one in four countries presently do not have a reopening date for their schools. “This has devastating outcomes that can affect the children for a lifetime. They will be more exposed to physical and emotional violence, more prone to be pushed to child labour, suffer sexual abuse and further intensify the cycle of poverty. We need the decision-makers to closely check the factors and ensure a safe environment for the children,” they stressed. Observing that there are many lessons from the pandemic that can be learnt to adapt and prepare for the future,the experts said, “This pandemic will come to an end, but the world needs to work together to ensure that we are better prepared next time. It is only through science and solidarity that solutions will be found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speedy-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccine-a-major-challenge-for-global-govts-who-experts/story-NaI6KpLB6E9H0pqnBumn6N.html

Interviewed by radio station 103FM, he declined to give details of the size of the shipment and said the date of its arrival was under discussion.Moderna has received authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine in the United States and Canada and additional authorisations are under review in the European Union, Singapore, Switzerland and Britain.Israel has begun to vaccinate its population at one of the quickest rates in the world, and it aims to reach all vulnerable citizens by late January. Authorities started vaccinations on December 19 using the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.Israel has also imposed a third national lockdown to fight climbing infection rates. Edelstein called for an immediate tightening of restrictions, with any final decision pending a cabinet meeting due later on Tuesday.The Bank of Israel said on Monday it expected the economy to rebound quickly in 2021 if the fast start to vaccinating people against Covid-19 was maintained.Israel, which has a population of about 9 million, has reported more than 450,000 Covid-19 cases and 3,448 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-authorises-use-of-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-D5o1KCv9nb4KpDEDnlTdMO.html

A violent face-off took place between the Indian and Chinese soldiers when a sizeable number of Chinese Army transgressed into the Indian side.Since taking over as president and head of the CMC in late 2012, Xi has consistently pushed the PLA to be prepared for war. He also initiated a massive overhaul of the PLA in 2015 to modernise the Chinese military, planned for completion in 2020, reported SCMP.In order to checkmate the US in South China Sea PLA also stepped up exercises and air force fly-by operations targeting Taiwan during 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-orders-chinese-military-to-scale-up-combat-readiness-to-act-at-any-second/story-fVhMtQ33zWIQzYxnRJd0rI.html

All his personal assets will be confiscated, the rulings said.In early 2020, Lai confessed in state TV documentary that he preferred cash payments and said he would drive trunk loads of bills to a Beijing apartment, where more than 200 million yuan was uncovered by police later. Detained in 2018, he was found to own a large number of properties, luxury watches, cars, gold and art collections.Chinese authorities are taking an increasingly tough stance on corporate malfeasance, broadening President Xi Jinping’s eight-year corruption crackdown into the nation’s boardrooms.

05-01-2021||World||Hong Kong: Amid protest and pandemic, experts warn govt of social unrest among youth||Experts have raised alarm over Hong Kong youths simmering grievances and frustration over Covid-19, which may turn into social unrest.The pent-up resentment against the government and frustration over the coronavirus pandemic among students has been described as ‘powder keg waiting to go off’, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).Lilian Cheng and Tony Cheung writing for SCMP cited an unpublished survey by two universities that found that nearly 90 per cent of students had no confidence in the government.In a survey of 250 students last year, Chinese University Professor Angel Lai Hor-yan and HKU Professor Terry Lum Yat-sang found 87 per cent reported having no confidence in the government. They warned the city could be engulfed in a crisis similar to the one that erupted two years ago over the now-withdrawn extradition bill and led to the arrest of thousands of students, reported SCMP.Amid psychological stress from a year of fighting coronavirus and unhealed wounds from 2019 protests could be a potent mix for unrest, suggested Lilian Cheng and Tony Cheung.Although students were no longer taking to the streets to protest, the administration would be wrong to believe their animosity had died down, warned Paul Yip Siu-fai, chair professor at the University of Hong Kong’s (HKU) department of social work and social administration.Yip attributed the relative calm over the past year to tough social-distancing rules that had kept people at home and the enactment of the national security law in June that threatened heavy punishments for activists.“Students are trapped at home, with limited social interactions, and the government has done little to consider their mental growth during such a difficult time,” he said.Professor Daniel Shek Tan-lei, chair professor of applied social sciences at Polytechnic University called for reconciliation between the government and the city’s youth, as well as for officials to acknowledge some of their wrongdoings to rebuild trust.“The government needs to think of ways to move forward, to reconcile with the young people,” he said.The analysts agreed Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had already taken a step towards reconciliation by promising young people who had joined the often-violent demonstrations that erupted in June of 2019 they would not be tried for their crimes if they admitted their wrongdoing and expressed contrition, reported SCMP.Since taking office in July 2017, Lam has been keen to demonstrate the government can reconnect with the city’s youth. The government’s think tank, the Central Policy Unit, was restructured as the Policy Innovation and Coordination Office and young people were encouraged to join.The Commission on Youth, an advisory body, was renamed the Youth Development Commission (YDC), with Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung appointed as chairman with the aim of improving the administration’s communication with the younger generation.Meanwhile, experts suggested authorities to ensure students return as soon as possible to classrooms and sports to help ease the psychological stress arising from confinement during the health crisis, as a short-term solution.While, in a long-term solution, they suggested the top officials’ open avenues for young people to play a greater role in shaping public policy by joining the ranks of advisory bodies, pro-establishment voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-amid-protest-and-pandemic-experts-warn-govt-of-social-unrest-among-youth/story-xKtnHNy4PvjToONnNhfRKL.html
05-01-2021||World||Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount||Germany’s disease control center on Tuesday reported 944 more Covid-19 deaths, fuelling expectations that Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors will extend the country’s lockdown until the end of the month. Germany’s latest lockdown took effect December 16 after a partial shutdown starting in early November failed to reduce the number of daily new coronavirus infections. It was initially set to expire January 10. Merkel’s meeting with the governors on Tuesday will decide how long the lockdown should go on and to what extent schools will reopen. Another topic high on the agenda will be addressing criticism of the country’s vaccination program amid frustrations over its gradual start. Vaccinations in Germany and the rest of the 27-nation European Union started over a week ago. In Germany, a nation of 83 million, nearly 265,000 vaccinations had been reported by Monday, the Robert Koch Institute said. Opposition politicians and even some within Germany’s governing coalition have criticised the EU’s cautious advance ordering of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — the only one so far cleared for use in EU nations. The EU’s medical regulator is also evaluating a vaccine by Moderna. The country’s health minister has repeatedly said that the vaccinations are progressing as expected and that the slow start is because mobile teams are first going to nursing homes to vaccinate the most vulnerable, which takes more time than inviting people to mass vaccination centers. Still, in a nod to the heavy pressure, Health Minister Jens Spahn said he has asked the country’s agency in charge of vaccinations if the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be delayed in order to be able to vaccinate more people right away with a first shot. Britain has embraced such a plan with its vaccinations, but the move is being hotly debated by scientists and governments around the world. Germany’s new infections remain at more than twice the level of 50 per 100,000 residents over seven days, which the government wants to reach. In part because of lower testing and delayed reporting, it’s not yet clear what effect the Christmas holidays will have on Germany’s new coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Germany has reported 35,518 virus-related deaths overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-set-to-extend-hard-lockdown-as-daily-deaths-mount/story-X9vYZeD6PbKcEC442U05VJ.html
05-01-2021||World||German unemployment unexpectedly fell during December lockdown||German joblessness unexpectedly declined in December, though companies were heavily dependent on government subsidies to keep workers employed through the latest lockdowns.A decrease of 37,000 left the total number of unemployed people at 2.776 million and the rate unchanged at 6.1%, according to the Federal Labor Agency. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a gain of 10,000.At the same time, applications for state wage support increased, according to labor agency chief Detlef Scheele. Some 2 million workers benefited from the government’s furlough program in November, according to the latest estimates by the Ifo Institute -- a number that is likely to rise.The country has been in a hard lockdown since the middle of last month, with most retail stores, restaurants, bars, gyms and cultural venues shut to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to announce an extension of the curbs beyond the current Jan. 10 deadline at a news conference later on Tuesday.That means labor market strains will persist in the coming weeks. Overall though, German employment has been more resilient than in other European countries, in part because of its focus on manufacturing.It’s also set to suffer less from school closures to contain the pandemic given there’s a lower share of households with children and working parents than in other European Union nations. Bloomberg Economics estimates that labor supply will fall by some 5% in Germany, compared with more than 10% in Slovenia.Euro-area jobless data is due to be released by Eurostat on Friday, with the rate forecast to have risen to 8.5% in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-unemployment-unexpectedly-fell-during-december-lockdown/story-c2u2M6EKWphu93fnE7FlvN.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19: UK announces £4.6 billion in new lockdown grants||Hours after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another six-week lockdown, chancellor Rishi Sunak on Tuesday announced £4.6 billion ($6.25 billion) in grants for companies that will be closed at least until mid-February, as new Covid-19 cases continued to spike.Calling the recent spike driven by the new variant “alarming”, Johnson clamped the third lockdown in England, effective from early Wednesday. Scotland went into a lockdown on Monday night while Wales and Northern Ireland have similar tough restrictions.Sunak said, “The new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge - and while the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve taken swift action to protect lives and livelihoods and today we’re announcing a further cash injection to support businesses and jobs until spring.“This will help businesses to get through the months ahead – and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen.”The UK government has already borrowed nearly £250 billion since early 2020 and offered help to companies to furlough employees and to the self-employed, besides concessions and grants to companies.Michael Gove, cabinet minister, admitted on Tuesday morning that the lockdown may last until March. Parliament has been recalled on Wednesday to pass related legislation for the third lockdown since March 2020.A grim-faced Johnson said on Monday night, “(We) now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible.“As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000.”He added, “That number is 40% higher than the first peak in April. On December 29, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.“With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the government is once again instructing you to stay at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-announces-4-6-billion-in-new-lockdown-grants/story-HbO4mcyu7AdrJHeE9NLsnO.html
05-01-2021||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak to set out more aid for lockdown-hit businesses||UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will announce extra financial help for businesses on Tuesday, after England entered a third national lockdown to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.The economy has already suffered the deepest recession in more than 300 years and is facing the prospect of another downturn as a result of the latest restrictions.“It’s a specific package to help businesses through a very difficult time,” Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on LBC radio. “The Chancellor will be saying more today about additional support.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England into a fresh lockdown late Monday, amid warnings that the National Health Service is at risk of being overwhelmed by soaring coronavirus infection rates.The restrictions risk devastating retail and hospitality businesses, and industry groups have pressed for more help to avert company failures. The government could also close the border to non-essential international travel in a further blow to the aviation industry.Helen Dickinson, chief executive officer of the British Retail Consortium, said 178,000 jobs have been lost in the retail sector and more could go without extra help. Businesses are losing 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) per week in lost sales, Dickinson said in an emailed statement on Monday.MakeUK, which represents Britain’s manufacturing sector, and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have also called for more government intervention.“There must now be a step change in support to equal the compensation offered during the first lockdown,” said Mike Cherry, national chair of the FSB. “The level of government grants is off the mark by an order of magnitude and has not kept the pace with events.”The U.K. Treasury announced a series of support packages through 2020 as the coronavirus crisis deepened, with the latest action being to extend the furlough program -- where the government pays 80% of the wages of workers who are unable to work -- through April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-to-set-out-more-aid-for-lockdown-hit-businesses/story-OvoVr32ij8Rv2FOrNd5HtJ.html
05-01-2021||World||China flies choppers over Lhasa in military drill to tame Tibet||China has carried out an aerial drill over the Tibet’s capital of Lhasa, a preemptive move designed to remind Buddhists scattered across the vast Himalayan plateau about the communist party’s military might that last crushed an uprising by young Tibetans ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The aerial drill comes days after the United States enacted the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 that reaffirmed the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan government-in-exile based in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala had described the US legislation as historic.A China watcher in New Delhi said the drill could be only one part of the continuing effort by President Xi Jinping to sinicise Tibet that would pick up pace in view of the new US law.Also Read: China cautions against use of ‘Tibet card’, says it will damage bilateral ties“China wouldn’t want anything to happen in Tibet that reflects support for the US law… The military drill was a preemptive move and would be followed by other steps to stem any potential dissent,” he said.Sinicisation is an attempt to wipe out religious and ethnic identities by increasing the influence of Chinese, or the culture of the majority Han community, on non-Chinese ideas and entities within China.President Xi Jinping has talked about sinicising religions in China since taking over the Communist Party of China leadership in 2012. Three years later, Xi spoke about sinicising the five major religions practised in China: Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism and Daoism. For the last few years, China has been working on a plan to redefine the practise of Islam and align the beliefs of Muslims with the communist party. Xinjiang has been a focus area where the communist regime has implemented tactics that it has practised in Tibet for years.Also Read: China violates border agreements with India, swears by 2003 pact on Tibet | AnalysisPresident Xi sees the sinicisation of Tibetan Buddhism as part of a four-point programme that he unveiled at an August meeting last year to build, what he called, an “impregnable fortress’’ to maintain stability in Tibet that is so important to Beijing because of its long border with India. That Buddhist Tibetans, despite decades of Chinese rule, still worship the Dalai Lama as a living god, has long been considered a threat by the communist party.This is why China views the US law that supports letting Tibetans decide the Dalai Lama such a risk and wants to shape his succession, and claims that the Buddhist reincarnations must “comply” with Chinese law.This compliance, however, is not unique to Buddhist Tibetans. A new rule that kicked in on 1 February last year requires all religions in China to look up to the ruling communist party for leadership and promote its policies.Analysts believe that China could order a fresh crackdown in Tibet if the communist party assesses that there is even the slightest possibility of unrest in Lhasa. Rights activists who tracked Beijing’s response to the 2008 uprising said dozens of Tibetans were killed by the military to stop the protests against China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-responds-to-us-law-on-tibet-with-military-drill-over-lhasa/story-4WPewBatJNsig0Qn2JSZQM.html
05-01-2021||World||Peace talks to resume under shadow of targeted Afghan killings||Battling a resurgence in violence including a campaign of targeted killings of journalists, Afghanistan’s government is set to resume peace talks with the Taliban Tuesday, with efforts expected to be focused on securing a cease-fire agreement in the dying days of Donald Trump’s presidency.Since the intra-Afghan talks began in September in the Qatari capital of Doha, where the Taliban have a political office, violence has increased nationwide, including an attack on Kabul University which killed dozens of students and Taliban attempts to capture Lashkar Gah and Kandahar cities in the southern region.“The current levels of violence, including targeted killings, is unacceptable,” Zalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy for Afghan reconciliation, said in a series of tweets after he arrived in Doha overnight, two weeks before Trump is due to leave office. “Both sides must demonstrate they are acting in the best interest of the Afghan people by making real compromises and negotiating an agreement on a political settlement as soon as possible and an immediate significant reduction in violence/ceasefire.”Trump has long been determined to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. Under a deal signed with Taliban in February, the U.S. is seeking to leave the country by May 2021 in exchange for counter-terrorism assurances from the Taliban. The country is planning to reduce its military presence this month by about 2,000 from 4,500 troops, who are providing air support for Afghan forces.Future GovernmentAfter a break of almost a month, the second round of the talks “will be lengthier and more important,” said Ahmad Saeedi, a former Afghan diplomat in Pakistan who is now an independent political analyst in Kabul. In addition to the cease-fire, the two sides will also negotiate the structure of a future Afghan government.“We’ll discuss the most important agenda -- the violence reduction or a comprehensive cease-fire,” according to Ghulam Farooq Majrooh, a member of Afghanistan’s negotiating team. The targeted killings of journalists, civilian activists and others will also be on the agenda, he added.The Taliban “are interested in establishing an interim government,” Abdul Hafiz Mansour, another member of the Afghan negotiating team, told reporters on Sunday.However President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly denied the idea, saying it would reverse the hard-won achievements, including in human rights, made in the past two decades.Reporters SlainSince November, journalists across the country have been targeted by unknown armed militants.The fifth reporter killed, Bismillah Adil Aimaq, was shot dead in Ghor province on Jan. 1, according to Afghanistan Journalists Center. Elyas Daee from the Afghan branch of U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Europe -- or Radio Azadi -- Rahmatullah Nikzad from Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, and Malala Maiwand, who worked as an anchor for a local TV channel are among the dead. A further two journalists have also died in Kabul of unknown causes.In an address to the country’s parliament on Monday, Interior Minister Masoud Andarabi, who had been summoned over security failures to thwart the killings, blamed the Taliban for the journalists’ deaths, citing “accurate intelligence evidence and confessions from arrested perpetrators.”Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahed, denied the group was responsible for the attacks in emailed statements and a series of tweets.The head of National Directorate of Security, the country’s intelligence agency, Ahmad Zia Saraj -- who was also summoned to parliament over the violence -- told lawmakers that Taliban insurgents carried out about 18,500 attacks in one year and have no “pure intentions for peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peace-talks-to-resume-under-shadow-of-targeted-afghan-killings/story-Av8JQTu59IY9brByh7iGoO.html

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the pacific nation, an archipelago home to about 18,000 people, is yet to report its first case of coronavirus, Palau is a sovereign nation in free association with the United States and, under an agreement signed in 1982, the latter remains responsible for Palau’s defence until 2044. The archipelago has also access to Washington’s social services, making it a part of US’ mass Covid-19 vaccination program - Operation Warp Speed. The Pacific Islands country on Saturday received its first shipment of 2,800 doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, which has been authorised by the US Food and Drug Association (FDA) for emergency use. The vaccination commenced on Sunday at the Belau National Hospital, starting with healthcare providers and first responders. Palau has requested another 30,000 Covid vaccine doses from the United States.Also Read | US pharmacist who destroyed Moderna Covid-19 vaccines was ‘conspiracy theorist’: policeIncident Commander of the Ministry of Health, Ritter Udui, reportedly said that small population puts Palau in prime position to become one of the first countries in the world to be inoculated against the virus. According to a CNN report, Palau’s goal is to vaccinate 80 per cent of its population and achieve herd immunity.“It’s not compulsory to receive the vaccine, so our goal is to vaccinate about 80% of the population. We hope to achieve herd immunity (through the vaccination program),” the Palau official was quoted as saying by the US media network.Notably, Palau had hailed India at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly for its “invaluable support” to fight the ongoing pandemic. In September, Palau President Tommy Remengesau Jr told a largely virtual gathering of world leaders that the Indian government helped the country improve its healthcare system through India-UN Development Partnership Fund. "Government of India, through India-UN Fund, in partnership with UNOSSC&UNOPS, has provided invaluable support to improve our healthcare system, & rapid response to pandemic preparations" H.E.

05-01-2021||World||NYSE scraps plan to delist China telecom firms||The New York Stock Exchange abandoned plans to delist three state-owned Chinese telecom companies on Monday, reversing a decision that further dented already strained relations between the world’s two superpowers.In a brief statement, the stock exchange said it “no longer intends to move forward with the delisting action” for China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.No detailed reason was given for the sudden reversal, which the exchange said came after “further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities”.Shares in the three state-owned telecoms firms jumped on the news. In Hong Kong trading of China Unicom, which at one point soared 11 percent, ended up at more than eight percent. China Mobile climbed more than five percent and China Telecom added more than three percent.Mainland Chinese shares reversed earlier losses, while the yuan rose around 0.7 percent against the dollar.Jackson Wong, at Amber Hill Capital, said the move was “quite unexpected”.“Some funds that had an obligation to unload these shares will now need to buy them back. Some investors are also starting to pricing in a scenario that the decision to halt delistings could be a start of a de-escalation in tensions between China and the US,” he added.The reversal comes just four days after the NYSE said it was ending trading in the companies to comply with an order by the Trump administration barring investment in firms with ties to the Chinese military.Donald Trump signed an executive order in November banning Americans from investing in Chinese companies deemed to be supplying or supporting the country’s military and security apparatus, earning a sharp rebuke from Beijing.The order listed 31 companies it said China was using for the “increasing exploitation” of US investment capital to fund military and intelligence services, including the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction.It was one of a series of executive orders and regulatory actions that have targeted China’s economic and military expansion in recent months.Trump’s order prohibits US companies and individuals from owning shares in any of the companies, which also include video surveillance firm Hikvision and China Railway Construction Corp.National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said at the time the order would prevent Americans from unknowingly providing passive capital to Chinese companies -- listed on exchanges around the world -- that support the improvement of Beijing’s army and spy agencies.Under his “America First” banner, Trump has portrayed China as the greatest threat to the United States and global democracy, pursued a trade war with it, harangued Chinese tech firms, and laid all the blame for the coronavirus pandemic at Beijing’s door.China had criticised the moves to delist its companies and threatened countermeasures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-scraps-plan-to-delist-china-telecom-firms/story-Wvg6zvLxw3EaLQ2VBt5yrJ.html
05-01-2021||World||US pharmacist who destroyed Moderna Covid-19 vaccines was ‘conspiracy theorist’: police||An American pharmacist who allegedly destroyed hundreds of coronavirus vaccine doses last month was an “admitted conspiracy theorist” and believed in a baseless rumour about their safety, authorities have said.Steven Brandenburg removed 57 vials of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, each containing around 10 doses, from refrigerators at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, Wisconsin, in an attempt to destroy them because he believed -- wrongly -- that they were dangerous and could alter human DNA.The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are based on mRNA technology that delivers genetic information to the human body to help produce antibodies against the coronavirus. Experts say there is no evidence at all to suggest they alter human DNA, and millions have been inoculated using these vaccines.They require very low temperatures for storage and can be damaged or destroyed otherwise, which is what Brandenburg tried to do on two occasions, the prosecution said Monday during his first court appearance.“His intent... was to render them inert because he’d formed this belief that they were unsafe, that the RNA method of creating these medications rendered them unsafe,” Ozaukee County district attorney Adam Gerol said during the hearing.Brandenburg had initially told hospital authorities that the vaccines were left unrefrigerated by accident, but later admitted that he removed them on purpose.The 46-year-old also admitted on one occasion to putting the unrefrigerated vaccines back inside, which were later injected into 57 people, the hospital’s operator said.The people were notified and there is no evidence that the inert vaccines harmed them, according to the hospital’s operator.He was fired and the hospital informed the authorities, including the FBI. He was arrested on Thursday last week.“Brandenburg, an admitted conspiracy theorist, told investigators that he believed that Covid-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA,” according to a probable cause statement from the police, released by local media.The prosecution said his charges may be downgraded if they find the vaccines can still be used.He also told authorities he was also under stress because of ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife, who has filed for sole custody of their two children, according to local media.“He told me that if I didn’t understand by now that... the world is crashing down around us, I am in serious denial,” she said in an affidavit, according to The New York Times.“He continued to say that the government is planning cyberattacks and plans to shut down the power grid.”Brandenburg was released on bail and ordered to surrender his firearms.Baseless conspiracy theories about the pandemic, especially vaccines, have been rampant on social media despite efforts by tech giants to counter them.Authorities and experts have said such misinformation poses a serious threat to the fight against the virus by promoting vaccine hesitancy and even outright rejection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pharmacist-who-destroyed-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-was-conspiracy-theorist-police/story-J4MmTzskKf1897ae7ys3NO.html
05-01-2021||World||China state news agency urges end to long work hours in tech||China’s official Xinhua News Agency is calling for shorter work hours in the country’s tech sector following the sudden death last week of a young employee at a leading e-commerce platform.Last month’s tragedy refocused attention on “the pain of an abnormal culture of overtime,” Xinhua said in a brief editorial posted Tuesday on its Twitter-like Weibo account.Dreams should be pursued through striving, but workers’ legitimate rights and interests should not be sacrificed and employers may be breaking the law in encouraging health-sapping overwork, Xinhua said.“Strengthening the protection of legal rights and interests for workers, letting those chasing their dreams run along in a healthy manner and introducing more warmth into the development of enterprises — that’s the form striving should take,” the news agency said.The editorial follows the Dec. 29 death of a 22-year-old employee of Pingduoduo as she was walking home with a colleague at 1:30 a.m. Few details have been released, other than that the woman apparently suffered stomach pains before collapsing, but internet users have seized on the case as an example of the health impacts of long working days.Grueling hours have long been a hallmark of China’s tech industry, heralded by business luminaries such as Alibaba’s Jack Ma, one of China’s richest and most prominent entrepreneurs. Ma drew controversy in 2019 by endorsing the “996” week, entailing working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, with many arguing that would further discourage young people from marrying and having children.The ruling Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper even weighed in at the time, saying it was unfair of dictatorial managers to demand excessive overtime.Worldwide, the tech sector is known for demanding long hours spent designing, coding and processing customer requests. While Chinese labor law limits the work week to five days and no more than 44 hours, increasing numbers of people work outside the state sector or in the informal economy where such regulations tend not to be adhered to as closely.China also outlaws independent labor organizing, allowing only one union, the tightly party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-news-agency-urges-end-to-long-work-hours-in-tech/story-KtOSmMPnod7XsAhzPG7NtK.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19 pushed India to be a force for good on the global stage: Indian envoy to China||The coronavirus pandemic has spurred India to strengthen itself to demonstrate that with greater capabilities it would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage, India’s ambassador to China Vikram Misri has said. In an opinion piece published in the Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post, Misri said that the “devastating impact” of the pandemic was hard to quantify and its implications have been profound. “But one of the biggest takeaways has to be more international cooperation, particularly as we get increasingly interconnected. Accordingly, while engaging with an emerging multipolar global order, India will continue to give the utmost attention to its immediate neighbourhood, where its Neighbourhood First policy, based on non-reciprocity, is creating the basis for shared activities,” he said. “At the same time, our extended neighbourhood has been an integral part of our history and heritage and our engagement has unfolded through an Act East policy and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi’s Sagar (Security and Growth for All In the Region) vision for the Indo-Pacific, which provides a template to engage with our maritime neighbours,” Misri wrote in the article on Monday. He said the world needed more trusted and capable players and India believes it can play the role. “The pandemic demonstrated that India with greater capabilities would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage. Atmanirbhar Bharat is thus a self-reliant India but not a self-centred one”, he said. Highlighting India’s commencing of its two-year term from January 1 in the UN Security Council for the eighth time as a non-permanent member, Misri said, “convinced that the multipolar world today needs more multilateralism, we will focus on efforts to make the UN and other international bodies more representative and in sync with contemporary realities”. “The challenges of 2020 are by no means over. Much remains to be done. India believes this is a collective enterprise and stands ready to engage with all and work for peace, development and cooperation,” he said. The year 2020 is one that all would like to forget in a hurry. The coronavirus pandemic created a global crisis with no parallels in living memory. The governments around the world were forced to deal simultaneously with a catastrophic health emergency, massive economic shocks and serious social disruption, he wrote. “Despite this, 2020 will be remembered in India as a year of reckoning when government and citizenry came together in a whole-of-society response marked by determination and discipline,” he said. “From an economy that previously did not make ventilators, testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 masks, India was soon manufacturing enough of them to cater not only to its own needs but also for export,” he said. India also emphasised the need for global cooperation. Guided by its civilisational ethos, which places humanity at the centre of global prosperity and cooperation, India assisted others even while tending to problems at home, Misri said. “When COVID-19 created a spike in pharmaceutical demand, we responded by ramping up our production, exporting medicines and other medical assistance to over 150 countries,” he said. “With the focus shifting to vaccines, India is involved in many international collaborations that give the world hope for normalcy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed that India will leverage its vaccine manufacturing capacities to help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all,” he said. As the pandemic dealt a blow to global mobility on account of severe travel restrictions, India mounted a massive operation, bringing more than three million citizens home from around the world and supported the movement of more than 110,000 foreigners out of India to 120 countries. “The pandemic’s health shock was matched perhaps only by its economic shock as trade and investment were disrupted and supply chains were unhinged. India’s response was articulated in the vision of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India). It would be a mistake to interpret this as India turning inward,” Misri said. “In the words of Modi, Atmanirbhar Bharat ‘is not just about competition, but also about competence; it is not about dominance, but about dependability; it is not about looking within, but about looking out for the world’,” he said. “In a time of global crisis, it would have been easy for India to focus just on recovery. Instead, the government seized the opportunity for a spate of major reforms in domains ranging from manufacturing to agriculture and education,” he said. He said the government has introduced “landmark” agricultural reforms to end the monopoly of trading cliques. ‘The proposed laws allow farmers to sell their produce at a price of their own choosing and even outside their respective states, thereby leading to better rural incomes. They also encourage private-sector investment and leverage technology to enhance our farm productivity to near-global standards,” he said, defending the three agriculture reform laws enacted by the government.

05-01-2021||World||Pentagon gets diversity watchdog in bill passed over Trump veto||Defense legislation passed in spite of President Donald Trump’s veto will bring a heightened focus on diversity issues and efforts to combat white supremacy and extremist behavior within the US military.Along with billions of dollars for new weapons systems and a pay raise for troops, a new deputy inspector general’s position was created by the bipartisan defense authorization bill to carry out audits, investigations and evaluations of military personnel policies, programs and systems to ensure they address diversity priorities.The new watchdog will also have a key role in responding to white supremacist and criminal gang activity by military personnel, according to the legislation passed on Jan. 1 over Trump’s veto.The deputy inspector general “will keep the heat on the military to make sure that racial inequality does not fade from the priority list, that these provisions are implemented successfully, and that Congress will receive an independent source of findings and recommendations,” said Representative Jackie Speier, the California Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee’s military personnel panel.Once the position is filled, the deputy inspector general could, for instance, review the extent to which the military services are examining social media posts of recruits or personnel needing security clearances to see if they’ve disclosed support for extremist organizations.Military leaders have been supportive of moves to curb behavior and eliminate symbols that are offensive to service members of color, who now make up more than 40% of the active-duty force. In vetoing the annual policy bill, Trump took issue with a provision to rename military installations that honor Confederate generals.That provision and the less-noticed move to create a diversity watchdog followed national protests in 2020 over systemic racism in law enforcement that prompted Pentagon leaders to speak out more forcefully on diversity issues.Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police “a horrible crime” and said that the officers responsible should “be held accountable for his murder.”The military’s response included an anguished Facebook post by then-Chief Master Sergeant Kaleth Wright, the Air Force’s top enlisted airman, who expressed his fear that “what happens all too often in this country to Black men who are subjected to police brutality that ends in death…could happen to me.”The move also comes as President-elect Joe Biden said he intends to nominate retired General Lloyd Austin to be the nation’s first Black defense secretary. Austin was previously the first African American to lead Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.While the US military desegregated units years ahead of key civil rights legislation passed in the 1960s, it has continued to lag behind in many critical areas. Last month the Air Force’s inspector general concluded that Black airmen in the Air Force and the Space Force face widespread disparities in opportunities and treatment compared to fellow service members, and many of them feel that the services are racist and biased against them.The review found enlisted Black troops are 57% more likely to face court-martials and are promoted less often, trends that continued across military criminal justice and professional development. In a survey of 123,000 Air Force members, one-third of Black respondents said the Air Force and Space Force do not provide them the same opportunities as White peers.One key oversight tool the new watchdog will be responsible for is an annual report with an assessment of the effectiveness of “policies, programs, systems, and processes in preventing and responding to supremacist, extremist, and criminal gang activity of a member of the Armed Forces,” according to the legislation.In addition to objecting to the renaming of military bases, Trump vetoed the defense measure because he wanted it to include an unrelated provision to eliminate a portion of the Communications Decency Act that protects technology companies from liability for most content published by their users. In his veto message, Trump also called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia, without clearly articulating his reasoning.But Trump’s repeated efforts to get Republicans to support his veto failed. Beyond the new weapons funding and pay increases for troops, it had become a point of pride for members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that the annual legislation has been enacted without fail for six decades. With that backdrop, the veto override became the first -- and most likely last -- of Trump’s presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-gets-diversity-watchdog-in-bill-passed-over-trump-veto/story-OxBBRUVwmhmvSsooWoG0DN.html
05-01-2021||World||Saudi Arabia reopens borders with Qatar in US-backed deal||Saudi Arabia opened its borders with Qatar for the first time in three years, a leap toward easing a dispute that split the energy-producing region and complicated US efforts to isolate Iran.The decision to open land, air and sea borders comes ahead of a summit of regional leaders in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Qatar’s ruler will attend for the first time since the 2017 row that cut trade, travel and diplomatic ties with the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahran and Egypt.Egypt has agreed in principle to open its airspace for Qatari planes and will do so if unspecified conditions are met, Saudi-backed Al Arabiya TV reported. Spokesmen for Egypt’s Foreign Ministry and presidency didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The steps were pushed through as President Donald Trump prepares to leave office and his successor, Joe Biden, vows to renew diplomacy with Tehran. The breakthrough is timely -- on Monday Iran seized a South Korea-flagged tanker and announced it would ramp up its nuclear enrichment activities.Qatar’s main equities benchmark rose the most in the Middle East following the announcement, with the majority of its members gaining.The dispute stretched beyond the Gulf region, with the countries lining up on opposite sides of conflicts and geopolitical squabbles in the wider Middle East and in Africa.Abu Dhabi, which led the boycott with Riyadh, didn’t appear to immediately join the accord but signaled optimism. The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter that Tuesday’s Gulf Cooperation Council summit would “bring back Gulf cohesion,” prioritizing the region’s security, stability and prosperity.“There’s more work ahead of us and we’re on the right track,” he said. Gargash’s comments echoed the sentiment expressed by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said the summit would create “reunification and solidarity to face the challenges that our region witnesses.”Leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council -- comprising Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE -- will hold their summit in the northwestern Saudi town of Al Ula.The resolution has wider economic and financial implications for Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and one of the richest countries per capita. It is expected to bolster prospects for Qatar’s non-oil economy over the medium term, according to Fitch Ratings. It is also positive news for Qatar Airways, which had to abandon plans to add new routes and make lengthy diversions when it was unable to cross the Saudi airspace.“For Saudi Arabia, this is an effort to take a leadership role, to try and gain some diplomatic advantage with the incoming Biden administration,” said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. It’s also “a realization perhaps that the last four years allowed too much foreign policy adventurism and experimentation,” Young said.The boycotting nations had accused Doha of meddling in their internal affairs, supporting hardline Islamist groups and building ties with Iran, a foe for most Gulf Arab states. Qatar denied the charges.It was unclear how far the agreement would go in easing frictions after three years of heated rhetoric. Commentators cautioned that major differences would likely persist with most of the flash-points dividing the sides unaddressed -- including the critical reporting of Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network.“The ideological gaps have not been closed either, so the GCC will remain fractured such below the surface, even as they paper over differences to score points with the new White House,” said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East analyst at Stratfor.The deal nearly fell apart on Sunday, but the White House and other parties stayed on the phone overnight to reach an agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is traveling to Saudi Arabia for the accord signing on Tuesday, the person said.The person said the agreement was reached in exchange for Qatar dropping lawsuits it had filed in relation to the Gulf split. It wasn’t immediately clear which legal cases were involved.Qatar had increasingly turned to Tehran and Ankara for support and relied on Iran’s airspace for overflights. That troubled the Trump administration -- which had initially backed the boycott -- as it sought to expand its offensive to weaken Tehran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-reopens-borders-with-qatar-in-us-backed-deal/story-0qqgpbiO3xhlM0mKBqp53N.html
05-01-2021||World||France promises faster Covid-19 vaccine rollout after criticism||The French government, under pressure for lagging behind EU neighbours in rolling out Covid vaccinations, promised on Tuesday to dispense jabs much more quickly and catch up.Health Minister Olivier Veran said more than 2,000 people had been vaccinated on Monday and that the “cruising speed of vaccinations will catch up with our neighbours in the coming days”.The French campaign had rolled out just over 500 doses as of January 1, with critics calling that figure “a scandal” compared with the 200,000 people immunised in Germany in a similar timeframe, after the EU-wide rollout began a week ago.President Emmanuel Macron, under pressure to take personal responsibility, met officials including Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday to discuss the logjam. “By Thursday we will increase numbers in a major way,” Veran told RTL radio, saying that “we will be on an exponential curve”.France would now “amplify, accelerate and simplify” its vaccination strategy, he said.Veran said vaccinations for people over 75 years of age who are not in care homes would be authorised by the end of January, covering five million people.He said the campaign would also be widened to include firefighters and home helpers over 50.France was currently taking delivery of 500,000 doses of a vaccine developed by Pfizer per week, Veran said.Once approved for the EU, 500,000 doses of a vaccine by Moderna would be added every month, he said.Scepticism about vaccines is making the government’s task harder.Just 40 percent of French want to take the vaccine compared with 77 percent in Britain, according to an opinion poll last week by Ipsos Global Advisor in partnership with the World Economic Forum.Veran also said that France had detected “about 10 suspected or confirmed cases” of a new variant virus strain that emerged in England, adding that authorities were watching the highly-contagious mutant virus “like hawks”.French health authorities on Monday reported 4,022 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 2.66 million.French deaths from Covid totalled 65,415, they said, after 380 new deaths were recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-promises-faster-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-after-criticism/story-YsOMycsrIwUXQ4puId74qO.html

And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose,” the FDA said on Monday https://bit.ly/38g9IsC.In a departure from other countries’ strategies, the British government said last week people could on rare occasions be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots, for example if the same vaccine dose was out of stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/premature-to-change-authorized-covid-19-vaccines-dosing-schedules-fda-says/story-QqlpJnkp2c3bDMRnynrB3L.html
05-01-2021||World||China doubles down on Covid-19 narrative as WHO investigation looms||As a team from the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares to visit China to investigate the origins of Covid-19, Beijing has stepped up efforts not only to prevent new outbreaks, but also shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began.China has dismissed criticism of its early handling of the coronavirus, first identified in the city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that the country would welcome the WHO team.But amid simmering geopolitical tensions, experts said the investigators were unlikely to be allowed to scrutinise some of the more sensitive aspects of the outbreak, with Beijing desperate to avoid blame for a virus that has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide.“Even before this investigation, top officials from both sides have been very polarised in their opinions on the origins of the outbreak,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think tank.“They will have to be politically savvy and draw conclusions that are acceptable to all the major parties,” he added.While other countries continue to struggle with infection surges, China has aggressively doused flare-ups. After a new cluster of cases last week, the city of Shenyang sealed off entire communities and required all non-essential workers to stay home. On Saturday, senior diplomat Wang Yi praised the anti-pandemic efforts, saying China not only curbed domestic infections, but also “took the lead in building a global anti-epidemic defence” by providing aid to more than 150 countries. But mindful of the criticism China has faced worldwide, Wang also became the highest-ranking official to question the consensus about Covid-19’s origins, saying “more and more studies” show that it emerged in multiple regions.China is also the only country to claim Covid-19 can be transmitted via cold chain imports, with the country blaming new outbreaks in Beijing and Dalian on contaminated shipments - even though the WHO has downplayed those risks. Transparency China has been accused of a cover-up that delayed its initial response, allowing the virus to spread further. The topic remains sensitive, with only a handful of studies into the origins of Covid-19 made available to the public.But there have also been signs China is willing to share information that contradicts the official picture. Last week, a study by China’s Center for Disease Control showed that blood samples from 4.43% of Wuhan’s population contained Covid-19 antibodies, indicating that the city’s infection rates were far higher than originally acknowledged.But scientists said China must also share any findings suggesting Covid-19 was circulating domestically long before it was officially identified in December 2019. An Italian study showed that Covid-19 might have been in Europe several months before China’s first official case. Chinese state media used the paper to support theories that Covid-19 originated overseas and entered China via contaminated frozen food or foreign athletes competing at the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.Raina MacIntyre, head of the Kirby Institute’s Biosecurity Research Program in Australia, said the investigation needed to draw “a comprehensive global picture of the epidemiological clues”, including any evidence Covid-19 was present outside of China before December 2019. However, political issues mean they are unlikely to be given much leeway to investigate one hypothesis, that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said MacIntyre. “I think it is unlikely all viruses in the lab at the time will be made available to the team,” she said. “So I do not think we will ever know the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-doubles-down-on-covid-19-narrative-as-who-investigation-looms/story-hAm4D6ozQUGKI6tcllaG2N.html
05-01-2021||World||Bill Gates hails India’s leadership in scientific innovation, vaccine manufacturing||US business magnate, philanthropist, and co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates on Tuesday applauded India’s effort in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.He also hailed India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability.“It’s great to see India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic,” he tweeted, tagging PMO India in the post.The Microsoft founder had previously written to PM Modi hailing the Indian government’s utilisation of “its exceptional digital capabilities in its COVID-19 response and launched the Aarogya Setu digital app for coronavirus tracking, contact tracing, and to connect people to health services.”“We commend your leadership and the proactive measures you and your government have taken to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 infection rate in India, such as adopting a national lockdown, expanding focused testing to identify hot spots for isolation, quarantining, and care, and significantly increasing health expenditures to strengthen the health system response and promote R&D and digital innovation,” Gates had written in April 2020.Meanwhile, earlier today Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also lauded India’s action and its resolve to end the Covid-19 pandemic as the largest vaccine producer of the world. Lauding the efforts of PM Modi in the fight against the pandemic, he wrote, “If we #ACTogether, we can ensure effective & safe vaccines are used to protect the most vulnerable everywhere @narendramodi”.On Monday, PM Modi pointed out that the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination programme is also going to start in India and that the CSIR and other institutions are working together came together to face every challenge and find solutions for new situations.“For this, the country is very proud of the contribution of its scientists. Today is also the day to remember the time when our scientific institutions, all of you, worked day and night together to develop the vaccine to defeat Covid,” he added.Speaking at the inauguration of National Atomic Timescale and Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya, via video conferencing on Monday, PM Modi said, “Indian scientists have been successful in coming up with two ‘Made in India’ COVID19 vaccines. The country is proud of its scientists,” he added.India has one of the largest vaccine manufacturing capacities in the world (including the largest vaccine producer - Serum Institute of India) and has secured authorisation to mass-produce the AstraZeneca, Novavax and Gamaleya Research Institute vaccines.With a population of 1.3 billion (and 94 million over 65-year-olds), the domestic vaccination drive will be the largest in the world.The country has a good track record of such drives with masses of the population regularly gaining inoculation for various diseases such as polio and cholera.India’s vaccine rollout will begin with frontline healthcare workers and individuals over the age of 50 years gaining priority. The government aims to vaccinate some 250 million people over six-to-eight months.

The Hindu temple was vandalised and set ablaze by hundreds of people on December 30.Earlier, Pakistan’s chief justice, Gulzar Ahmed, who had taken suo motu notice of the attack on the place of worship, had said the Supreme Court would hear the case on January 5.The chief justice took the action after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being vandalised during their meeting in Karachi last week.The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Auqaf department have been directed to start the work immediately and submit a progress report in two weeks. The chief justice also observed that the people who vandalised the temple should pay for its restoration.The court has also asked for reports on the number of temples in Pakistan, encroachment on land belonging to the Auqaf department, and the steps taken by the authorities against land grab. All temples in Pakistan come under the Auqaf department.Earlier, the one-man commission on the rights of minorities at the Supreme Court submitted its report on the Karak temple vandalism. Muhammad Shoaib Suddle, a former police chief, had prepared the report.The commission recommended a comprehensive investigation into the vandalism of the temple. Maulvi Sharif, the main suspect in the case, is believed to have incited people to carry out violence, the report said. It added that the record of the temple land at the time of Partition should be looked into.The report also recommended that the home department should take steps to stop the entry of suspicious people inside the temple. Exemplary punishment should be handed out to suspects to prevent such incidents in the future, the report recommended.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics.After the latest incident, local police had detained at least 14 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restore-vandalised-temple-in-two-weeks-pak-sc-tells-kp-s-provincial-govt/story-KEmCMXXjqs6sqZwONYj86N.html

05-01-2021||World||US, India are among countries with most Covid-19 cases. Here’s a list||As the world scrambled into the New Year after being severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, several countries are beginning their vaccination programmes to inoculate their citizens against the viral disease. The emergence of a new, the more infectious strain might have dampened some of the positivity going into 2021 but experts have said that a vaccine would work despite mutations.While some countries were not hit as hard by the coronavirus disease, some were hit the worst in terms of loss of life, overwhelming the medical system, and the economy.Here are the 10 countries with the most cases of Covid-19 so far:1. United States: The US is the country with the most number of coronavirus infections in the world at the moment. The country currently has an overall caseload of 20,805,262 while the death toll stands at 353,371, as per Johns Hopkins University.2. India: Second on the list with nearly half the number of cases as the US is India. India’s tally of the coronavirus disease stands 10,356,844 after 16,375 new cases and 201 deaths were reported on Tuesday, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) recently gave their approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use authorisation.3. Brazil: The South American nation is the worst affected in the continent in terms of infections with 7,733,746 confirmed cases and 196,018 deaths, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows. President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed the virus threat for months before himself getting infected. 4. Russia: Russia has seen a surge in coronavirus infections recently. Its current overall caseload stands at 3,203,743 while the death toll stands at 57,730, as per Johns Hopkins University.5. United Kingdom: The UK went into strict lockdown restrictions yet again as cases surged, topped off by the discovery of a new, even more infectious strain of the virus. Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows the UK currently has the highest caseload in Europe with 2,662,699 confirmed cases and 75,137 deaths.6. France: France was the first country to suspend travel from the UK after the discovery of the new virus strain. The country has seen a surge in cases over the winter like several other European nations with even their President contracting the virus. The country currently has a caseload of 2,712,975 and a death toll of 65,164, as per Johns Hopkins University.7. Turkey: Turkey currently has an overall caseload of 2,241,912 with the death toll at 21,488, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows.8. Italy: Italy was the worst-affected nation in the world during the earlier months of the pandemic. It has since controlled and checked the spread of the virus but the winter period has seen cases surging all over Europe. The country currently has a caseload of 2,155,446 with 75,332 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.9. Spain: Spain was also one of the worst-affected countries in Europe. The country currently has 1,928,265 Covid-19 cases with the death toll currently standing at 50,837, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker showed.10. Germany: Germany had announced lockdown measures from Christmas to New Year in a bid to check the spread of the coronavirus infection as cases surged all across Europe. The country currently has an overall caseload of 1,783,896 with the death toll standing at 34,791 as per Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-are-among-countries-with-most-covid-19-cases-here-s-a-list/story-zHHn438mXaVq9ROEI56JzN.html
05-01-2021||World||Iran seizes ship, ramps up enrichment as Gulf tensions mount||Iran seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz hours before announcing it would increase its nuclear activities, as tensions in the region mount in the final days of Donald Trump’s US presidency.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it detained the Hankuk Chemi vessel at 10 a.m. local time Monday “due to repeated violations of marine environmental laws.”It’s the latest in a series of shipping incidents in the Persian Gulf, where several vessels have been attacked or seized in recent years.The events have unfolded against a broader backdrop of rising anxiety in the Middle East as the Trump administration extended its offensive to weaken Iran and force it into deeper nuclear and military concessions.Concerns of further conflict have grown in the final weeks before Joe Biden takes over in Washington, especially around the recent assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist and this week’s first anniversary of the killing of the country’s leading general.“In the short run, these tactics run the risk of turning into a just cause for war in the waning days of the Trump administration, and in the longer run can poison the well with Biden’s team,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group.Iran’s army also announced large-scale drone exercises starting Tuesday following a weekend of defiant speeches accusing the US of aggression.Korea ReactsIran’s announcement Monday that it would start processing uranium to 20% purity marks a further breach of a nuclear deal that Trump, who leaves office Jan. 20, abandoned in 2018.That announcement came shortly after Washington decided to keep the USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf because of “recent threats” from Iran’s leaders against Trump. The aircraft carrier had been set to leave the region.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it ordered the deployment of its naval destroyer ROKS Choi Young to waters near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday.The Hankuk Chemi’s owner, DM Shipping Co., denied it had broken any marine environmental rules, adding that the vessel was still being held off Iran, according to an official from the company who asked not to be named due to internal policy.The ship was headed to Fujairah after loading petrochemicals including methane from Jubail in Saudi Arabia and was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was intercepted, the official said. A total of 20 crew members from South Korea, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam were on board the vessel.The guard corps took the ship to Bandar Abbas port in Iran, the semi-official Fars News Agency said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry later appeared to play down the incident, saying the seizure was related to a “technical issue” and stressed that it’s nuclear move was easily reversible.Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that nuclear weapons had “no place” in the country’s defense program, according to Tasnim.Strained RelationsRelations between Tehran and Seoul have been strained since the US reimposed tough sanctions on Iran and banned countries, including major Asian customers, from buying its petroleum.Iran says it has at least $7 billion from oil sales trapped in South Korea and the money is needed to purchase humanitarian goods, including coronavirus vaccines. Seoul’s deputy foreign minister was scheduled to visit Iran to discuss the trapped funds, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said just before the tanker was seized.South Korea is not a member of the International Maritime Security Construct, a maritime force created in 2019 in response to Iranian attacks and to protect sea lanes in the Middle East. Seoul has previously indicated a willingness to work with IMSC, though it has not requested assistance from the alliance so far, said an IMSC spokesman.The Hankuk Chemi was sailing to the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah after loading at Jubail on Jan. 2, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. It veered off course in the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow stretch of water between the tip of Oman and Iran, and headed toward Bandar Abbas.UK Maritime Trade Operations, which serves as a link between the Royal Navy and commercial vessels operating in high-risk areas, said there had been “an interaction” between a merchant vessel and the Iranian authorities in the Strait of Hormuz between 6:15 a.m. and 7:33 a.m. London time.The US Fifth Fleet, which is based in the region, is “monitoring the situation,” spokeswoman Commander Rebecca Rebarich said.On Dec. 31, a mine was discovered attached to the hull of an oil tanker off Iraq, near the Iranian border. A ship at the Saudi Red Sea port of Jeddah was hit by an explosion earlier in the month, which Riyadh labeled an act of terror.Iran detained the UK-flagged tanker Stena Impero for more than two months at Bandar Abbas in mid-2019 in retaliation for the arrest of one of its ships off Gibraltar. The Islamic Republic seized another oil vessel that was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-seizes-ship-ramps-up-enrichment-as-gulf-tensions-mount/story-4A2bafX2k1x1yYJH8f1tmM.html
05-01-2021||World||Top Georgia election official says White House pushed him to take Trump call||Georgia’s top election official said on Monday that President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, had pushed him to take an “inappropriate” call in which he pressured the state to overturn his November presidential election defeat there. In the call on Saturday, Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to make him the victor in the Southern state, according to a recording published by US media. “I never believed it was appropriate to speak to the president, but he pushed out, I guess he had his staff push us. They wanted a call,” Raffensperger told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Two Democratic members of Congress asked FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday to investigate the call. “We believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes. We ask you to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president,” they said in a statement. The Justice Department had no comment on the request by Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice.A state Democrat has called for a probe into whether Trump had violated Georgia election law on the call. Raffensperger and his office’s general counsel rejected Trump’s assertions of electoral fraud in the hour-long conversation.“We took the call, and we had a conversation. He did most of the talking, we did most of the listening,” Raffensperger said. “But I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong. He had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two. That’s an example of just he has bad data.”Trump for two months has been claiming contrary to evidence that his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple state and federal reviews, as well as courts, have rejected those claims as unsupported.Biden won the state-by-state Electoral College by 306-232 and carried the popular vote by more than 7 million ballots.The only Democrat on Georgia’s election board, David Worley, asked Raffensperger in a letter on Sunday to investigate whether the president had violated state law that prohibits solicitation to commit election fraud.Raffensperger said the district attorney in Fulton County, home to Atlanta, might be the appropriate authority to carry out such an investigation. The county’s district attorney, Fani Willis, said she found news reports about Trump’s phone call with Raffensperger “disturbing.”The state election board can refer the case to her office and the state attorney general, said Willis, a Democrat elected in November. “I will enforce the law without fear or favor. Anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable,” Willis said. ‘UNWISE PRECEDENTS’In another blow to Trump, staunch conservative Senator Tom Cotton refused to sign on to a long-shot campaign by some dozen other Republicans in the U.S. Senate this week to challenge Biden’s victory, warning it was outside of Congress’ power and would “establish unwise precedents.”In a statement on Sunday, Cotton said he would not join his colleagues Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and others in defying Republican Party leaders by objecting on Wednesday when lawmakers meet to tally the votes in the Electoral College - a largely symbolic act of certification.Cotton, Cruz and Hawley are among those considered possible 2024 presidential candidates. Trump, who has not conceded defeat, has also floated the idea of running again in 2024.Thomas J. Donohue, chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce, criticized the effort on Monday, saying it “undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.”Several moderate Republicans have also joined the criticism of Cruz, Hawley and others for undermining the will of the voters and planning to object - a move they say will not succeed in installing Trump but will erode confidence in US democracy. It was not immediately clear how the release of Trump’s call with Raffensperger could affect the Republicans’ objection plan.“This call was not a helpful call,” Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, who is among those planning to object to the certification, told Fox News in an interview on Monday.US Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, criticized the call as “deeply troubling” on Monday, according to a congressional pool report.But Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, who is defending her seat in one of two US Senate runoffs in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine control of the chamber, said on Monday she would join the effort to object to the certification.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has publicly acknowledged Biden’s win. Vice President Mike Pence, who will oversee Wednesday’s proceedings, has said the Republicans have the right to object.Even if Republicans in the Senate were successful in their objections, the campaign would fail in the House, which is controlled by Democrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-georgia-election-official-says-white-house-pushed-him-to-take-trump-call/story-soDagD2lZYosTAn0Avu7BL.html
05-01-2021||World||Donald Trump says he’ll ‘fight like hell’ to hold on to presidency||With mounting desperation, Donald Trump declared Monday night he would “fight like hell” to hold on to the presidency and appealed to Republican lawmakers to reverse his election loss to Joe Biden when they convene this week to confirm the Electoral College vote.Electoral voters won by President-elect Biden are “not gonna take this White House!” he shouted as supporters cheered at an outdoor rally in Georgia. Trump’s announced purpose for the trip was to boost Republican Senate candidates in Tuesday’s runoff election, but he spent much of his speech complaining bitterly about his election loss — which he insists he won “by a lot.”Also Read: ‘Truth matters,’ says Georgia official resisting Donald Trump pressureEarlier, in Washington, he pressed Republican lawmakers to formally object Wednesday at a joint session of Congress that is to confirm Biden’s victory in the Electoral College, itself a confirmation of Biden’s nationwide victory Nov. 3.Though he got nothing but cheers Monday night, Trump’s attempt to overturn the presidential election i s splitting the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers backing him are rushing ahead, despite an outpouring of condemnation from current and former party officials warning the effort is undermining Americans’ faith in democracy. All 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in an op-ed that “the time for questioning the results has passed.”It’s unclear the extent to which GOP leaders in Congress will be able to control Wednesday’s joint session, which could drag into the night, though the challenges to the election are all but certain to fail. Trump himself is whipping up crowds for a Wednesday rally near the White House.Also Read| ‘It’s not social media, it’s Trump Media’: 5 key points from Donald Trump’s phone callVice President Mike Pence, who is under pressure to tip the results for Trump, will be closely watched as he presides in a ceremonial role over Wednesday’s joint session.“I promise you this: On Wednesday, we’ll have our day in Congress,” Pence said while himself campaigning in Georgia ahead of Tuesday’s runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate.Trump said in Georgia: “I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.” He added, “No, Mike is a great guy.”One of the Georgia Republicans in Tuesday’s runoff — Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who faces Democrat Raphael Warnock — told the crowd she will join senators formally objecting to Biden’s win. The other Republican seeking reelection, David Perdue, who is running against Democrat Jon Ossoff, will not be eligible to vote.Trump repeated numerous times his claims of election fraud, which have been rejected by election officials — Republican as well as Democratic in state after state — and courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court. His former attorney general, William Barr, also has said there is no evidence of fraud that could change the election outcome.The congressional effort to keep Trump in office is being led by Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, along with rank-and-file House members, some on the party’s fringe.“Just got off the phone with @realDonaldTrump,” tweeted newly elected Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is aligned with a conspiracy group backing Trump.“He wants you to call your Rep & Senators TODAY, ALL DAY!” she tweeted Monday. “Don’t let Republicans be the Surrender Caucus!” She later joined the president on Air Force One as he traveled to Georgia.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tried to prevent his party from engaging in this battle, which could help define the GOP in the post-Trump era. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has declined to say much publicly on it.Both Hawley and Cruz are potential 2024 presidential contenders, vying for Trump’s base of supporters.Biden, speaking at a drive-in rally in Atlanta, said Trump “spends more time whining and complaining” than he does working on solving the coronavirus pandemic. He added dismissively, “I don’t know why he still wants the job — he doesn’t want to do the work.”During the day Monday, more current and former GOP officials rebuked the effort to upend the election.Former three-term Sen. John Danforth of Missouri said in a stinging statement, “Lending credence to Trump’s false claim that the election was stolen is a highly destructive attack.” He said, “It is the opposite of conservative; it is radical.”Two current Republican senators, Rob Portman of Ohio and Mike Lee of Utah, joined the growing number who now oppose the legislators’ challenge.Portman said in a statement, “I cannot support allowing Congress to thwart the will of the voters.”At the Dalton rally, Trump noted he was a “little angry” at Lee, but expressed hope that the senator would change his mind. “We need his vote,” Trump said.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the giant lobbying organization and virtual embodiment of the business establishment, said the electoral vote challenge “undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.”So far, Trump has enlisted support from a dozen Republican senators and up to 100 House Republicans to challenge Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College win.With Biden set to be inaugurated Jan. 20, Trump is intensifying efforts to prevent the traditional transfer of power. On a call disclosed Sunday, he can be heard pressuring Georgia officials to “find” him more votes from the Nov. 3 election he lost in that state.The challenge to the presidential election is on a scale unseen since the aftermath of the Civil War, though the typically routine process of confirming Electoral College votes has been hit with brief objections before. In 2017, several House Democrats challenged Trump’s win, but Biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert Trump’s victory.States run their own elections, and Congress has been loath to interfere.“The 2020 election is over,” said a statement Sunday from a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah.A range of Republican officials — including Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland; Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House GOP leader; and former House Speaker Paul Ryan — have criticized the GOP efforts to overturn the election.Hawley defended his actions in a lengthy email over the weekend to colleagues, saying his Missouri constituents have been “loud and clear” in insisting Biden’s defeat of Trump was unfair.Cruz’s coalition of 11 Republican senators vows to reject the Electoral College tallies unless Congress launches a commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. Congress is unlikely to agree to that.The group, which presented no new evidence of election problems, includes Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-ll-fight-like-hell-to-hold-on-to-presidency/story-kOIg12CGh6lm9ZRhJOjuPP.html

UNICEF said that an estimated 371,504 babies were born around the world on New Year’s Day. Fiji in the Pacific was projected to have welcomed 2021’s first baby while the United States would welcome its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to have taken place in 10 countries: India (59,995), China (35,615), Nigeria (21,439), Pakistan (14,161), Indonesia (12,336), Ethiopia (12,006), the United States (10,312), Egypt (9,455), Bangladesh (9,236) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (8,640), it said. In total, an estimated 140 million children will be born in 2021 and their average life expectancy is expected to be 84 years, the UN agency said. “The children born today enter a world far different than even a year ago, and a New Year brings a new opportunity to reimagine it,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said, calling on nations to make 2021 the year they start to build a fairer, safer, healthier world for children. The year 2021 will also mark the 75th anniversary of UNICEF. Over the course of the year, UNICEF and its partners will be commemorating the anniversary with events and announcements celebrating three-quarters of a century of protecting children from conflict, disease and exclusion and championing their right to survival, health and education. “Today, as the world faces a global pandemic, economic slowdown, rising poverty and deepening inequality, the need for UNICEF’s work is as great as ever,” said Fore. “For the last 75 years, throughout conflicts, displacements, natural disasters and crises, UNICEF has been there for the world’s children. As a New Year dawns, we renew our commitment to protect children, to speak up for their rights, and to make sure their voices are heard, no matter where they live,” Fore said. In response to the global pandemic, UNICEF launched the Reimagine campaign, a global effort to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF as it seeks to respond, recover and reimagine a better, post-pandemic world. For the estimates, UNICEF used vital registration and nationally representative household survey data to estimate the monthly and daily fractions of births in countries. UNICEF used the annual live births numbers and period life expectancy from the latest revision of the UN’s World Population Prospects (2019) to estimate the babies born on January 1, 2021 and their cohort life expectancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/60-000-babies-born-in-india-on-new-year-s-day-world-s-highest-unicef/story-BQs3DpGiP0sSpyRj6hhztM.html

Separately, Denmark approved a delay of up to six weeks between the first and second shots of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-data-to-support-delayed-vaccine-booster-shot-says-biontech/story-ZCHLxo0KiW3UARcmB7Z0YL.html

While India is expected to shortly begin what will be the world’s largest immunisation drive, having cleared its first two vaccines on Sunday, the United Kingdom on Monday started giving shots of a second Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Last month, the UK also became the first country to begin a vaccination drive, administering shots of the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE vaccine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith the global Covid-19 caseload at more than 85 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, here are some latest updates on the vaccination front:1. Brian Pinker, 82-year-old dialysis patient, became the first British citizen, as well as the first in the world, to receive a shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The immunisation drive began with 530,000 doses of the vaccine on a day that ended with prime minister Boris Johnson announcing another national lockdown due to begin early Wednesday.Also Read | Covid-19: Boris Johnson locks down UK again, says ‘variant spreading at an alarming rate’2. Mexico has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, its government announced on Monday, joining the UK, Argentina and India in giving a nod to the shot. The announcement was made by deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell on Twitter. Mexico is already administering shots of the Pfizer vaccine to its health workers.3. Moderna Inc, the American drugmaker, on Monday said Israel had approved its vaccine against Covid-19. “Israel’s ministry of health has secured 6 million doses and first deliveries are expected to begin in January,” the company said in a statement. This makes Israel the third country overall, after the US and Canada, the first outside North America and the first in Asia to authorise Moderna’s vaccine.4. Spain, which is using Pfizer’s vaccine, has administered 83,000 doses since December 27, health minister Salvador Illa said on Monday. Illa also said that Spain expects to vaccinate around 4.5 million people, of the country’s 47 million population, by the end of March. This, Illa said, depends on Spain receiving nearly 350,000 doses per week during the next few two months.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-begins-immunisation-drive-of-second-vaccine-mexico-okays-oxford-astrazeneca-candidate/story-BubxY92kBvfQf6zvCPuIHL.html
05-01-2021||World||Vaccines may not work on South African coronavirus variant: UK scientists||Scientists are not fully confident that Covid-19 vaccines will work on a new variant of the coronavirus found in South Africa, ITV’s political editor said on Monday, citing an unidentified scientific adviser to the British government.Both Britain and South Africa have discovered new, more infectious variants in the coronavirus in recent weeks that have driven a surge in cases. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday he was now very worried about the strand found in South Africa.Scientists including BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin and John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, have said they are testing the vaccines on the new variants and say they could make any required tweaks in around six weeks.“According to one of the government’s scientific advisers, the reason for Matt Hancock’s ‘incredible worry’ about the South African Covid-19 variant is that they are not as confident the vaccines will be as effective against it as they are for the UK’s variant,” ITV political editor Robert Peston said.Public Health England said there was currently no evidence to suggest that vaccines will not be effective against the new strain. The health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.The world’s richest countries have started vaccinating their populations to safeguard against a virus that has killed 1.8 million people and crushed the global economy.There are currently 60 vaccine candidates in trials, including those that are already being rolled out from AstraZeneca and Oxford, Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinopharm.That has helped to lift global financial markets, but the discovery of the new variants has raised fresh alarm.Scientists say the new South African variant has multiple mutations in the important “spike” protein that the virus uses to infect human cells.It has also been associated with a higher viral load, meaning a higher concentration of virus particles in patients’ bodies, possibly contributing to higher levels of transmission.Oxford’s Bell, who advises the government’s vaccine task force, said on Sunday he thought vaccines would work on the British variant but said there was a “big question mark” as to whether they would work on the South African variant.He told Times Radio that the shots could be adapted and “it might take a month or six weeks to get a new vaccine”.BioNTech’s Sahin told Spiegel in an interview published on Friday that their vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with the variant first detected in Britain.“We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant and will soon know more,” he said.Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though it might require additional regulatory approvals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-may-not-work-on-south-african-coronavirus-variant-uk-scientists/story-ZmRbrICJAC4SqSyX547XhN.html
05-01-2021||World||Most US Covid-19 vaccines go idle as New York, Florida move to penalize hospitals||More than two-thirds of the 15 million coronavirus vaccines shipped within the United States have so far gone unused, US health officials said on Monday, as the governors of New York and Florida vowed to penalize hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly enough.In New York, hospitals must administer vaccines within a week of receiving them or face a fine and a reduction in future supplies, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, hours before announcing the state’s first known case of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant originally detected in Britain.“I don’t want the vaccine in a fridge or a freezer, I want it in somebody’s arm,” the governor said. “If you’re not performing this function, it does raise questions about the operating efficiency of the hospital.”New York hospitals on the whole have dispensed fewer than half of their allocated doses to date, but performance varied from one group of hospitals to another, Cuomo said. The NYC Health + Hospitals system, the city’s main public hospital network, has only administered 31% of its allotment, compared with 99% for a few private hospitals in the state. In Florida, where officials have put senior citizens ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, Governor Ron DeSantis announced a policy under which the state would allocate more doses to hospitals that dispense them most quickly, “Hospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job at getting the vaccine out,” DeSantis said at a briefing.“We do not want vaccine to just be idle at some hospital system,” he added, although he did not say they would face fines.Florida will also deploy an additional 1,000 nurses to administer vaccines and will keep state-run vaccination sites open seven days a week, he said.UK VARIANT FOUND IN NEW YORKCuomo’s announcement that the more contagious COVID variant known as B.1.1.7 had been confirmed in a man in his 60s living in a town north of Albany gave new urgency to the state’s efforts to accelerate vaccinations. At least three other US cases of the so-called UK variant have been documented since last week, one each in Florida, California and Colorado. None of the four patients has a recent travel history, meaning the variant was likely spreading person-to-person within each of the communities where it turned up.Neither the UK variant, nor a similarly more contagious strain first found in South Africa, is believed any more lethal than the original form of the virus. Scientists say newly developed vaccines should be equally effective against both.But medical experts worry that the emergence of a more communicable variant could accelerate a months-long surge of infections and hospitalizations already straining US healthcare systems to their limits.The US death toll has climbed to well over 350,000 out of more than 20 million known infections to date, with the fatality rate averaging 2,600-plus lives every 24 hours over the past week. The staggering human toll, together with an upending of daily social life and a stifling of economic activity, has made the slower-than-expected uptake of available vaccines all the more vexing to authorities.‘WE HAVE TO DO BETTER’Some of the problem has been attributed to widespread distrust of immunizations, even among some healthcare workers, owing in part to the record speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed and approved 11 months after the virus emerged in the United States.But some U.S. officials also have cited a lack of adequate planning and logistical glitches in launching the most ambitious mass inoculation campaign in the nation’s history.The federal government has distributed more than 15 million vaccine doses to states and territories across the country, but only around 4.5 million have been administered so far, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released on Monday. Those figures put the government far short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, although officials said they expected the rollout would pick up significantly this month.“We have go to do better, and we are going to keep doing better, and I promise you, you will see in the next two weeks numbers increase substantially,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS News in an interview.Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said New York and Florida were being “overly bureaucratic” in penalizing hospitals over vaccine deliveries even as they coped with soaring patient caseloads.“Instead of fining hospitals, why not give them more resources to do this, more money, more staffing?” he said in a telephone interview.New York has dispensed about 175,000 doses of the 896,000 it has received since mid-December, according to CDC data. Florida has dispensed 265,000 of the 1.14 million doses it received.Monday also marked the first day when some Americans were due to receive their second vaccine shots, three weeks after getting the first. Among them was Maritza Beniquez, a healthcare worker in Newark, New Jersey.“I now have body armor,” she said after receiving the dose in a video shared on Facebook by state officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-covid-19-vaccines-go-idle-as-new-york-florida-move-to-penalize-hospitals/story-pQUw3JvX9UWoTn3gCVJphN.html
05-01-2021||World||UK is back in lockdown as hospitals face breaking point||Boris Johnson imposed a third coronavirus lockdown across England, shutting schools and ordering the public to stay at home, amid dire warnings that the National Health Service is at risk of being overwhelmed.The emergency measures will start immediately and last until at least February 15, potentially devastating retail and hospitality businesses and threatening to push the economy into a double-dip recession, as medics try to get a grip on the pandemic.In a televised address to the nation, the prime minister insisted he had no option but to close down all social activities, education and non-essential travel in the face of a sudden and severe surge in infections. Similar steps are being taken across the rest of the UK, he said.The government now aims to rush out a vaccination program, reaching 13.9 million vulnerable people and carers by mid-February so restrictions can begin to be lifted.“Our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic,” Johnson said in the broadcast. “With most of the country already under extreme measures it’s clear that we need to do more to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out.”Police FinesThe police will have legal powers to use fines and dispersal orders to enforce the rules. Parliament will be recalled to debate the measures on Wednesday but the regulations are due to become law on Tuesday, officials said.The prime minister was forced to act after data showed new infections soaring past 50,000 a day and more people in the hospital than in the first peak of the virus in April.By January 4, there were 26,626 patients in hospital with Covid-19, a 30% increase in a week, which the government is blaming on a surge in infections from a new, faster spreading strain of the virus.Johnson resisted pressure from scientists and opposition lawmakers to lockdown the whole country in December. He cut back plans to allow families to mix over Christmas, but insisted he wanted to avoid nationwide curbs like those seen in March, choosing to keep a regional tier system in place instead.But government chief medical officers for the four nations of the UK warned on Monday that the health service may not be able to cope without urgent action now. They issued a statement two hours before the prime minister’s announcement, saying the NHS is “under immense pressure” already.Overwhelmed“We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days,” they said in a statement which said the national alert level is now at the highest level five. “Cases are rising almost everywhere.”Scotland earlier announced a lockdown starting at midnight. “We are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus,” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said as she ordered Scots to stay home and for schools to remain shut.Johnson has made keeping schools open for face-to-face learning a priority for his government, but scientists warned last month they would have to close to stop the virus from spreading. While children rarely suffer badly from the disease, they can infect their families after catching it from their friends.It’s a far cry from the government’s optimism in early December, when the arrival of vaccines was described as the “scientific cavalry” coming to the rescue.On Monday, the premier insisted he wanted to vaccinate about 14 million older and vulnerable people and their carers, including frontline medics, by the middle of February.“If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus,” Johnson said. “And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long.”But there will be a “time lag” between vaccinating patients and the pressure on the NHS easing, Johnson said, adding that he is “cautious about the timetable ahead.”The dilemma for the government has been to try to balance attempts to stop the spread of the virus against the need to keep shops and businesses open to protect the economy, which has already suffered its deepest recession since the Great Frost in 1709.A double-dip recession is looking increasingly inevitable as a result of the new lockdown. Before Johnson’s announcement, most economists expected the UK economy to eke out some growth this quarter.Four weeks of school closures could cost as much as 3% of GDP, according to a tweet by Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz SE. Bloomberg Economics estimates that as much as 6% of Europe’s labor supply could be affected by the narrowing of childcare options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-is-back-in-lockdown-as-hospitals-face-breaking-point/story-t2UNwK0BmxGHb13lQuWZ6I.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson locks down UK again, says ‘variant spreading at an alarming rate’||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday night announced another national lockdown from early Wednesday following continuing spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases – the country registered over 50,000 daily infections for seven consecutive days – as the race between vaccine and the virus entered a new phase.Johnson said in an address to the nation that the variant has been spreading at an “alarming rate”, which makes another lockdown imperative. The restrictions with the main message to ‘stay at home’ will last from early Wednesday for six weeks, he said, adding that they include closure of schools, not venturing out of homes unless for essential reasons and working from home.A grim-faced Johnson said: “(We) now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible”.“As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000”.“That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further.“With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home”, he added.This is the third nation-wide lockdown since March 2020. It was re-imposed in November, when cases rose after a dip over the summer months. The overall number of deaths in the UK is expected to reach the grim figure of 100,000 by the end of January or early February.Two vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca have been deployed, with over 1.5 million people so far vaccinated; the UK has ordered 40 million of the former and 100 million of the latter vaccine.The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales said that based on the latest data, the UK’s alert level moved from level 4 to level 5, which means hospitals and the health infrastructure is under “immense pressure”.They said in a statement: “There are currently very high rates of community transmission, with substantial numbers of Covid patients in hospitals and in intensive care. Cases are rising almost everywhere, in much of the country driven by the new more transmissible variant”.“We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-locks-down-uk-again-says-variant-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate/story-TjbAv6FzJU6G9x4M6A6fiJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Joe Biden: Most closely watched man of 2021||No government will be watched as closely as that of United States President-elect Joe Biden’s. After four rollercoaster years of Donald Trump, the world will look for proof of the new Democratic President’s claim, “America is back.” Despite an emphatic election victory and an administration of Washington veterans, the going will not be easy. The political guerrilla war Trump is still waging against Biden is a warning the Republican Party will remain irascible and irrational. The Right may yet control the Senate and have a good chance of recapturing both houses in the 2022 midterm elections. Biden has indicated he is a one-term president which would confer lame duck status by early 2023. The president-elect wants to resurrect the spirit of bipartisanship of yore. But Trump is working hard and dirty to ensure that doesn’t happen.Read more| Biden flexes Georgia muscle alongside GOP in Senate racesBiden’s foreign policy strategy is to spend as little time on foreign policy as possible. He believes the US needs large-scale social engineering at home if it wants to avoid throwing up another populist like Trump. He wants to cut defence spending and has ambitious plans to rebuild America’s infrastructure, green its energy and transport, and revamp its health care and educational systems. But how will he do all this while also facing off the “Death to America” bloc of China, Russia, Iran and Turkey? That will be his primary global challenge.The Biden strategy is to revive the US’s alliance structure, the most extensive of any country in the world and pooh-poohed by Trump. Which is why he keeps talking up Europe and NATO. He will also be softer on Israel, India and other countries who are strategically close to the US but ideologically distant from the Democrats. Biden will seek to create coalitions of the willing to, say, counter China on 5G technology or Belt and Road infrastructure. But he will downplay military responses, so expect the US to push for the Quad to be more about supply chains and less about aircraft carriers. At the same time, Washington will try to work closely with Beijing and Moscow on multilateral issues. Biden has called for partnering with China on “climate change, nonproliferation, and global health security.”Read more| Biden has no record of missteps on IndiaAll this sounds good on paper. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating and Biden may yet choke. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has already warned that if Washington wants to work, it must look the other way when it comes to Xinjiang and Hong Kong – both of which will be the world’s human rights black holes this coming year. And both governments have already begun sparring over Taiwan. The president-elect has said he sees Russia as a greater threat than China. A more positive element is Biden’s plans to revive nuclear talks with Iran. Tehran is already readying to expand oil production in expectation of an easing of sanctions. What is good for the Narendra Modi government is that India fits in nicely with a lot of what Biden wants to accomplish on the world stage. And what Biden’s team doesn’t like about India, largely civil rights issues on the domestic front, will be small fry compared to the unpleasantness of other governments. The incoming US president has said he plans to hold a climate summit – here Modi can expect a seat at the high table – and another of democracies – where he should expect a private lecture on what Biden has called “democratic backsliding.” Biden has said he won’t be doing trade agreements in a hurry just as well as New Delhi doesn’t do FTAs well.Read more| Joe Biden’s inauguration to include presidential escort, virtual paradeBiden takes oath of office on January 20 and will face two immediate tests. One is getting his senior personnel choices approved by the Senate. The other is showing he can handle the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out better than Trump handled any aspect of the pandemic. After that, he needs to push through his domestic agenda despite dogged and exhausting opposition from the Republicans.

05-01-2021||World||Will economy give Xi Jinping muscle to flex?||China enters 2021 on a high. Even if it wasn’t, Beijing would manufacture one. This is the Chinese Communist Party’s 100th anniversary so there must be bells and whistles. However, Beijing’s leadership feels the imperial ambitions of the Middle Kingdom are going well. China, though its own bungling led to Covid-19 becoming a pandemic, is spreading the word about its success in stamping out the virus. Xi Jinping faces novice leaders in two of China’s main rivals, the United States and Japan. Its sharply rebounding economy will be the driver of any global revival.They started the fire, but want to be remembered as the phoenix who rose from the ashes. That is the narrative Beijing will push over the next few months. It’s one reason China has gone hammer and tongs at Australia and others who have called for a robust investigation as to how the pandemic began. The other part of this Covid alt-news will be about how Sinopharm’s vaccine was the only one provided to the affected.Read more| EU sets aside China’s rights record, seals pact with Prez Xi that may upset USXi will see no reason to be less wolf warrior-ish this year. Things worked out reasonably well last year despite the pandemic. President Donald Trump’s tariff strikes were hard but not true. The United States earned as much negative press as China for committing less sins. Foreign minister Wang Yi last month dismissed the US’s attempts at stitching together an international coalition against China, correctly saying “the overwhelming majority of [other countries] do not want to take sides.” Beijing’s influence expanded across Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Leaders from Germany to Sri Lanka offered economic concessions as tribute. Some things did not go as planned. Galwan Valley was supposed to bring India down a peg but backfired quite bloodily. No matter, as far as the Chinese public is concerned the incident never happened.Read more| Chinese economy is recovering. But there are gaps | AnalysisBeijing will have more on its domestic plate in 2021. Besides the 100th anniversary party for the Party, it will also adopt its 14th Five Year Plan. Xi has promised some tectonic economic shifts. He has said the Chinese equivalent of “vocal for local” will play as great a role in growth as exports. He has also committed to creating a net zero carbon economy. Fluff or fact? That will depend on the Five-Year Plan’s fine print. But expect a template on how to set up a separate supply chain structure and universe of cyber standards independent of the West: decoupling with Chinese characteristics.Beijing will accelerate its ambitions to create a new illiberal world order. This will also mean bad news for the likes of Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong who will recede further into darkness. If China is to create a sphere of influence across the world, it will have even less patience for different strokes among its own folks.Read more| Chinese President Xi Jinping announces more commitments to back global climate actionsThe keel of its fourth aircraft carrier will probably be laid this year. The airspace of Taiwan and Japan will be harassed endlessly by drones and fighters. Indian officials are braced for the possibility of border hostilities resuming in the spring. Yet Xi is likely to be more cautious about using China’s still limited military capabilities.Beijing’s main policy focus will be to roll out economic carrots and sticks to get other countries to sign on the dotted line of a Sinocentric economic order. In the case of India, it will largely be sticks designed to warn others of the dangers of trying to decouple from China. The Chinese economy will be Xi’s big red selling point. Despite being overloaded with debt and increasingly hostile to its own private sector, growth will clock in at 8% or more this year. GDP will nearly touch $16 trillion and probably overtake the European Union. These figures, Xi would hope, will ensure the world will forget about the curious incident at Wuhan in the night time and contemplate only the greater glory of the Chinese Communist Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-economy-give-xi-muscle-to-flex/story-TxkJzyBUyl1filc0XbywsJ.html
