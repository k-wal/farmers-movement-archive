The volcano spewed hot ash for 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in early December, triggering panic among villagers.Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.A strong earthquake shook Indonesia’s Sulawesi island early Friday, killing at least 46 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/semeru-volcano-on-indonesia-s-java-island-spews-hot-clouds-101610821502291.html
16-01-2021||World||'I was the mouse': How quest for love landed US Navy veteran in Iran jail||Michael White's long-anticipated trip to Iran was already a disappointment. The love interest he'd gone to visit had stopped seeing him and he'd idled away hours in his hotel room by himself.Then it got much worse.On his final day, the car he and his tour guide were in was abruptly cut off by another vehicle with a passenger frantically waving his hands at them. He recalls three men getting out, one with a video camera, forcing him into their car and driving him to an office for questioning. From there, it was on to jail, where orange-tinted water spewed from the sink and shower and prison-issued dirty sandals proved useful in shoving sewer roaches in the bathroom into the toilet.A handwritten journal he wrote behind bars — a copy of which was provided exclusively to The Associated Press — offers new details about his ordeal in Iran, which ended last June when the State Department secured the Navy veteran's release. In it, he catalogues physical abuse from his jailers and taunts from fellow inmates while held on dubious allegations. He writes tenderly of the woman he visited even while likening himself to a mouse lured into a trap. And he brands himself a “political hostage,” held on pretextual charges to secure concessions from the US. Seven months after his release, White is trying to reassemble his life in Mexico, unsure what comes next but eager to share his story.“I don’t want the government of Iran to think that, 'Oh, Mike White's out of here, he's going away, he's going to be quiet,'" he said in a recent interview. “That's not going to happen. Believe me, if only you understood the fear and anger inside of me as a result of what they did.”The peculiar saga began in July 2018 when White flew to Iran to visit a woman he'd met years earlier in a Yahoo chat room and with whom he hoped to rekindle an on-off relationship that included two prior visits to the country. But the bond turned sour on the most recent trip when the woman stopped seeing him and encouraged him to return home earlier than he'd planned.His 156-page manuscript is told from his own perspective with details that are vivid though sometimes difficult to corroborate. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. But according to the document, the men who arrested him pulled him into their car and drove him, blindfolded and handcuffed, to a building for questioning. His interrogator asked about his relationship with the woman, seeming to know details of her family, and telling White, vaguely, that some in Iran were concerned about his intentions there.He was taken to what he calls the “intel jail,” where he says he was given no food for days, nor blanket or pillow even as the vent blew frigid air. The conditions were compounded, he says, by his cancer diagnosis that had resulted in chemotherapy treatment and hospital stays in the months before he left for Iran.He was repeatedly interrogated over several months about why he'd come to Iran, as officials suspicious that he may be a spy handed him questionnaires focused on his military background and any intelligence service connections. At one point, he writes, he fabricated a tale about being tasked to gather intelligence by an acquaintance he said was with the National Security Agency, figuring that interrogators wanted to hear something like that before setting him free.“I was just saying something out of desperation, doing whatever to hopefully get them to just cut me loose," he said in the interview. ”It turned out it wasn’t really helpful at all."The truth was more mundane, he says, albeit more difficult to comprehend: He was a “dumb American” pursuing love.White's decisions were undoubtedly risky: His Iran visits came despite that country's hostile relationship with the US. He says he and his girlfriend got together in 2014 in Iran's Kish Island, even though retired FBI agent Robert Levinson vanished from there years earlier.But White, 48, who grew up in Southern California and was honorably discharged from the Navy, says he's long been drawn to Iran's culture and people and had felt safe there, connecting through social media to a network of acquaintances. He'd once thought of law school or entering politics, but at the time of a 2018 trip he hoped would recharge his life, he was working as a Job Corps resident adviser.He struggles to reconcile his affection for the woman he perceived as his girlfriend — “Her voice melts me with its softness and tenderness. My heart flutters when I see her,” he writes — with the suspicion that he was somehow set up during his visit. His Instagram page reflects that ambivalence, with photos posted this year of them together.“Yet, sadly, I was lured into a trap, like a mouse trap. I was the mouse,” he writes. "I followed my heart instead of my head and missed signs.”In jail, he writes, he was once awakened by a guard dumping a bucket of cold water on him. Another time, an interrogator snapped a whip on his toes as he completed a questionnaire. After White tossed water on a surveillance camera to get the guards’ attention, they pummeled him in the ribs and threw him to the floor, he writes.He was relocated to another prison where some inmates tauntingly referred to him as “The Great Satan.” One placed a cockroach inside his pants pocket as a prank.At the suggestion of a prisoner he befriended, he began a handwritten manuscript, writing it under the cover of playing Sudoku to hide it from the guards. He gave the pages to the prisoner who he says was able to smuggle it out through a cousin.White ultimately faced various charges, including posting private images, collaborating with the US. against Iran and disrespecting Iran's supreme leader. He was sentenced to 10 years but calls the charges a pretext to “extort” concessions.He insists he's not a spy and never posted any inappropriate photos of his girlfriend. He writes in his manuscript that he has indeed made social media posts about Iran but denies having disparaged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.An unexpected development came last spring as the coronavirus ravaged Iran. White, who was himself infected, was among thousands of prisoners released on medical furlough, permitted to live freely in Tehran in the Swiss Embassy's custody while required to remain in Iran.The State Department, which has maintained that White was wrongfully detained, arranged for his release in June, flying him back to the U.S. as part of a deal that spared additional prison time for an American-Iranian doctor convicted in the US of sanctions violations.In August, he visited the White House with other freed hostages and detainees to record a Republican National Convention segment praising the Trump administration. He sat beside President Donald Trump in a three-piece suit in an experience he says made him feel like a celebrity, though he recalls Trump not shaking his hand.“He was like, well, you know, if the media sees that, they're going to be flipping out of because of the corona(virus) thing,” White said.White isn't sure what comes next. He had contemplated opening a Persian restaurant, but isn't sure he'll do that now. He likens his life to the aftermath of a city-flattening hurricane."I’m just picking up the pieces, regrouping and trying to figure out how I’m going to move forward and stuff."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-the-mouse-how-quest-for-love-landed-us-navy-veteran-in-iran-jail-101610820662594.html
16-01-2021||World||US lawmakers who helped the rioters should be prosecuted, says Nancy Pelosi||US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday said lawmakers who may have helped in the January 6 storming of the Capitol in any way will be prosecuted.Democrats have alleged that rioters were given advance tours of the US Capitol ahead of the attack by some Republicans. How else, they have argued, could the rioters know their way around, reaching office rooms deep inside the building.“If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecutions,” Pelosi said at a news conference.“In order to serve here with each other, we must trust that people have respect for their oath of office, respect for this institution,” she added.Mikie Sherrill, a Democratic lawmaker who is also a former US Navy pilot, said she saw “members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on January 5 for reconnaissance for the next day”. She leads a group of Democrats demanding action against them.James Clyburn, a senior Democrat whose endorsement was crucial to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the primaries, was surprised that the rioters reached his unmarked office. “Well, it seems to me that something was going on - some coordination was going on between sitting members of Congress and some of these visitors to the Capitol,” he said.Four insurrectionists and one Capitol police officer were killed in an attack on the US Capitol on January 6 by a mob incited by outgoing President Donald Trump to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.Trump was impeached on Wednesday for “incitement of insurrection”, making him the first American president to be impeached twice. A trial by the Senate will take place at a date and time not announced yet.Preparations are underway to secure the US Capitol for Biden’s inauguration on January 20 - with four times more troops deployed in Washington, DC than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined as well as tall fencing. Trump will not attend Biden’s inauguration, he has said before, breaking a long-running tradition. Biden does not want him there either. Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the inauguration. He called vice-president elect Kamala Harris on Thursday afternoon to congratulate her. Neither Pence nor his boss had conceded defeat until then or congratulated the incoming team. Trump still hasn’t. And along with his enablers, he had contested the results with baseless claims of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-who-helped-the-rioters-should-be-prosecuted-says-nancy-pelosi-101610818611908.html
16-01-2021||World||Federal prisons on lockdown in run-up to Biden inauguration||All federal prisons in the United States have been placed on lockdown, with officials aiming to quell any potential violence that could arise behind bars as law enforcement prepares for potentially violent protests across the country in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.The lockdown at more than 120 federal Bureau of Prisons facilities took effect at 12am Saturday, according to an email to employees from the president of the union representing federal correctional officers.“In light of current events occurring around the country, and out of an abundance of caution, the decision has been made to secure all institutions,” the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement.The lockdown decision is precautionary, no specific information led to it and it is not in response to any significant events occurring inside facilities, the bureau said.To avoid backlash from inmates, the lockdown was not announced until after they were locked in their cells Friday evening.Shane Fausey, the president of the Council of Prison Locals, wrote in his email to staff that inmates should still be given access in small groups to showers, phones and email and can still be involved in preparing food and performing basic maintenance.Messages seeking comment were left with Fausey on Saturday.The agency last put in place a nationwide lockdown in April to combat the spread of the coronavirus.During a lockdown, inmates are kept in their cells most of the day and visiting is canceled. Because of coronavirus, social visits only resumed in October, but many facilities have canceled them again as infections spiked.One reason for the new nationwide lockdown is that the bureau is moving some of its Special Operations Response Teams from prison facilities to Washington, DC, to bolster security after President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6. Authorities are concerned there could be more violence, not only in the nation’s capital, but also at state capitals, before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.A Bureau of Prisons spokesman said the agency was coordinating with officials at the Justice Department to be ready to deploy as needed. Earlier this month, about 100 officers were sent to the Justice Department's headquarters to supplement security staff and were deputized by the US Marshals Service and given special legal powers to “enforce federal criminal statutes and protect federal property and personnel,” said the spokesman, Justin Long.The specialized units typically respond to disturbances and other emergencies at prisons, such as riots, assaults, escapes and escape attempts, and hostage situations. Their absence can leave gaps in a prison’s emergency response and put remaining staff at risk.“The things that happen outside the walls could affect those working behind the walls,” Aaron McGlothin, a local union president at a federal prison in California.As the pandemic continues to menace federal inmates and staff, a federal lockup in Mendota, California, is also dealing with a possible case of tuberculosis.According to an email to staff Friday, an inmate at the medium-security facility has been placed in a negative pressure room after returning a positive skin test and an X-ray that indicated an active case of tuberculosis.The inmate was not showing symptoms of the lung disease and is undergoing further testing to confirm a diagnosis, the email said.As a precaution, all other inmates on the affected inmate’s unit were placed on quarantine status and given skin tests for tuberculosis.The bacterial disease is spread similarly to Covid-19, through droplets that an infected person expels by coughing, sneezing or through other activities such as singing and talking.Mendota also has 10 current inmate cases and six current staff cases of Covid-19.As of Wednesday, the last day for which data was available, there were 4,718 federal inmates and 2,049 Bureau of Prisons staff members with current positive tests for Covid-19.Since the first case was reported in March, 38,535 inmates and 3,553 staff have recovered from the virus. So far, 190 federal inmates and 3 staff members have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-prisons-on-lockdown-in-run-up-to-biden-inauguration-101610816787593.html
16-01-2021||World||Prince William worried about strain on UK emergency workers||Prince William says he is concerned about the mental health of UK ambulance drivers, police officers and other first responders who are being exposed to extraordinary levels of trauma and death as coronavirus cases soar.William, a former search and rescue helicopter pilot, told emergency workers on a video call that they must not be afraid to ask for help despite their inclination to help others first.“I fear…you’re all so busy caring for everyone else that you won’t take enough time to care for yourselves, and we won’t see the impact for quite some time,’’ William, the second in line to the British throne, said on a tape released late Friday.Britain’s health care system is staggering as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus coupled with cold, wet winter weather puts unprecedented strain on hospitals and emergency workers.The London Ambulance Service says it is receiving about 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared with 5,500 on a typical busy day. But the strain is being felt across all emergency services. Hundreds of firefighters, for example, have volunteered to drive ambulances to ease pressure on beleaguered services.The surge in infections across the UK has pushed the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 to a record 37,282, more than 70% higher than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. Britain has reported 87,448 coronavirus-related deaths, more than any other country in Europe and the fifth-highest number worldwide.Eleven months into the pandemic, the pace is taking a toll on the men and women who are first to respond to calls for help.But many emergency workers aren’t taking advantage of counseling and other support programs because they are too focused on responding to the crisis, said Phil Spencer, a police inspector who coordinates well-being programs for the Cleveland Police force in northeastern England.“Perhaps further down the line, when all this is gone, we’re going to have some broken police officers and emergency services staff, because we’re too busy focusing on protecting the most vulnerable,” Spencer told the prince and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.William and Kate have made ending the stigma attached to mental health issues a focus of their charitable work.As the couple chatted with emergency workers and counselors, William shared his own experiences of working as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance.“I think a lot of the public don’t understand that when you’re surrounded by that level of intense trauma and sadness and bereavement, it really does, it stays with you at home, it stays with you for weeks on end, doesn’t it?’’ he said. “And you see the world in a much more, slightly depressed, darker, blacker place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-worried-about-strain-on-uk-emergency-workers-101610813122957.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump will leave about $500 million poorer after 4 years in office||On the day Donald Trump was getting impeached in Washington, the lobby of his New York tower at 40 Wall St. was almost silent. Few footsteps smudged the shiny marble.But up the dark and golden elevators, trouble was stirring in one of the billionaire’s most valuable properties. Inside one law office, two partners had clashed over whether to keep paying rent to a landlord who encouraged the Capitol’s deadly riot. On the 24th floor, a nonprofit that fights tuberculosis was exploring options for leaving. On the seventh, the Girl Scouts were figuring out how to break their lease.And in the basement, vintage bank-vault doors that weigh more than 10 tons stood wide open. There, in a club room that Trump renovated, the news was playing on a jumbo television to an audience of empty armchairs just as Congress voted against him.So it goes in Trump’s empire as his presidency slouches toward the end.The Trump Organization, run by sons Eric and Don Jr., was struggling with the devastating consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic even before their father incited a raid on Congress. Efforts to sell his Washington hotel were shelved, his office buildings were losing value amid a glut of space in Manhattan, and his golf courses were facing the reality that younger generations aren’t so interested.Trump entered office worth $3 billion. Despite soaring stock prices and his own tax cuts, he will leave about $500 million poorer, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.His buildings are saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, most of it coming due in the next three years and more than a third of it personally guaranteed. Refinancing would mean finding lenders and corporations willing to work with history’s only twice-impeached ex-president.“Nothing like this has ever happened to him,” said Barbara Res, who was an executive in Trump’s company for years. “Will he come back? My gut tells me yes, because he always comes back. But he won’t come back the same.”Deserted AvenueTrump already has survived corporate bankruptcies, rough times in Atlantic City, a school that ended with probes and dead-end brand journeys for Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka and even an airline. The man who made “America First” his catchphrase could now hunt overseas for partnerships and licensing deals.Even so, Deutsche Bank AG, his longtime financier, won’t touch him anymore. Signature Bank, where his daughter Ivanka once served on the board, is closing his accounts. Cushman & Wakefield Plc, a broker for 40 Wall St., is cutting ties, and PGA of America is steering clear.The biggest hits to Trump’s fortune are in New York, the heart of his empire, where the Queens-born developer turned into a reality star and then descended his own escalator to enter politics.Outside Trump Tower, East 56th Street remains blocked, a parking lot for about a dozen black SUVs with government plates. The building is closed to visitors due to the pandemic, shutting Trump’s grill, bar, cafe and ice cream parlor.Not that there are tourists around for winter sundaes. Fifth Avenue is almost deserted. Vacant storefronts are multiplying, and some remaining boutiques are now appointment-only. Rents have slid 32% from a 2018 peak, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.Trump’s cavernous East 57th Street space is currently subleased to the iconic Tiffany’s jewelry store, but a new tenant will soon be needed.High above, 1,596 square feet of Trumpian extravagance keeps getting cheaper.Apartment 55B, with blue lapis floors and medallion ceilings, is listed for $2.995 million, about $2.5 million less than four years ago. It’s hardly an outlier. Prices at the skyscraper have slipped by a third since Trump took office, StreetEasy data show.And even before the Capitol attack, his company was offering concessions to some tenants at 40 Wall St., lender records show. The $137 million debt at the property was added to lender watch lists in November after net income dipped below what underwriters expected when the debt was issued in 2015.City’s Rejection“I don’t believe his name is going to bring a premium currently,” said Warren A. Estis, founding partner at real estate law firm Rosenberg & Estis and owner of an 86th-floor penthouse at Trump World Tower near the United Nations. Still, Estis said he’s heard no rumblings from his condo board about stripping Trump’s name from the building.“What’s in a name? A rose by any other name is still a rose,” says Estis. “It appears Donald is very resilient and I expect he’s going to bounce back from this.”New York City itself wants nothing to do with Trump. Officials plan to end more than $17 million in contracts with the president’s family business, including a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park and a Bronx golf course.“The City of New York has no legal right to end our contracts and if they elect to proceed, they will owe the Trump Organization over $30 million,” the company said in a statement. “This is nothing more than political discrimination, an attempt to infringe on the First Amendment, and we plan to fight vigorously.”While police officers were keeping the public out of Trump Tower, including its Trump Store, there was also bad news for fans going online to nab Trump pint glasses for $55 or a Trump candle set for $80. Shopify is refusing to service the website, which has left customers with a warning that their connection isn’t private and “attackers might be trying to steal your information.”Not long ago, the big question hovering over Trump’s return to the business world was whether the former reality television host would make a foray into conservative media, where product endorsements and licensing deals are legion. Now the talk in finance circles centers on whether he can defend his existing empire. He’ll have to convince lenders he’s worth the risks, and prove to developers his name retains enough cache.“The presidency and Donald’s racist, sexist and xenophobic language has tarnished the brand to such an extent that it is valueless,” said Michael Cohen, his lawyer-turned-critic.Streaming TrumpEric Trump brushed off such assertions in an interview with the Associated Press this week, blaming “cancel culture” for recent hits to the family empire that he said posed no threat to the company’s finances. His father, he noted, still has armies of fans: “You have a man who would get followed to the ends of the Earth by a hundred million Americans.”One executive in conservative media who’s still bullish on Trump’s prospects for creating a subscription-based video service conceded that recent events may limit possible platforms, advertisers and partners.Still, the executive said that even controversial porn purveyors can find homes online. He estimated Trump could get 5 million to 15 million supporters to pay $10 a month for content, predicting gold hawkers and close friends wouldn’t balk at advertising.The Trump Organization could also look overseas.During his presidency, Trump pledged that his businesses wouldn’t sign new deals in foreign countries, but it continued to collect income from licensing arrangements in Turkey, the Philippines and India. His administration developed close ties in the United Arab Emirates, where he’s previously done business, and Saudi Arabia, where his company considered projects before his ascent to the presidency.Betting on ReboundHussain Sajwani, chairman of Dubai’s DAMAC Properties, said he’d welcome the chance to expand his firm’s relationship with Trump.“We have a great relationship with the Trump Organization, and, be assured, we have absolutely no intention to cancel our agreement,” he said in a statement.The author of “The Art of the Deal” and “The Art of the Comeback” could try his hand at returning to publishing. Trump’s predecessors in the White House, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, got a record-breaking $65 million advance for their memoirs.Trump may have created problems for himself here, too. Publisher Simon & Schuster canceled a planned book by Trump ally Josh Hawley, citing the Missouri senator’s “role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.”At least for now, a return to politics isn’t out of the question. Betting website PredictIt pegs the odds that Trump will file this year to run again for president at about 30%. Recently, like so much else, that number has taken a tumble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-will-leave-about-500-million-poorer-after-4-years-in-office-101610813077951.html

The groundbreaking for the project was done in November during the visit of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, and it was the first India-funded grant project to be inaugurated this year.The running track is the only one of international standard in the Maldives, and it was built on an open space in Male that has been used to conduct sports events and tournaments. Over the past six months, eight grant projects backed by India have been completed in the Maldives.The newly laid running track is designed to make the space more suited for exercise and sports and athletic events and will equally benefit sports professionals and residents of Male. The track also will promote a healthier lifestyle, which is one of the key pledges of Solih.Solih and Indian envoy Sunjay Sudhir participated in a limited overs cricket match during the inauguration ceremony and there was also a relay race and events involving differently-abled children.The Ekuveni project is part of 30 high-impact community development projects being implemented across the Maldives with a total outlay of $13 million from India.The projects completed with Indian grants includes a convention centre in Ukulhas, installation of streetlights in Kolhufushi, development of Vaani police centre, provision of vehicles and machinery to the Male city council, the Goidhoo-Fehendhoo school ferry, provision of equipment for gyms on 61 islands and creation of 67 children’s parks on atolls.Over the next three months, more India-backed projects will be inaugurated, including the Rasdhoo coastal protection project, a wetland park in Faresmathoda, and a refurbished orphanage and a renovated jetty in Hulhumale. With a special focus on the development of Addu city, India is helping set up three fish processing plants, five eco-tourism zones and a drug detoxification centre.India has also provided grants to set up a bottled water plant in Hoarafushi and a soil-testing laboratory at the Hanimaadhoo Agricultural Research Centre.“High impact community projects undertaken through Indian grant assistance constitute an important dimension of the dynamic development partnership between India and the Maldives,” the Indian high commission in Male said in a statement.“This development partnership is further distinguished by its transparent and participative nature and an inherent flexibility to perfectly complement requirements of the local community and the thrust of the government on decentralisation,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-implements-community-projects-worth-13-million-in-the-maldives-101610810693030.html

Paulo reported on Saturday, citing government and industry sources.Financial costs potentially worth billions of dollars and the exit of ally President Donald Trump from the White House are forcing President Jair Bolsonaro to backtrack on his opposition to Huawei bidding to provide the next generation cellular network for carriers in Brazil, the paper said.Like Trump, Bolsonaro opposes Huawei on the unproven grounds that it shares confidential data with China's Communist government.But, with China being Brazil's largest trade partner and Huawei's ability to compete on price, he has faced resistance from industry and within his own government, including from Vice President Hamilton Mourao.Estado de S. Paulo quoted Mourao as saying all companies that provide the necessary guarantees on respecting Brazil's national sovereignty and data protection will be allowed to offer 5G equipment in the country.Last month, sources told Reuters that Bolsonaro's government was looking for a legal way to exclude Huawei from 5G networks in Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-to-allow-china-s-huawei-in-5g-auctions-report-101610810245281.html

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, New Jersey and Mississippi are offering the vaccine to smokers under the age of 65 to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has claimed more than 392,000 lives in the United States.Earlier this week, Mississippi governor Tate Reeves announced an expansion of the vaccine rollout for people under 65 years of age with high-risk medical conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines say that adults of any age with smoking habit are at increased risk for severe Covid-19 associated illness and are placed in Phase 1c population groups, ahead of those essential workers not included in Phase 1b. Tate told a news conference that essential workers like teachers are next in line for the vaccination."And just be very clear to our emergency first responders, to our police officers, to our firefighters, and to our teachers, you're on deck. The next time we have an update, I expect it will be to announce that the vaccine will become available to you," the Mississippi governor said.While the phased rollout of vaccines in the two US states is in line with the federal guidelines published by the CDC, the decision to prioritise smokers over essential workers like teachers has drawn criticism. According to a CNN report, Bergen County Education Association president Sue McBride said that educators in New Jersey frustrated that they have been pushed back in the priority line."From what I am hearing, it's just another round of frustration and another round of difficulty, you know, our educators and our education support professionals have working contact with the students and with their colleagues in their school buildings," McBride was quoted as saying by the US media outlet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccination-priority-to-smokers-frustrate-essential-workers-in-us-report-101610808906895.html
16-01-2021||World||Norway: Deaths among elderly after first Covid-19 vaccine dose rise to 29||Norway has registered a total of 29 deaths among people over the age of 75 who’ve had their first Covid-19 vaccination shot, raising questions over which groups to target in national inoculation programs.The latest figure adds six to the number of known fatalities in Norway, and also lowers the age group thought to be affected from 80.Until Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech was the only vaccine available in Norway, and “all deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,” the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a written response to Bloomberg on Saturday.“There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said. All the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders,” it said. “Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.”Side EffectsNorway’s experience has prompted the country to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill, the most cautious statement yet from a European health authority as countries assess the real-world side effects of the first shots to gain approval.The Norwegian Institute of Public Health judges that “for those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant.”Pfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations,” Pfizer said.“We are aware that deaths have also been reported in other countries, but do not have full details of this yet,” Norway’s medicines agency said. “There are also differences between countries in who is prioritized for vaccination, and this could also affect the reporting of side effects, including death.”“The Norwegian Medicines Agency has communicated, prior to the vaccination, that when vaccinating the oldest and sickest, it is expected that deaths will occur in a time-related context with vaccination. This does not mean that there is a causal link between vaccination and death. We have also, in connection with the reported deaths, conveyed that it is possible that common and known side effects of the vaccines may have been a contributing factor to a serious course or fatal outcome,” the agency said.Norway’s recommendation doesn’t mean that younger, healthier people should avoid being vaccinated. But it’s an early indication of what to watch as countries begin to issue safety monitoring reports on the vaccines. Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, has said tracking the safety of Covid vaccines, especially those relying on novel technologies such as messenger RNA, would be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-suggests-covid-19-vaccine-may-be-too-risky-for-old-people-terminally-ill-101610809149331.html

Some of those steps were triggered by a law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran has blamed on its arch-foe Israel.They are also part of a process of retaliation Tehran started in 2019 in response to US President Donald Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the deal and his reimposition of US0. sanctions that the deal lifted in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.The three powers, who remain in the deal with China and Russia, said they were "deeply concerned" and that Iran's production of uranium metal had no civilian credibility and had potentially serious military implications.The nuclear deal imposes a 15-year ban on Iran producing or acquiring uranium metal, a sensitive material that can be used in the core of a nuclear bomb.The Iranian breaches raise pressure on US President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week and has pledged to return the United States to the deal if Iran first resumes full compliance. Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-european-powers-rebuke-iran-over-uranium-metal-plans-101610809470593.html

Eric Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and was the lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome. He would be the first life scientist to have that White House job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.The president-elect also said on Friday he is retaining the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project. Biden also is naming two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Frances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will lead the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration.Collins, in an email statement, called Lander “brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.”“I predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science,” Collins said.The job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.Science organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.“Elevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion,” said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.Biden has picked Princeton's Alondra Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, as deputy science policy chief.Lander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur “genius” fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.Lander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his “Achilles' heel": “I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/science-will-always-be-at-the-forefront-of-my-administration-joe-biden-101610808352015.html

Under the new guidance, the secondary employers, also known as clients, will have to comply with the filing requirements and other obligations which, currently, only lie with the primary employers or the staffing agencies.According to the office of Foreign Labor Certification (FLC), the regulations require all common-law employers of H-1B workers to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA). It will not only put the liability on employers for compliance obligations relating to wages and working conditions but will also lead to higher administrative burden and costs for clients. The new guidance documents will take effect in 180 days, which means the employers have to comply with the obligations for the applications filed on or after July 14.The labor department said that the interpretation and guidance are “more consistent with the H-1B statute and regulations”, adding that it is also “appropriate” in the wake of interpretative changes made by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). “This revised interpretation is long overdue in light of the language of the regulations, better comports with the goals of the H-1B program, and is consistent with recent Executive Branch directives,” John Pallasch, assistant secretary for employment and training, said in a statement.After the announcement, US Tech Workers, a non-profit organisation “representing the voices of American workers harmed by the H-1B visa program”, said that the new guidance was a “great way to target companies” that use staffing agencies to “displace Americans.” In a series of tweets, US Tech Workers said that the new regulation will hold those secondary employers accountable that claim to be not directly involved in the sponsoring of H-1B visas.“When Disney was sued for laying off American workers and replacing them H-1B workers brought in from third party IT outsourcing firms (Cognizant & HCL), Disney’s defense was that they weren’t the ones who sponsored the H-1B visas. This regulation would now hold them accountable,” it tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-companies-clients-required-to-meet-h1-b-filing-obligation-under-new-us-rule-101610804734319.html

Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment," he said.The agency reported Thursday that a total of 29 people had suffered side effects, including the 13 people who died.Twenty-one women and eight men experienced side effects, officials said.Besides those who died, nine had serious side effects -- including allergic reactions, strong discomfort and severe fever -- while seven had less serious ones, including severe pain at the injection site, New York Post reported.According to health officials around 400 people die each week in the nursing home population.A Pfizer rep said the company is "aware of reported deaths" following the administration of the vaccine in Norway and is working with the Norwegian Medicines Agency to gather all the relevant information.The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Norway is 58,202, while the death toll stands at 517, according to the Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-23-people-die-within-days-of-getting-first-covid-19-vaccine-dose-101610804880470.html
16-01-2021||World||Explainer: Can Trump pardon himself? Would the courts reject the move?||As he prepares to end a tumultuous four years as US president facing potential legal jeopardy, Donald Trump has discussed the possibility of pardoning himself, according to a source familiar with the matter. But there are questions about whether a president's broad executive clemency powers under the US Constitution would permit such action.The Justice Department has previously taken the view that the Constitution does not allow a sitting president to be indicted, but a former president enjoys no such protections.Here is an explanation of the potential constitutional problems with a self-pardon and why such action would not end Trump's legal jeopardy after his term ends on Wednesday.Is a self-pardon constitutional?There is no definitive answer to this question, and the Constitution does not explicitly address this possibility. No president has tried it before, so the courts have not weighed in. Trump wrote on Twitter in 2018 that he had the "absolute right" to pardon himself. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a self-pardon.Many scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case.Others have argued that a self-pardon is constitutional because the pardon power is very broadly worded in the Constitution. Historical texts made clear that the nation's 18th century founders discussed self-pardons, but opted not to include an explicit limitation on that power.The Constitution states that a president "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment." The common usage and history of the words "grant" and "pardon" imply a president's power under the clause is limited to issuing pardons to other people, according to University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman.The last time the Justice Department explored the question was in a 1974 memo by a lawyer in its Office of Legal Counsel that concluded that it would be unconstitutional for then-President Richard Nixon to pardon himself. Nixon resigned that year amid the Watergate political scandal."Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself," the Justice Department lawyer wrote.But the memo argued that Nixon could temporarily step down, be pardoned by his then-vice president, and then resume power. The 1974 memo does not have any legal authority.Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes.How might a self-pardon be tested in court?Under US law, courts do not issue advisory opinions. For a court to rule on a self-pardon's validity, the Justice Department would need to charge Trump with a crime, and then he would need to invoke the pardon as a defense, legal experts said.A self-pardon might only embolden prosecutors to bring a case against Trump because it would suggest he is hiding something, said law professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School in California.Why would Trump pardon himself?He may face criminal liability on several fronts.Some legal experts have pointed to Trump's Jan. 2 phone call in which he pressured Georgia's top election official to "find" enough votes to overturn his Nov. 3 election loss to President-elect Joe Biden in the state. They said the call could have violated a federal and a state law.A Georgia law against "criminal solicitation to commit election fraud" makes it illegal for a person to intentionally solicit, request, command or otherwise attempt to cause another person to engage in election fraud. A separate federal law makes it illegal to attempt to "deprive or defraud" people of a "fair and impartially conducted election process."Trump would likely argue that he merely expressed his personal opinions to the official, and did not order him to interfere with the election.Some lawyers have said Trump could be in legal jeopardy for an incendiary speech he gave to thousands of supporters on Jan. 6, shortly before a mob descended on the US Capitol and disrupted congressional certification of Biden's victory, sending lawmakers into hiding and leaving five people dead. Trump could make a strong case that his remarks were protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free speech, other lawyers said.Trump could be targeted by prosecutors for violations of state laws. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance already is spearheading a tax-fraud investigation into Trump's businesses, though no charges have yet been brought. Trump has called the investigation politically motivated.How broadly could a self-pardon be worded?There is precedent for very broadly worded pardons. Nixon eventually received a "full and unconditional pardon" from his successor, Gerald Ford. The pardon cleared Nixon for "any crimes that he might have committed against the United States as president."The US Supreme Court has never ruled on whether such a broad pardon is lawful. Some scholars have argued that the nation's founders intended for pardons to be specific, and that there is an implied limit on their scope.Could a pardon be preemptive?A pardon cannot cover future conduct, but a pardon can be preemptive in the sense that it can cover conduct that has not yet resulted in legal proceedings.The Nixon pardon is an example, and there are others. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter preemptively pardoned hundreds of thousands of "draft dodgers" who avoided a government-imposed obligation to serve in the Vietnam War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-can-trump-pardon-himself-would-the-courts-reject-the-move-101610799527059.html
16-01-2021||World||Joe Biden fills out state department team with Obama administration veterans||President-elect Joe Biden is filling out his State Department team with a group of former career diplomats and veterans of the Obama administration, signaling his desire to return to a more traditional foreign policy after four years of uncertainty and unpredictability under President Donald Trump.A transition official said Biden intends to nominate Wendy Sherman as deputy secretary of state and Victoria Nuland as undersecretary of state for political affairs — the second- and third-highest ranking posts, respectively.They were expected to be the 11 department appointees that Biden was announcing Saturday to serve under his pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the official said. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the appointments before the announcements and spoke on condition of anonymity.Among the others joining the Biden team are:—longtime Biden Senate aide Brian McKeon, to be deputy secretary of state for management.—former senior diplomats Bonnie Jenkins and Uzra Zeya, to be under secretary of state for arms control and undersecretary of state of democracy and human rights, respectively.—Derek Chollet, a familiar Democratic foreign policy hand, to be State Department counselor.—former U.N. official Salman Ahmed, as director of policy planning.—Suzy George, who was a senior aide to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will be Blinken's chief of staff.—Ned Price, a former Obama administration National Security Council staffer and career CIA official who resigned in protest in the early days of the Trump administration, will serve as the public face of the department, taking on the role of spokesman.—Jalina Porter, communications director for Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., who is leaving Congress to work in the White House, will be Price's deputy.Price and Porter intend to return to the practice of holding daily State Department press briefings, officials said. Those briefings had been eliminated under the Trump administration.Jeffrey Prescott, a former national security aide when Biden was vice president, is Biden's pick to be deputy ambassador to the United Nations, He would serve under U.N. envoy-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield.Five of the 11 are either people of color or LGBTQ. Although most are not household names, all are advocates of multilateralism and many are familiar in Washington and overseas foreign policy circles. Their selections are a reflection of Biden's intent to turn away from Trump's transactional and often unilateral “America First” approach to international relations.“These leaders are trusted at home and respected around the world, and their nominations signal that America is back and ready to lead the world, not retreat from it," Biden said in a statement. “They also reflect the idea that we cannot meet this new moment with unchanged thinking or habits, and that we need diverse officials who look like America at the table. They will not only repair but also reimagine American foreign policy and national security for the next generation.”Sherman led the Obama administration’s negotiations leading to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which Trump withdrew, and had engaged in talks over ballistic missiles with North Korea during President Bill Clinton's second term. Nuland served as assistant secretary of state for European Affairs during the Ukraine crisis..Sherman, McKeon, Nuland, Jenkins and Zeya will require Senate confirmation to their posts while the others will not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-fills-out-state-department-team-with-obama-administration-veterans-101610804015535.html

If we don’t start bringing revenue into the sector, we’re going to be in a very difficult place indeed," he told BBC radio."Airlines have been staying in business by taking on billions of pounds of debt which will need to be paid back," he added.Britain's current lockdowns ban most international travel meaning that airline schedules are currently minimal, but the withdrawal of any quarantine-free travel from Monday will be a further blow for the industry.The latest restrictions were prompted in part by a third wave of the disease that has caused record daily death tolls in Britain, as well as concern about a new coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil.Karen Dee, chief executive of Britain's Airport Operators Association, said the government needed to go beyond existing support that includes a temporary exemption from local property taxes.“The UK and devolved governments (for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) now need to set out as a matter of extreme urgency how they will support airports through this deepening crisis," she said.Relief from regulatory, policing and air traffic control costs would help, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-airports-call-for-urgent-government-support-after-travel-rules-tightened-101610802066491.html

And, the decision is an initiative to save their culture and identity as the Cherokee Nation has only 2,000 fluent speakers of the language.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19What is the Cherokee Nation?The Cherokee Nation is the sovereign tribal government settled in Indian territory present-day Oklahoma, United States. It is the largest tribe in the United States with more than 380,000 tribal citizens worldwide. The new government was established by the Cherokee people in the city of Tahlequah, Oklahoma. A constitution was also adopted 68 years earlier to the statehood of Oklahoma in September of 1839.The main aim of the Cherokee Nation is to protect the inherent sovereignty, preserve and promote their culture, language and values, and to improve quality of life for the next seven generations of Cherokee Nation citizens.Covid-19 and the Cherokee NationAround 141,000 tribal citizens reside in the reservation boundaries of northeastern Oklahoma. The tribe recorded 12,759 coronavirus disease cases and 73 deaths till date, as per the Cherokee Nation health dashboard. More than 30 who lost their lives due to the pandemic were native language speakers of the Cherokee Nation, according to the tribe reported CNN.Also Read | AIIMS worker, 34, is first in India to get Covid-19 vaccine"When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure," principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr was quoted as saying by CNN. "Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left," he added.Vaccination targetThe tribal government received the first consignment of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine of 975 doses on December 14 last year. More than 600 native speakers have been vaccinated so far and the government targets vaccinating 1000 by the end of the week, reported CNN.Prioritisation of native language speakers and people aged 65 years and beyond have also imbibed the tribal citizens with the trust in the vaccine. Hoskin said that the prioritisation of native speakers and elders has resulted in easing the anxieties of the citizens against the vaccines."People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation. I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence," Hoskin was quoted as saying by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/native-speakers-on-covid-19-vaccine-priority-list-as-cherokee-nation-looks-to-prevent-culture-erosion-by-pandemic-101610800874454.html

Final results were expected at 3 p.m (1200 GMT), it said.In a phone interview with Reuters, Wine accused Museveni of fabricating the results and called the poll "the most fraudulent election in the history of Uganda". He urged citizens to reject the results.Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker, also said his home in the capital, Kampala, was surrounded by hundreds of soldiers and that the military was not allowing him to leave.The army's deputy spokesman, Deo Akiiki, told Reuters that security officers at Wine's house were assessing threats he could face by going out: "So they might be preventing him in the interest of his own safety."Soldiers and police were out in force patrolling Kampala on Saturday.Museveni, 76 and in power for 35 years, campaigned for another term arguing his long experience in office makes him a good leader and promising to keep delivering stability and progress.Wine, 38, galvanised young Ugandans with his calls for political change and pledged to end what he calls dictatorship and widespread corruption.Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said on Friday he had video proof of voting fraud, and would share the videos as soon as internet connections were restored. The government ordered the internet shut down the day before the election, and the blackout was still in place.Electoral Commission Chairman Simon Byabakama said on Friday that under Ugandan law, the burden of proof rested with Wine.Reuters has not independently verified Wine's claims.The United States and the European Union did not deploy observer teams, but the U.S. State Department’s top diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, said in a tweet early on Saturday that the "electoral process has been fundamentally flawed".He cited fraud reports, denial of accreditation to observers, violence and harassment of opposition members, and the arrest of civil society activists.The African Union and East African Community sent observer teams to the election, but neither group of officials responded to requests for comment about possible irregularities.Police recorded 42 election-related offences nationwide during voting and tallying so far, police spokesman Fred Enanga said on Friday night on local NBS TV. Offences included assaults, voter bribery, and theft and damage of electoral materials, he said.The run-up to Thursday's election was more violent than in previous polls. Security forces cracked down on opposition candidates and their supporters during the campaign, and more than 50 people died in protests in November on one of the multiple occasions when Wine was arrested.PARLIAMENTARY WINSIn addition to the internet blackout, the government on Tuesday banned all social media and messaging apps. Wine and his supporters often used Facebook to relay live coverage of his campaign.In the parliamentary election, where candidates were vying for 529 seats, results were still coming in but Ugandan media reported that at least 19 candidate from Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) had won their races, while the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), previously the largest opposition party, has so far won 17 seats.The country's vice president, Edward Ssekandi, was one of a number of senior ruling party MPs who lost their seats, according to broadcaster NTV Uganda.The FDC won 35 seats in the 2016 election, but the NUP had no seats in the previous parliament - Wine was elected as an independent and joined the party last year.(Reporting by Nairobi newsroom; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uganda-presidential-polls-bobi-wine-claims-museveni-committed-electoral-fraud-101610798848527.html
16-01-2021||World||Japan's suicides jump 16% in Covid-19 second wave after fall in 1st wave: Study||Suicide rates in Japan have jumped in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly among women and children, even though they fell in the first wave when the government offered generous handouts to people, a survey found.The July-October suicide rate rose 16% from the same period a year earlier, a stark reversal of the February-June decline of 14%, according to the study by researchers at Hong Kong University and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology."Unlike normal economic circumstances, this pandemic disproportionately affects the psychological health of children, adolescents and females (especially housewives)," the authors wrote in the study published on Friday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.The early decline in suicides was affected by such factors as government subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure, the study found.But the decline reversed - with the suicide rate jumping 37% for women, about five times the increase among men - as the prolonged pandemic hurt industries where women predominate, increasing the burden on working mothers, while domestic violence increased, the report said.The study, based on health ministry data from November 2016 to October 2020, found the child suicide rate spiked 49% in the second wave, corresponding to the period after a nationwide school closure.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this month issued a Covid-19 state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures in a bid to stem the resurgence. He expanded it this week to seven more prefectures, including Osaka and Kyoto.Taro Kono, administrative and regulatory reform minister, told Reuters on Thursday that while the government would consider extending the state of emergency, it "cannot kill the economy.""People worry about Covid-19. But a lot of people have also committed suicide because they have lost their jobs, they have lost their income and couldn't see the hope," he said. "We need to strike the balance between managing Covid-19 and managing the economy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-suicides-jump-16-in-covid-19-second-wave-after-fall-in-1st-wave-study-101610798535980.html

The document is set to be adopted by the European Commission on Jan. 19, the day before US President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-draft-sets-out-plans-to-limit-us-dollar-reliance-report-101610797213865.html
16-01-2021||World||US officials plead for more use of languishing antibody drugs||US health officials are pleading for more use of Covid-19 antibody therapies from Eli Lilly and Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that have been plagued by logistical issues, lack of efficacy data and insufficient reimbursement.The antibody treatments, touted by President Donald Trump and once feared to be subject to rationing because of demand, have instead been underused. As little as 5% of the supply available was being used in some areas in December, and utilization is now about 20% to 25% of regimens distributed to states, according to a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson.The US has more than $4.2 billion in supply agreements for millions of doses of antibody therapies for Covid-19, including a $2.6 billion deal with Regeneron clinched this week. Frustrated health officials seek wider use of the drugs that, like Covid vaccines, were developed at top speed in hopes of keeping patients out of hospitals and potentially preventing the severely ill from overwhelming the nation’s health system.“We don’t have the kind of evidence people are used to,” Janet Woodcock, a longtime Food and Drug Administration official who serves as therapeutics lead for Operation Warp Speed, said Thursday in a briefing. Still, she said, the evidence that the drugs can keep people off hospital wards “is very convincing.”Worth the EffortWoodcock, who’s likely to play a role in President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, urged hospitals and health centers to make the investments to administer the drugs.“We really feel it is worth it to go to the effort, set up the infusion centers, have as many infusions to high-risk people as possible and decrease the burden to the health-care system,” she said at the briefing.The Lilly and Regeneron antibody treatments mimic proteins that are typically produced by the body to fend off the virus. Trump received Regeneron’s antibody therapy after he was diagnosed with Covid last year and heralded the drug’s benefits.Emergency FDA clearances in November made them the first drugs authorized for use in non-hospitalized patients. They’re intended specifically for older individuals or those with chronic medical conditions, who are at high risk of progressing to severe Covid-19.But the authorizations were based on small, early-stage trials, a point of contention for clinicians who say insufficient data makes it difficult to recommend the drugs to patients.Just over 641,000 doses of the antibody treatment had been administered as of Jan. 6, according to US government figures. US patients currently hospitalized with Covid numbered almost 130,000 as of Jan. 10, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Logistical HurdlesGetting the drugs to patients is rife with complexity. The antibody therapies must be infused early in a Covid-19 illness, when patients are infectious, so common treatment sites like hospital wards are risky. Further, the government’s distribution plan relies on hospitals.The government’s distribution plan to date has relied heavily on hospitals. Beset by the pandemic, they are not yet getting paid for performing infusions of the government-supplied drugs because of delays in Medicare reimbursement and payment from commercial health insurers.“It is a problem at a time when hospitals are financially strapped, as are many others in health care,” Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s vice president of quality and patient safety policy, said in an interview. “It needs to be resolved quickly.”An even tougher issue is identifying patients early after infection and getting them timely treatment, Foster said. Many patients aren’t tested at hospitals, and the institutions can’t always determine who’s eligible for antibody treatment, Foster said.Health-care companies are providing some assistance. Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. has funding from the U.S. to pinpoint viable recipients and administer antibodies in patients’ homes and long-term care facilities. Insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. is following as many as half a million patients in a real-world study in partnership with Lilly to help clarify how well the drugs work.Bolstering UptakeAlready this year, Lilly is seeing a significant improvement in uptake of its antibody, called bamlanivimab, over last year, according to Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley.Some states are “running out of drugs, and are trying to get more, while other states, they’re in that 20% or less utilization range,” Smiley said in an interview.Regeneron declined to comment.Patients and doctors would benefit from more information about where to find the monoclonal antibodies, he said. But the companies can’t advertise their products, which lack full approval that’s required to do outreach. Absence of a coordinated, federal response is also an an obstacle, creating a void of information about how and where to get the treatment.“I get friends of friends of friends who say, ‘My dad is sick. I know about Lilly’s drug, but how do I get it?’” he said.Belated WebsiteThe government has launched a website outlining which hospitals have received antibody therapies. As of Thursday, about 23 states lacked any identified infusion sites. Officials say they are working on updating the platform, and that all sites will be required to have their locations listed. The National Infusion Center Association, an industry group, has also launched a treatment locator.The US has also expanded distribution of antibody therapies to other settings like nursing homes, with hopes of doing so in urgent cares as well, Woodcock said Thursday.The AHA has urged the government to consider sites like separate infusion clinics run by public health or home health agencies, or converting ambulatory surgery centers into infusion sites. Rural areas are looking at using mobile units, which federal officials have expressed support for, according to Mark Howell, senior associate director of policy for the AHA.Smiley said he’s optimistic that more patients will get access to its antibody therapy. The company will likely invest another $300 million to $400 million this year to ramp up supply and even develop a more easily administered version, after spending about $450 million on its Covid program in 2020.“We should be able to make a bigger impact than we are making, and certainly we’ll be able to make a bigger impact in February and January and so on,” Smiley said. “Hopefully by the second half of this year it’s not as big of an issue because we’re getting the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-plead-for-more-use-of-languishing-antibody-drugs-101610795008878.html
16-01-2021||World||Armin Laschet elected chairman of German chancellor Merkel's CDU party||Germany's Christian Democrats elected Armin Laschet as chairman on Saturday, aiming to unify their divided party behind a new leader who they hope can succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor when she steps down after federal elections in September.Laschet, the premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany's most populous - won a runoff vote against Friedrich Merz, securing 521 votes against 466 for his arch-conservative rival, according to a ballot of 1,001 party delegates.At the helm of the CDU he replaces Europe's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, who has said she will not run for chancellor again."I want to do everything so that we can stick together through this year... and then make sure that the next chancellor in the federal elections will be from the (CDU/CSU) union," Laschet said in his victory speech.Laschet, 59, presents himself as the Merkel continuity candidate, and she said last year he had "the tools" to run for chancellor, the closest she has come to endorsing anyone.By tradition, the CDU chairman is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the conservative bloc is on course to win September's federal ballot.However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is the conservative most favoured by voters. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic Health Minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armin-laschet-elected-chairman-of-german-chancellor-merkel-s-cdu-party-101610795554401.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump’s China Inc. onslaught leaves key decisions for Biden||A year ago, President Xi Jinping asked the US to treat Chinese companies “fairly” in a letter read out at the White House to mark the signing of a landmark trade deal between the world’s biggest economies.At the time, President Donald Trump’s actions against China Inc. had mostly been aimed at tech giant Huawei Technologies Co., which had become a global leader in the race to set up 5G networks across the world. And even though it was blacklisted, Huawei enjoyed an ample supply of the radio chips critical to maintaining its dominance.Now, with Trump set to leave office next week, dozens of strategic Chinese companies find themselves in US crosshairs after a year that saw relations nosedive as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Besides closing loopholes on Huawei, effectively knee-capping its smartphone business, the Trump administration took a wide range of actions to thwart China’s efforts to dominate high-tech industries that will drive growth over the next few decades.The profile of the companies targeted, including in the latest announcements on Thursday, is staggering. They include China’s three biggest telecom firms, its top chipmaker, its biggest social media and gaming players, its top two smartphone makers, its main deepwater energy explorer, its premier military aerospace contractor, its leading drone manufacturer and its primary commercial planemaker. At risk is China’s ability to produce everything from 5G networks to a passenger jet to compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.While the scope of Trump’s unprecedented actions has roiled markets, the full reckoning of their impact largely hinges on President-elect Joe Biden. His incoming administration will have the power to either keep the restrictions in place, remove them or tighten them further on companies such as Xiaomi Corp., an Apple Inc. competitor hit this week for alleged ties to China’s military -- an allegation it denies.“Biden can’t afford to look soft on China, so may end up getting stuck enforcing any measures Trump puts in place on his way out, regardless of whether they are fully consistent with his own administration’s ideal policy approach,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting, a US-owned firm that helps companies invest in China.Trump’s campaign against Chinese companies accelerated in June, when the Pentagon unveiled a list of Chinese companies it said were effectively controlled by the People’s Liberation Army for the first time under a requirement in a 1999 law. In November, shortly after he lost the Nov. 3 election, Trump banned US investment in Chinese companies named on the list, which climbed to 44 on Thursday with the addition of Xiaomi and eight others.The order said that designated stocks could not be purchased by Americans from Jan. 11, and that holdings by Americans must be fully divested by November when transactions will be frozen. Nearly $12 billion worth of Chinese securities will need to be divested by US investors by the November deadline, Morgan Stanley strategists estimated, using the Jan. 13 version of the list.The New York Stock Exchange this month said it would delist the thinly-traded New York shares of China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., the first time an American exchange removed Chinese companies due to tensions between the two countries. In Hong Kong, where the three stocks are primarily listed, China Mobile fell to its lowest price since 2006 and China Telecom tumbled to a low of more than 17 years.Chinese officials dismissed the impact of the NYSE’s restrictions and said it would ultimately hurt U.S. interests, but they also struck a critical note. “Some politicians in the US have been oppressing foreign companies listed in the US,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Xiaomi SinksThe decision was followed by a series of similar moves from U.S. providers of funds, derivatives and investment products as the ban took effect on Jan. 11. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. delisted about 500 warrants and callable bull/bear contracts in Hong Kong, the world’s largest market for structured products. State Street Corp.’s $13 billion Tracker Fund of Hong Kong bled $470 million in a single day -- the most since it was founded in 1999.On Friday, Xiaomi sank 10% after being named on the military list, the worst day since its Hong Kong debut in July 2018. Other firms on the list include state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which is central to China’s goal of competing with Boeing and Airbus.Besides the list of military companies, Trump’s Department of Commerce has maintained a separate but connected list of Chinese firms that need specific permission to access U.S. technology. In December, the department said it was blacklisting chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co. and more than 60 other Chinese companies “to protect US national security.” China National Offshore Oil Corp., the country’s third-biggest oil company, was added to the Entity List on Thursday. It said it noticed the development and would continue to monitor it.‘Grand Bargain’Unless Trump takes action on Xiaomi or other companies placed on the military list before next Tuesday, it will be up to Biden to determine whether to restrict the company from accessing key components from the US While Biden hasn’t tipped his hand on which Trump actions he could rescind, most of the current administration’s tougher stances against China have received bipartisan support in Congress.Kurt Campbell, tipped to become Biden’s Indo-Pacific coordinator, said the administration would initially seek to build consensus with allies on China after dealing with a host of domestic issues, according to the South China Morning Post. He said the two countries could take confidence-building steps, such as reversing tit-for-tat moves on expelling journalists, easing visa restrictions and reopening closed consulates.“It’s possible the sanctions could be lifted in a grand bargain, perhaps as part of a trade agreement that would give the president political cover for easing back on recent actions,” said Nicholas Turner, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson LLP in Hong Kong who specializes in economic sanctions.China RetaliationChina, for its part, isn’t sitting still. The Foreign Ministry on Friday vowed to protect the rights of Chinese companies, with spokesman Zhao Lijian saying Trump’s moves amounted to “unilateralism, double standards and bullying.”Over the past few years, China has enhanced its toolbox to hit back at the US even though it has mostly held fire. It created an “unreliable entities list” and passed a new export control law that could potentially be used to restrict rare earths vital for key technologies. Last week it issued new rules that would allow Chinese courts to punish global companies for complying with foreign sanctions -- a move that could theoretically force businesses to choose between the US and China.Xi has also appeared to abandon hope that relations with the US would improve under Biden, with a renewed push to gain self-sufficiency in key technologies. China’s public, meanwhile, is getting used to the constant barrage and see the US lists “as a certificate of achievement for Chinese companies,” said Chen Xi, an adjunct associate professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University.“The Biden administration won’t be dealing with these issues anytime soon once he is sworn in, because it is beneficial for him to use such lists and sanctions as a bargaining chip with China,” Chen said. “In the long run, Chinese companies will strengthen their self-dependence in core technology, while global firms may find themselves losing an important market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-china-inc-onslaught-leaves-key-decisions-for-biden-101610795013918.html
16-01-2021||World||Pak HC forces govt to remove Imran Khan's aide from PTV chairman's position||The Pakistan Cabinet has removed Naeem Bukhari, a close associate of Prime Minister Imran Khan, as chairman of Pakistan Television (PTV), after the Islamabad High Court barred him from working as the head of the state-run channel, according to media reports on Saturday.Supreme Court lawyer, politician and former TV host Bukhari was appointed as chief of the state broadcaster in November last year, inviting criticism for getting benefit from his closeness to Prime Minister Khan.In an embarrassment to Khan, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday restrained Bukhari from working as the PTV chairman while hearing a set of petitions challenging his appointment, citing it a violation of a 2018 Supreme Court order in a similar case.Justice Minallah had remarked that the Cabinet did not make a clear decision on relaxing the age limit for 65-year-old Bukhari.The Cabinet, through circulation, took a decision in which Bukhari and two other PTV directors were removed from their posts as they were over 65 years, the Dawn News reported, quoting Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry.When asked why the decision was taken in haste and made through circulation instead of convening a formal meeting of the Cabinet, the minister said the government had to take a decision as presently the PTV was without a head and facing a “chaos-like situation”, the report said.The Cabinet also restored Aamer Manzoor as the managing director of PTV, the Geo News reported. Manzoor was removed by the corporation's board of directors on January 1.Barring Bukhari from serving as PTV chairman, the high court had directed the government to move a fresh summary for his appointment and clarifying special age relaxation for him. The court adjourned the hearing for two weeks.While passing the order, the IHC recalled a 2018 Supreme Court decision, which set aside the appointment of Ataul Haq Qasmi as PTV chairman.The apex court in Qasmi's appointment case had ordered the federal government to appoint a full-time managing director of PTV after fulfilling all legal, procedural, and codal formalities strictly in accordance with the law.The court noted that the information ministry had repeated the same mistakes as those made in Qasmi’s case and did not go through the apex court’s judgement before sending the summary to the federal Cabinet.The petition while challenging Bukhari’s appointment pointed out that contrary to the direction of the apex court, the vacancy had not been advertised in the press and the appointment was made without inviting applications for the vacant position.It said the federal cabinet had relaxed the upper age limit for Bukhari, without mentioning plausible reasons in the minutes of the federal cabinet meeting.Bukhari successfully defended Khan in 2017 in a famous case seeking his disqualification from public office for failing to show the source of income for buying an estate in the suburbs of Islamabad. He also led the legal team of Khan in the Panama Papers leak case.Interestingly, Bukhari's appointment was made in apparent haste as the federal Cabinet had in its meeting considered a summary for his appointment but did not endorse his induction as PTV chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-hc-forces-govt-to-remove-imran-khan-s-aide-from-ptv-chairman-s-position-101610793151424.html
16-01-2021||World||End of Merkel era: German CDU to pick new party leader on Saturday||Germany's Christian Democrats elect a new chairman on Saturday, aiming to unite their conservative party behind a leader who they hope can succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor when she steps down after federal elections in September.At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy. Merkel, the continent's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, has said she will not run again.The new CDU chairman will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress, who began voting shortly before 1000 GMT.By tradition, that person is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the conservative bloc is on course to win September's federal ballot.Centrist Armin Laschet, arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are vying for the CDU leadership.However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is the conservative most favoured by voters. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic Health Minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership.Laschet, the first of the three candidates to speak on Saturday, said many voters preferred Merkel over her party."The Chancellor's reputation both here and abroad can be summed up in one word: trust," he told an empty studio from which the congress was livestreamed to delegates.The next leader's task would be to earn that same trust, both for himself and for the party, he said.The three declared CDU candidates all contrast with Merkel.Roettgen, 55, the eloquent chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China. Merz, 65, has targeted European Central Bank policy and is less diplomatic. Laschet, 59, who has polished his international profile, complains Berlin has taken "too long to react" to French calls for European Union reform.Roettgen has suggested that, if elected CDU leader, he could support Soeder, Bavaria's premier, to run as chancellor candidate for their alliance.Soeder, 54, has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late. He plays coy about his ambitions - "My place is in Bavaria" has been his repeated refrain.Carsten Nickel at Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said Soeder's deft move towards the centre ground could make him the ideal candidate to lead a coalition with the ecologist Greens."But of course, the true challenges will arise when liberal and conservative demands clash," Nickel added.Germany is headed for another coalition government in September, with the CDU/CSU likely though not guaranteed to lead it.Opinion polls give Merkel's conservative bloc around 36% of votes, followed by the Greens on around 20% and the Social Democrats on 16%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-merkel-era-german-cdu-to-pick-new-party-leader-on-saturday-101610793176680.html

A Washington Post photographer captured a partial, but clear image of the memo carried by My Pillow CEO Michael Lindell.According to the official schedule, Trump was supposed to “work from early in the morning until late in the evening” and “make many calls and have many meetings” on his final Friday in office. Lindell, an avid Trump supporter, reportedly met the US president with notes which included words like “Insurrection Act” and “martial law”.“Insurrection Act now as a result of the assault on the—” reads one of the snippets from notes captured on camera by Post photographer Jabin Botsford, and the next line reads, “martial law if necessary upon the first hint of any—”.@MyPillowUSA CEO Michael Lindell shows off his notes before going into the West Wing at the White House on Friday, Jan 15, 2021 in Washington, DC. pic.twitter.com/AY6AyJNSyEPolitical observers fear that a number of phrases and agenda items on the memo match with the apprehensions about drastic measures which may be ordered by the outgoing president in an attempt to seize the power. Days before the certification of Electoral College and president-elect Joe Biden’s victory, elected officials of District of Columbia were reportedly analysing the risk of a similar threat.According to a Buzzfeed report, the DC attorney general’s office had shared a memo with the 13-member City Council during a closed briefing that focussed on president’s capability to take control of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department by invoking Insurrection Act of 1807. Earlier this week, the United States army sent out a rare message to its community, urging them to uphold their values during this critical period.The army said that the violent riot at the Capitol was an attack on the Congress and the constitutional democracy, reminding all soldiers and civilians to “uphold the army's apolitical standards.” “Democratic elections are a constitutional right, and the military has no role in determining their outcome. The Nation expects all member of the United States Army to follow the law and do the right things the right way, whether we are in or out of uniform,” the letter read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-ally-with-alarming-martial-law-notes-captured-on-camera-at-white-house-101610792353034.html

The list includes individuals, companies, unions and political action committees that contributed through January 10. All gave at least $200, but individual amounts were not disclosed.Other companies on the updated list are United Parcel Service Inc. and Yelp Inc.The committee isn’t required to disclose the full list with amounts to the Federal Election Commission until 90 days after the inauguration, but said it was making voluntary disclosures in the interest of transparency.Other companies previously disclosed include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. Qualcomm Inc., Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc., Boeing Co., Anthem Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Donors came from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with 19% coming from California.Taxpayers pay for the inauguration ceremony itself, but newly-elected presidents raise their own funds to pay for related celebrations that usually include a parade and inaugural balls. Donations to Biden’s committee will go toward dramatically scaled-down ceremonies that have mostly moved to virtual, made-for-television events because of the Covid-19 pandemic and security concerns following the violent riots at the Capitol last week.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris — as well as District of Columbia officials — have asked Americans to stay home on Inauguration Day on Wednesday, and mark the event from there.The National Park Service said Monday that the National Mall, which usually holds the throngs of Americans witnessing an inaugural, will be closed. The Virginia Department of Transportation said several bridges and roads linking that state to Washington would be closed from 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-uber-among-new-corporate-donors-for-joe-biden-inauguration-101610791804284.html
16-01-2021||World||2 insider attackers kill 12 Afghan militiamen: Official||At least two members of an Afghan militia opened fire on their fellow militiamen in the western Herat province, killing 12, in what provincial police on Saturday described as an insider attack.Herat police spokesman Abdul Ahad Walizada said the attackers fled with the slain militiamen's weapons and ammunition, adding that Afghan government forces had regained control of the area.A Taliban spokesman Yousaf Ahmadi in a tweet claimed responsibility for the insider attack, which took place late Friday.Meanwhile, a sticky bomb attached to an armored police Land Cruiser SUV exploded Saturday in the western part of the capital, Kabul, killing two policemen and wounding another, Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said.Faramarz did not specify the identities of the casualties. However, two members of the Afghan police force, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media, said Kabul's deputy police chief Mawlana Bayan was wounded in the attack.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Kabul.In the southern Helmand province, a suicide car bomber targeted a police compound late Friday, killing one policeman and wounding two others, provincial police spokesman Zaman Hamdard said. The attack took place in Lashkar Gah district on the highway between Helmand and Kandahar provinces.Also in Kandahar province, a suicide car bomber and multiple gunmen attacked an auto workshop belonging to the Afghan intelligence agency on Saturday but inflicted no casualties, provincial governor Rohullah Khanzada said. He said at least four attackers were killed and that an operation to clear the workshop compound was ongoing.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Helmand and Kandahar.The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students. IS has claimed responsibility for rocket attacks in December targeting the major US base in Afghanistan. There were no casualties.The violence comes as the representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government earlier this month resumed peace talks in Qatar. However, the negotiations were off to a slow start as the insurgents continue their attacks on Afghan government forces while keeping their promise not to attack US and NATO troops.The stop-and-go talks are aimed at ending decades of relentless conflict. Frustration and fear have grown over the recent spike in violence, and both sides blame one another.There has also been growing doubt lately over a US-Taliban deal brokered by outgoing President Donald Trump’s administration. That accord was signed last February. Under the deal, an accelerated withdrawal of US troops ordered by Trump means that just 2,500 American soldiers will still be in Afghanistan when President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-insider-attackers-kill-12-afghan-militiamen-official-101610790841754.html

A 3,000-room hospital is under construction in Shijiazhuang.Virus clusters also have been found in Beijing and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning in the northeast and Sichuan in the southwest.The latest infections spread unusually fast, the National Health Commission said.“It is harder to handle,” a Commission statement said. “Community transmission already has happened when the epidemic is found, so it is difficult to prevent.”The Commission blamed the latest cases on people or goods arriving from abroad. It blamed “abnormal management” and “inadequate protection of workers” involved in imports but gave no details.“They are all imported from abroad. It was caused by entry personnel or contaminated cold chain imported goods,” said the statement.The Chinese government has suggested the disease might have originated abroad and publicized what it says is the discovery of the virus on imported food, mostly frozen fish, though foreign scientists are skeptical.Nationwide, the Health Commission reported 130 new confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Friday. It said 90 of those were in Hebei.On Saturday, the Hebei government reported 32 additional cases since midnight, the Shanghai news outlet The Paper reported.In Shijiazhuang, authorities have finished construction of 1,000 rooms of the planned hospital, state TV said Saturday. Xinhua said all the facilities are due to be completed within a week.A similar program of rapid hospital construction was launched by the ruling Communist Party at the start of the outbreak last year in Wuhan.More than 10 million people in Shijiazhuang underwent virus tests by late Friday, Xinhua said, citing a deputy mayor, Meng Xianghong. It said 247 locally transmitted cases were found.Meanwhile, researchers sent by the World Health Organization were in Wuhan preparing to investigate the origins of the virus. The team, which arrived Thursday, was under a two-week quarantine but was due to talk with Chinese experts by video link.The team's arrival was held up for months by diplomatic wrangling that prompted a rare public complaint by the head of the WHO.That delay, and the secretive ruling party’s orders to scientists not to talk publicly about the disease, have raised questions about whether Beijing might try to block discoveries that would hurt its self-proclaimed status as a leader in the anti-virus battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-hospital-in-5-days-after-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101610788481211.html

16-01-2021||World||Massive violence erupts in PoJK over road being built by China||Massive protests and violence erupted in Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK) over the Chinese move to build a 33-kilometer road on Friday.Talking to the media, Amjad Ayub Mirza, an exiled activist from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) informed that China is building a 33-kilometer road from Yarkand to PoJK to move its artillery and military personnel in the region."China is now building a road from Yarkand of 33 km wide enough to bring its artillery, military and personnel. Things are gearing up in a precarious way, but PoJK people have risen up to the occasion. There will be more protests in PoJK, and I think Pakistan has lost in PoJK totally," said Mirza in the interview to the media.A general strike has been going on since January 13, and Friday's strike is a continuation of the protest against the People Liberation Army's (PLA) move to build the road in PoJK."This is the second time in the month when we are witnessing a general strike. This time the strike in PoJK is widespread, last time the strike was limited to the Poonch division but now it has gone out of control. The whole of PoJK was under general strike on January 13th and the focal point became Azad Pattan Bridge, which is the entry point between Pakistan and PoJK, that was blocked. Police opened fire, tear gas and lathi-charged and there were clashes after which police had to retreat back to Pakistan," said Mirza."This is a big thing. The police check-post was set alight and yesterday even after the general strike the inertia is still there, and yesterday on the LoC at Mandhor, there were protests spreading like a wildfire across 750 miles Line of Control (LoC). People are fed up with food shortages, there is no flour, no electricity, no clean drinking water, and big cities are full of filth because the system has collapsed," added Mirza.PoJK was already in chaos since the Imran Khan-led government made it the fifth province of Pakistan. People are protesting the decision and every day a procession or stir against the decision is witnessed in the region."Now what is happening that not a single day passes without a protest, sometimes more than one protest in different parts of PoJK. Every single day people are protesting in Gilgit Baltistan, PoJK, and Pakistani media does not report it. International media is not allowed in those areas," informed Mirza.Mirza lamented the fact that the elected government of PoJK is sitting in Islamabad and merry-making while the public in the region is holding a crusade against Chinese incursions in the area."The whole of PoJK government elected after November 15th is sitting in Islamabad, enjoying buffets and parties, having a fun time because it's very cold in Gilgit. The government of Farooq Haider is called 'miscreants' by its people. PoJK has gone out of the hands of Pakistan, it has lost it. There is no sentiment for Pakistan in PoJK," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-violence-erupts-in-pojk-over-road-being-built-by-china-101610788479764.html

16-01-2021||World||US carries out 13th and final execution under Donald Trump administration||The US government carried out the 13th and final federal execution under President Donald Trump's administration early on Saturday, days before his successor Joe Biden takes office with a promise to try to end the death penalty.Dustin Higgs, 48, was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. EST (0623 GMT), the federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement, after a late-night Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the execution to proceed.Since resuming federal executions last year after a 17-year hiatus, Trump, a long-time proponent of capital punishment, has overseen more executions than any US president since the 19th century, including three this week.Higgs was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for his role in the kidnapping and murder of three women on a federal wildlife reserve in Maryland in 1996: Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black and Mishann Chinn.His accomplice, Willis Haynes, who confessed to shooting the women, was sentenced to life in prison in a separate trial.In his final words, Higgs sounded calm and defiant at the Justice Department's death chamber in its prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, a reporter who served as a media witness said."I'd like to say I am an innocent man," he said before lethal injections were administered, mentioning the three women by name. "I did not order the murders."Some of his victims' relatives attended, and a sister of Jackson released a statement, although the Bureau of Prisons did not share the sister's name."When the day is over, your death will not bring my sister and the other victims back," the statement said. "This is not closure, this is the consequence of your actions."Higgs' older sister, Alexa Cave, could be heard sobbing uncontrollably from a separate witness room as Higgs died."THIS IS NOT JUSTICE""The government completed its unprecedented slaughter of 13 human beings tonight by killing Dustin Higgs, a Black man who never killed anyone, on Martin Luther King's birthday," Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs' lawyers, said in a statement."Dustin spent decades on death row in solitary confinement helping others around him, while working tirelessly to fight his unjust convictions."The majority conservative Supreme Court's ruling was consistent with earlier decisions: it had dismissed all orders by lower courts delaying federal executions since they were resumed last year."This is not justice," one of its members, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote in dissent."After waiting almost two decades to resume federal executions, the Government should have proceeded with some measure of restraint to ensure it did so lawfully. When it did not, this Court should have. It has not."The federal government executed 10 people last year, more than three times as many as in the previous six decades, marking the first time that it had conducted more executions than all US states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.A minority of the country's 50 states still carry out executions.Before Trump became president, only three people had been executed by the federal government since 1963.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the execution of Higgs the end of a "cruel, inhumane and lawless" spree by the federal government."President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to end the federal death penalty. He must honor that commitment," Cassandra Stubbs, director of ACLU's Capital Punishment Project said.After a failed triple date with the three women, Higgs and Haynes offered to drive them home but instead took them to the Patuxent Research Refuge. Prosecutors said Higgs gave Haynes a gun and told him to shoot the three women.The disparity in their sentences was grounds for clemency, Higgs's lawyers had said.Higgs and another death row inmate, Corey Johnson, were diagnosed with Covid-19 in December, but on Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected an order by a federal judge in Washington delaying their executions for several weeks to allow their lungs to heal.The Justice Department executed Johnson on Thursday night.Cave, Higgs' sister, said she believed life in prison would have been a more just punishment."They don't have freedom at all in any sense of the word," she said in an interview on Friday, before Higgs was executed. "What purpose does it serve to kill you? It brings nothing back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-13th-and-final-execution-under-donald-trump-administration-101610788435362.html
16-01-2021||World||Covid-19 effect: UN report finds global migrants fell by 2 million by mid-2020||A new UN report estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic reduced the number of international migrants by 2 million by the middle of 2020 because of border closings and a halt to travel worldwide — an estimated 27% decrease in expected growth.Clare Menozzi, principal author of the report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Population Division, told a news conference Friday that for the second half of 2020 “we have a sense that it will be probably comparable, if not more so.”She said international migration had been projected to grow by 7 to 8 million between mid-2019 and mid-2020.But the border closures and travel clampdown starting in March, as the pandemic circled the globe, meant zero growth for four months, and an estimated 2 million reduction in the expected number of international migrants, Menozzi said.By August 2020, Population Division Director John Wilmoth noted, “there had been more than 80,000 travel restrictions imposed by 219 countries or territories across the world.”Over the last two decades, growth in the number of international migrants has been robust.Wilmoth said that according to the latest estimates, “the number of international migrants worldwide reached 281 million persons in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000,” They account for just 3.6% of the total global population, he said.Liu Zhenmin, undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs, said, “The report affirms that migration is a part of today’s globalized world and shows how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the livelihoods of millions of migrants and their families” and undermined progress on achieving UN development goals for 2030.The economic fallout from the pandemic is expected to reduce remittances from people working abroad to low- and middle-income countries from $548 billion in 2019 to $470 billion in 2021, according to projections by the World Bank.Wilmoth said the data confirmed that nearly two-thirds of all international migrants were living in high-income countries.According to the report, the United States continued to top the destination list with 51 million international migrants in 2020, representing 18% of the global total. Germany was second, hosting around 16 million international migrants, followed by Saudi Arabia with 13 million, Russia with 12 million and the United Kingdom with 9 million, it said.India topped the list of countries with the largest diasporas in 2020, with 18 million Indians living abroad, followed by Mexico and Russia, each with 11 million outside the country, China with 10 million, and Syria with 8 million, the report said.In 2020, it said, women and girls comprised 48% of all international migrants, and refugees accounted for 12% of international migrants, up from 9.5% in 2000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-effect-un-report-finds-global-migrants-fell-by-2-million-by-mid2020-101610787378872.html
16-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel succession gets serious with vote for party leader||The race to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor will start to take shape when her party elects a new leader on Saturday.Unlike orderly transitions of the past, a botched succession has led to a tight three-way race between long-time Merkel antagonist Friedrich Merz, moderate state leader Armin Laschet and Norbert Roettgen, a foreign-policy expert and former cabinet member. The winner will see the Christian Democratic Union through national elections in September.While the CDU leader usually goes on to be the chancellor candidate for Germany’s conservative bloc, that step isn’t automatic this time. The Bavarian CSU sister party will have an important say in the decision — and Markus Soeder, the Christian Social Union’s leader, is well ahead in polls for chancellor preference. Merkel called on her party to avoid infighting over its leadership in the buildup.“I’d like to see us choose a team to lead our proud people’s party,” the chancellor said in opening remarks to the virtual convention on Friday.The new CDU leader will have a brief window to prove himself until the two parties choose their joint candidate after state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on March 14. A strong CDU performance at the polls would enhance its chances of thwarting the Bavarian premier.Merkel’s succession plan was upended nearly a year ago when her protege -- outgoing Chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer -- announced she would step aside following a series of gaffes and leadership challenges. Now, as the final term of Europe’s longest-serving leader nears its end, 1,001 Christian Democrats will choose one of three men to chart a course into the future.The meeting has been delayed twice because of the coronavirus pandemic and will be held online to adhere to Germany’s hygiene and distancing rules. That presents the party with a number of challenges, including ensuring delegates -- many in their 70s -- can manage the digital voting process.The CDU is also going to great lengths to ensure systems aren’t hacked and will follow up the online vote with a mail-in ballot -- with the winner being the only option -- to abide by German laws. Any hiccups could spur legal challenges.Neither of the three contenders is likely to get an absolute majority in the first round, meaning there will be a runoff between the two front-runners. A final result is expected as early as noon.The new CDU leader faces a challenging political environment. The Greens were on par with the conservative bloc before the coronavirus crisis, and the far-right Alternative for Germany -- which arose from dissatisfaction with Merkel’s policies -- is nipping at its support. But the conservative bloc maintains a comfortable lead in the polls, thanks to Merkel’s steady leadership and her shift to the center.The outcome is critical far beyond Germany’s borders. The European Union needs the country’s leadership as it seeks to recover from the pandemic, reset trans-Atlantic ties under US President-elect Joe Biden and chart a post-Brexit course.Merz, 65, offers the biggest break with Merkel. The former BlackRock Inc. director advocates for a more economically liberal approach. His divisive rhetoric could turn off many voters, and the Greens -- the most likely coalition partner -- are skeptical.“A CDU under Friedrich Merz would certainly be more shaped by policies that move far away from us and from the center of society,” Robert Habeck, co-chair of the Green party, told reporters this week. His views on capitalism and the economy have “fallen out of sync with time.”Laschet, 59, is a moderate in Merkel’s mold. He was considered the clear favorite after forging an early alliance with Jens Spahn, the up-and-coming health minister. The premier from North Rhine-Westphalia has faltered badly in recent months, but could get votes as a safer choice than Merz and has indicated that he’s open to appointing Soeder as chancellor candidate.Roettgen, 55, was seen as an outsider, but has rallied in recent weeks. A centrist, who was fired from Merkel’s cabinet in 2012, would push a tougher line on Russia and China. He was an outspoken critic of Merkel’s refusal to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from Germany’s 5G wireless networks and has opposed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with Russia. He’s also expressed a willingness to consider alternative candidates for chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-succession-gets-serious-with-vote-for-party-leader-101610787794866.html

16-01-2021||World||England not listening to Johnson’s lockdown orders any more||People across England are about to be hit with a deluge of new government adverts on television, radio and social media containing one blunt demand: Stay at home.It’s a familiar message -- and that may be why the public seems to be shrugging it off.The data shows Britons are far more active during the current third national lockdown than when the first emergency “stay at home” order was given last spring. There’s more traffic on the roads, more people on trains and more shoppers making trips out.Government officials worry too many are flouting the rules as Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges the public to try harder to avoid spreading coronavirus. With the National Health Service buckling under the weight of Covid-19 patients, the UK already has the highest death toll in Europe at more than 87,000.While there are early signs that infection rates are starting to fall in places like London, and one person in 20 has now been vaccinated, officials warn life still might not be back to normal by spring.Images of a state health-care system collapsing would risk inflicting further huge damage to Johnson’s standing, with public confidence in the government’s handling of the crisis already severely dented since it began.Hospital crisis“We are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards,” Johnson said on Friday. “This is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts.”Last week, schools and businesses were shut and people were told to stay home for work if they possibly could, and to avoid all journeys unless they were essential.Despite the crisis, traffic on U.K. roads was still running at 63% of pre-pandemic levels on Jan. 11, government figures showed. That’s almost double the rate at the beginning of the first lockdown in early April, when traffic fell to 35% of normal levels.Public transport use is also up, with four times the number of rail passengers this week than at the start of the spring lockdown. Despite the closure of non-essential stores, more people are out shopping this time, too, according to research firm Springboard.Schools are open only for children of key workers but are reporting much higher attendance levels than in the spring. Latest government figures show that 14% of pupils in state-funded schools were in on Jan. 11, compared to an overall level of just 2% in April.Rule breakersGiven the stark threat facing the country, why are people going out more than they did when the pandemic first hit? Is there more rule-breaking, is the public just bored, or are the rules themselves not tough enough?The picture is not unique to the UK Elsewhere in Europe, people have grown tired of wave after wave of restrictions. What makes England different is that even from the start, the messaging was mixed from a government that was reluctant to curb people’s liberties.In Spain and Italy, which imposed harsh lockdowns from the beginning, entire families became accustomed to living with life-altering restrictions. In Madrid and Milan, everyone wears a mask outside, and children must wear them at school. In London, face coverings outdoors are still optional.Back at the beginning of the pandemic, England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned that citizens would “understandably get fatigued” with the restrictions.But in recent surveys people insist they are still following the rules. Stephen Reicher, a UK government adviser and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, dismissed the concept of lockdown “fatigue” as a way for the authorities to shift the blame onto the public.“Some of the rules and the messaging around them may be the problem,” he wrote in the British Medical Journal. For one thing, during the summer ministers encouraged people to go back to work and gave them discounts to eat in restaurants.Some of the restrictions do appear to be more relaxed now compared to the start of the first lockdown: Nurseries are open to all children, there are childcare and support bubbles, and people can meet up with someone else for exercise. Restaurants are also open -- albeit only for takeaway meals.Mixed messagesSusan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London and a government adviser, said “having more things open sends a mixed message” and makes people doubt that the country is “at crisis point.”“On the one hand they are saying ‘stay at home,’ on the other hand they are allowing universities, nurseries, places of worship, non-essential businesses to stay open,” she said.But increased activity could also be down to a change in attitude toward the virus some 11 months into the pandemic. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said people were understandably frightened in the spring but it’s now become “normalized, a routine hazard.”He said that for many people who hadn’t fallen ill with the virus, there was “more and more discrepancy” between their everyday experiences and the government press conferences reporting countless deaths.SacrificeThe Cabinet Office said the government had “set out clear instructions to the public about what they need to do” to suppress the disease and the “public has made enormous sacrifices, to prevent our NHS from becoming overwhelmed and help save lives.”But senior government ministers have confused the picture by offering different versions of the rules. Home Secretary Priti Patel said Thursday that people should exercise alone, even though the rules allow activity with a friend.Johnson himself was criticized for cycling in the Olympic Park in east London, 7 miles away from his Westminster home, despite guidelines saying people should stay in their local areas.In the end, it all comes back to the prime minister. A libertarian at heart, he has struggled from the start with the idea of curbing freedoms. In December he declared it would be “frankly inhuman” to ban people from gathering over Christmas, before being forced to do just that as the virus surged days later.Even now, Johnson can’t quite bring himself to be definitive in his messaging. In a Twitter video on Friday, he addressed people planning to leave their homes to go out this weekend. “Please,” he said. “Really, think twice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-not-listening-to-johnson-s-lockdown-orders-any-more-101610786841888.html
16-01-2021||World||Hong Kong government 'strongly' objects to US congressional report||The Hong Kong government said it "strongly" objects to a US congressional report critical of Beijing's handling of the city, calling the report "biased, politically motivated and not reflecting the truth"."Safeguarding national security through legislation is in line with international practice," the government of the financial hub said in a statement late on Friday.The annual report from the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China this week said that the "one country, two systems" framework in Hong Kong has been "dismantled", severely undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights that the city has long enjoyed.The report says a national security law that Beijing imposed over the summer on the former British colony directly threatens Hong Kong residents' right to due process and their freedoms of expression and association. "The legislation is clearly meant to target, intimidate, and silence Hong Kong's robust civil society," it says.Hong Kong countered that contrary to the erroneous allegations that the law undermines the "one country, two systems" framework, China "has the right to legislate for this matter" under the framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-government-strongly-objects-to-us-congressional-report-101610783401327.html
16-01-2021||World||US slams Beijing for continuous withholding of Covid-19 information||Calling for a transparent and thorough investigation into the origin of Covid-19, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Friday said the pandemic was avoidable adding that Beijing did not reveal vital information about the virus, which would have helped scientists to save the world from the disease.Pompeo, in a statement said the United States has "repeatedly called for" a transparent and thorough investigation into the origin of COVID-19. Understanding the origin of this pandemic is essential for global public health, economic recovery and international security."The Covid-19 pandemic was avoidable. Any responsible country would have invited world health investigators to Wuhan within days of an outbreak. China instead refused offers of help - including from the United States - and punished brave Chinese doctors, scientists and journalists who tried to alert the world to the dangers of the virus," he said."Beijing continues today to withhold vital information that scientists need to protect the world from this deadly virus, and the next one... Until the Chinese Communist Party allows a full and thorough accounting of what happened in Wuhan, it is only a matter of time until China births another pandemic and inflicts it on the Chinese people, and the world," Pompeo added.The top US diplomat added that Washington has "reason to believe" that several researchers inside the WIV [Wuhan Institute of Virology] became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses."This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli's public claim that there was 'zero infection' among the WIV's staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses," Pompeo said.The US Secretary of State accused the WIV not been transparent nor consistent about its work with RaTG13 or other similar viruses, including possible "gain of function"."Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian institution, the WIV has collaborated on publications and secret projects with China's military. The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017," the top diplomat added.Earlier this week, the international team of experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in Wuhan to study the origin of the pandemic.Amid this visit, the US Department of State shared some data about the outbreak in a hope that the WHO will press the Chinese authorities to get more information about the deadly virus.Previously, Pompeo said the CCP "has offered not one, not two, but at least three alternative theories for where this began.""They continue to attempt to obfuscate. Everything that we have seen indicates that this began not only inside of China but at Hubei province, Wuhan," he added.Pompeo said there "will be hundreds and hundreds of thousands" more people continue to live in poverty as a direct result of the economic challenges that the 'Wuhan virus' has foisted upon the world.As of Saturday, 7.52 am IST, the Covid-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) reported that the global coronavirus caseload stands at 93,787,372 while the fatalities across the world stand at 2,006,987.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-beijing-for-continuous-withholding-of-covid-19-information-101610783455912.html
16-01-2021||World||At 18 million, India has largest diaspora in the world: UN||The Indian diaspora, one of the most “vibrant and dynamic”, is the largest in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland in 2020, the UN has said.The United Arab Emirates, the US and Saudi Arabia host the largest numbers of migrants from India, it said.“India has the largest transnational population in the world. It has the most migrants abroad -- 18 million, which is a significant number and another feature which is very interesting about the Indian migrant population is that they're really distributed all over the globe,” Population Affairs Officer in the Population Division at UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Clare Menozzi told PTI in an interview on Friday.Menozzi said while some transnational populations are really clustered in one country or region, the Indian diaspora is present in all continents and regions -- from the Gulf to Northern America to Australia, UK.“It's a very vibrant” and dynamic diaspora in the world, she said.The report, ‘International Migration 2020 Highlights’, by the Population Division of UN DESA, released on Friday said in 2020, 18 million persons from India were living outside of their country of birth.Other countries with a large diaspora included Mexico and Russia (11 million each), China (10 million) and Syria (8 million).The report said India’s large diaspora is distributed across a number of major countries of destination, with the UAE (3.5 million), the US (2.7 million) and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million) hosting the largest numbers of migrants from India.Other countries hosting large numbers of migrants from India included Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar and the UK.Between 2000 and 2020, the size of the migrant population abroad grew for nearly all countries and areas of the world. India experienced the largest gain during that period at nearly 10 million, followed in order of magnitude by Syria, Venezuela, China and the Philippines.Migration from India is largely motivated by labour and family reasons, Director of Population Division at UN DESA John Wilmoth told reporters at the launch of the report here, adding that forced displacement is a much smaller category (about 10 per cent) in the total.Menozzi said the Indian diaspora is comprised predominantly of persons who are working, but also students and people who moved for family reasons.She said there is a very large presence of migrants who are born in India, in the Gulf countries where they are playing a central role in the economic prosperity of the countries, working in construction, hospitality and care services. The diverse Indian diaspora also includes highly-skilled scientists, engineers and doctors.The US remained by far the largest country of destination of international migrants with 51 million migrants in 2020, equal to 18 per cent of the world’s total.Germany hosted the second largest number of migrants worldwide at around 16 million, followed by Saudi Arabia (13 million), Russia (12 million) and the UK (9 million).The report said preliminary estimates suggest that Covid-19 pandemic may have slowed the growth in the stock of international migrants by around two million by mid-2020, 27 per cent less than the growth expected since mid-2019.The report said growth in the number of international migrants has been robust over the last two decades, reaching 281 million people living outside their country of origin in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000 and 221 million in 2010.Currently, international migrants represent about 3.6 per cent of the world’s population.Between 2000 and 2020, the number of migrants grew in 179 countries or areas. Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the US gained the largest number of migrants during that period. By contrast, in 53 countries or areas, the number of international migrants declined between 2000 and 2020. Armenia, India, Pakistan, Ukraine and Tanzania were among the countries that experienced the most pronounced declines.In many cases, the declines resulted from the old age of the migrant populations or the return of refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin.In terms of regional migration corridors, between 2000 and 2020, some regional migration corridors grew very rapidly. The corridor Central and Southern Asia to Northern Africa and Western Asia grew the most, with 13 million migrants added between 2000 and 2020; more than tripling in size."The majority of that increase resulted from labour migration from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka to the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),” the report said.It noted that while it is too soon to understand the full extent, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 may have slowed the growth of this regional migration corridor.In many GCC countries, thousands of migrant workers in the construction, hospitality, retail and transportation sectors lost their jobs due to the pandemic and were required to return home.The report said according to World Bank projections, the Covid-19 pandemic may reduce the volume of remittances sent to low-and middle-income countries from USD 548 billion in 2019 to USD 470 billion in 2021, a decline of 14 per cent.Menozzi said India is the main country of recipient of remittances worldwide and in 2019 received USD 83 billion in remittances from its diaspora. The World Bank projects that in 2020, the amount will decline by around 9 per cent to about USD 76 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-18-million-india-has-largest-diaspora-in-the-world-un-101610780174277.html
16-01-2021||World||Biden announces plan to vaccinate 100 mn Americans in his 1st 100 days in office||US President-elect Joe Biden has announced an ambitious goal of inoculating 100 million Americans with Covid-19 vaccines in the first 100 days of his administration, noting that the vaccine rollout in the country, the worst hit by the pandemic, has been a "dismal failure."Ahead of his inauguration on January 20, Biden on Friday held a briefing with his team on addressing the major health crisis that has engulfed the nation for nearly a year now.The US is the worst-affected country in the world with more than 23,523,000 Covid-19 infections and 391,955 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.During his election campaign, Biden, a Democrat, made tackling Covid-19 and the economic hardships it had put on Americans a core pitch to voters.“The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far and in today's briefing we discussed five things, five things we will do in an attempt to turn things around, five things to turn frustration into motivation, five things to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days in office. Some wonder if we are reaching too far for that goal. Is it achievable? It's a legitimate question to ask,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear; I am convinced we can get it done, and this is the time to set big goals to pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is literally at stake. First, we will immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups,” he said.Biden said that the process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing.“If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly is getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccine sitting unused in freezers around the country while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it,” he said.Exuding confidence, Biden said that his administration will fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond healthcare workers and move through those groups as quickly as they think they can. That includes anyone 65 years or older, a population that has accounted for over 80 per cent of the deaths to date.“We also have to continue vaccinating frontline essential workers like educators, first responders, grocery store workers, et cetera. It won't mean that everyone in this group will get vaccinated immediately as the supply is not where it needs to be, but it will mean that vaccines become available--as they become available, it will reach more people who need them, will reach out and get the vaccine used,” he asserted.Secondly, more vaccination sites would be added.“That is where we are going to harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centres. On my first day in office, I will instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to be again setting up the first of these centres. By the end of our first month in office we will have 100 federally supported centres across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people,” he said.Within the first month, the administration is going to deploy mobile clinics moving from community to community that will partner with community health centres and local primary-care doctors to offer vaccines to hard-hit and hard-to-reach communities in cities, small towns and in rural communities. And to staff up these centres, the US will mobilise thousands of clinical and non-clinical professionals."The third change we are going to make is we are going to fully activate the pharmaceutic--the pharmacies across the country to get the vaccination to more arms as quickly as possible."Millions of Americans now turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We are going to immediately start a new major effort working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get Americans vaccinated," he said.This programme will expand beyond access in neighbourhoods across the country so that people can make an appointment and get shot, conveniently show up at a particular time and get it done quickly, he said.Biden said his administration is going to use the full strength of the federal government to ramp up supply of the vaccines.Biden said he will use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine from the tubes and syringe--and syringes to protective equipment.He alleged that the outgoing Trump administration's policy of holding back close to half the supply of the vaccines available did not make sense.“Our administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they're available so more people can get vaccinated weekly while still retaining a small reserve for any unseen shortage or delays,” he said.He said his administration will always be "honest and transparent about where we stand, both the good news as well as the bad. We're going to make sure state and local officials know how much supply they'll be getting and when they can expect to get it so they can plan.""Right now, we're hearing that they can't plan because they don't know how much supply of vaccines they can expect at what time frame. That stops when we're in office,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-announces-plan-to-vaccinate-100-mn-americans-in-his-1st-100-days-in-office-101610778581340.html

16-01-2021||World||Joe Biden says we'll 'manage the hell' out of feds' Covid-19 response||President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to boost supplies of coronavirus vaccine and set up new vaccination sites to meet his goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. It's part of a broader COVID strategy that also seeks to straighten out snags in testing and ensure minority communities are not left out.“Some wonder if we are reaching too far,” Biden said Friday. “Let me be clear, I'm convinced we can get it done.”The real payoff, Biden said, will come from uniting the nation in a new effort grounded in science.Biden spoke a day after unveiling a $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” to confront the virus and provide temporary support for a shaky economy. About $400 billion of the plan is focused on measures aimed at controlling the virus. Those range from mass vaccination centers to more sophisticated scientific analysis of new strains and squads of local health workers to trace the contacts of infected people.“You have my word: We will manage the hell out of this operation,” Biden declared. He underscored a need for Congress to approve more money and for people to keep following basic precautions, such as wearing masks, avoiding gatherings and frequently washing their hands.Throughout the plan, there’s a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments.A key challenge for Biden and the nation: Vaccines are in too-short supply.Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act, a Cold War-era law, to boost vaccine supplies and work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up 100 vaccination centers around the country by the end of his first month in office.“Almost a year later, we’re still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: Things will get worse before they get better," he said Friday, as US deaths climbed closer to 400,000. The global toll has now reached 2 million.Biden seconded the Trump administration's call earlier this week for states to start vaccinating more seniors, reaching those 65 and older as well as younger people with certain health problems. Until now states have been focused on inoculating health care workers, and some are starting to vaccinate people 75 and older. Relatively few are providing shots to people between 65 and 75.Another carryover from the Trump administration plan: Biden said he intends to mobilize local pharmacies to administer vaccines.“Is it achievable?" he asked. "It’s a legitimate question to ask. Let me be clear. I’m convinced we can get it done.”In fact, Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician, said the president-elect should aim higher.“At this point, mass vaccination is our last and best chance to restoring normalcy,” she said. “There should be no expenses spared in the vaccine rollout. A hundred million in 100 days needs to be seen as only a start."Two medical groups, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Group, said Friday evening they “strongly support” the Biden plan. The strategy “will be vital to ending the impacts of Covid-19” in the US, the groups said.As Biden spoke, some governors blasted the Trump administration for what at least one said was “deception” in suggesting earlier this week that a reserve of vaccine doses was ready to ship, augmenting supplies. An administration official said states have still not ordered all of the doses allocated to them, and called it a problem with states' expectations.Biden committed to better communication with the states, to avoid such surprises. His plan calls for the federal government to fully reimburse states that mobilize their National Guards to help distribute vaccines.Biden's proposal comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic’s most dangerous wave yet. “We remain in a very dark winter,” he said.The political outlook for the legislation remains unclear, although a powerful business lobbying group, the US Chamber of Commerce, welcomed its focus on controlling the pandemic.“This is not a political issue,” Biden said. “This is about saving lives. I know it’s become a partisan issue, but what a stupid, stupid thing to happen.”Biden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably tied to control of the coronavirus.Under Biden's multipronged strategy, about $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.On Friday, he announced former FDA chief David Kessler as his chief science officer for the vaccine drive. Kessler has been advising Biden as a co-chair of his advisory board on the coronavirus pandemic. A pediatrician and attorney, he has emphasized a need to ease public concerns about the safety of the vaccines.With the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration delivered two highly effective vaccines and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation’s vaccination campaign is off to a slow start with about 12.3 million doses administered out of more than 31 million delivered, or 39%.About 10.6 million individuals have received first or second doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the American Hospital Association estimates that 246 million must be vaccinated to reach widespread or “herd” immunity by the summer. Vaccines currently available require two shots to be fully effective.Biden has called the vaccine rollout “a dismal failure so far."“We need to be getting to more than 3 million vaccinations a day, rapidly,” said Wen.Biden's plan also would provide $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus. The Biden administration also plans to launch a public education campaign to overcome doubts about vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-we-ll-manage-the-hell-out-of-feds-covid-19-response-101610775423634.html
16-01-2021||World||Amazon, Uber among new corporate donors to Biden inauguration||Amazon.com Inc., United Airlines and Uber Technologies are among companies that made new contributions to President-elect Joe Biden’s inaugural ceremonies, according to a new disclosure posted by the Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee.The inaugural committee disclosed the names of 3,184 additional donors on Friday night, after making its first disclosure of 959 donors last Saturday. The list includes individuals, companies, unions and political action committees that contributed through Jan. 10. All gave at least $200, but individual amounts were not disclosed.Other companies on the updated list are United Parcel Service Inc. and Yelp Inc.The committee isn’t required to disclose the full list with amounts to the Federal Election Commission until 90 days after the inauguration, but said it was making voluntary disclosures in the interest of transparency.Other companies previously disclosed include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. Qualcomm Inc., Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc., Boeing Co., Anthem Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Donors came from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with 19% coming from California.Taxpayers pay for the inauguration ceremony itself, but newly-elected presidents raise their own funds to pay for related celebrations that usually include a parade and inaugural balls. Donations to Biden’s committee will go toward dramatically scaled-down ceremonies that have mostly moved to virtual, made-for-television events because of the Covid-19 pandemic and security concerns following the violent riots at the Capitol last week.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris — as well as District of Columbia officials — have asked Americans to stay home on Inauguration Day on Wednesday, and mark the event from there.The National Park Service said Monday that the National Mall, which usually holds the throngs of Americans witnessing an inaugural, will be closed. The Virginia Department of Transportation said several bridges and roads linking that state to Washington would be closed from 6am Tuesday to 6am Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-uber-among-new-corporate-donors-to-biden-inauguration-101610770911828.html
16-01-2021||World||New York prosecutors interview Michael Cohen about Trump finances||New York prosecutors conducted an hour-long interview Thursday of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, asking a range of questions about Trump's business dealings, according to three people familiar with the meeting.The interview focused in part on Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank, his biggest and longest standing creditor, according to the three people, who weren't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.The interview, at least the second of Cohen by the Manhattan district attorney's office, comes amid a long-running grand jury investigation into Trump's business dealings. District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. has been waging a protracted legal battle to get access to the president's tax records.The US Supreme Court is expected to rule on Trump’s request for a stay and a further appeal after he leaves office Jan. 20.The New York investigation is one of several legal entanglements that are likely to intensify as Trump loses power — and any immunity from prosecution he might have as a sitting president — as he departs the White House.The Manhattan-based grand jury has been continuing its work despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many court operations.The Republican president also faces a civil investigation, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, into whether Trump’s company lied about the value of its assets to get loans or tax benefits. Cohen also is cooperating with that inquiry.He previously told Congress that Trump often inflated the value of his assets when dealing with lenders or potential business partners, but deflated them when it benefited him for tax purposes.The White House declined to comment. A message seeking comment was sent to Cohen's attorney.Trump has repeatedly called the investigations by Vance and James, both Democrats, a baseless political “witch hunt."Vance has declined to provide specific details about the investigation, but pointed to news reports of what prosecutors described as “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization" in court filings.Among the reports Vance’s office referenced in court filings was a 2017 article about Ladder Capital, a commercial mortgage lender that made more than $250 million in loans to the Trump Organization that were secured by Trump properties. Jack Weisselberg, the son of Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, is a director of Ladder Capital.Subpoenas issued in the investigation cover 11 entities engaged in business dealings as far away as Europe and Dubai, according to an appeals court judge speaking at a hearing on the matter.Cohen, who is serving the remainder of a federal prison sentence on home confinement, has been asked by investigators to examine certain Trump Organization documents and to provide other details about its corporate structure, the people familiar with the matter said. Cohen pleaded guilty to evading taxes, lying to Congress and facilitating campaign finance crimes.Germany-based Deutsche Bank continued to do business with Trump even after he defaulted in 2008 on a loan for his Chicago hotel and condo development. Trump sued the bank and others whom he blamed for his inability to repay.But Deutsche Bank’s private banking division continued to lend to Trump, including $125 million to finance the purchase and renovation of his Doral golf resort in 2012, according to previous disclosures.Deutsche Bank declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-prosecutors-interview-michael-cohen-about-trump-finances-101610770943828.html

Some have sought refuge in the mountains, while others went to cramped evacuation centres, witnesses said.Friday's quake and its aftershocks damaged more than 300 homes and two hotels, as well as flattening a hospital and the office of a regional governor, where authorities told Reuters several people had been trapped.Access to the neighbouring city of Makassar remains cut off, Arianto Ardi of the search and rescue agency in Mamuju told Reuters, adding that the search will focus on the hotels.Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told Metro TV on Saturday that another quake was possible and could reach a magnitude of 7.0, urging residents to keep out of the water because of the tsunami risk.The earthquake magnitude scale is logarithmic; a one-point increase means it is 10 times bigger. The difference in energy released is even greater. Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes.In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aftershock-rocks-indonesia-quake-zone-as-search-continues-101610771403084.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump will leave White House before Biden inauguration, may go to his golf club||By the time Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president Wednesday, his scandal-tainted predecessor Donald Trump will already be far away, having helicoptered out of the White House a last time earlier that morning, an official said Friday.Trump will be the first president in a century and a half to snub the inauguration of his successor.An official who asked not to be identified said Trump would go to his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, which is his legal residence and will become home after the White House.He is expected to be out of town well before Biden is sworn in on the steps of the Capitol building at exactly noon.After spending more than two months trying to overturn the results of the November election, pushing false conspiracy theories about fraud, Trump's presence had not been expected at the inauguration.The final straw came on January 6 when Trump gathered a huge crowd of supporters on the National Mall and once more claimed that they had to fight to stop a fraudulent election. A mob then stormed Congress, halting proceedings underway to certify Biden's win.For longer than anyone can remember, outgoing presidents have stood by their replacement on the Capitol steps, watching them take the oath -- and in so doing showing visible support for the peaceful transfer of power.Trump, who was impeached for a record second time in the wake of the Congress storming, has also broken with more discreet protocol by refusing to invite Biden and his wife Jill Biden to the White House for a traditional cup of tea in the Oval Office.On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence did make the gesture of telephoning his incoming counterpart Kamala Harris, a source said.Although this came only five days before inauguration day -- and more than two months after the election -- The New York Times said Pence offered his congratulations and belated assistance to Harris, describing the exchange as "gracious and pleasant."Recriminations over the January 6 attack continued to reverberate on Friday, however, when Trump's health secretary criticized "the actions and rhetoric following the election."In a letter confirming he would step down when Biden takes office on January 20, Alex Azar called the violence "an assault on our democracy and on the tradition of peaceful transitions of power," urging Trump to condemn all violence and help ensure a smooth handover to Biden.- Inauguration like no other -Trump's extraordinary exit adds to the nervous atmosphere around an inauguration that was already set to be like no other.In the wake of the Congress attack, thousands of National Guard troops have taken up position around central Washington. And even before the security nightmare, organizers had been forced by Covid-19 safety measures to nix the traditional big crowds and long guest lists.For Biden, the subdued ceremonies will quickly be followed by a mammoth To Do list. His administration faces multiple crises on day one, including the stumbling national Covid vaccination project, a precarious economic recovery and Trump's looming impeachment trial in the Senate.At the same time, Biden will have to cajole the Senate into rapidly confirming his cabinet appointees, allowing him to form a government and bring stability back to the country.Incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday that the Senate is fully capable of juggling the impeachment trial along with the urgent confirmations."The Senate can do its constitutional duty while continuing to conduct the business of the people," she said."Our expectation and hope and belief is that we need to walk and chew gum at the same time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-will-leave-white-house-before-biden-inauguration-may-go-to-his-golf-club-101610768833354.html
16-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un’s new missile could be an attempt to get Joe Biden's attention||Kim Jong Un has rolled out a lot of new missiles in recent months, including at least one more this week. The next step is for him to fire them into the air to get President-elect Joe Biden’s attention.The North Korean leader paraded a new submarine-launched ballistic missile through central Pyongyang Thursday as part of a military pageant to mark the completion of more than a week of ruling party meetings. The Pukguksong-5 -- the largest in an growing line of solid-fueled nuclear missiles -- moves Kim closer to a opening a maritime front in his strategic struggle with the US.The new missile comes only four months after Kim unveiled a smaller version of the same rocket at a similar military parade in October. That event also featured a massive new intercontinental ballistic missile, which is believed to be the world’s largest road-mobile weapon of its sort.The problem for Kim is that many of these new systems haven’t been proven, diminishing their value as a deterrent against an American attack. If Kim wants to achieve the ambitious nuclear program he outlined at Workers’ Party gatherings this month, he’ll need to start launching soon.“I am certain we will see tests in the near future,” said Melissa Hanham, a non-proliferation expert and an affiliate with the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation.North Korea hasn’t fired off an ICBM since November 2017, when Kim moved to open communications with US President Donald Trump. Kim has already declared an end to the testing freeze he put in place to facilitate talks with Trump and earlier this week reaffirmed that the US was his “biggest main enemy.”The next launches may illustrate how rapidly North Korea has developed its nuclear delivery systems over the past few years, despite tough international sanctions and Trump’s three face-to-face meetings with Kim. The provocations may also help pressure the Biden administration into making concessions.North Korea tested President Barack Obama with the launch of a long-range rocket and a nuclear device within months after he took power in 2009. He welcomed Trump with a series of tests culminating with the launch of an ICBM that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to the entire US.“The Biden administration need not accept this as a done deal,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “An early signal from the US. could stay Kim’s hand, but Biden would have to offer a clearly valuable inducement, like the prospect of sanctions relief.”The Biden administration has indicated it may be ready to ease sanctions in exchange for steps by Kim to freeze, cap and wind down his atomic arsenal. This could help Kim fix an economy that has only gotten smaller since he took power about a decade ago.Kim has vowed never to surrender the nuclear arsenal he views as key to his regime’s survival. Each new missile helps bolster his argument that the US. should drop its demands for “final, fully verified denuclearization” and accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.Earlier this month, Kim outlined plans for smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, improving the ability to strike strategic targets within 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) -- a thinly veiled allusion to the US. He said he was seeking to develop solid-fuel ICBMs and a nuclear-powered submarine.North Korean state media released photos and footage from the latest parade Friday. Kim could further signal his intentions at a parliament session scheduled to being Sunday in Pyongyang.Koh Yu-hwan, president of the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said North Korea may hold off on testing the Pukguksong missiles for now. “Kim may just want to send a message to Washington that his weapons would only advance if the US. continues to press him,” Koh said, saying the goal was “opening up the possibility of talks with the new administration.”Kim’s latest SLBMs would require a vessel with more capacity than his only current missile submarine, the Gorae, said Joseph Dempsey, a London-based research associate for the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“The considerably wider body diameter of the Pukguksong-3, -4 and now -5 raises the question if any of these missiles could be fitted on this boat, even with extensive modification,” he said. North Korea is building at least one other ballistic missile submarine, he said.Although it could be years before Kim deploys a bigger submarine, the program will require lots of provocative tests. North Korea may conduct ejection tests of the new Pukguksong-5 on land before launching it off a submerged barge and finally from a submarine, said Hanham, of the Stanford Center.Moreover, the weapons move North Korea closer to developing solid-fueled ICBMs, which can be stored full and moved quickly to evade a counterattack. The diameter of Kim’s latest Pukguksong missiles appear to have reached the key 1.7 meter (5.6 feet) threshold needed to build one capable of crossing the Pacific, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.“We’ve been saying for a year that North Korea could test a solid-propellant ICBM in 2021,” Lewis said. “I would expect more missile tests in the coming year, unless there is some dramatic change in the relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-new-missile-could-be-an-attempt-to-get-joe-biden-s-attention-101610767595319.html
16-01-2021||World||Midnight quake kills 42 in Indonesia||A strong, shallow earthquake shook Indonesia’s Sulawesi island just after midnight, toppling homes and buildings, triggering landslides and killing at least 42 people.More than 600 people were injured by the magnitude 6.2 quake, which sent people fleeing their homes in the darkness on Friday. Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas.There were reports of many people trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes and buildings.In a video released by the national disaster agency, a girl stuck in the wreckage of a house cried out for help and said she heard the sound of other family members also trapped. “Please help me, it hurts,” the girl told rescuers, who replied that they desperately wanted to help her.The rescuers said an excavator was needed to save the girl and others trapped in collapsed buildings. Other images showed a severed bridge and damaged and flattened houses.The quake damaged a hospital and patients were moved to an emergency tent. Rescuers struggled to extract seven patients and staff who were trapped under rubble. After several hours, an excavator came to help and the rescuers retrieved four survivors and three bodies.Another video showed a father crying, asking for help to save his children buried under their toppled house. “They are trapped inside, please help,” he cried. Thousands of people were evacuated to temporary shelters.The quake was centred 36km south of West Sulawesi’s Mamuju district, at a depth of 18km. The disaster agency said the death toll climbed to 42 as rescuers in Mamuju retrieved 34 bodies trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes and buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/midnight-quake-kills-42-in-indonesia-101610767241423.html
16-01-2021||World||Damaged roads, lack of gear hinder Indonesia quake rescue||Damaged roads and bridges, power blackouts and lack of heavy equipment on Saturday hampered Indonesia's rescuers after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake left at least 42 dead and hundreds injured on Sulawesi island.Operations were focused on about 10 locations in the hardest-hit city of Mamuju, where people are still believed trapped following Friday's nighttime quake, said Saidar Rahmanjaya, who heads the local search and rescue agency.Cargo planes carrying food, tents, blankets and other supplies from Jakarta landed late Friday for distribution in temporary shelters. Still, thousands spent the night in the open fearing aftershocks and a possible tsunami.The National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesperson Raditya Jati said 34 people were killed in Mamuju and nearly 200 hospitalized.The nearby district of Majene was also ravaged, leaving at least eight dead and more than 630 injured, he said.At least 300 houses in Majene were damaged and about 15,000 people moved to shelters. Many survivors said that aid has not reached them yet due to damaged roads and disrupted communications.The quake set off landslides in three locations and blocked a main road connecting Mamuju to Majene. Power and phone lines were down in many areas.Mamuju, the capital of West Sulawesi province with nearly 75,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings. A governor office building was almost flattened by the quake and a shopping mall reduced to a crumpled hulk. A large bridge collapsed and patients with drips laid on folding beds under tarpaulin tents outside one of the damaged hospitals.Two hospitals in the city were damaged and others overwhelmed.Two ships headed to the devastated areas from the nearby cities of Makassar and Balikpapan with rescuers and equipment, including excavators.State-owned firm AirNav Indonesia, which oversees aircraft navigation, said the quake did not cause significant damage to the Mamuju airport runway or control tower.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Friday that he instructed his Cabinet ministers and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response.In a telegram sent by the Vatican on behalf of Pope Francis, the pontiff expressed “heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this natural disaster.”The pope was praying for “the repose of the deceased, the healing of the injured and the consolation of all who grieve.” Francis also offered encouragement to those continuing search and rescue effects, and he invoked “the divine blessings of strength and hope.”Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is frequently hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Palu on Sulawesi island set off a tsunami and caused soil to collapse in a phenomenon called liquefaction. More than 4,000 people died, many of the victims buried when whole neighborhoods were swallowed in the falling ground.A massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia in December 2004 triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries._____Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damaged-roads-lack-of-gear-hinder-indonesia-quake-rescue-101610766737116.html

16-01-2021||World||US imposes fresh sanctions on Iran in final days of Trump presidency||The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on companies in Iran, China and the United Arab Emirates for doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and on three Iranian entities over conventional arms proliferation.They are the latest in a series of measures aimed at stepping up pressure on Tehran in the waning days of President Donald Trump's administration, which ends on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington had sanctioned seven companies, including Chinese-based Jiangyin Mascot Special Steel Co and UAE-based Accenture Building Materials, and two people for shipping steel to or from Iran.He said Iran's Marine Industries Organization, Aerospace Industries Organization and the Iran Aviation Industries Organization had also been blacklisted over conventional arms proliferation.In a statement later on Friday, Pompeo said he was also increasing the scope of metals-related sanctions against Iran administered by the State Department.Those who knowingly transfer 15 materials which the State Department says are used in connection with Iran's nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs, including certain types of aluminum and steel, would be subject to sanctions, he said.During his four years in office, Trump has tried to force Tehran back into talks over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its activities in the Middle East. Saying the agreement did not go far enough, Trump in 2018 quit an Iran nuclear deal, which Tehran struck with world powers in 2015 to rein in its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who will succeed Trump on Wednesday, has said he will return to the 2015 nuclear pact if Iran resumes strict compliance with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-fresh-sanctions-on-iran-in-final-days-of-trump-presidency-101610763312389.html
16-01-2021||World||WHO stops short of advising proof of Covid-19 shots for travel||The World Health Organization on Friday refrained from advising proof of Covid-19 vaccination or immunity as a condition for international travel, citing "critical unknowns" regarding their efficacy in reducing transmission and limited availability.The WHO's Emergency Committee, composed of 19 independent experts, held its sixth meeting in a year as the global death toll from the pandemic reached two million among more than 90 million cases.The experts issued a series of recommendations, which WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accepted and sent to the U.N. agency's 194 member states, a statement said."At the present time, do not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry as there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission and limited availability of vaccines," the WHO panel said."Proof of vaccination should not exempt international travellers from complying with other travel risk reduction measures."Didier Houssin, panel chairman, said that there was currently a "great disparity" among countries about testing, quarantines and travel bans, leading to the world being "a little bit paralysed, a little bit confused".Its advice to WHO was to "take a strong lead in order to produce clear guidance and scientifically based guidance about how best to facilitate and permit the circulation of people in a safe manner by air, by sea", he told a news conference.Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said: "What the committee is saying is 'at this present time', scientific evidence is not complete, there isn't enough vaccine and therefore we shouldn't do that now and create an unnecessary restriction to travel."So we are trying to protect the travel space and ensure economies are not entirely isolated," he added.Britain is tightening border controls from Monday to block new variants of Covid-19, suspending all "travel corridor" arrangements that had meant arrivals from some countries did not require quarantine.The WHO panel urged countries to monitor virus variants such as those identified by Britain and South Africa to assess the effects on the efficacy of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests.It called for promoting technology transfer to low- and middle-income countries with the potential capacity to accelerate global production of Covid-19 vaccines.Further research was also needed on "critical unknowns about Covid-19 vaccination efficacy on transmission, duration of protection against severe disease and asymptomatic infection" as well as the duration of immunity following infection or vaccination, and protection after a single dose, the panel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-stops-short-of-advising-proof-of-covid-19-shots-for-travel-101610765214818.html
16-01-2021||World||Post US Capitol riots, Podcasts help extremists get their message out||Major social platforms have been cracking down on the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories in the leadup to the presidential election, and expanded their efforts in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But Apple and Google, among others, have left open a major loophole for this material: Podcasts.Podcasts made available by the two Big Tech companies let you tune into the world of the QAnon conspiracy theory, wallow in President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election and bask in other extremism. Accounts that have been banned on social media for election misinformation, threatening or bullying, and breaking other rules also still live on as podcasts available on the tech giants’ platforms.Conspiracy theorists have peddled stolen-election fantasies, coronavirus conspiracies and violent rhetoric. One podcaster, RedPill78, called the Capitol siege a “staged event” in a Jan. 11 episode of Red Pill News. The day before the Capitol riot, a more popular podcast, X22 Report, spoke confidently about a Trump second term, explained that Trump would need to “remove” many members of Congress to further his plans, and said “We the people, we are the storm, and we’re coming to DC.”Both are available on Apple and Google podcast platforms.Podcasting “plays a particularly outsized role” in propagating white supremacy, said a 2018 report from the Anti-Defamation League. Many white supremacists, like QAnon adherents, support Trump. Podcasting’s an intimate, humanizing mode of communication that lets extremists expound on their ideas for hours at a time, said Oren Segal of ADL’s Center on Extremism.Elsewhere on social media, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been cracking down on accounts amplifying unfounded QAnon claims that Trump is fighting deep state enemies and cannibals operating a child-sex trafficking ring. A major talk radio company, Cumulus, told its hosts to tone down rhetoric about stolen elections and violent uprisings or risk termination, although it's not clear what impact that dictate has had.Google-owned YouTube axed “Bannon's War Room,” a channel run by Trump loyalist Steve Bannon on Jan. 8 after he spread false election claims and called for the beheading of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert. But podcast versions of Bannon's show live on at Apple and Google. Spotify took it down in November, according to one of its hosts.“Podcasts filled with hatred and incitement to violence should not be treated any differently than any other content," Segal said. "If you’re going to take a strong stance against hate and extremism in the platform in any way, it should be all-inclusive.”Apple, Spotify and Google curate lists of top podcasts and recommend them to users. Apple and Spotify are the dominant players in the U.S., with other players far behind, said Dave Zohrob, CEO of the podcast analytics firm Chartable. Despite its name recognition, Google remains a tiny presence.Spotify said it takes down podcasts that violate its policies against hate speech, copyright violations or break any laws, using “algorithmic and human detection measures” to identify violations. Apple’s guidelines prohibit content that is illegal or promotes violence, graphic sex or drugs or is “otherwise considered obscene, objectionable, or in poor taste.” Apple did not reply to repeated questions about its content guidelines or moderation.Google declined to explain the discrepancy between what’s available on YouTube and what’s on Google Podcasts, saying only that its podcast service “indexes audio available on the web” much the way its search engine indexes web pages. The company said it removes podcasts from its platform “in very rare circumstances, largely guided by local law.”X22 Report and Bannon’s War Room were No. 20 and No. 32 on Apple's list of top podcasts on Friday. (Experts say that list measures a podcast's momentum rather than total listeners.) X22 Report said in October that it was suspended by YouTube and Spotify and last week by Twitter. It's no longer available on Facebook, either. It is supported by ads for products such as survivalist food, unlicensed food supplements and gold coins, which run before and during the podcasts.The website for Red Pill News said YouTube banned its videos in October and that a Twitter suspension followed. The podcast is available on Apple and Google, but not Spotify.Several QAnon proponents affected by the crackdown sued YouTube in October, calling its actions a “massive de-platforming.” Among the plaintiffs are X22 Report, RedPill78 and David Hayes, who runs another conspiracy podcast called Praying Medic that's available on Apple and Google, but not Spotify.Melody Torres, who podcasts at SoulWarrior Uncensored, self-identifies as a longtime QAnon follower and said in a recent episode that her podcast is “just my way of not being censored." She said she was kicked off Twitter in January and booted from Instagram four times last year. She currently has Instagram, Facebook and YouTube accounts; her podcast is available on Apple and Google. Spotify removed the podcast Friday after The Associated Press inquired about it.X22 Report, RedPill78 and Hayes did not respond to requests for comment sent via their websites. Torres did not reply to a Facebook message.Podcasts suffer from the same misinformation problem as other platforms, said Shane Creevey, head of editorial for Kinzen, a startup created by former Facebook and Twitter executives that offers a disinformation tracker to companies, including some that host or curate podcasts.Creevey points out that it's harder to analyze misinformation from video and audio than from text. Podcasts can also run for hours, making them difficult to monitor. And podcasting has additional challenges in that there are no reliable statistics on their audience, unlike a YouTube stream, which shows views, or a tweet or Facebook post, which shows likes and shares, Creevey said.But some argue that tech-company moderation is opaque and inconsistent, creating a new set of problems. Censorship “goes with the tide against what’s popular in any given moment," said Jillian York, an expert at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights group. Right now, she said, “that tide is against the speech of right-wing extremists ... but tomorrow the tide might be against opposition activists.”___AP Technology Editor David Hamilton contributed to this article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-us-capitol-riots-podcasts-help-extremists-get-their-message-out-101610756419161.html
16-01-2021||World||US steps up claims Covid-19 may have escaped from Chinese lab||The State Department on Friday said it had new information suggesting the Covid-19 pandemic could have emerged from a Chinese laboratory and not through contact with infected animals, the latest salvo in the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure Beijing over the virus’s origins.Specifically, the US said it had obtained new evidence that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in the fall of 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak in the surrounding city, with symptoms it said were consistent with either Covid-19 or common seasonal illnesses.The department said China’s lack of transparency about the pandemic’s origin more than a year ago, as well as efforts to mask early shortcomings in the country’s response to the outbreak, make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. But the brief, unsigned statement issued by the US -- less than a week before the end of the Trump administration -- provided no data to back up its claims.“The virus could have emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, spreading in a pattern consistent with a natural epidemic,” according to the State Department. “Alternatively, a laboratory accident could resemble a natural outbreak if the initial exposure included only a few individuals and was compounded by asymptomatic infection.”A State Department spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked for further comment.China has repeatedly rejected charges that the virus might have emerged from a laboratory. The US didn’t say how it obtained the new information about illnesses at the lab.The comments, in a State Department fact sheet, come as China faces criticism for initially preventing some members of a World Health Organization mission from entering China as part of an effort to trace the origin of Covid-19, saying they hadn’t passed health screenings. While the experts were eventually granted clearance, China had already been criticized by the WHO for delaying the mission’s plans to visit the country.China has been under scrutiny since the outbreak exploded in and around Wuhan, but the Trump administration also sought to pin more blame on authorities in Beijing after the pandemic took off in the US and deaths soared. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo frequently refer to the illness as the “China virus”, “China plague” and “Wuhan virus.”For its part, China is mounting a campaign to cast doubt the virus originated within its borders. State media have played up research suggesting that there were cases in Italy and the U.S. that pre-date those in Wuhan, and hinted that the pathogen could have entered the country via frozen food or packaging.On Friday it was announced that 2 million people had died worldwide from the outbreak, with almost 400,000 deaths in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-claims-covid-19-may-have-escaped-from-chinese-lab-101610763288387.html

They will be critical to ensuring that our policy agenda is effective in bringing change for the American people.”The president-elect is set to unveil his economic proposals at 7:15 p.m. from Wilmington, Delaware.Fazili comes to the White House from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where she was director of engagement for the community and economic development department. She previously served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the NEC and at the Treasury Department, where she spent time in the offices of Domestic Finance and International Affairs.Budget ImpactBeckwith-Stanley was an associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom before joining the Biden transition team. She previously clerked for Judge Ronald Buch of the United States Tax Court, and began her public policy career advocating for low-income kids and families at the Children’s Alliance in Seattle. During the transition, Beckwith-Stanley has been focused on building analytical and budget tools to assess the impact of budget and tax policies on racial equity, a transition official said.Brian Deese, Biden’s NEC director, described the new hires as “people with really impressive economic-impact credentials, but also deep experience in inclusive economic development, racial equity, and a sort of place-based and community-based focus on economic engagement, which is something that we’re looking to prioritize within the NEC.”Fazili joins two other deputy directors announced by the transition last month, David Kamin and Bharat Ramamurti, whose portfolio will focus on financial reform and consumer protection. Joelle Gamble will be a special assistant to the president for economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-taps-kashmir-born-sameera-fazili-as-us-national-economic-council-101610759341128.html

We are also interested in Russian vaccine Sputnik V, who have submitted some data but we have sought more data from them," he said."We are trying to get AstraZeneca vaccine both through the Covax facility and through direct procurement," he added.This revelation comes as several countries have already started administering Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-not-placed-any-orders-for-covid-19-vaccine-says-health-official-101610759951260.html

16-01-2021||World||Who are German chancellor Merkel's potential successors||Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) elects a new leader on Saturday who would be in the pole position to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor after she steps down following federal elections in September.The new CDU leader will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress. By tradition, the leader is usually - though not always - chancellor candidate for the CDU's "Union" with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Here's a look at the potential successors: Armin LaschetThe premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous region, presents himself as the Merkel continuity candidate. Laschet, 59, has the advantage of controlling the CDU in NRW, which provides 298 of the 1,001 congress delegates, but lacks appeal with the wider electorate. He has polished his international profile, courted French President Emmanuel Macron, and complained last year that Berlin had taken "too long to react" to French calls for European Union reform. CDU sources say Laschet, a centrist, would be well suited to negotiating a possible coalition government with the Greens. However, he resisted early efforts to curb coal production. Merkel said last year he has "the tools" to run for chancellor, the closest she has come to endorsing anyone.Friedrich MerzA rock-ribbed conservative who narrowly lost a 2018 bid for the CDU leadership, Merz was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Merkel in 2002 and has been out of the Bundestag since 2009. But he retained an influential network of CDU contacts while pursuing a successful business career and is a favourite with many rank-and-file party members. The plain-speaking Merz, 65, wants to shift the CDU to the right. He told Reuters last year that the EU must be careful not to become a "transfer union" in which richer member states are asked to bankroll their poorer peers. He has criticised the European Central Bank's policies on the euro common currency.Norbert RoettgenAfter starting the leadership race as an outsider, Roettgen, 55, has picked up support by presenting himself as a moderniser, appealing to women and younger voters. He has shown a capacity to reinvent himself, and some CDU lawmakers would like to see him do the same with the party. He beat Laschet in a 2010 contest to be party chief in NRW only to lose a subsequent state election, after which Merkel fired him as environment minister. He subsequently became chairman of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee. Eloquent and intellectual, he wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China.Markus SoederThe Bavarian premier, 54, projects a charm that none of the CDU leadership candidates can match and is voters' preferred conservative leader. A political chameleon, he has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late and has courted the Greens, the Union's likely next coalition partner after many years with the sliding Social Democrats. Soeder plays coy about his ambitions - "My place is in Bavaria" has been his repeated refrain - but insists the CDU and CSU will decide together who should be their chancellor candidate. He has warned against departing from Merkel's centrist brand of politics. No German chancellor has ever come from the CSU.Jens SpahnBy far the youngest of potential chancellor candidates, Spahn, 40, backed Laschet for the CDU leadership last February but his own profile and standing has since been boosted by his capable management of the coronavirus crisis. An economic liberal and openly gay Catholic, he was critical of Merkel's open-door policy during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis. Some CDU lawmakers, unimpressed with the three declared party leadership contenders, would like him to run for chancellor. While standing by Laschet in the CDU leadership contest, he has been more circumspect when asked about running for chancellor: "As of today, I rule that out," he said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-the-german-chancellor-merkel-s-potential-successors-101610757784202.html
16-01-2021||World||On guns, abortion and voting rights, Trump leaves lasting mark on US judiciary||When a U.S. appeals court declared that Florida could make it harder for convicted felons to vote - a ruling decried by civil rights activists - the impact of President Donald Trump's conservative judicial appointments was plain to see.The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was divided 6-4 in the September ruling, with five Trump appointees in the majority. They ruled that the Republican-governed state could require felons to pay fines, restitution and legal fees after serving time and before casting ballots. A lower court had ruled the law violated their voting rights under the U.S. Constitution.The dissenting 11th Circuit judges were all Democratic appointees.The outcome illustrated that Trump's success in moving the U.S. judiciary to the right was not limited to the Republican president's three Supreme Court appointments - Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - who pushed the top U.S. judicial body's conservative majority to 6-3.Nowhere is that more clearly on display than on the 13 influential federal courts of appeals, one rung below the Supreme Court. Trump, due to leave office next Wednesday, has appointed 54 judges to these courts in his four years as president, just one fewer than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama did in eight years. Trump's total amounts to almost a third of the 179 federal appellate judges.Trump also appointed 174 federal district court judges, a step below the appeals courts. Only Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981, appointed more judges overall during a single four-year term, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who tracks judicial nominations.Earlier in his presidency, Trump often touted judicial appointments as one of his greatest achievements in office. But after losing the Nov. 3 presidential election, he turned on judges, including Supreme Court justices, who repeatedly rejected his efforts to overturn the result as he pushed false claims of widespread voting fraud and irregularities."He misses the fundamentals, much less the subtleties, of the independent judiciary," Wheeler said. "Those concepts are just foreign to him."When Trump took office in January 2017, the 11th Circuit had an 8-3 majority of Democratic-appointed judges. Due to the speed of Trump's nominations and the quick work that the Republican-led Senate under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made of confirming them, it now has a 7-5 majority of Republican appointees.The number of Republican and Democratic appointees is typically an indicator of an appeals court's conservative-liberal balance.Trump's nominees have generally been relatively young, meaning they could serve in their lifetime appointments potentially for decades. Trump appointed eight non-white judges and 11 women to these appeals courts, including Barrett, who he subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court.Although Supreme Court rulings have the greatest impact on the law, it hears fewer than 100 cases a year, typically leaving the final word to the 13 appeals courts. Trump's judicial appointees already are having an influence not just on voting rights but on other contentious issues including guns, abortion and LGBT rights.'TIPPED THE BALANCE'"Having such a very high number of ideologically driven young courts of appeal judges around the country not only tipped the balance on a number of these circuits but has also tipped it in a way that could last for a long time," said Russ Feingold, a former Democratic U.S. senator and president of the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group.When Trump took office, Democratic-appointed judges held majorities on nine of the 13 appeals courts. Under Trump, the 11th Circuit and two other regional appeals courts - the New York-based 2nd Circuit and the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit - have "flipped" to have a majority of Republican appointees.Even on courts that have not flipped, Republican-appointed judges have made inroads. At the start of Trump's presidency, the liberal San Francisco-based 9th Circuit had an 18-4 majority of Democratic appointees. Now it is just 16-13.Trump-appointed judges have made their mark on the 9th Circuit, including when Judge Kenneth Lee authored a ruling last August striking down a California gun regulation that banned large-capacity magazines.On abortion, four Trump-appointed judges were in the majority in 2019 when the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit declined to reconsider a ruling that upheld a Republican-backed Louisiana law that placed restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling last June struck down the law.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but supporters of Trump's judges said their rulings have shown independence from political influence."So many of these court of appeals judges ... have proven over and over that they put the rule of law and the Constitution ahead of any political agenda. Democrats predicted that they would be political hacks, but they’ve been proven wrong," said Leonard Leo, a long-time conservative legal activist who advised the Trump administration on judges.McConnell played a crucial role in clearing the way for Trump's appointments by impeding Senate confirmation of Obama's picks - including refusing to consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 - while subsequently speeding approval of Trump's nominees.In some ways, Wheeler said, "it's McConnell's legacy: He gave Trump the vacancies to fill."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-guns-abortion-and-voting-rights-trump-leaves-lasting-mark-on-us-judiciary-101610760292200.html
16-01-2021||World||Pompeo offers burst of actions, attacks before leaving State||Mike Pompeo isn't quietly fading away. In his final days as secretary of state, he's issuing orders that have caused international consternation and tweeting up a storm on his official and personal accounts to cement his legacy as a prime promoter of President Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine.With a potential eye on a 2024 presidential run, Pompeo has doubled down on his support for Trump, even as other Cabinet members have resigned or stayed out of sight in the aftermath of the Capitol violence. While the House debated Trump's role in encouraging the riot, Pompeo sent a tweet promoting Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.Also Read: US secretary of state Mike Pompeo says Donald Trump's legacy stronger than riotsOver the past week, Pompeo has celebrated controversial policies that are likely to be overturned by his successor, stepped up criticism of what he believes to be unfair news coverage, and he has complained about alleged censorship of conservatives on social media.And in a sign of his post-Trump ambitions, he urged followers of his official State Department Twitter account to start following his personal one.While it’s not unusual for outgoing Cabinet members to publicize their successes, Pompeo has taken it a step further by trashing his predecessors in the national security community, some of whom will play prominent roles in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.“Remember this Middle East ‘expert?’ He said it couldn’t happen. We did it,” Pompeo said in a taunting tweet featuring a video clip of John Kerry saying Arab countries would not recognize Israel without an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Kerry, a former secretary of state, will serve as climate envoy in the Biden administration.Already the most political of recent secretaries of state, Pompeo has bristled at even the mildest criticism and accused his critics of being misguided, unintelligent or incompetent. He has ignored the advice of his own advisers by forging ahead with pet projects, some of which seem designed to complicate Biden’s presidency.Since last Saturday, he has:—Rescinded long-standing restrictions on U.S. contacts with Taiwan, a move that's main result is to anger China.—Declared Yemen's Houthi rebels a terrorist organization, a step that the United Nations and relief agencies say could worsen what is already a humanitarian catastrophe.Also Read: Donald Trump becomes first US President to be impeached twice—Re-designated Cuba a “state sponsor of terrorism," an action that will impede or at least delay any attempt by Biden to improve ties with Havana.—Accused Iran of deep and longstanding ties with al-Qaida, a pronouncement that many in the intelligence community find overblown given a history of animosity between the two.The actions are in line with a tough “America First” policy that he has long espoused with gusto.He has attacked China, Iran, various U.N. organizations, multilateral institutions like the International Criminal Court, and bilateral treaties such as arms control accords with Russia, two of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from during his time as America’s top diplomat.On Iran, Pompeo has been particularly harsh, re-imposing all sanctions that had been eased by the Obama administration after the 2015 nuclear deal and adding more penalties. He also advocated for the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq at the beginning of last year and has been at the forefront of an effort to encourage Sunni Arab states to unite against predominantly Shiite Iran.“The foreign policy blob constantly looks for a moderate inside the Iranian regime who will ‘normalize relations’, Pompeo said this week. “The reality is you have a better chance finding a unicorn.”Pompeo has made a sport out of trashing China, Cuba and international organizations, as well as Obama administration officials he believes were hopelessly naive in negotiating with them.“As the UN’s largest contributor, I put U.S. taxpayers and America’s interests first,” Pompeo tweeted on Monday. It was accompanied by a photo of former President Barack Obama, Kerry, Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice and Obama’s U.N Ambassador Samantha Power at the United Nations. Along with Kerry, Rice and Power have also been named to prominent positions in Biden’s administration.Yet for all the efforts to celebrate Trump administration foreign policy, Pompeo and the State Department have had minimal roles in some of the biggest areas, with the White House taking charge. That was most notable in what Trump supporters see as one of his top accomplishments, improving Israel's ties with its Arab neighbors.Led by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the administration relentlessly promoted Israeli-Arab peace efforts, culminating in agreements for the normalization of relations between the Jewish state and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. Pompeo and the State Department were largely absent from that diplomacy, with the exception of Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who reports mainly to the White House.Pompeo's State Department was effectively shut out of Kushner's much-talked-about Israeli-Palestinian peace "vision" — and the secretary of state was not present for the rollout of the economic part of the plan in Bahrain in 2019. Pompeo and other Cabinet members were present for the unveiling of the political piece of the proposal last January, yet his role in creating the plan, which was immediately rejected by the Palestinians, is murky.On Thursday, Pompeo lauded Trump's March 2019 decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967. He tweeted a video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem that night with the caption: “I’ll never forget this moment.” Yet he and his delegation had been out of the loop on the timing of the Golan Heights decision, which Trump made after consulting with Kushner just minutes before Pompeo was to meet with Netanyahu.Similarly, the State Department took a backseat in Kushner's negotiations to get Morocco to normalize ties with Israel, which involved U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara.Pompeo did void a decades-old U.S. legal opinion regarding the legality of Jewish settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians. On his last visit to Israel in November, Pompeo became the first secretary of state to visit a settlement and on Thursday proudly promoted a West Bank wine named after him.“L’Chaim to Pompeo wine!” Pompeo said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-offers-burst-of-actions-attacks-before-leaving-state-101610760028531.html
16-01-2021||World||US Capitol riots: FBI questioning dozens in killing of police officer, assaults||The FBI is questioning dozens of people in the killing of Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died a day after physically engaging with a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the US. Capitol last week, and other assaults on law enforcement, the New York Times reported on Friday.The FBI detailed its investigation in a memo sent to the private sector and others on Friday, the newspaper reported.As rioters overpowered Capitol police, Sicknick was pepper-sprayed and hit in the head, his father told Reuters last week. Ambulance crews resuscitated him twice as he was rushed to a nearby Washington hospital. Sicknick died the next day.The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sicknick’s death is being investigated as a homicide by the Washington Metropolitan Police. The FBI is assisting.Sicknick was the fifth person to die after Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.The Republican president had summoned them to Washington for a rally and urged them to fight as lawmakers were meeting to certify his November election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The deaths included some rioters.Fourteen other Capitol Police officers were injured in the riot, the FBI memo said, according to the New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-riots-fbi-questioning-dozens-in-killing-of-police-officer-assaults-101610753933056.html
16-01-2021||World||World hits 2 million Covid-19 deaths with cases still surging||Led by the U.S., the world has hit a frightening Covid-19 threshold, with 2 million people dead and few expectations for the numbers to start dropping any time soon.“You want to get to the point first where the virus can’t outrace you,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership. “It’s very hard to project out in any fine level of resolution how many people will be dead from this, in even 6 months to a year.”With the rollout of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and the Moderna Inc. shot going slowly in the U.S., and virtually non-existent in many parts of the world, the odds of controlling the outbreak before the summer at the earliest are slim, especially because it can take weeks for an infected person to die.“We have a great forest fire of a pandemic happening,” Gonsalves said in a phone interview. “But if you have just a bucket of water in a forest fire, then you aren’t doing well.”Overall, the U.S. is leading all countries in deaths with 388,705, with Brazil, India, Mexico and the U.K. next in line. Covid, meanwhile, has already killed more people than malaria and tuberculosis combined in the past year, and is nearing the peak number of annual deaths seen from AIDS, which occurred in 2005.French Prime Minister Jean Castex sees a gradual exit from the pandemic in his country, potentially by next summer.“This tragedy our country is living, that the world has been living for months and which weighs on so many of us, the utmost priority to get out of this crisis is the recourse to vaccination,” Castex said Thursday at a news conference in Paris. “But we must collectively show patience and responsibility, because it’ll be several months before vaccination will be able to sufficiently protect us.”In the U.S., public health officials say that most people will have access to the vaccine by summer, which will start to choke off the virus and create some level of protection.Ali Mokdad is a population scientist and professor of global health at the University of Washington, where the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has been tracking and modeling the outbreak for the past year.The institute projects that the world won’t get to about 3 million deaths by the end of 2021, meaning that fewer than 1 million people will die from coronavirus this year. The group’s latest analysis projects 2.89 million deaths worldwide by the end of the year.“All the way to December, it’s not going to be another million,” Mokdad said in a telephone interview. When it comes to infections, he said, “we are not going to see any more situations in the U.S. with 4,000 deaths a day.”People need to wear masks until 75% of the population is immunized, Mokdad said, which could happen sometime this summer. That assumes, he said, that the vaccines continue to roll out, that no further side effects emerge, that there is no new mutation that makes it less effective and that Americans don’t start to celebrate too soon.“Cases are going to come down simply because of the vaccine and the weather,” he said. “It‘s on us to keep doing what we need to do.”Still, studies haven’t confirmed whether the vaccine will stop the spread of the virus itself, instead showing it protects those who receive it from contracting a symptomatic or severe infection. Still, as more and more people obtain some protection against the immediate ravages of the pathogen, the death and hospitalizations rates should start to slow.Gonsalves, though, is concerned that even if the U.S. is able to stem its outbreak, the virus will continue to surge elsewhere. “If you can’t put it out everywhere,” he said, “you can’t put it out anywhere. You are always going to have travel seeding new outbreaks.”Booster ShotWhile the vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are promising to protect people right now, it also remains unclear how long that protection will last.Pfizer is continuing to study its vaccine, hoping to move from its emergency use authorization to final approval, and to determine if regular booster shoots will be needed to keep the virus from re-emerging.While the number of deaths is likely to recede as more and more people get vaccinated, herd immunity -- which occurs when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, making the person-to-person spread unlikely -- won’t be achieved until at least 70% of the population is protected, experts including Anthony Fauci have said.IHME projects this to happen sometime in July. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease doctor and soon to be a key adviser to Joe Biden once he becomes U.S. president on Jan. 20, said last month that herd immunity will likely happen in the summer, with a return to normality by the end of the year.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization puts the timeline globally at 2022.Worldwide Protection“Even as vaccines start protecting the most vulnerable, we’re not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,” said the WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan at a Jan. 11 news briefing. “Even if it happens in a couple of pockets, in a few countries, it’s not going to protect people across the world.”The WHO has placed orders for more than 2 billion vaccine doses for low and moderate income countries through its COVAX facility, designed to fight the pandemic. It also has the option to acquire a billion more, according to Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist working with the WHO.“This issue is not the lack of vaccines that we are ordering for the low and low middle income countries,” according to Aylward. “The crucial thing is the timing, to get at least some of those doses early enough to protect these health care workers on the front lines in these countries, as well as the older populations and others who are at high risk of potentially dying of this disease.”Aylward urged wealthier countries to focus not on making sure that all of their population is vaccinated first, but that those at highest risk and most likely to keep the virus viable worldwide get priority access.‘Incredible Progress’“This is not the time to get disheartened,” said the WHO’s Swaminathan, an Indian pediatrician known for her work on tuberculosis and HIV. “We’ve made incredible progress, and a year ago nobody would have predicted that there would have been not one but several vaccines against this new virus that have been developed, manufactured, produced and distributed.”It takes time to scale up the production of doses “not just in the millions but here we’re talking about the billions,” she said. “We have to be a little bit patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hits-2-million-covid-19-deaths-with-cases-still-surging-101610757155085.html
16-01-2021||World||National Rifle Association files bankruptcy, citing New York politics||The National Rifle Association of America, the gun-rights group feared for its lobbying clout but now threatened with dissolution by the state of New York, filed Friday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to regroup in Texas.Restructuring in court will help the NRA exit “a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York,” according to a statement on its website. The NRA’s petition listed assets and liabilities of as much as $500 million each.The filing marked another dramatic twist in months of infighting and external legal pressure that have battered the New York-based NRA, one of the most powerful influencers in American politics. New York has been at the forefront of pursuing the NRA in court, with Attorney General Letitia James suing to dissolve the organization and accusing leader Wayne LaPierre and three others of fleecing it.Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows entities to continue operating while working on a plan to repay creditors. In addition, it pauses pending litigation against the bankrupt entity. Besides James’s case, Washington D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine has filed a separate lawsuit against the NRA’s charitable arm, accusing it of misusing donor funds.The NRA struck a defiant tone Friday, asserting that it is in “its strongest financial condition in years” and is “not insolvent” on a question-and-answer web page about the bankruptcy filing.Texas-Bound“The plan can be summed up quite simply: We are DUMPING New York, and we are pursuing plans to reincorporate the NRA in Texas,” LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, wrote in a letter on its website, citing “costly, distracting and unprincipled attacks” by politicians.James retorted in her own statement, saying, “The NRA’s claimed financial status has finally met its moral status: bankrupt.” She said New York would “not allow the NRA to use this or any other tactic to evade accountability and my office’s oversight.”The NRA has enjoyed enormous sway in Washington for its full-throated defense of the firearms industry and gun rights, beating back repeated attempts for stricter laws in the wake of mass shootings, especially since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut. But the internal rifts and James’s lawsuit dented the group’s image of invulnerability, and President Donald Trump’s impending departure is poised to remove one more NRA ally in Washington’s power structure.For years, the NRA has received millions of dollars annually from the NRA Foundation, whose donors get a tax deduction -- until the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the group’s successful grassroots fund-raisers.Spending ClaimA report detailing alleged lavish spending under LaPierre, published in April 2019 by The Trace, led James to open a probe into the NRA’s nonprofit status. After former NRA President Oliver North complained about financial misconduct at the gun association, LaPierre pushed him out of his unpaid post. The NRA sued North in an attempt to bar him from seeking legal fees, and North countersued.James filed suit in August, alleging the NRA for years diverted millions of dollars in charitable donations to enrich the organization’s top executives in violation of laws governing nonprofits. James also is demanding millions of dollars in restitution and penalties. The case immediately posed one of the biggest legal threats the NRA faced since its founding in New York in 1871.The NRA countersued James in federal court, accusing her of violating its First Amendment rights. The organization also accused her of weaponizing her regulatory and legal power under the guise of protecting state residents.The NRA’s turmoil began with a power struggle in 2019 between North and LaPierre, which included allegations of self dealing. A subsequent state probe found wrongdoing blamed for more than $64 million in losses in the last three years alone, James said when she filed her suit.As part of litigation arising from the power struggle, the NRA claimed that North plotted with its former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen Inc., to smear LaPierre by leaking details of his spending. North and Ackerman denied the claims. The NRA has also accused James of trying to circumvent the organization’s legal rights by demanding information about its members as part of a “political witch hunt.”The case is National Rifle Association of America, 21-30085-11, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas).(Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, is a donor to candidates and groups that support gun control, including Everytown for Gun Safety.)(Adds Letitia James’s comment in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-rifle-association-files-bankruptcy-citing-new-york-politics-101610753953065.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump's approval rating plummets to all-time low of 29% following Capitol riots||US President Donald Trump's approval rating has plummeted to an all-time low, led by a dramatic drop in support among voters of his own party, following insurrection at the Capitol last week.A new Pew Research Center poll released on Friday found that just 29 per cent of Americans have approved of the job Trump is doing in office, by far the lowest rating he has received during his presidency, reported The Hill.The poll said 68 per cent of people disapprove of his handling of the job, while 52 per cent say Trump bears a lot of responsibility for the violence and destruction that took place at the Capitol last week.Voters have deeply disapproved of the way the president has conducted himself in wake of the November election he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. More than six in ten say his behaviour after Election Day was poor, and almost half of those who say they voted for Trump called his behaviour either poor or only fair.The rating makes Trump one of the least popular presidents of all time, slightly above the percentage of Americans who approved of Richard Nixon's job performance when he resigned office in disgrace. Just 26 per cent of Americans said they approved of Nixon's job performance when he left office in 1974, The Hill reported.Meanwhile, Sputnik reported that as Biden prepares to take office just days after the riot inside the US Capitol, 64 per cent of voters expressed a positive opinion of his conduct since he won the November election and majorities also approved of Biden's Cabinet selections and how he has explained his plans and policies for the future, Pew said.Other surveys have also depicted a free fall in Trump's approval rating.On January 6, a group of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest legislators confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid.Five people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police.Following the violence, the US House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Trump for "inciting" last week's deadly violence at Capitol Hill, making him the first US President to be impeached twice.Congress voted 232 to 197 on the single article of impeachment charging Trump with "incitement of insurrection".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-approval-rating-plummets-to-all-time-low-of-29-following-capitol-riots-101610756961062.html

Wiedemann also prohibited Barnett from using the internet or having contact with anyone else who participated in the Jan. 6 violence.Federal prosecutors indicated the Justice Department planned to appeal the order and asked Wiedemann to stay her decision. Barnett was set to be released on Saturday.Barnett was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol. Five people died because of the protest and violence, including a Capitol police officer.Barnett is charged with unlawfully entering a restricted area with a lethal weapon — in this case, a stun gun. Barnett also is charged with disorderly conduct and theft of public property.He surrendered voluntarily Jan. 8 to FBI agents at the Benton County Sheriff’s Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, and has remained in the Washington County jail since then.During a nearly four-hour hearing Friday held over video conference, prosecutors showed pictures of Barnett sitting at a desk in Pelosi's office and Capitol security video of him inside the building. They also showed footage of him bragging on a bullhorn to a crowd outside the Capitol about taking a envelope from the speaker's office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-riots-pelosi-s-office-invader-barnett-to-be-put-under-house-arrest-101610756464229.html

He is the first life scientist to have that job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.Saying “science will always be at the forefront of my administration,” Biden said he is boosting the science advisor post to Cabinet level, a first in White House history.The president-elect also said he is retaining National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project, and named two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Frances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will co-chair the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration.Collins, in an email statement, called Lander “brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.”“I predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science,” Collins said.The job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.Science organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.“Elevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion,” said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.Biden chose Princeton's Alondra Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, as deputy science policy chief.Lander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur “genius” fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.Lander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his “Achilles' heel": “I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-eric-lander-as-science-adviser-puts-in-cabinet-101610756567191.html
16-01-2021||World||Pelosi calls for prosecution of Congress members who aided Capitol siege||Any members of the US Congress who helped a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters storm the Capitol should face criminal prosecution, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday.The unprecedented Jan. 6 attack on the seat of Congress left five dead and led the House to impeach Trump a second time, for a fiery speech that day in which he urged thousands of his followers to fight Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's victory.The hundreds who stormed the Capitol quickly overwhelmed police guarding the building, calling security preparations into question, and showed a level of detailed knowledge about the location of lawmakers' offices by some rioters that raised suspicions.Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill, a former US Navy helicopter pilot, has accused some Republican lawmakers of helping Trump supporters, saying she saw colleagues leading groups on "reconnaissance" tours on Jan. 5.Pelosi was asked at a news conference whether any actions would be taken against lawmakers who may have brought tours to the Capitol the day before the attack, which briefly halted Congress in its duty of certifying Biden's win."If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crimes, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress, in terms of prosecution for that," Pelosi said.The Capitol Police is investigating whether members of Congress led people through the Capitol the day before the attack. "The matter is under investigation," said Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki.More than 30 House Democrats, including Sherrill, have asked the acting House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the acting head of the Capitol Police for information about who was in the building on Jan. 5.Pelosi announced a security review of the siege by Trump followers, some of whom were aligned with white supremacist groups. The review would study the Capitol's security infrastructure, procedures, and "command and control," she said.Some Republican Representatives have loudly protested security measures put in place since the attack, including new requirements that everyone entering the House chamber pass through a metal detector.The march by Trump's supporters had been publicized for weeks.There was no direct evidence to suggest rioters had formed "kill capture teams," the top federal prosecutor in Washington, DC said on Friday, softening a statement made by US prosecutors in Arizona in a court filing late on Thursday.The US Justice Department's internal watchdog will review how the FBI and other law enforcement agencies prepared and responded, Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Friday.The House on Wednesday approved an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection for his speech immediately before the attack.Pelosi declined to answer questions from reporters about when she would send the article to the Senate, the step necessary to trigger a trial. A spokesman for the speaker said he could not confirm a CNN report later on Friday that she is expected to send the article next week.Trump is not expected to face trial before his term ends on Jan. 20, though lawmakers could bar him from running for office again.Congressional Democrats have been grappling with how to balance the impeachment of Trump with other Senate priorities including confirming Cabinet nominees and addressing Biden's request for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.When Biden takes office on Wednesday, he will be leading a nation where more than 388,000 people have died of Covid-19, which is infecting more than 235,000 people per day."This is a matter of complete urgency," Pelosi said of the Covid-19 vaccine distribution under Biden's proposal.According to Senate rules, the trial would start the day after the charge is sent over by the House. The last time the House voted to impeach Trump, in December 2019, Pelosi did not transmit the charges to the Senate for weeks.Those charges related to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The Senate in February 2020 voted to acquit Trump, keeping him in office.Democrats said on Friday they are bringing back two outside lawyers who helped prosecute Trump's first impeachment: Barry Berke, who will serve as chief impeachment counsel, and Joshua Matz, according to a House Judiciary Committee statement.The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday, the day before Biden's inauguration.A presidential inauguration traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, but the ceremonies have been scaled back dramatically because of the Covid-19 pandemic, even before last week's riot.Now Washington is wrapped in a security blanket with thousands of troops and law enforcement officers on duty.Trump plans to leave Washington on the morning of the inauguration and go to his club in Palm Beach, Florida, a source familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-calls-for-prosecution-of-congress-members-who-aided-capitol-siege-101610754352140.html

He would also use the law to support vaccine refrigeration and storage.Biden said his team has identified companies that are ready to be activated under the law, which enables the president to order businesses to produce items necessary for national defense.States that use their National Guard in the effort would be reimbursed by the federal government, the transition team said.The coronavirus has killed more than 390,000 people in the United States, and a top Biden adviser said on Friday the death tally could reach 500,000 by February.Biden has promised to do better than President Donald Trump to curb the virus and get 100 million vaccine shots into the arms of Americans during his first 100 days in office."This is a time to set big goals and pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is literally at stake," said Biden, who takes office on Wednesday.EXPANDING VACCINATION SITESSpeaking near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden called for increasing vaccine distribution in lower-income neighborhoods not currently well served by hospitals and pharmacies. Biden also plans a marketing campaign to encourage those skeptical of the vaccine to get inoculated.His transition team said he will reorganize the vaccine distribution team currently called "Operation Warp Speed" and has asked former Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler to work with manufacturers to boost vaccine availability.Biden said his administration will release the vast majority of doses when they become available, rather than holding back a large portion to ensure that recipients can get a second dose, which had been the Trump administration's approach for much of the rollout. States will get regular updates to know how many doses are coming to ensure they can distribute them efficiently.He said he will order the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up 100 vaccine centers within a month, which he said would ultimately serve millions of people. Neighborhood pharmacies would also be enlisted as vaccination sites, he said.Even with these changes, Biden said it will take time for the United States to beat back the virus. "The honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better," he said.Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday that includes $20 billion for vaccine distribution as well as $50 billion for coronavirus testing, which experts and officials said should help speed the process up.The stimulus proposal faces an uphill battle in Congress, however. When Biden takes office, Democrats will control both the Senate and the House of Representatives but by narrow margins. Some Republicans have balked at its cost, while liberals have pushed for more spending on direct payments to individuals.The Trump administration had aimed to give vaccine doses to 20 million Americans by the end of 2020. But only 12.3 million coronavirus shots had been administered as of Friday morning out of more than 31 million doses distributed to states, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Federal officials have largely left states to manage distribution, resulting in big differences in vaccination rates. The Trump administration has said it expects 1 million shots to be delivered per day by the end of next week.A Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States is on track to have 300 million doses available by the end of Biden's first 100 days in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/retired-doctors-and-more-syringes-biden-lays-out-plan-to-get-america-vaccinated-101610755517777.html
16-01-2021||World||US imposes sanctions on Cuba citing human rights violations||The US Department of the Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Cuba's Interior Ministry and its leader, accusing them of serious human rights violations.The measures against the ministry and Brigadier Gen. Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas include freezing any bank accounts they may have in the United States and blocking any business operations with US entities.The new sanctions, which are largely symbolic, come less than a week before the end of Donald Trump’s presidency, which has been characterized by strong hostility toward the Cuban government.“The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to address the dire human rights situation in Cuba and elsewhere around the world,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The sanctions will be implemented under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and directed “against the perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption throughout the world,” the US government said in a news release.The statement cited the case of Cuban dissident Jose Daniel Ferrer, who was held in a prison controlled by the Interior Ministry. Ferrer reported being beaten, tortured, held in solitary confinement and denied medical attention at the prison.The island’s Ministry of the Interior oversees the internal order in the Caribbean nation and includes police, firefighters, the penitentiary system and border guards. The Cuban government does not recognize the legal status of dissidents, whom it often accuses of being manipulated and financed by American interest groups wanting to discredit the socialist government.It is not the first time that high-ranking Cuban officials have been sanctioned by the United States. In September, the US Department of State imposed sanctions on the former president and current leader of Cuba’s Communist Party, Raúl Castro — a historical leader of the Cuban Revolution — and his four children.Trump has promoted a policy of sanctions and restrictions on the island since taking office in 2017, reversing the bilateral relations that had begun under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration has applied hundreds of measures and sanctions, some of only symbolic value, such as the ones announced Friday, and others with a strong impact on the island’s economy and its population.President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office Wednesday, said during his election campaign that he will re-establish at least part of Obama’s policies related to the island. Biden’s advisers have said he plans to eliminate restrictions on remittances and travel, among other measures implemented by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-sanctions-on-cuba-citing-human-rights-violations-101610754443039.html

16-01-2021||World||UN Security Council approves Kubis as new Libya mediator||The United Nations Security Council approved on Friday the appointment of veteran diplomat Jan Kubis as the UN Libya envoy, diplomats said, nearly a year after the last mediator stepped down.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had proposed that Kubis succeed Ghassan Salame, who quit the role in March last year due to stress. Salame's deputy Stephanie Williams has been acting Libya envoy.Kubis, a former Slovakian foreign minister, is currently the UN special coordinator for Lebanon. He has also served as the UN special envoy in Afghanistan and Iraq.The appointment of Kubis comes after the Security Council approved in December a plan by Guterres' to name Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov to the Libya role. But a week later Mladenov said he could not take up the position due to "personal and family reasons."Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October, the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire.Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-approves-kubis-as-new-libya-mediator-101610753904153.html
16-01-2021||World||Pfizer to cut vaccine shipments as Belgian factory renovated||Pfizer Inc. will decrease deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine to countries outside the US in the next three to four weeks as it renovates a factory in Belgium.The updates will help boost capacity beginning in mid-February, according to statements from Norway, Germany, Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech SE. The factory, located in Puurs, supplies vaccine to all countries other than the US, the German Health Ministry said.“As part of the normal productivity improvements to increase capacity, we must make modifications to the process and facility that will require additional regulatory approvals,” a Pfizer spokeswoman said in a statement. “Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March.”Together, Pfizer and BioNTech will be able to deliver the fully committed quantity of vaccine doses to the European Union in the first quarter, and even higher output in the second quarter, BioNTech said in a statement Friday. The EU deliveries will return to its original schedule the week of Jan. 25, with increased deliveries commencing the week of Feb. 15.“The companies will inform the European Commission, EU member states and other countries impacted by the changes about the updated delivery schedules,” BioNTech said in the statement.Pfizer and its German partner are under growing pressure to make more shots as countries around the world rush to immunize vulnerable people. The companies recently increased their output target for this year by more than 50% to 2 billion doses. However, some of that increase is simply due to regulators giving health-care providers the go-ahead to pull an additional dose from each vial.The partners are also seeking to boost capacity at their factories and find new production partners. A new BioNTech factory in Marburg, Germany, passed its emissions review with the German state of Hesse on Friday, putting it a step closer to opening as planned next month.Pfizer shares were little changed at $36.70 in New York on Friday, while BioNTech’s American depositary receipts fell 4%.‘On the Case’European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she called Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla, who promised that the company will meet delivery targets for the first quarter.“He’s personally on the case on reducing the delay,” she said. “We urgently need the guaranteed doses in the first quarter.”Because of the dosing schedule, “there is also a medical necessity and need to stick to what we have agreed, to the schedule we have agreed, and to the delivery,” von der Leyen said. “In Europe we have been supportive and we will be supportive in what concerns the scaling up of production capacity, but we expect then that the delivery schedule is being fulfilled.”Countries RespondNorway said it will get 36,078 doses from Pfizer next week instead of the 43,875 that were anticipated. Two doses given three weeks apart are needed to vaccinate one person.Meanwhile, Italy’s virus emergency czar, Domenico Arcuri, said Friday that he’s warned Pfizer that it faces potential, unspecified action for temporarily reducing shipments of its Covid-19 vaccine to Italy and other European countries.“Today Pfizer unilaterally announced that starting from Monday it will deliver to our country about 29% fewer vaccine vials than the schedule it had shared,” Arcuri said in a statement demanding the restoration of the original allocation.In Canada, which has ordered more Covid-19 vaccine doses per capita than any other country, Procurement Minister Anita Anand called the temporary reduction “unfortunate.” Pfizer plans to catch up on deliveries by the end of March, Anand said, adding that by the end of September, everyone who wishes to be vaccinated will be able to get a shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-to-cut-vaccine-shipments-as-belgian-factory-renovated-101610754532094.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump directs government to minimize procurement from China||In another action against China days before he leaves office, US President Donald Trump on Friday directed government departments to look at ways to minimize procurement of Chinese goods and services to reduce the risks from espionage, his national security adviser said.In a statement, Robert O'Brien accused China of targeting the information systems of the US government for personnel records, military plans, and other data through cyber and other means."For this reason, the United States must take corresponding actions to protect American interests. We must adjust our regulations and policies and take other necessary actions to reduce the risk of PRC technical and human espionage activities directed at the Federal Government," he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.He said Trump had directed government bodies to conduct reviews "to minimize the procurement of People’s Republic of China (PRC) goods and services by the Federal Government."O'Brien did not give examples of the procurement he referred to, but a senior administration official said a key aim was to push back against Chinese attempts to infiltrate US IT networks."Anything having to do with Chinese companies that are going to have kit components in our network could potentially become a vulnerability that could be used to continue China's military-civil fusion strategy," the official said."If there's hardware, for example, that would make its way into our networks, that's the sort of stuff that could pose a potential vulnerability."The announcement comes less than a week before Trump leaves office to be succeeded by Democrat Joe Biden on Jan. 20. It was the latest in a series of steps targeting China, which analysts see as a bid to lock in a tough approach to Beijing.Trump has pursued hard-line policies toward China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus. Relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when he ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-directs-government-to-minimize-procurement-from-china-101610754006038.html
16-01-2021||World||US agents guarding Ivanka, Jared had to rent $3k/month flat||US Secret Service agents guarding President Donald Trump’s family members and advisers, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were instructed not to use the half-dozen bathrooms in the couple’s house in Washington, compelling them to use facilities at neighbours’ houses and a portable washroom for months, according to a report by the Washington Post.Asked not to use the bathrooms inside the couple’s sprawling 5,000-square-foot house in the elite Kalorama neighbourhood, several US agents resorted to using a porta-potty as well as bathrooms at the nearby homes of former President Barack Obama, and Vice-President Mike Pence. Sometimes, they even went up to commercial facilities nearby to use the washrooms, two law enforcement officials cited by the Washington Post report said.Finally, in September 2017, the federal government rented from a neighbour a basement studio with a washroom for $3,000 per month, which resolved the issue but came at a total cost of $100,000 to American taxpayers.A White House spokesperson, however, denied that the President’s daughter and son-in-law had restricted the Secret Service agents’ entry into their house.“When discussions regarding protecting their home were initially had in 2017, Ivanka and Jared made clear that their home would always be open to the incredible men and women on their detail. It was only after a decision by the [Secret Service] was made that their detail sought other accommodations,” White House spokesperson Judd Deere said. “Their home will always be open to them and they have immense gratitude for their service over the last four years,” the spokesperson added.The law enforcement officials gave a different version. One of the officials cited above told the Post that the reason for not allowing agents inside the house was not known, but the second official said the decision was taken by the Kushners.“It’s the first time I ever heard of a Secret Service detail having to go to these extremes to find a bathroom,” said one of the officials aware of the matter.A spokesperson for the Secret Service refused to comment.The US Secret Service is a federal agency that is in charge of protecting US political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of governments along with conducting financial investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usagents-guarding-ivanka-jared-had-to-rent-3k-month-flat-101610739528709.html
16-01-2021||World||UK, South Africa, Brazil, US: Variants of SARS-Cov-2 virus found so far||The first coronavirus mutation spotted in the United Kingdom has now spread to over 50 countries, according to World Health Organization data. Meanwhile, several other mutations have been reported from other countries which may differ from the original UK variants.Here is all you need to know about several variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus.UK variantThis variant, believed to be more contagious, was first reported in December. It was first reported to the WHO on December 14. The variant is known as VOC 202012/01. It is likely to infect young people and people with no serious health issues as well, unlike the original virus.South African variantThis variant 501Y.V2, first reported on December 18, is now spread in 20 countries, according to WHO. This variant does not lead to serious illness but is contagious.Japan/Brazil variantA new variant has been detected in four persons who travelled from Brazil to Japan. Among these four, two are children, which makes it apparently clear that this variant can infecchildren as well. This was reported to the WHO on January 9. It has 12 mutations to the spike protein including three mutations of concern in common with the UK and the South African variant.Brazil too reported similar variant independent of the cases detected in Japan.United StatesOhio researchers have claimed to have discovered two new variants of the virus which likely have their origin in the United States. The findings have not yet been published as studies are being conducted. The strains have been found in Columbus — one is similar to the UK variant but the other was an entirely different mutation, researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-south-africa-brazil-us-japan-how-many-variants-of-sars-cov-1-virus-found-so-far-101610698432774.html
