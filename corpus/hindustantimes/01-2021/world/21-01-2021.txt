A second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the proposal but offered no details.The move is almost certain to be welcomed both by Russia and key American allies. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday called on the United States and Russia to extend the treaty and to later broaden it.“We should not end up in a situation with no limitation on nuclear warheads, and New START will expire within days,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.Stoltenberg underlined that “an extension of the New START is not the end, it’s the beginning of our efforts to further strengthen arms control.”The treaty is set to expire Feb. 5 and is the last remaining agreement constraining U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons. Signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, it limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads.President Donald Trump had been highly critical of the deal, asserting that it put the United States at a disadvantage. His administration waited until last year to engage Russia in substantive talks on the treaty's future. Trump insisted that China be added to the treaty, but Beijing rejected the idea out of hand.Biden, who indicated during the campaign that he favored extending New START, is not proposing any alterations, the U.S. official said. Thus it appeared likely that Moscow would be amenable to an extension.The proposal was reported first by The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-proposing-5-year-extension-of-nuke-treaty-report-101611253367483.html
21-01-2021||World||EU agency urges preparation of stronger measures over coronavirus variants||The EU disease agency ECDC on Thursday urged countries to prepare more stringent measures and speed up vaccine campaigns in the coming weeks because of the risks of more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus.The European Centre Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a new report that countries in the EU and European Economic Area "should expect increased numbers of Covid-19 cases due to the gradual spread and possible dominance of the variants with increased transmissibility.""The key message is to prepare for a rapid escalation of the stringency of response measures in the coming weeks to safeguard healthcare capacity and to accelerate vaccination campaigns," the agency said.According to the agency the "rate and scale" of the spread would depend on the level of prevention measures and adherence to those measures.The ECDC said that some 16,800 cases of a new more infectious variant of the novel coronavirus had been identified in the UK, where it was first discovered and some 2,000 cases in 60 countries around the world as of Tuesday, of which 1,300 cases were in 23 countries in the EU and EEA area.Around 570 cases of another variant, also more infectious, first discovered in South Africa have been detected in 23 countries, with 27 cases in 10 EU/EEA countries, in addition to the 349 cases confirmed in South Africa as of January 13.The ECDC also urged members to monitor changes in transmission rates or infection severity to identify and assess the circulation and impact of variants, and also to prepare laboratories for increased testing.It also said countries should increase the number of vaccination centres and vaccination staff to speed up the rollout of the Covid-19 jabs.Even though many countries have already begun vaccinations and have strict measures in place the ECDC cautioned against relaxing measures, "since the population groups driving transmission will not be targeted with vaccination for some months."It said because of the evidence of higher transmissibility of the new variants, authorities should be ready to enforce even stricter measures, "communicating and engaging with the population to encourage compliance".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-urges-preparation-of-stronger-measures-over-coronavirus-variants-101611252020591.html

Smoke could be seen billowing out of broken windows of the second floor.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the interior minister to open and take charge of an inquiry into the incident.The Ukrainian prosecutor general said authorities had launched a criminal investigation and the preliminary cause of the tragedy was the "careless handling of electric heating devices".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-15-killed-11-injured-in-nursing-home-fire-in-ukraine-101611250143614.html
21-01-2021||World||Senate to get Donald Trump's impeachment trial soon: Nancy Pelosi||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the article of impeachment against Donald Trump will be sent to the Senate soon, triggering the start of his trial, but she refused to specify when.The House impeachment managers -- the prosecutors who will present the case against Trump -- are in contact with the Senate about the timing, Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday.“I don’t think it will be long,” she said.The article accuses Trump of inciting insurrection for stoking a crowd of his supporters on Jan. 6 who then stormed the Capitol in a riot that left five people dead. Sending the article to the Senate would require an almost immediate start for the trial, inevitably drawing attention away from President Joe Biden’s first days in office and potentially slowing confirmation of his cabinet picks.Democrats won back the Senate on Wednesday after six years in the minority after two new Georgia senators elected Jan. 5 were sowrn in. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has replaced Republican Mitch McConnell as the majority leader, but they are still working out details of how to organize the Senate, including the procedures for the trial.“It’s still unresolved as to when she’s sending it over,” Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, told reporters earlier on Thursday. “It could be today -- unlikely -- could be tomorrow. And then what we’re going to do with it, whether or not it’s going to be a full blown trial with evidence and witnesses or ‘expedited,’ whatever that means, that final decision isn’t even close.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday it’s up to Congress to conduct the trial. Biden is “going to leave it to them to determine what the path forward should be, on the pace, on the steps, on the mechanics,” she told MSNBC. “He’s going to focus on delivering what he feels he promised to deliver on when he was running for office.”After Trump’s first impeachment on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on Dec. 18, 2019, the House didn’t transmit the articles until Jan. 15, 2020. That trial concluded Feb. 5 with Trump’s acquittal.The House speaker dismissed the criticism from some Republicans that proceeding with the trial of Trump, who is no longer in office, would undermine the message of unity that Biden emphasized at his inauguration.“I think we need to speak as soon as possible with as much unity as possible that a second impeachment of President Trump is bad for the country and we’re gonna fight that,” South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been a close ally of the outgoing president, said Wednesday.Pelosi said the former president must be held accountable for his role inciting the mob.“Just because he’s now gone, thank God, you don’t say to a president ‘do whatever you want in the last months of your administration, you get a get out of jail card, free,’” she said.At least 17 Republicans would have to join all 50 Democrats to convict Trump. The Senate could then vote to bar him from ever holding public office again with a separate vote by a simple majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-to-get-donald-trump-s-impeachment-trial-soon-nancy-pelosi-101611250008252.html
21-01-2021||World||World has faith in Joe Biden, but not in the US: Survey||President Joe Biden is popular across much of the world and expected to provide greater US leadership on issues such as fighting Covid-19, terrorism and climate change, a new multi-nation survey shows. But trust is low both in the US as a nation and Biden’s ability to deliver.“We wanted to know: If there is a change of administration and if the US is ready to lead again, will anyone follow?” said Michael Broening, Executive Director of the New York office of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, the German think tank that commissioned the survey.The answer from the survey’s 12,400 respondents in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the US itself: ‘Yes, but’.“Whatever was here in terms of US trust has really dissipated a lot,” said Broening, adding that US scores on international trust had fallen toward the levels of Russia and China. “That’s a very far stretch from the shining city on a hill.”Asked by polling agency YouGov whether they approved of Biden, and separately if they thought he’d provide more global leadership than predecessor Donald Trump, respondents showed almost as much enthusiasm as similar polls in 2009 -- when Barack Obama replaced George W. Bush, another internationally unpopular US President, in the White House.Eighty-nine percent of Kenyans, 73% of Germans and more than 60% of French, Indians, Indonesians, Mexicans and South Africans said they approved of Biden. Even in countries Trump courted heavily while in office –- such as India and Brazil -– Biden was seen as a welcome change. Only in Russia did more respondents disapprove of the change of guard in Washington.Yet asked whether the new US President should -- and would -- make good on specific goals such as reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the Paris Agreement on climate change, the survey showed skepticism as to whether he can succeed. Biden signed an order to rejoin the Paris Agreement as soon as he was inaugurated on Wednesday.The results chime with those of another recent survey, this time limited to European nations, published January 19 by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a Brussels think tank. That poll found Biden’s popularity abroad undermined by pessimism, including beliefs that the US political system is broken, that Washington can no longer be relied on to provide allies with security, and that China will be the stronger global power within a decade.“Past polling suggested that the changing of a President really presaged similar changes in attitudes to the US,” said John Ray, director of polling at YouGov Blue, which carried out the poll. He cited the large boosts seen both to confidence in the new president and trust in the US around Obama’s 2009 inauguration. “That’s no longer the case.”The poll for the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung was carried out online in December, after Biden’s election victory had become clear, according to Ray. YouGov surveyed roughly 1,000 respondents from each of the 12 countries, with results weighted for variables such as respondents’ ages, gender, education and religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-has-faith-in-joe-biden-but-not-in-the-us-survey-101611248617326.html
21-01-2021||World||Canada's vaccination drive hindered despite securing enough shots for population||Canada came out No. 1 in the global race to secure vaccines against Covid-19, pre-ordering enough shots to inoculate its 38 million people three times over. You wouldn’t know it, though, from the pace of vaccinations.Canada has administered about 684,000 doses, enough to give first shots to about 1.8% of the population, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, though some people have already gotten two. That compares with roughly 7.6% in the UK and 5.2% in the US Israel, leading all nations, has administered enough vaccine to give first shots to nearly a third of its population.Canada’s campaign hit another roadblock last week, when Pfizer Inc. said it would temporarily reduce deliveries outside the US as it renovates a factory in Belgium to boost capacity. Canada won’t receive any shipment from the pharmaceutical giant next week.“Pfizer’s global supply issues are not ideal, but that’s why we were so ambitious in the large number of contracts we signed and doses we secured,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters this week. “The total number of doses committed to us is still the same, with every Canadian who wants to get vaccinated able to get vaccinated by September.”Canada has ordered 40 million doses from Pfizer, amounting to less than 20% of the country’s commitments.The delay is a blow to Canada, where a resurgence of the virus since October has pushed hospitals near capacity, prompting provinces to add restrictions, including a curfew in Quebec. While Canada is hardly alone in its struggle to roll out the vaccine, the subdued start and the Pfizer hurdle have increased tensions between Trudeau and the provinces, and emboldened his critics.“Canada is a proud, strong G7 nation,” Erin O’Toole, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said in written statement Tuesday. “We cannot accept this kind of failure -- not with so much at stake.”Canada’s vaccination ratio ranks 14th worldwide on the vaccine tracker, behind Ireland and Iceland and ahead of Austria, Romania and Germany. The sluggish start has been a particularly sore point as vaccinations accelerated in the U.S., which ranks fifth, just below the U.K. The contrast between the North American neighbors was highlighted in news reports showing Canadian snowbirds happily getting shots in Florida.Even though Canada has secured more vaccines per capita than any other nation, “it doesn’t mean much” when the bulk is not yet being delivered, said Jean-Paul Soucy, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. So far only products produced by Pfizer and Moderna Inc. are authorized for use in Canada, which doubled its Pfizer order from 20 million doses last week.Federal and provincial officials have attributed the slow pace, in part, to Canada’s expansive geography and the industrial freezer storage required for Pfizer’s vaccine, which made it difficult to cover remote areas in the world’s second-largest country by land mass. The country’s decentralized health care system, which leaves it to each province to organize its own vaccination campaign, has made the rollout uneven.Manitoba, for example, confused some people by sending the wrong address for a vaccination center, CTV News reported. Some provinces set aside shots for second doses to complete individuals’ inoculations, while others used up all their stock to give first shots to as many people as possible.Ontario, the country’s largest province, closed vaccination clinics over the December holidays because of low staffing. It was also slow to start inoculating elderly people in long-term care facilities, where thousands died in the spring, Soucy said.“Certainly, we’re behind peer nations in a lot of what we’re doing,” he said.Canadian authorities said Pfizer will ramp up shipping and meet a target of 4 million doses by the end of March. But the disruption of deliveries forced provinces to change plans, with Quebec lowering its targets and Alberta halting appointments.”It’s troubling, it’s a massive concern,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference this week, referring to the Pfizer delay. “My message to the federal government is that nothing else matters right now. Every day we’re giving out less vaccine than we have the capacity to administer is a day we lose.”Pfizer Says It’s Willing to Sell Covid Vaccine Doses to US States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-vaccination-drive-hindered-despite-securing-enough-shots-for-population-101611244831126.html
21-01-2021||World||One in five British adults went further into debt due to pandemic||Almost 9 million people in Britain had to borrow more money by the end of last year to help them through the coronavirus crisis, according to new figures that show widening gaps between the rich and the poor.That’s about a fifth of the UK’s adult population of 47 million people. The findings feed a debate about how Boris Johnson’s administration can best protect segments of the population like the young and lowest paid who have taken the hardest economic hit during the crisis.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have highlighted those concerns in recent weeks and begun talking about measures that could bridge the inequality gap.“The uneven effects of Covid concern me,” Bailey said in a webinar on Wednesday. “It’s clear to me we’ve got to come out of Covid in a way that addresses all parts of the population.”People under the age of 30 and those with household incomes of less than 10,000 pounds ($13,700) were far more likely to be furloughed than the general population, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. The government data also showed self-employed workers were more likely to report reduced hours and income.Among people unable to work, more than half of the top 20% of earners continued to be paid in full, compared with little more than a quarter of those in the bottom 20%. Self-employed workers and the disabled were more likely to have borrowed 1,000 pounds or more. Meanwhile fewer people were able to save for the year ahead.The findings put pressure on Sunak to act in his annual budget statement, which is due on March 3. With the deficit at its highest in peacetime, there are calls for the better off to shoulder the burden of future tax increases.Separate ONS figures showed the gap between rich and poor was widening even before the pandemic struck.Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, rose to 36.3% in the financial year through March, its highest for a decade. The income share of the richest 1% has increased from 7% to 8.3% since 2011.The inflation-adjusted median income of the poorest fifth of people fell by 3.8% between 2017 and 2020. The richest fifth meanwhile saw their incomes steadily grow.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-five-british-adults-went-further-into-debt-due-to-pandemic-101611242955559.html
21-01-2021||World||Indonesia ends search for crashed plane's victims, debris||Indonesian authorities on Thursday ended the search for remaining victims and debris from a Sriwijaya Air jet that nosedived into the Java Sea, killing all 62 people on board.Transportation minister Budi Karya Sumadi said retrieval operations have ended after nearly two weeks, but that a limited search for the missing memory unit from the cockpit voice recorder will continue.The memory unit apparently broke away from other parts of the voice recorder during the crash. Divers retrieved its battered casing and cover last week near the location where the flight data recorder was recovered three days after the accident.The Boeing 737-500 jet crashed on January 9, minutes after taking off from Jakarta, the capital.Searchers have recovered plane parts and human remains from an area between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain just north of Jakarta.“After much consideration, we have to close the search and rescue operation today,” Sumadi told reporters.“However, we are committed to continue efforts to find the cockpit voice recorder." The government will provide a ship to take relatives to the crash site for a memorial ceremony on Friday morning, Sumadi said.So far, 43 victims have been identified from more than 300 body bags containing human remains sent to the National Police's disaster victim identification unit.Investigators are working with Boeing and engine maker General Electric to review information from the flight data recorder, which tracks hundreds of parameters showing how the plane was being operated.A team from the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration is joining the investigation.Investigators will publish a preliminary investigation report within a month after the crash.The 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 was out of service for almost nine months last year because of flight cutbacks caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The airline and Indonesian officials say it passed inspections, including for possible engine corrosion, before resuming commercial flights in December.Indonesia's aviation industry grew quickly after the nation's economy was opened following the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s.Safety concerns led the United States and the European Union to ban Indonesian carriers for years, but the bans have since been lifted due to better compliance with international aviation standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-ends-search-for-crashed-plane-s-victims-debris-101611238265177.html
21-01-2021||World||US climate envoy Kerry says Glasgow last chance for action||US President Joe Biden’s climate czar promised to make a success of the next round of global warming talks, warning it will be the last chance the world has to avoid climate disaster.In his first speech since becoming US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry said failure is “simply not an option” at COP26, which is taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.“We really have the world’s last, most important opportunity to come together to raise ambition and to take the next step from Paris,” he said Thursday at B-20, a business leaders event advising G-20 nations.Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement on Wednesday immediately after taking office, reversing a decision by former President Donald Trump. The Paris deal pledges to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, striving to keep temperature increases as low as 1.5°C.That decision was criticized by Republican Senator Ted Cruz on Wednesday evening, who tweeted that it shows Biden “is more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh.”Kerry praised Europe’s policies on tackling climate and blasted Trump’s stance as “reckless” and embarrassing. He said the US will now try to repair its reputation and seek to close the gap by increasing action. Biden plans to set a goal for net-zero US emissions by 2050.Biden’s next task will be to announce a US emissions target for 2030, which will be key to success at COP26. While Kerry said the US will rejoin the accord with increased ambition, he stopped short of suggesting a figure for emissions cuts.Analysts at Climate Action Tracker estimate the US would need a goal to cut emissions by at least 52% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, in order to make a fair contribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-climate-envoy-kerry-says-glasgow-last-chance-for-action-101611239631737.html
21-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel promises widespread vaccine availability before September vote||Chancellor Angela Merkel promised widespread availability of coronavirus vaccines by late September, shortly before voters elect her successor.Amid efforts to boost vaccine supply, Merkel said all Germans who want a shot will get one by the end of the summer on September 21. National elections take place on September 26.Her conservative bloc is still grappling with who should run for chancellor, wary of the difficulties the candidate would have stepping out of her shadow as she runs the country.The choice is between Armin Laschet -- the newly elected head of Merkel’s Christian Democratic party -- and Markus Soeder from the smaller Bavarian CSU sister party. Merkel on Tuesday reaffirmed her intention to not seek political office after 16 years leading Europe’s largest economy. While the CDU/CSU is well ahead in the polls, it faces challenges from the Greens and the Social Democrats.Merkel dismissed suggestions that the election would be influenced by her handling of the pandemic.Ahead of a virtual meeting with European Union counterparts later on Thursday, the German leader called on the bloc to find common ground to beat the pandemic.“The EU is one area” in the fight against the disease, she said. “There is still some time to prevent virus mutations from spreading.”The EU will seek ways to speed up vaccination programs. Merkel said intensive talks are under way with vaccine makers like Pfizer Inc. to accelerate production.The bloc will also consider special privileges for people who have been inoculated and look into whether to apply travel restrictions. Merkel said some border controls might be needed with neighbors, including Switzerland, in case there is no coordinated response.Merkel said Germany will be very cautious about easing restrictions to guard against a renewed spike from fast-spreading strains like in Britain and Ireland.Schools and daycare facilities would be the first priority when authorities do start to roll back curbs, the German leader said in Berlin on Thursday. A broader opening of shops and hairdressers would likely follow.“Any opening strategy must be approached very carefully because of the mutated virus,” she said, two days after extending a lockdown to February 14.While contagion rates in Europe’s largest economy have declined to the lowest since early November, levels remain more than double a government target. Merkel said infections need to fall below 50 per 100,000 people over seven days to consider looser curbs. The current level is 119.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, was cautiously optimistic that the government’s target could be reached in the next three to four weeks, as long as more aggressive variants are held at bay.“Although everyone is tired of the coronavirus, we have to remain very resolute in coming weeks,” he said in an interview with ARD television. “Then we have a fantastic chance that things will improve step by step and we will beat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-promises-widespread-vaccine-availability-before-september-vote-101611238129615.html

21-01-2021||World||US jobless claims fall slightly but remain elevated||Applications for US state unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week and remained elevated, signaling heightened pandemic-related strain in the US labor market just as Joe Biden begins his first days as president.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs declined by 26,000 to 900,000 in the week ended January 16, according to Labor Department data Thursday. On an un-adjusted basis, the figure dropped by more than 151,000 to 960,668.Continuing claims in state programs -- an approximation of the number of people receiving ongoing jobless benefits -- decreased by 127,000 to 5.05 million in the week ended January 9. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 935,000 initial applications and 5.3 million continuing claims.The figures continue to far exceed their pre-crisis levels as the resurgent pandemic leads to more stringent business restrictions and stokes people’s fears of infection. Vaccine distribution is expected to restore economic activity later this year, but the rollout has been slower than expected and is limiting the speed at which the job market is able to recover.The latest jobless claims figures coincide with the survey week for the monthly employment report, suggesting that the January jobs figures, which will be released on February 5, could show weak payroll gains in the month.While the US economy has been steady in some areas like housing and manufacturing in recent months, the labor market has struggled to bounce back. The $900 billion pandemic aid package approved in December should provide some relief for workers and businesses in the current quarter, especially if businesses receive Paycheck Protection Program loans and keep employees on payrolls.Last week, Biden released details of his $1.9 trillion economic relief plan. If approved by Congress, it would provide $400 per week in supplementary unemployment benefits through September, aid for state and local governments and direct payments of $1,400 to individuals, on top of the $600 approved in December.Janet Yellen, Biden’s pick for Treasury Secretary, said during a confirmation hearing Tuesday that after the initial relief package, she intends to focus on a second package to “build back better” that would include investment in infrastructure, research and development, training and workforce development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-slightly-but-remain-elevated-101611237028787.html
21-01-2021||World||EU, Turkey call for improved relations after turbulent 2020||The European Union and Turkey pressed each other on Thursday to take concrete steps to improve relations long strained by disagreements over energy, migration and Ankara's human rights record.Turkey, which remains an official candidate for EU membership despite the tensions, is facing the threat of EU economic sanctions over a hydrocarbons dispute with Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, but the mood music between Brussels and Ankara has improved since the new year."We have seen an improvement in the overall atmosphere," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said as he welcomed Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for talks, describing 2020 as complicated."Intentions and announcements need to be translated into actions," Borrell said.The improved tone follows a video conference between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on January 9 in which both stressed the importance of the bilateral relationship.Cavusoglu said he hoped von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the head of the European Council which represents the 27 EU member states, would visit Turkey after an invitation from Erdogan."It is of course important for there to be a positive atmosphere in Turkey-EU ties, but in order for this to be sustainable, we must take concrete steps," Cavusoglu added.STRAINED TIES2020 proved particularly difficult for relations between Turkey and the EU, especially France, with Erdogan expressing publicly his hope that protests in French cities would topple President Emmanuel Macron.Greece and Cyprus, strongly backed by France, want to punish Turkey for what they see as provocative oil and gas exploration by Turkish vessels in disputed waters, but Germany and Italy are reluctant to go ahead with any sanctions on Ankara.Turkey has now withdrawn the vessels and is set to restart talks with Greece, although the EU has accused Ankara of playing "cat and mouse" in a pattern of provocation and reconciliation.EU leaders will decide in March whether to impose sanctions.Brussels also accuses Erdogan of undermining the economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts and media, leaving Turkey's bid to join the EU further away than ever."We remain concerned about the (human rights) situation in Turkey," Borrell said on Thursday.The European Parliament is expected on Thursday to back a resolution calling for the release of Selahattin Demirtas, a leading Kurdish politician jailed in 20216 on terrorism-related charges.But Turkey remains a big destination for EU trade and investment and also hosts some 4 million Syrian refugees. The EU aims to agree fresh funds for the refugees from 2022 to discourage them from coming into the bloc.Ankara wants progress on Turks' right to visa-free travel to the EU, an upgrade of its trade agreement with Europe and recognition of its claims to hydrocarbons off its maritime shelf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-turkey-call-for-improved-relations-after-turbulent-2020-101611236293012.html
21-01-2021||World||Clinton, Bush and Obama record joint video to wish Biden success||Former US Presidents Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton have recorded a video together to send their good wishes to President Joe Biden for a smooth transition to power. The video was aired on Wednesday night hours after Biden took oath as the 46th President of the United States.It begins with Obama's remarks. "Obviously there is a personal element to see my former Vice-President become the 46th President and to see Kamala Harris as our first woman Vice-President. But more broadly, inaugurations signal a tradition of a peaceful transfer of power that is over two centuries old," he says.Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton taped a message of unity in honor of Joe Biden's inauguration https://t.co/jw5mUPtHzq pic.twitter.com/NN9pGr4WUoBush, the 43rd US President, says, "The fact that the three of us are standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country. America is a generous country, people of great hearts. All three of us were lucky to be the president of this country."Clinton, 74, and America’s 42nd president says, "This is an unusual thing. We are both trying to come back to normalcy, deal with totally abnormal challenges and do what we do best, which is try to make a more perfect union. It’s an exciting time.”"We have got to not just listen to folks we agree with but folks we don't. One of my fondest memories of the inauguration was the grace and generosity that President Bush showed me, and Laura Bush showed Michelle. It was a reminder that we can have fierce disagreements and yet recognise each other's common humanity and that as Americans we have more in common than what separates us," Obama said.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump skipped the inauguration, a first since Richard Nixon in 1974.If Americans loved their neighbours like they loved themselves, a lot of the division that is there in society would end, Bush says, to which Clinton adds that everybody needs to get off their "high horse" and reach out to their friends and neighbours. "I'm glad you're there. And I wish you well," he says."Mr. President, I am pulling for your success. Your success is our country's success," says Bush while Clinton says he is ready to march with Biden.

21-01-2021||World||UK, EU in spat over diplomatic status of bloc's ambassador||Britain has sparked a post-Brexit spat with the European Union by declining to grant the bloc’s first-ever ambassador to the country full diplomatic status.Joao Vale de Almeida is the 27-nation EU’s envoy to the U.K., which left the bloc last year. But the British government says the EU is an international organization, rather than a country, and has not given Vale de Almeida the full rights accorded to ambassadors under the Vienna Convention, including immunity from taxation and prosecution.The EU says the rest of its 143 delegations around the world have all been given full diplomatic status.“The EU’s status in external relations and its subsequent diplomatic status is amply recognized by countries and international organisations around the world, and we expect the United Kingdom to treat the EU Delegation accordingly and without delay,” European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said Thursday.Britain’s Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, said everyone in the EU delegation would get “the privileges and immunities necessary to allow them to carry out their work,” though he did not say whether that amounted to full diplomatic status.He said the Foreign Office “continue(s) to engage with the EU on the long-term arrangements for the EU delegation in the U.K., and I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome.”Tobias Ellwood, a lawmaker with the governing Conservative Party who heads Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government was being “petty.”“We are better than this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-in-spat-over-diplomatic-status-of-bloc-s-ambassador-101611235775238.html

The findings feed a debate about how Boris Johnson’s administration can best protect segments of the population like the young and lowest paid who have taken the hardest economic hit during the crisis.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have highlighted those concerns in recent weeks and begun talking about measures that could bridge the inequality gap.“The uneven effects of Covid concern me,” Bailey said in a webinar on Wednesday. “It’s clear to me we’ve got to come out of Covid in a way that addresses all parts of the population.”People under the age of 30 and those with household incomes of less than 10,000 pounds ($13,700) were far more likely to be furloughed than the general population, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.Among people unable to work, more than half of the top 20% of earners continued to be paid in full, compared with little more than a quarter of those in the bottom 20%. Self-employed workers and the disabled were more likely to have borrowed 1,000 pounds or more. Meanwhile fewer people were able to save for the year ahead.The findings put pressure on Sunak to act in his annual budget statement, which is due on March 3. With the deficit at its highest in peacetime, there are calls for the better off to shoulder the burden of future tax increases.Separate ONS figures showed the gap between rich and poor was widening even before the pandemic struck.Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, rose to 36.3% in the financial year through March, its highest for a decade. The income share of the richest 1% has increased from 7% to 8.3% since 2011.The inflation-adjusted median income of the poorest fifth of people fell by 3.8% between 2017 and 2020. The richest fifth meanwhile saw their incomes steadily grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-million-people-borrowed-money-to-get-through-pandemic-uk-govt-data-101611235199041.html
21-01-2021||World||Western Spain set to get Europe's largest solar power plant||Spain’s largest utility Iberdrola SA and the French food giant Danone SA sealed an accord to build 590 MW-capacity photo-voltaic plant, the largest in Europe.The 300 million-euro ($364 million) project will be located in the western province of Caceres, Iberdrola said in statement on its website. The utility will provide power to Danone’s 29 supply points for 10 years, starting from April 2022 under a power purchase agreement.Spain is by far Europe’s busiest subsidy-free photo-voltaic market, and leads the sector’s booming growth in the region, according to a BloombergNEF report. It commissioned 2.9 GW last year, four times the 729 MW of capacity added in 2019.The plant will avoid the emission of 245,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, Iberdrola said. Danone’s suppliers in Spain, Graham Packaging and Salvesen Logistica, will also join the project, dubbed Francisco Pizarro after the famous Spanish conquistador.Other Spanish companies have also committed to developing similar projects. In July, oil producer Repsol SA began the construction of its Valdesolar project, a 264-MW photo-voltaic plant with a planned investment of 200 million euros.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-spain-set-to-get-europe-s-largest-solar-power-plant-101611234721740.html
21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to direct agencies to use Defense Production Act in Covid-19 fight||US President Joe Biden will issue an executive order on Thursday directing agencies to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) and other powers to speed up the manufacturing of testing and vaccine supplies and other items needed to fight Covid-19 in the country.According to The Hill, the Biden administration officials signalled they would be "more aggressive" than former President Donald Trump's administration in invoking the DPA, which allows the federal government to force companies to increase the production of critical supplies during national emergencies."Where we can produce more, we will. Where we need to use the Defense Production Act to help more be made, we'll do that too," said Tim Manning, Biden's Covid-19 supply coordinator, in a call with reporters on Wednesday as quoted by The Hill.Manning said that his team has identified 12 "immediate supply shortfalls", that include N-95 masks, isolation gowns, gloves and swabs needed for tests.Officials said that the new administration will also use the DPA for the acceleration in the production of syringes, raw materials used in vaccines, and other items needed to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible."The team will work with the states and the manufacturers to ensure that we're using the DPA as aggressively as needed to accelerate the supply of the vaccine," said Bechara Choucair, Biden's Covid-19 vaccine coordinator.Critics have argued that while the Trump administration used the DPA to increase the supply of ventilators, masks and other supplies, he was not being aggressive enough to close shortages of supplies."President Trump has not used his DPA authority sufficiently enough to award adequate medical supply contracts for the nation's needs. We must immediately do more to re-shore the most in-demand PPE, such as nitrile gloves, nearly all of which are manufactured in China," a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter this week to Biden, urging him to invoke the DPA as quoted by The Hill.A key part of the Biden administration's national strategy for defeating the coronavirus is invoking the DPA.Biden's strategy is centered around seven goals, including restoring trust with the American people; mounting a safe and effective vaccination campaign; expanding masking, testing, data and treatments; building the health care workforce; safely reopening schools, businesses and travel while protecting workers; protecting those most at risk for serious illness, including people of colour; and restoring US leadership globally, the plan stated as cited by The Hill."For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to Covid," said Jeff Zients, Biden's Covid-19 response coordinator."This is a plan that is driven by science data and public health, it's not driven by politics," The Hill quoted him saying.The plan also lays out goals to establish an "effective, comprehensive" and "aggressive" vaccination campaign but did not offer timetables for when shots will be available to the general public."We must do this, equitably, we cannot miss vaccinating communities that are hit hardest by the pandemic. This is going to have to be critical to our success... We must do this, equitably, we cannot miss vaccinating communities that are hit hardest by the pandemic. This is going to have to be critical to our success," Choucair told reporters.The administration had already set a goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within the first 100 days of Biden's first term.The Hill also reported that Biden will also sign executive orders on Thursday increasing federal reimbursement to states and tribes from 75 per cent to 100 per cent of the cost for National Guard personnel and emergency supplies, like PPEs, cleaning and sanitising efforts and opening mass vaccination centers.Biden would also sign another executive order creating a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force, which will provide recommendations to the president for allocating resources and funding in communities that are disproportionately impacted by the pathogen.At least 24.4 million cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-direct-agencies-to-use-defense-production-act-in-covid-19-fight-101611234298956.html

His resignation needs to be approved by parliament.The protests erupted on Wednesday over what some Mongolians saw as the inhumane treatment of a Covid-19 patient and her newborn baby, Montsame said.Video footage showed the patient, still wearing her nightgown and slippers, being relocated with her baby to a specialist quarantine facility run by Mongolia's National Center of Communicable Diseases.The protests triggered the dismissal of senior health officials. Mongolia's deputy prime minister and health minister also tendered their resignations.The incident came amid growing public dissatisfaction with Mongolia's economic situation and a lack of job opportunities.Mongolia, which earned praise from the World Health Organization in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic for its handling of the health crisis, has recently been battling an outbreak caused by an infected driver entering from Russia.The country, with a population of around 3 million, has so far reported 1,584 cases, but no deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mongolian-prime-minister-submits-resignation-after-covid-19-protests-101611232924561.html
21-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s hasty climate regulations may take long to unwind||On January 13, with the nation’s attention riveted on the vote to impeach President Trump again, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule severely limiting its own ability to regulate heat-trapping gases. A little over a week earlier, as would-be insurrectionists were gathering in Washington, DC, the outgoing administration finalized a rule rendering the vast majority of public health data off limits to policymakers.Eleventh-hour executive actions are a hallmark of presidential transitions, and experts see little in the way of lasting impact as President Joe Biden moves from his inauguration on Wednesday into an expected flurry of policy moves from the new White House. Late environmental rules that conflict with Biden’s ambitious climate agenda can mostly be reversed, some just as hastily as they were implemented.“The last-minute regulations were meant to gum up the works for Biden,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director for climate and clean energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that filed numerous lawsuits aiming to block the Trump administration’s agenda. “But they were slow, incompetent, and did things that were illegal. They are already getting their comeuppance in the courts.”Eliminating or weakening regulation was a top priority from the start of the Trump presidency, but the mission took on an urgent focus after Biden’s win. In its last days the Trump administration took aim at major provisions ranging from fuel-efficiency standards in appliances to the rules for cost-benefit analysis under the Clean Air Act.The reversals started almost immediately after Biden took office Wednesday, with the signing a slew of executive orders on climate issues. These included a re-commitment to the Paris climate agreement and a request that federal agencies review any and all Trump policies “that were harmful to public health, damaging to the environment, unsupported by the best available science or otherwise not in the national interest.”While the Paris pact can be re-entered with the stroke of a pen and take effect just 30 days later, other Trump regulations will take substantially longer to unwind.There are three main pathways to undoing the regulatory accomplishments of a previous administration. The quickest is the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to nullify a rule within 60 legislative working days of its passage. Once a rule has been nullified, however, the law prohibits any future regulation that is “substantially the same.” What falls into that category has yet to be tested in the courts, and Democrats in particular have been loath to use congressional review for this reason.“The CRA is bad law. It is a bad way to make public policy,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You could be shooting yourself in the foot.”The other two ways of overturning Trump’s climate policies may be more palatable, even if they also take longer. Anyone with standing can use the courts to block regulations on the grounds that they lack scientific justification or are “arbitrary and capricious.” Andrew deLaski of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said his group has already sued to block a last-minute regulation intended to weaken efficiency standards for dishwashers, and that they’re likely targeting at least one more on water heaters.“The hope is the new administration decides not to defend and settles,” said deLaski, who runs the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “If a court agrees, it could put the rules on a fast track for reversal.”Even a positive court decision could set the Biden administration back. A January 19 ruling, for instance, that overturned an attempt by Trump’s EPA to curtail its own ability to regulate greenhouse gases produced by power plants also left the Biden administration without a policy to govern energy emissions. On the one hand, said Kevin S. Minoli, a former EPA lawyer, this means the incoming administration can make a fresh start. “But it also forces the administration to start over again at square one,” he told Bloomberg Law. “That will leave a regulatory gap as the Biden administration sets out on its plan to address climate change.”The rule-making process itself is the third and final tool the incoming Biden administration will have at its disposal. While it’s possible to simultaneously repeal and replace rules at the same time, the process is notoriously cumbersome and full of delays. It’s not unusual for the whole thing to take years.Doniger of the NRDC argues that new rules would have been unavoidable given Biden’s climate policy aspirations, even compared to Obama’s. “Imagine the Trump administration had done nothing,” he said. “It would still be time to revise and strengthen what had been done before.”Even after rules become finalized, there’s one more gauntlet to run. Deregulation advocates argue that rule-making at federal agencies routinely oversteps constitutional and statutory authority to make new laws. A 1984 Supreme Court decision gives deference to agencies when laws are unclear and scientific expertise is required to meet their mandates. More conservative members of the court, including recently seated Justice Amy Coney Barrett, have strongly hinted an openness to overturning this precedent.“At the end of the day the Trump administration’s attacks on environmental law are unlikely to endure,” said Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. “But it is not going to be that easy to replace them with something better.”The real enduring legacy of the Trump administration on the environment, she said, will be the 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. “They are going to look really skeptically at new levels of regulatory authority,” she said.“The Biden administration is packing its agencies with very smart lawyers and administrators who will be crafting the rules with this court in mind,” Horowitz added, “so it will be an interesting game of cat and mouse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-hasty-climate-regulations-may-take-long-to-unwind-101611231586607.html
21-01-2021||World||Thailand approves AstraZeneca vaccine amid second virus wave||Thailand approved AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, paving the way for the country to begin inoculating its 67 million people amid a resurgence in the coronavirus cases.Thailand’s Food and Drug Administration granted the approval for the vaccine on Thursday, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said by phone. AstraZeneca is the first coronavirus vaccine developer to win approval in Thailand, which also has ordered shots developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.“Now we’ll have to wait for the vaccines to be shipped to Thailand, which we’re speaking with the company about,” Anutin said.Thai government has ordered 61 million shots of AstraZeneca vaccine, which has won approvals for emergency use in countries including India, the UK and Brazil. The regulatory nod will also open the door for imports by private Thai companies for administering the doses to people who can afford to pay.Thailand, which was relatively successful last year in containing the pathogen, is betting on wider availability of the vaccine to revive its tourism-reliant economy that’s devastated by the pandemic. The Southeast Asian nation has set a target of inoculating at least 50% of the nation’s population before the end of 2021 as it battles a new wave of infections that’s seen total cases almost triple in the past month to almost 13,000.The government has so far approved plans to purchase a total of 63 million doses and the National Vaccine Institute is in talks with several manufacturers for additional supplies for delivery as early as this quarter. The orders include the AstraZeneca vaccines, some of which will be produced locally by Siam Bioscience Ltd. through technology transfer.The first batch of locally-produced AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be ready for distribution in May, following the rollout of 2 million doses of Sinovac vaccine starting in February. The Chinese vaccine is expected to be approved next month, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-approves-astrazeneca-vaccine-amid-second-virus-wave-101611229909696.html
21-01-2021||World||Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg calls for improvement in US infrastructure||President Joe Biden's nominee to head the US Transportation Department will tell a US Senate panel on Thursday the United States must improve its infrastructure."We also have a lot of work to do to improve the infrastructure in this country, a mission that will not only keep more people safe, but also grow our economy as we look to the future," former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will say, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.Biden put Buttigieg - a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination last year - in charge of the department that oversees aviation, highways, vehicles, pipelines and transit.In April 2019, then President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2 trillion over a decade - but the president never proposed any new revenue source to pay for the upgrades - and never made it a priority."Infrastructure Week" became a long-running joke in the Trump administration as other unrelated events often overtook the effort to rebuild roads, bridges and airports."Now is the time, and we have a real chance to deliver for the American people," Buttigieg will say in his testimony.Biden said last week he will ask Congress in February for "historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy."Biden has also vowed to boost fuel economy standards that were slashed under Trump and take steps to increase the number of electric vehicles on American roads.Congress has abandoned a decades-old policy of largely using fuel tax revenue to fund infrastructure repairs.Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, according to the Government Accountability Office.Congress failed again last year to approve a multi-year surface transportation bill and instead passed a one-year extension that expires Sept. 30.Congress has not boosted the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax since 1993. That tax is now worth just 10.2 cents after adjusting for inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/transportation-nominee-pete-buttigieg-calls-for-improvement-in-us-infrastructure-101611228231076.html
21-01-2021||World||Now a private citizen, Donald Trump faces an uncertain legal future||Donald Trump issued a list of pardons during his final hours as US president but did not include himself, his children, or personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, even though advisers said he had privately debated the extraordinary step of a self-pardon.Here is how the decision could impact his potential civil and criminal liability as a private citizen:What may have guided Trump's decision not to pardon himself and members of his inner circle?Presidential pardons can only accomplish so much. They can shut down prosecutions by the US Department of Justice, a federal agency. But investigations brought by state-level prosecutors, such as the criminal probe Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is leading into whether Trump's businesses engaged in fraud, would still be active.Vance has not charged anyone with criminal wrongdoing and Trump has said the investigation is politically motivated.A self-pardon would have only increased calls to prosecute Trump on a state level, said Daniel R. Alonso, a lawyer at the Buckley firm and Vance's former deputy in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.It could also have fueled efforts to hold Trump accountable through civil lawsuits brought by private litigants, such as family members of people who died during the Jan. 6 storming of the US Capitol by Trump followers, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.Before the attack, as lawmakers were certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s Nov. 3 election victory, Republican Trump took to a stage near the White House and exhorted a crowd of supporters repeatedly to “fight” - using the word more than 20 times - and “not take it any longer.” He also called on his followers to march on the Capitol, the seat of government."With a pardon comes at least the veneer of an admission of guilty," said Levinson. "In a way, I think pardoning himself and his family is almost like a taunt. It would have said 'try to come and get me,' and would have accelerated litigation and investigation."There is also considerable doubt among scholars about whether a self-pardon would hold up in court. Many experts said it violates the basic principle that no person should be the judge in his or her own case.Self-serving pardons might also have drawn the ire of Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who will soon have a trial to determine whether Trump's Jan. 6 speech was incitement, the charge in his impeachment by the House of Representatives.The trial could result in Trump being disqualified from future office.Would a pardon for Giuliani have helped Trump?The answer is likely yes, though hard to speculate, legal experts said.Giuliani had dealings with Ukrainians on Trump's behalf when he was trying to dig up dirt on Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump's efforts led to his first impeachment by the House in December 2019 and the Republican-majority Senate acquitted him in February 2020.In November 2019, federal prosecutors in New York sought records of payments to Giuliani as part of an active criminal investigation, according to a grand jury subpoena seen by Reuters.Prosecutors were investigating money laundering, wire fraud, campaign finance violations, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, according to the subpoena.Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing.The scope and status of the investigation is unclear, and Giuliani has not been charged with wrongdoing. It is also unclear if he knows anything about Trump that would be valuable to prosecutors.But not receiving a pardon makes it more likely that Giuliani would cooperate with prosecutors and implicate Trump if charged, said Jessica Roth, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a former federal prosecutor."Without the possibility of a pardon, the prospect of a conviction and potential prison sentence becomes more real, providing an incentive to cooperate to receive more favorable treatment," Roth said.Trump may have decided against pardoning Giuliani because he lost a series of lawsuits brought on behalf of Trump attempting to invalidate Biden as the election winner, Levinson said.Could Trump have pardoned himself and others in secret?It's possible, said former prosecutor Alonso.Pardons are usually made public. But the Constitution does not require this, and Trump could secretly issue preemptive pardons to family members and associates, or even himself, said Alonso.The Presidential Records Act requires documentation of presidential decisions but the law lacks a mechanism for enforcing it, Alonso said. A secret pardon might only become public if the recipient were eventually charged with a federal crime and invoked the pardon as a defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-a-private-citizen-donald-trump-faces-an-uncertain-legal-future-101611229001436.html
21-01-2021||World||Ex-chief of China’s aircraft carrier programme to be held for graft||The former chief of China’s multi-billion dollar aircraft carrier programme and head of one of the largest shipping companies, will be arrested on charges of corruption, the state media reported on Thursday.Hu Wenming was expelled from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) last year for severely violating party discipline and being suspected of taking bribes and misfeasance.On Thursday, it was announced that the Supreme People’s Procuratorate had decided to arrest Hu, 62, also the former party chief and chairman of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), over suspicion of taking bribes and abuse of power. The investigation was completed by China’s top disciplinary authority and his case has been transferred to the Supreme People’s Procuratorate for prosecution, an official media report said.As the chief commander of China’s ambitious and rapidly developing aircraft carrier programme, Hu oversaw the development of the country’s first domestically developed aircraft carrier and the second one, named “Shandong” when it was commissioned into the Chinese Navy in December 2019. “On August 30, 2019, Hu retired from his position as CSIC’s Party chief and chairman, the company announced on its website. Investigation into his bribery case was announced in May, 2020, the tabloid Global Times reported.Details of the charges against him include the allegation that he had “lost faith, gone astray from the CPC spirit, engaged in superstitious activities, resisted the investigation and violated party discipline by accepting banquets and bribes”.Hu was accused of violating CPC rules and regulations by “illegally playing golf, visiting private clubs…and taking gifts and gratuities while arranging for subordinate units to pay expenses that should be paid by him personally”.Hu had worked in several major Chinese state-owned arms companies including military aircraft developer and manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), armoured vehicle and munition developer China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO), China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and eventually CSIC, according to the People’s Daily. CSIC was heavily involved in the research, development and manufacturing of military vessels, including for the People’s Liberation Army.Hu retired from CSIC shortly before it merged back with its parent company, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), forming one of the world’s largest shipbuilders.The CSSC is responsible for developing aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, warships including the Type 055 large destroyers and Type 075 amphibious warships, as well as commercial vessels, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchief-of-china-s-aircraft-carrier-programme-to-be-held-for-graft-101611228328879.html

The Bank of England released its figures from its payment systems to the statistics office to provide more up-to-date information on how the pandemic is affecting the economy.The result gives a taste of the scale of the slump in consumer spending after the government tightened lockdowns to control the coronavirus, raising the risk of a double-dip contraction in the first quarter after the deepest recession in centuries. The ONS will publish retail sales figures on Friday for the month of December, when shops were open for two weeks during a brief loosening of restrictions.Retail footfall was a third of the year-earlier period last week. The proportion of the workforce on furlough leave in which the government subsidizes their wages rose 2 points to 16% in the period to January 10.Some 3% of firms had permanently shut down between December 28 and January 10. Of those still trading, more than a quarter said turnover had fallen by at least a fifth compared to normal levels for this time of year.A separate central bank survey revealed signs of mounting financial distress, with lenders expecting higher default rates on both secured and unsecured loans to households in the first quarter.The BOE’s quarterly Credit Conditions Survey painted a similar picture for the corporate sector. Small businesses found it more difficult to obtain credit at the end of 2020 and investment plans were subdued.Still, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said Wednesday that the economy is adapting to the restrictions and that lockdowns don’t seem to have as big an impact as they did earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-card-purchase-data-shows-35-drop-in-consumer-spending-101611226101676.html
21-01-2021||World||Google and its ethics AI team row: What we know so far||Google has recently locked out artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Margaret Mitchell. This is not the first controversy between the company and its ethics team to have surfaced.What has happened so far:1. Margaret Mitchell is the second AI researcher in the ethics team of Google to have been plugged out of corporate access. The company has said she will be 'locked out for a few days'.2. Margaret Mitchell is the co-lead of Google ethical AI team, responsible for developing the company's technology in a socially responsible manner.3. Google had earlier sacked notable AI ethicist and outspoken critic Timnit Gebru. Mitchell has been a vocal supporter of Gebru on social media and had questioned Google on firing her.4. Gebru claimed to have been abruptly fired by the tech giant after the company demanded retraction of her research paper that questioned the facial recognition technology used by Google. Gebru co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini, as per which there were more errors in identification of black people in comparison to white people, because of largely white data sets used in the algorithm, reported The Verge.5. Google has drawn major criticism on the move of sudden investigation of Mitchell and suspension of her system access.6. Gebru on the latest development had said, "What happens to Mitchell will continue to shape attitudes toward corporate self-governance and speculation about the voracity of research produced with Big Tech funding. "She's not fired **yet**. But apparently they've told her she will be locked out for at least a few days. https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM7.

21-01-2021||World||China congratulates Biden, welcomes US return to WHO, Paris Accord||China on Thursday congratulated US President Joe Biden on his inauguration and called for a reset in Beijing-Washington relations as Donald Trump’s term, marred by a range of bilateral disputes, came to an end.Beijing said it welcomed news that the US would rejoin the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris climate accord, as Biden made his first efforts to pivot Washington back to a central role in global leadership.“With cooperation from both sides, the better angels in China-US relations will beat the evil forces,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a ministry briefing on Thursday.Hua said Biden had used the word “unity” several times in his inauguration speech, and that it was “precisely what is needed currently in US-China relations”.“China and the US had experienced a very difficult time in the past, and the two sides indeed deserve a better future, so we wish Biden a successful presidency,” Hua said. The Trump administration, especially secretary of state Mike Pompeo, had burned many bridges that needed to be rebuilt, and damaged many roads that needed to be fixed. “The two governments should have courage to listen to and respect each other. If we are determined to fix it, it can be fixed,” Hua said.Hours earlier, the Chinese foreign ministry sanctioned Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former Trump, accusing them of “hatred” against the Chinese and carrying out “crazy” moves to harm its interests.The announcement came while Biden was taking oath of office in Washington.The sanctions seemed to signal Beijing’s anger against Pompeo – routinely ridiculed by the Chinese government and state media – who on his final day in office said that China had committed genocide against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The strongly worded statement, and its timing, also signalled Beijing’s anger and frustration against the Trump administration. “Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs, undermined China’s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations,’’ the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.“The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests. China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues,” the statement added.Besides Pompeo, the sanctioned former officials included trade chief Peter Navarro, national security advisers Robert O’Brien and John Bolton, health secretary Alex Azar, UN ambassador Kelly Craft and former top Trump aide Steve Bannon.“These individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China,” the foreign ministry said.On Wednesday, the foreign ministry had dismissed the charges of genocide against the Uighur community in Xinjiang.Responding to the Xinjiang allegations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the regular ministry briefing: “Pompeo has made so many lies in recent years, and this is just another bold-faced lie.”“This US politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughingstock and a clown.”Hua said China hoped “the new administration will work together with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle differences and conduct more win-win cooperation in more sectors.”“We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment on Xinjiang issues, among other issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-congratulates-biden-welcomes-us-return-to-who-paris-accord-101611227188361.html

The bloc will consider special privileges for people who have been inoculated and look into whether to apply travel restrictions. Earlier this week, Merkel threatened to impose border controls without a coordinated response with European neighbors.The EU will also seek ways to speed up vaccination programs. Merkel said intensive talks are under way to accelerate production of the shots.Germany extended lockdown curbs to Feb. 14 and sharpened select measures on Tuesday, but stopped short of a nationwide curfew and a complete closure of schools amid resistance from some state officials.While contagion rates in Europe’s largest economy have declined to the lowest since early November, levels remain more than double a government target. Authorities are concerned that fast-spreading strains could spark a surge like in Britain and Ireland. The risks were underscored on Thursday with Germany’s coronavirus fatalities surpassing 50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-calls-for-european-solidarity-in-fight-against-covid19-101611226570388.html
21-01-2021||World||Twitter makes Joe Biden's account start with zero followers||The micro-blogging site, Twitter cleared out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts after US President Biden was sworn in on Wednesday, rather than moving the accounts' current followers over to the new administration.According to The Verge, Twitter had said in December that the accounts for @VP, @FLOTUS, @PressSec, @Cabinet, and @LaCasaBlanca would also have their followers wiped.Meanwhile, the @POTUS, @VP and @WhiteHouse accounts are rapidly gathering new followers.Initially, there was a conflict between the Biden camp and Twitter about whether adherents would move over.This is a reversal from what Twitter did in 2017 when the Trump administration took over records from the Obama administration. Back then, Twitter basically copied the current accounts, making a chronicle of Obama-time tweets and followers and building another arrangement of accounts for the approaching organization that held all those followers without any of the tweets.Twitter didn't say why it changed the policy this time. Twitter told The Verge that "It is the ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers."Biden's team seems to be unhappy about this change in policy, given the significant digital advantage they'll be losing. Rob Flaherty, Biden's digital director said the transition team "pushed back and we were told this was unequivocal."Twitter is a major communication tool for the president. The account @POTUS had 33 million followers, @WhiteHouse had 26 million, @FLOTUS had 16 million, and @PressSec had 6 million as of December.As per The Verge, former US President Donald Trump's @POTUS account will be renamed @POTUS45 and 'frozen as-is'. He would have originally been in control of @realDonaldTrump, albeit with fewer protections than before, if Twitter had not banned him for inciting violence on January 8th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-makes-joe-biden-s-account-start-with-zero-followers-101611226396709.html

21-01-2021||World||‘Found only small chunks of remains’: Why Indonesia crash was the 'worst'||Bayu Wardoyo tends to skip the 6 a.m. breakfast of Indonesian fried rice served to divers on the ship searching for wreckage of the Sriwijaya Air passenger jet that crashed in the Java Sea on Jan. 9. He prefers coffee, light snacks and some fruit to prepare for the long day ahead.Later in the morning, kitted out in a black wetsuit and weighed down by diving paraphernalia, he boards a speedboat and heads out under heavy monsoon clouds to the day’s search area. Once there, Wardoyo attaches his scuba regulator and rolls overboard into waters filled with fresh tragedy.Also Read | Explained: Why is Indonesia prone to plane crashesIndonesia has suffered several air disasters over the past decade, and Wardoyo has been involved in more than his fair share of undersea searches. The 49-year-old worked on recovery efforts after an AirAsia jetliner carrying 162 people went down in the Java Sea in December 2014. Less than four years later, he returned to the same waters to hunt for wreckage and bodies in the wake of a Lion Air crash that claimed 189 lives. Now he’s back there again, after Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 plunged into the ocean with 62 people on board. Among them were seven children and three infants.He’s never seen a crash as devastating as this.“This Sriwijaya crash is the worst. The aircraft body is totally destroyed and scattered,” Wardoyo said by text message. “We’ve only found small chunks of human remains. On the Lion Air crash we still found big pieces and the AirAsia crash we found almost a complete human body.”SJ182 plummeted close to 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) in 14 seconds shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on a stormy Saturday afternoon. Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee confirmed that the Boeing Co. 737-500’s engines were running when the plane hit the sea at high speed, indicating the aircraft was in one piece upon impact. What triggered the violent dive remains a mystery.One possibility investigators are looking into is the pilots losing control because a malfunctioning throttle was producing more thrust in one of the engines, according to a person familiar with the situation. The device had been having problems on previous flights, the person said.With the search in its second week, hopes are fading that the cockpit voice recorder -- a crucial jigsaw piece in finding out what unfolded -- will ever be found. Divers retrieved the casing of the so-called black box on Friday, but the memory chip that records communication between pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit had broken loose.The flight-data recorder was recovered last week and will provide clues as to whether this was a problem with the Boeing plane, pilot error, a freak weather occurrence or something else entirely. But the investigation is hamstrung without the other black box. The locator beacons of both were dislodged when the plane smashed into the water, an impact so hard that according to Queensland-based air-safety specialist Geoffrey Dell, it would’ve been like hitting concrete.With the AirAsia crash back in 2014, “the aircraft body was still intact -- only broken into three pieces so we had to pull bodies from inside the aircraft,” Wardoyo said.“The Lion Air crash was different, the aircraft body disintegrated but we could still find big pieces of the fuselage. Sriwijaya is the worst,” he said.Indonesian authorities extended the search period, prolonging the divers’ stay on the command vessel off the coast to Jakarta’s north, but it is due to finish Thursday. Wardoyo is leading a group of 15 civilian professional divers with various qualifications such as deep-sea exploration and cave diving. One is a police officer and diving instructor. The team of volunteers is supporting specialist divers from the National Search and Rescue Agency, or Basarnas. He’s not optimistic about recovering the rest of the voice recorder.“Since the aircraft body is totally disintegrated to very small pieces and the sea floor is very thick mud, it would be very hard to collect anything after more than seven days,” Wardoyo said. “It’s almost impossible to find the memory or other piece of the recorder.”An official from Indonesia’s NTSC said Tuesday that data from the cockpit voice recorder was needed to support findings from the flight-data analysis. Representatives from Boeing, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and General Electric Co. have traveled to Indonesia to help with the investigation. A preliminary report on the crash should be published in 30 days, local authorities said Tuesday.Bad weather and high seas in Indonesia’s monsoon season have hampered recovery efforts. “Big swells, high winds and rain wouldn’t affect the divers below, but it makes it difficult for the surface team operating dinghies and rubber boats,” Wardoyo said. “It also makes it harder for divers to transfer to the mother ship if the weather is bad.”The command vessel had to return to shore early Wednesday after it was damaged in a collision with another boat at about 1 a.m. in heavy swell and strong winds, according to Wardoyo. The divers returned to the crash site later that morning on a smaller boat.While diving carries some risk regardless of the circumstances, it’s amplified on a search mission, Wardoyo said. Shark attacks aren’t an issue, but decompression sickness, drowning and even heart attacks from overexertion caused by lifting heavy pieces of wreckage in strong currents are among the dangers, he said.“We don’t and won’t take credit for doing this, but at least we can help others with our expertise,” Wardoyo said. “Anyone else would do the same.”The challenging conditions may prompt authorities to use other means to collect aircraft debris instead of relying on divers, according to Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman. “They may use vacuum pumps or dredging once all the victims have been identified or there a no more human remains at the scene,” he said.Wardoyo, who lives with his wife in Jakarta, has been involved in the search since the day after the crash. At sea, the teams wake early, at around 5 a.m., and a briefing is held on the day’s plans after breakfast. Wardoyo runs those meetings along with the commander of the Basarnas specialist diving team. Weather permitting, they head to the search area at 8 or 9 a.m. on rubber boats or rigid inflatables.On good days, visibility underwater is three to five meters, but this week it dropped to one meter or less, Wardoyo said. In the aftermath of the crash, Indonesian officials briefed the media on the number of bags containing body parts and plane wreckage being brought ashore. Members of Wardoyo’s team, in line with Basarnas protocol, wear surgical gloves underneath diving gloves for handling human remains.“It’s not nice for us, but we always think about the families who lost their loved ones,” Wardoyo said. “It’s not easy, we have to move inch by inch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/found-only-small-chunks-of-remains-why-indonesia-crash-was-the-worst-101611219802317.html

21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden's inaugural address written by Indian-American earns praise for its powerful message||US President Joe Biden's powerful inaugural speech, penned by Vinay Reddy, has received glowing tributes for its meticulous crafting and emphasis on the importance of democracy, unity and hope in the midst of challenging times.Reddy - an Indian-American from Telangana who wrote the speech that outlined Biden’s goals for his administration, focusing on healing from the current state of division in national politics - has been praised for his “calming” and “inspiring” words.Here are some of the memorable quotes from Biden’s speech:"This is America’s day, this is democracy’s day, the day of history and hope. Today we celebrate a triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause. We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. At this hour my friends, Democracy has prevailed.""For without unity, there's no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only state of chaos...this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge...unity is the path forward.”"Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.""Here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That’s what we do for one another."About halfway through his inauguration speech, President Biden said something very important about the work of Washington - and how he envisions his presidency."Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path," Biden insisted, adding, "Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war"."Hear me out as we move forward,” Biden said at one point in his speech, vowing to be a “president for all Americans”, while asserting: "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue”.Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, described Biden’s inaugural speech as “modest, austere, grave, calming, cleansing” and “inspiring” in a tweet, while other commentators and media columnists said the president “gave the speech the moment demanded.”"Biden’s speech is about appealing to ‘our better angels’, ‘history, faith, and reason’, ‘dignity’, ‘respect’, ‘unity’. It’s literally a rebuttal to Trump’s 'American carnage' Inaugural address," journalist Matt Fuller tweeted."Joe Biden gave the speech the moment demanded. Well done,” Time magazine columnist David French tweeted."Biden is meeting the moment here by being direct about the challenges we face, the gaslighting, the viciousness and the need to come together. Hell of a speech,” said Tommy Vietor, former NSC spokesman for President Obama said.Last month, Biden named his long-time associate Reddy as his speechwriter.Reddy serves as a speechwriter on the Biden-Harris Transition and was the Senior Advisor and Speechwriter for the Biden-Harris Campaign. He previously served as chief speechwriter to former Vice President Biden in the second term of the Obama-Biden White House, after which, he worked as Vice President of Strategic Communications at the National Basketball Association.During the Obama-Biden administration, he also served as senior speechwriter at the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, deputy speechwriter for the Obama-Biden re-election campaign, and speechwriter for his home state Senator, Sherrod Brown of Ohio.Reddy grew up in Dayton, Ohio, the second one of the three sons in an immigrant family and is a product of Ohio public schools from kindergarten to Miami University to The Ohio State University College of Law. He currently lives in New York with his wife and their two daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-inaugural-address-written-by-indian-american-earns-praise-for-its-powerful-message-101611220118164.html

Only 6% of companies had female CEOs, the association said, though that marked an improvement from 4.7% in 2019.The study said women were hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic, suffering higher unemployment and greater stress juggling work and family, but did not discuss its impact on the gender diversity scores.The United Nations has set a 2030 goal for achieving gender equality and several EU countries, including its largest member Germany, have laws promoting it. Still, one report estimated that at current path, the bloc was at least 60 years away from accomplishing that goal.Companies from Norway, France, Britain, Finland and Sweden led the rankings, with Switzerland and newly represented Poland at the bottom of the table.Three real state companies added to the STOXX 600 index in 2020, British groups Assura and Grainger, and Sweden's Wihlborgs Fastigheter AB, led with a perfect score.Six of the tracked companies had no women on their boards, executive boards or committees, including two from Germany - Nemetschek and Rational - the study showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-firms-improve-diversity-scores-in-pandemic-year-study-101611219866633.html
21-01-2021||World||Indonesia air crash: Boeing jet’s throttle becomes focus in probe||Indonesian investigators probing the Jan. 9 crash of a Sriwijaya Air flight are looking at the possibility that a malfunctioning automatic throttle could have led to the pilots losing control, according to a person familiar with the investigation.The autothrottle was producing more thrust in one of the Boeing Co. 737-500’s two engines than the other shortly before the plane carrying 62 people crashed into the Java Sea, said the person, who isn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The device had been having problems on previous flights, the person said.Issues involving the autothrottle on the 737 have led to incidents in the past and a similar malfunction on another aircraft model was a cause of a fatal crash in 1995 in Romania.Nurcahyo Utomo, the lead investigator at Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, confirmed that a malfunctioning throttle was “one of the factors that we are looking at, but I can’t say at this point that it’s a factor for the crash or there was a problem with it.”Utomo’s team is working with engineers from Boeing to review the data from the aircraft’s flight-data recorder that was retrieved from the seabed last week. Rescuers are still trying to locate the memory module of the plane’s cockpit-voice recorder, which broke apart upon impact.Unequal thrust from the engines can cause a plane to turn or even roll onto its side and descend abruptly, if it’s not handled properly. Pilots must compensate by manually setting the power or taking other actions.If the autothrottle failure proves central to the probe, it’s likely to put the focus on pilot actions and training as well as how the airline maintained the plane.“Large thrust asymmetry is rare, but pilots are trained to notice this and prevent loss of control,” Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said. “Investigators will determine to what extent asymmetry occurred and look into other factors that let it become a loss of control situation.”Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 abruptly nosedived more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) in about 15 seconds just minutes after takeoff in heavy rain from Jakarta, according to tracker Flightradar24. All aboard died.Boeing’s 737-500 model first flew in 1989 and, according to tracking website Planespotters.net, the particular aircraft that crashed earlier this month entered service in May 1994. The family of jets belongs to an older model than the 737 Max that was involved in two other deadly accidents, including one off the coast of Indonesia, in 2018 and 2019 and that led to a global grounding.Indonesia’s NTSC hasn’t issued any details about what may have led to the crash. It said Tuesday it was planning on releasing preliminary findings within 30 days of the accident. Both engines appear to have been functioning prior to the plane hitting the water, according to the NTSC.Indonesian publication Tempo reported in recent days that there had been recurring malfunctions of the plane’s auto-throttle system prior to the crash.Like an autopilot, an autothrottle on the 737-500 can be used by pilots to set the speed automatically, thereby reducing their workload and wear on the engines.Twin-engine jetliners such as the 737 are designed to fly on a single engine during an emergency, so an autothrottle failure that produced unequal thrust shouldn’t have been enough to take down the plane by itself.However, a severe case of unequal thrust can cause a variety of issues with a plane’s controllability. If an aircraft is in clouds or pilots aren’t closely monitoring the plane’s condition, it can get severely out of control before crews respond.In 2001, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered operators of the family of jets including the 737-500 to replace the autothrottle computer after reports of unequal thrust. While there’s no indication this specific issue occurred in the recent accident, it illustrates how it could create a safety hazard.Boeing had years earlier issued instructions for how pilots should correct the problem -- known as a procedure -- but multiple incidents continued to occur in which crews failed to recognize what was happening soon enough and FAA said more specific repairs were needed.“This procedure does not take into account human factors that may result in the flightcrew failing to recognize an abnormality that develops over an extended period of time, resulting in an excessive bank angle for the airplane,” the FAA said in the 2001 notice to pilots.Out of eight incidents in which pilots didn’t respond properly, two aircraft rolled more than 40 degrees, according to the agency.Unequal thrust on an Airbus SE A310 and a pilot’s inadequate response caused a Tarom airlines flight to crash near Bucharest in 1995, according to Romanian investigators. All 60 aboard died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-air-crash-boeing-jet-s-throttle-becomes-focus-in-probe-101611219911671.html

Health workers in white protective gear took temperatures beside mounded earth and tents as part of Covid-19 precautions.About 600 people are involved in the rescue, with as many as 25 ambulances waiting at the scene, as well as neurosurgeons, trauma specialists and psychologists.A Reuters team saw fire trucks and cars coming and going through a checkpoint on an approach road.China's mines are among the world's deadliest. In December, 23 people died after being trapped in a coal mine in the southwestern city of Chongqing, with one survivor rescued after more than 30 hours of efforts. That had been the region's second fatal accident in just over two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-rescuers-hope-to-drill-shaft-to-free-21-miners-trapped-for-11-days-101611219413791.html

It also doesn’t have a well developed vaccine industry, and authorities are now grappling with the possibility of having to acquire doses at significantly higher prices.On Tuesday, Khan directed the Cabinet committee on procurement to speed up the process for acquiring vaccines. This came days after Pakistan’s regulatory authority approved the emergency use of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Sinopharm vaccine made by state-run China National Pharmaceutical Group.In early December, Pakistan approved $150 million in funding to buy vaccines, initially to cover the most vulnerable 5% of the population, including frontline health workers and people above the age of 65.Also Watch | India sends vaccines to Nepal & Bangladesh; govt says ready to help others tooThis was almost a month after Bangladesh’s drugmaker Beximco Pharma signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million doses of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine. These doses would be in addition to the two million doses of Covishield provided by India to Bangladesh on Thursday as a gift.Also Read: Bhutan, Maldives first to benefit from India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’There has also been no announcement by Pakistan’s “iron brother” ally China about assistance in the supply of vaccines.Given its troubled relationship with India and reluctance to cooperate even on issues such as the pandemic, Pakistan has not reached out to India for help with vaccines, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.It also doesn’t figure in the list of nine neighbouring and partner countries, including Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius and Seychelles, to whom India is providing vaccines as grant assistance.Also Read: UAE Air Force to help 3 Rafale fighters reach India, 7 more in AprilAuthorities in Islamabad are now looking to acquire vaccines either through commercial sales or under the Covax facility of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to which the Serum Institute is committed to supplying at least 200 million doses this year.Pakistani authorities are now faced with the possibility of having to pay as much as $6 to $7 a dose if they opt for the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the country’s sole authorised distributor of the vaccine is currently unable to give a timeline for deliveries, the Dawn newspaper reported on Thursday.“Since the government has allowed [the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine] and given us the nod to import the consignments, we have estimated that it would be available to the government for something between US$6 and US$7,” said Usman Ghani of Sindh Medical Stores, one of Pakistan’s biggest importers of vaccines and pharmaceutical products.“The offer has formally and clearly been made to both governments [federal and provincial], but it is a difficult question to answer when it would be made available. Frankly speaking, we don’t have exact idea about this right now.”Ghani also pointed to another key factor – the Indian manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine will first meet the needs of the Indian government, and then the needs of Gavi and other countries such as Bangladesh that concluded commercial agreements in advance.“We have very cordial relations with Serum Institute of India and we would try our best to procure it as early as possible,” he said.Pakistan has so far recorded nearly 530,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 11,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-faces-dilemma-of-sourcing-covid-19-vaccines-101611219687725.html
21-01-2021||World||Amid crippling sanctions, Iran traders seek lifeline in Iraq||Piles of plush carpets line the floors of a northern Iraq shopping center hosting traders from neighboring Iran who hope the spangle of their ornate handicrafts might offer a lifeline out of poverty.In their own country, the economy is in tatters amid crippling U.S. sanctions.“Our money is so devalued, so when we come to this side — apart from the cultural exchange that we share — from a financial perspective it's more profitable for us,” said Iranian Ramiyar Parwiz, the organizer of the exhibition who is originally from Sanandaj. “The money we receive … whether in dollars or dinars has a higher value on our side and it's worth a lot." At least 24 businesses from 15 Iranian cities set up shop this week in the city of Dohuk in the Kurdish-run northern region of Iraq. From Sanandaj to Bijar, they brought luxurious carpets. From Isfahan, Yazd and Hamadan, precious gems, copper and pottery.Iran is among Iraq's largest trading partners and this cooperation has deepened since 2018 amid the Trump administration's maximalist policy on Iran that has seen the U.S. pull out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and levy punishing sanctions on the country.Tens of thousands of Iranian pilgrims visit holy sites in Najaf and Karbala every year, boosting Iraq's fledgling tourism sector. Over 100 trucks ferry construction materials, food, medicine and appliances into Iraq every day.The dependence on Iraqi markets has only deepened as economic conditions worsen in Iran. U.S. sanctions bar American companies and foreign firms from dealing with Iran affecting Iran's energy, shipping and financial sectors, causing foreign investment to dry up.Oil exports have been hardest hit and Iran's economy contracted with dreary forecasts for the future. Unemployment rose and rural populations were disproportionately affected.The exhibition of Iranian businesses is typically held every year in the city of Sulimaniyah, which borders Iran. This is the first year the traders have ventured to Dohuk, which shares closer economic ties to neighboring Turkey, in hopes of enticing new customers and creating greater demand for Iranian goods.Parwiz said the Dohuk venture was the result of desperation.“There is huge pressure on people (in Iran), and the cost of living is unimaginably high,” he said. “We can't afford to buy anything, we cannot even afford to buy medicine.” For Iranian businessmen experiencing difficult times, Iraq has always offered hope for respite.Haji Tousi, a businessman from Mashhad, sells his fine carpets at a lower price than local Iraqi traders. He knows the dollars he takes back home to Iran will keep him afloat. “The type of carpet we are selling here is $200, whereas the same carpet in the market here is sold for $300-350,” he said.But, to the dismay of many Iranian traders, the impact of Iraq's own economic troubles was in plain sight: The exhibition attracts crowds of visitors but many can't afford the marked-down items.“There are many visitors who have warmly welcomed this expo but economic problems have kept them from (purchasing) ,” said Maryam Mradi, a businesswoman from Sanadaj.Iraq is grappling with an unprecedented liquidity crisis brought on by low oil prices. That has slashed state coffers in half and led the government to borrow from the central bank's foreign currency reserves to make salary payments.Some of the Iranian vendors were skeptical their goods would be well received in Dohuk and other areas of Iraq, where Turkish brands dominate shopping isles.“The people's demand is mainly for Turkish goods,” said Shireen Mohammed, a local resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-crippling-sanctions-iran-traders-seek-lifeline-in-iraq-101611218791141.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden administration calls China sanctions on Trump officials 'unproductive'||China's move to sanction former Trump administration officials was "unproductive and cynical", a spokeswoman for President Joe Biden's National Security Council said on Wednesday, urging Americans from both parties to condemn the action.Around the time Biden was sworn in as president on Wednesday China announced sanctions against "lying and cheating" outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former President Donald Trump, a striking repudiation of its relationship with Washington under Trump.China's foreign ministry said Pompeo and the others had "planned, promoted and executed" moves that had interfered in its internal affairs. It banned the ex-officials and immediate family members from entering China, and restricted companies associated with them from doing business in the country."Imposing these sanctions on Inauguration Day is seemingly an attempt to play to partisan divides," Biden's National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement to Reuters."Americans of both parties should criticize this unproductive and cynical move. President Biden looks forward to working with leaders in both parties to position America to out-compete China," Horne said.Pompeo, who unleashed a barrage of measures against China in his final weeks in office, declared on Tuesday that China had committed "genocide and crimes against humanity" against Uighur Muslims."This so-called determination by Pompeo is nothing but paper," a Chinese foreign Ministery spokesperson said in response. "This U.S. politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughing stock and a clown."China has repeatedly rejected accusations of abuse in its Xinjiang region, where a United Nations panel has said at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims had been detained in camps.Biden's choice to succeed Pompeo, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday he agreed with Pompeo's assessment.He told his Senate confirmation hearing there was "no doubt" China posed the most significant challenge to the United States of any nation, and that he believed there was a very strong foundation to build a bipartisan U.S. policy to stand up to Beijing.(Reporting by Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Tom Hogue and Raju Gopalakrishnan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-calls-china-sanctions-on-trump-officials-unproductive-101611218808410.html
21-01-2021||World||Hungary becomes first EU nation to approve Russia's Sputnik V vaccine||Hungary became the first European Union nation to approve Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine as Prime Minister Viktor Orban takes a pre-election risk to accelerate the country’s exit from the coronavirus crisis.Hungary’s drug regulator granted emergency approval for Russia’s Sputnik V, the agency’s director, Matyas Szentivanyi, told state television late Wednesday. The decision followed pressure by Orban to fast-track it and skirt the EU, which has yet to authorize the vaccine.While Orban is regularly criticized in the EU for his cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party leadership, he may only be the first rather than the sole western leader to secure alternative supplies from the east amid the slow roll-out of western vaccines that have left governments exasperated. The government in Budapest is also considering procuring a Chinese vaccine from Sinopharm.Like many of its EU peers, Hungary has faced public skepticism of the vaccines and so far has administered them for only a little more than 1% of its population amid a trickle of doses from Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc.The government has warned that without a ramp-up, curbs like an evening curfew and the closure of some businesses could be in effect through the summer.Orban is also under the gun before 2022 parliamentary elections, which are expected to be the closest in years after the opposition united against the four-term leader. He has pledged to protect the living standards of Hungarians, a tall order after his cabinet projected a 6.4% economic decline for 2020.Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto will be in Moscow on Friday where he may agree to a large purchase of the Russian vaccine. Despite the emergency approval -- which is for six months and an option to extend that for another six -- Hungary’s health authority is still reviewing the Russian version in tests, and mass inoculations may happen only after its sign-off, state television reported.Hungary is also ready to purchase more than a million doses from Sinopharm within days of regulatory approval, Orban told state radio on January 15.Ideological ShiftThe willingness to go ahead with eastern procurements follows Orban’s ideological shift from once being a staunch supporter western values to a leader who has vowed to eradicate liberal democracy, cultivated ties with strongmen and frequently clashed with the EU over his decade-old consolidation of power.Orban has sought to follow the warming of political ties with business deals, including a Russia-backed $15 billion expansion of Hungary’s sole nuclear plant and a $2 billion rail link between Budapest and Belgrade, part of the China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Both contracts are at least partly classified.Extending the deal-making to vaccines the EU hasn’t yet approved isn’t without risks. Chinese and Russian developers have been slow compared with their western peers in releasing clinical trial data, raising questions over transparency, efficacy and safety.Getting Hungarians to trust vaccines is also a challenge after Orban, an early supporter of Russia’s Sputnik, said people wouldn’t be told which doses they’d be getting. He has since said people would be informed.Hungarians are still generally skeptical of Covid-19 vaccines, with 27% responding “Yes” to a question on whether they would get the jab if it became available, compared with 29% who said “No,” according to a survey by the state statistics office published on January 14. That compared with 15% in favor of the vaccine and 36% against a month earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-becomes-first-eu-nation-to-approve-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-101611218555378.html

Global warming is an urgent threat to the whole world and to the survival of our species.”“May I also commend you for other measures you are taking towards the betterment of the United States of America. I have long been an admirer of your great country, the bastion of liberty, democracy, religious freedom and the rule of law. The whole world places its hope in the democratic vision and leadership of the United States."In these challenging times, I am confident that you will contribute to shaping a more peaceful world in which those suffering from hunger, disease and violence may find help. The need to address these issues is indeed pressing," the letter read.The Dalai Lama also hailed the encouragement of American people and their leaders in efforts to preserve ancient Buddhist culture."... I take this opportunity to express our gratitude for your long-standing support for the Tibetan people. It has been our good fortune to have enjoyed the friendship and encouragement of the American people and their leaders in our endeavour to protect and preserve our ancient Buddhist culture, a culture of peace, non-violence and compassion," he said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-congratulates-us-president-joe-biden-101611218566713.html
21-01-2021||World||Twin suicide bombings kill at least 32 in Baghdad||Twin suicide bombings ripped through a busy market in the Iraqi capital Thursday, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens, officials said.The rare suicide bombing attack hit the Bab al-Sharqi commercial area in central Baghdad amid heightened political tensions over planned early elections and a severe economic crisis. Blood smeared the floors of the busy market amid piles of clothes and shoes as survivors took stock of the disarray in the aftermath.No one immediately took responsibility for the attack, but Iraqi military officials said it was the work of the Islamic State group.Iraq's health minister Hassan Mohammed al-Tamimi said at least 32 people were killed and 110 others were wounded in the attack. He said some of the wounded were in serious condition. Iraq's military previously put the number of dead at 28.The Health Ministry announced that all of its hospitals in the capital were mobilized to treat the wounded.Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, which includes an array of Iraqi forces, said the first suicide bomber cried out loudly that he was ill in the middle of the bustling market, prompting a crowd to gather around him — and that's when he detonated his explosive belt. The second detonated his belt shortly after, he said.“This is a terrorist act perpetrated by a sleeper cell of the Islamic State,” al-Khafaji said. He said IS “wanted to prove its existence" after suffering many blows in military operations to root out the militants.The suicide bombings marked the first in three years to target Baghdad's bustling commercial area. A suicide bomb attack took place in the same area in 2018 shortly after then-Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State group.No one immediately took responsibility for Thursday's attack, but Iraq has seen assaults perpetrated by both the Islamic State group and militia groups in recent months.Militias have routinely targeted the American presence in Iraq with rocket and mortar attacks, especially the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The pace of those attacks, however, has decreased since an informal truce was declared by Iran-backed armed groups in October.The style of Thursday's assault was similar to those IS has conducted in the past. But the group has rarely been able to penetrate the capital since being dislodged by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition in 2017.IS has shown an ability to stage increasingly sophisticated attacks across northern Iraq, where it still maintains a presence, three years after Iraq declared victory over the group.Iraqi security forces are frequently ambushed and targeted with IEDs in rural areas of Kirkuk and Diyala. An increase in attacks was seen last summer as militants took advantage of the government's focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic.The twin bombings Thursday came days after Iraq's government unanimously agreed to hold early elections in October. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had announced in July that early polls would be held to meet the demands of anti-government protesters.Demonstrators took to the streets in the tens of thousands last year to demand political change, and an end to rampant corruption and poor services. More than 500 people were killed in mass demonstrations as security forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse crowds.Iraq is also grappling with a severe economic crisis brought on by low oil prices that has led the government to borrow internally and risk depleting its foreign currency reserves. The Central Bank of Iraq devalued Iraq's dinar by nearly 20% last year to meet spending obligations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-attack-kills-3-injures-16-in-central-baghdad-market-police-101611216986846.html

No deaths were attributed to the disease.The northern Heilongjiang province registered the highest number of cases showing symptoms at 68, while the neighbouring Jilin and Hebei provinces posted 33 and 20 cases respectively, according to a daily update from China's National Health Commission.The commission's data showed that 18 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic cases were imported from abroad.This takes the total in the country since the beginning of the pandemic to 88,701 cases and 4,635 fatalities.China has been battling an uptick in transmissions since the beginning of the year with lockdowns affecting over 20 million people in large cities of the country's northeast.Hebei province, which surrounds the capital city of Beijing, saw its main city Shijiazhuang shut down all transportation routes with the capital.Health authorities have been undertaking mass testing drives in major urban centers of affected areas since the uptick was first registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-registers-144-new-covid-19-cases-113-asymptomatic-infections-101611216687010.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden reverses Trump travel ban, halts wall construction||President Joe Biden on Wednesday began reversing Donald Trump’s immigration policies, part of an aggressive push to roll back some of the most controversial actions of his predecessor and chart a new course for the nation.In one of his first acts as president, Biden signed an executive action ending restrictions on travel and immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries. The measure directs the State Department to resume visa processing for those countries and develop a plan to address people affected, such as those who were denied entry to the U.S.The action also orders reviews of other “extreme vetting” practices used by the Trump administration, while directing the U.S. to improve information-sharing with foreign governments to bolster screening of travelers.Biden is also proposing a sweeping immigration bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday night that the president had sent the text of his proposal to Congress.The legislation marks a stark contrast with the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict both legal and illegal immigration during its four years in power.The new president issued a proclamation ordering a stop to construction of Trump’s wall along the border with Mexico. It rescinds the national emergency that Trump declared to secure funding for the wall.The travel ban and border wall were the fulfillments of Trump’s central 2016 campaign promises, to crack down on immigration and limit the number of Muslims coming to the U.S. Biden condemned them as an attack on racial and religious minorities.Just one week after taking office, Trump announced he would suspend entry to travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The policy also suspended refugee resettlement. Federal judges blocked the first version of the ban from being implemented. A third version went into place following numerous court challenges.The ban that Biden ended blocked entry to most people from Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and North Korea. It also restricted immigrant visas for people from Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Eritrea as well as for certain others from Venezuela and Tanzania.Biden’s immigration legislation is ambitious, and as a result, it could face obstacles in Congress.The proposal calls for an eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, down from 13, and an even shorter one for those known as Dreamers who were brought illegally as children to the U.S., as well as those with temporary protected status.The bill seeks to address the root causes of migration by bolstering assistance to Central American countries. It eases immigration for people fleeing violence and increases prosecution of human traffickers and drug smugglers. But it does not call for a major increase in border security measures in exchange, which could make it difficult to garner support from Republicans in Congress.The travel ban reversal is part of a 10-day onslaught of executive actions intended to overturn key Trump policies without waiting for Congress, on topics ranging from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change and criminal justice.Biden on Wednesday also signed an executive order rescinding the Trump administration’s immigration-enforcement priorities that stepped up patrols along the U.S. southern border and cast a wider net in the interior of the country. The decision clears the way for the Biden administration to set narrower targets.Strengthening DACA ProgramAnother order signed by Biden directs the Department of Homeland Security to shore up the Deferred Action for Childhood Migrants program the Trump administration sought to terminate. The program provides deportation reprieves and work permits for the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.The new president is also restoring deportation protections for Liberians, which the Trump administration attempted to scale back.Biden next week is expected to issue an order directing federal agencies to speed the reunification of families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of Trump’s crackdown on migrants. The new administration is also considering a broad moratorium on deportation in the coming days.In another immigration matter, Trump issued an order on Tuesday night deferring the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S., citing the “autocratic government” of Nicolas Maduro, which his administration had unsuccessfully sought to topple. It isn’t clear if Biden will allow the order to stand.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-reverses-trump-travel-ban-halts-wall-construction-101611206050815.html

The former senator was sworn in just before Biden took the oath of office to become the 46th US President."In many ways this moment embodies our character as a nation. It demonstrates who we are, even in dark times. We, not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be."We shoot for the moon, and then we plant our flag on it. We are bold, fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted, in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up. This is American aspiration," Harris said outside the Lincoln Memorial.She cited the accomplishments of President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, who "saw a better future and built it with land grant colleges, and the transcontinental railroad."She also highlighted how Martin Luther King Jr fought for racial and economic justice."In the middle of the civil rights movement, Dr King fought for racial justice and economic justice. American Aspiration is what drove the women of this nation, throughout history, to demand equal rights,” Harris said addressing 'Celebrating America', a primetime special that wrapped up a busy day of Biden-Harris inauguration events.Harris said a great experiment takes great determination. The will to do the work and then the wisdom to keep refining, keep tinkering, keep perfecting.The same determination is being realised in America today, she noted."I see it in the scientists who are transforming the future. I see it in the parents who are nurturing generations to come and in the innovators, the educators, in everyone, everywhere who is building a better life for themselves, their families and their communities."This too is American aspiration. This is what President Joe Biden has called upon us to summon now. The courage to see beyond crisis, to do what is hard, to do what is good, to unite, to believe in ourselves, believe in our country, believe in what we can do together," Harris said.In his remarks, Biden said the nation faces difficult challenges, but he is optimistic that the country can meet them.“We’ve learned again that democracy is precious, and because of you, democracy has prevailed...To overcome the challenges in front of us requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity. It requires us to come together in common love that defines us as Americans: Opportunity, liberty, dignity and respect. And unite against common foes: Hate, violence, disease and hopelessness,” he said.“The question is: are we up to it? Will we meet the moment like our forebears have? I believe we must, and I believe we will,” Biden said.The 'Celebrating America' event showcased the American people's resilience, heroism and unified commitment to coming together as a nation to heal and rebuild.Hosted by Tom Hanks and featuring appearances by Eva Longoria and Kerry Washington, the 90-minute programme included performances at iconic locations across the country by Foo Fighters, John Legend, Lin Manuel Miranda, Bruce Springsteen, Demi Lovato, Justin Timberlake, Ant Clemons and Jon Bon Jovi.Prior to taking the oath at the US Capitol, Harris paid tribute to the women who she says came before her."I stand on their shoulders," she said in a video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-in-dark-times-we-not-only-dream-we-do-says-kamala-harris-101611213970025.html
21-01-2021||World||Pope urges US reconciliation as bishops call out Joe Biden on abortion||Pope Francis told President Joe Biden on Wednesday that he was praying that God would guide his efforts to bring reconciliation in the United States, while the head of the nation's Catholic bishops condemned Biden's pro-choice stand on abortion.In a message sent shortly after the second Catholic U.S. president was sworn in, Francis also said he hoped Biden would work towards a society marked by true justice, freedom and respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those with no voice."Under your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding," Francis said."I likewise ask God, the source of all wisdom and truth, to guide your efforts to foster understanding, reconciliation and peace within the United States and among the nations of the world in order to advance the universal common good," he said.Three days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Congress by supporters of former president Donald Trump, Francis said the violence had left him "astonished".In Wednesday's message to Biden, the pope said the "grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses".The president of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, served notice that the bishops will continue to fight Biden over his position on several moral issues, mainly abortion.Biden, like many other Catholic politicians, has said he is personally against abortion but cannot impose his position on others.Gomez praised Biden for what he called the new president's "moving witness" on how his faith brought him solace in times of tragedy and his commitment to the poor but said bishops had to proclaim all the truth of the Gospel."So, I must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender," Gomez said.In a move that underscored the deep divisions among U.S. bishops on how to approach the new administration, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago said Gomez's statement was "ill-considered" and that many bishops had not been consulted.Many Catholic conservatives supported Trump. Francis had a rocky relationship with Trump, disagreeing with him on a series of issues including immigration and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-urges-us-reconciliation-as-bishops-call-out-joe-biden-on-abortion-101611212755939.html
21-01-2021||World||Two Canadian MPs join commemoration of Kashmiri Hindu exodus||With two Canadian MPs joining in the commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the “ethnic cleansing” of Kashmiri Hindus in 1990, members of the diaspora are hopeful that the tragedy will also be acknowledged in the country’s Parliament.In a statement on the 31st anniversary of the attack on Hindus in Kashmir sent to the Indo-Canadian Kashmir Forum (ICKF), Warren Steinley, an MP from the province of Saskatchewan, expressed his “deep sadness” in commemorating the “attack on the Hindu population of Kashmir valley in January 1990 by cross border militants.”He also commended the “resilience and courage” exhibited by members of the Kashmiri pandit community “who survived this gruesome ethnic cleansing.”These views were also echoed by Indo-Canadian MP Bob Saroya who had earlier issued a similar message and conveyed his condolences “to the families and friends of all those who were killed, raped and injured in this massacre.” Saroya, who represents a riding (constituency) in the Greater Toronto Area became the first-ever Canadian MP to issue a statement of this nature, and described the events of 1990 as a “gruesome genocide”.Both MPs also supported the Indian government’s “plans to help Kashmiri Hindus return safely back to their homes.”Getting such support from MPs for the first time has enthused members of the community in Canada. Vidya Dhar, director of the ICKF, said they were hopeful that a motion would soon be tabled in Canada’s Parliament that is an “acknowledgement” of the violence and persecution the community faced prior and during its exodus from the Valley.While community groups usually take out a procession to mark the anniversary each year, restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to them adopting an inventive manner this year.

Canada is the single-largest supplier of energy to the United States, contributing to US energy security and economic competitiveness, and supporting thousands of jobs on both sides of the border,” the statement added.While the reaction from Ottawa was tempered, that from the province of Alberta, which is reliant on natural resource-driven projects like Keystone, was far less restrained. Jason Kenney, Alberta’s Premier, called on the federal government to “impose meaningful trade and economic sanctions (on the US) in response to defend our country’s vital economic interests” if the Biden Administration “refuses to open the door to a constructive and respectful dialogue about these issues.”Construction for the project had commenced earlier and the proposed 2700 km pipeline was expected to carry nearly 830,000 barrels of oil from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas via multiple Midwestern American states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-disappointed-at-us-move-to-revoke-keystone-pipeline-permit-101611211646767.html
21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to unveil Covid plan on first full day in office||US President Joe Biden was expected Thursday to unveil his administration's plans to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he starts his first full day in the White House with America confronting a slew of challenges.Biden was sworn in as the 46th US president on Wednesday, delivering a calming call to heal a nation riven by festering divisions that had grown deeper under four years of Donald Trump.Biden took the presidential oath standing on the steps of the US Capitol, the building complex that had been attacked two weeks earlier by a pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn his victory. Moments earlier Kamala Harris had taken the oath to officially become America's first female vice president."Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed," Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront swiftly.Absent from the ceremony was Trump, who had earlier left Washington for Florida, breaking 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.Trump has not publicly conceded defeat and spent the months since November's election falsely claiming he was cheated out of a second term.Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama did however attend the inauguration."I think if Americans would love their neighbor like they would like to be loved themselves, a lot of the division in our society would end," said Bush, a Republican.Shortly after walking into the White House, his wife Jill by his side, Biden signed a flurry of executive orders, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord from which the US withdrew under Trump."We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far," the new US leader said, speaking in the Oval Office as he signed papers on the Paris deal which was negotiated when Biden was Obama's vice president.Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said his first call to a foreign leader would be Friday to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- after Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline fiercely opposed by environmentalists but backed by Ottawa.Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, stopped construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border, and rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations.- A full in-tray -Biden's presidency will initially be shaped by his response to Covid-19, which has killed more than 400,000 people in the US, and the associated economic emergency.He will look to move quickly on coordinating a federal plan to combat the virus, which for months ran rampant across the country as the Trump administration bungled its response.Biden is expected to outline his administration's plans later Thursday after he is briefed by his Covid-19 team.Whereas Trump seldom acknowledged the tragic toll the virus was inflicting on Americans, Biden paused in his inaugural address to offer a moment's silent prayer for the victims.The veteran Democrat also appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts."I will be a president for all Americans," Biden said.Still, he confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol assault, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.The United States faces "a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat," Biden said.Biden's inauguration ceremony, while steeped in pomp and tradition, was different from previous events, with no crowds and the National Mall closed.Washington normally parties hard after an inauguration, but the US capital stayed quiet Wednesday.A-listers made a valiant effort to keep up the energy at a mostly virtual, pre-produced show dubbed "Celebrating America."At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987, and is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy.Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two.She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever "second gentleman" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who became a hero by luring away the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-unveil-covid-plan-on-first-full-day-in-office-101611211037916.html
21-01-2021||World||Angry China sanctioned Pompeo, 27 Trump officials as Biden took oath||China sanctioned outgoing US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former President Donald Trump, accusing them of “hatred” against the Chinese and carrying out “crazy” moves to harm its interests.The announcement came as new US President Joe Biden was taking oath in Washington.The Chinese foreign ministry’s move seemed to signal Beijing’s anger against Pompeo – routinely ridiculed by the Chinese government and state media – who on his final day in office said that China had committed genocide against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The strongly worded statement, and its timing, also signalled Beijing’s anger and frustration against the Trump administration.“Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs, undermined China’s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations,’’ the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.“The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests. China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues.” Other sanctioned former Trump officials include trade chief Peter Navarro, national security advisers Robert O’Brien and John Bolton, health secretary Alex Azar, UN ambassador Kelly Craft and former top Trump aide Steve Bannon.“These individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China,” the foreign ministry said.Earlier on Wednesday, the foreign ministry had dismissed the charges of genocide against the Uighur community in Xinjiang.Responding to the Xinjiang allegations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the regular ministry briefing: “Pompeo has made so many lies in recent years, and this is just another bold-faced lie.”“This US politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughingstock and a clown.”Hua said China hoped “the new administration will work together with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle differences and conduct more win-win cooperation in more sectors.”“We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment on Xinjiang issues, among other issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angry-china-sanctions-pompeo-27-trump-officials-during-biden-oath-101611210806713.html
21-01-2021||World||On day one, Biden takes US back to Paris climate accord, World Health Organization||On his first day in office on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed executive orders that returned the US to the Paris Agreement on climate crisis and the World Health Organization, and ended the Muslim travel ban, reversing some of his predecessor Donald Trump’s most controversial decisions.Biden signed 15 executive orders in all. The first — of the three he signed in the presence of reporters — mandated masks on federal property and interstate transportation, launching a “100 Day Masking Challenge”, reaffirming the highest property he is according to combating the Covid-19 pandemic.The White House had earlier announced an immigration legislation — of particular interest to Indian aspirants for Green Cards, the permanent residency that are a stepping stone to citizenship — that allows H-1B dependents to work and protects their children from “aging out” of their parents’ visas when they turn 21, and “improves access” for foreign students of advanced STEM degrees to Green Cards, which allows permanent residency as a mandatory next step to citizenship.“I thought, with the state of the nation today, there’s no time to waste, get to work immediately,” President Biden said before signing the orders, picking them up from a pile of folders — each of them containing an order — on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.Biden returned the US to the Paris Agreement that his former boss, President Barack Obama, had helped forge. But his predecessor, Trump, had pulled the US out of it claiming, wrongly, it favoured India and China at the expense of the US.Biden’s decision to rejoin the WHO was also a significant move, recognising the importance of the global body in the middle of the deadliest pandemic the world had seen in more than 100 years. Trump had ordered the pullout to shift blame for his own mishandling of the epidemic on to the WHO, accusing it of covering up for China.In her first daily news briefing, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who was reviled by Trump and was sent death threats by the former president’s supporters, will lead the US delegation to the world body in America’s renewed engagement with the world body.President Biden also told reporters Trump had left him a “generous” note but refused to share its content saying it was a private matter. He said he must speak first about it with Trump. But a spokesperson said there were no plans for him to call his predecessor.Trump and Melania Trump had left the White House without waiting to receive their successor, violating one of the many rituals of transfer of power. They had also not attended Biden’s inauguration and Melania Trump had not given First Lady Jill Biden a customary tour of the White House.The Bidens’ first day in the White House marked the return of a familiar style and manner of American politics and governance that had been overshadowed by Trump’s unpredictable and irascible brand of governance.Nothing signified the change more than Biden’s instructions to nearly a thousand political appointees he swore in on web video call: “If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treated another colleague with disrespect — talk down to someone — I promise I will fire you on the spot. On the spot...Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-day-one-biden-takes-us-back-to-paris-climate-accord-world-health-organization-101611208106277.html
21-01-2021||World||Indian-American lawmakers say Biden, Harris will heal America||Indian-American lawmakers hailed the leadership of US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, expressing confidence that the two leaders will heal the country, courageously face challenges and build back better.During the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s official Asian American inaugural ball, hosted virtually by the leading Indian-American advocacy organisation IMPACT, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi from Illinois said he is extremely happy that both Biden and Harris are finally able to take over leadership.Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th Congressional District, located in the heart of Silicon Valley, said he cannot stress “what an amazing moment this is for our community and for the multi-racial democracy in America.”Congressman Ami Bera, representing California’s 7th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives, said Biden and Harris are humble people who get the importance of this moment in time to heal this country, to bring the nation together and “face with courage the challenges that are ahead of us.”Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said at the AAPI ‘Inaugural Ball: Breaking Barriers’ that she is proud and excited to call Harris the next US Vice President - the first woman, first South-Asian American and the first Black American to ever be elected to this "position of public trust.“Today we prove that our democracy still works and that the power always belongs to the people through the power of our vote,” she said at the virtual inaugural ball held on Tuesday, and added that she cannot wait to see the brighter world that “we will build together.”Indian-American Neera Tanden, nominated by Biden as the Director of Office of Management and Budget at the White House, said she is honored to be part of the Biden-Harris administration.“I know for many in our community there is so much to be proud of. Not only can we celebrate an incredibly diverse cabinet, but we can also celebrate the fact that we have the first vice president” who is of an Asian descent.Following the swearing-in of Harris, IMPACT Executive Director Neil Makhija said generations of immigrants came to the US for a better life for their children. "Today, the daughter of an Indian immigrant, who made dosas on the campaign trail, and spoke to her 'chithis' in her nomination speech, took her oath of office as Vice-President of the United States.“And as Kamala Harris takes her place in the American story, the hearts of her countrymen and women are swelling with pride and hope for the future,” he said, adding that the inauguration of Harris is not only the culmination of an American dream, but “marks the launching of millions of new dreams.Beginning today, a generation of American children will grow up knowing only an Indian-American and Black woman as vice-president of the United States.”As Harris has said, she may be the first, but she won't be the last. “And, with her as an inspiration, we look forward to helping the next generation prove her right,” Makhija added.National, grassroots organisation South Asians for Biden’s National Director Neha Dewan said Biden and Harris are the "right leaders” for this moment “when we are experiencing multiple, converging crises, and their leadership gives us all hope that we can emerge from this as a stronger country.”She said the organisation is heartened by the fact that the South Asian community played a critical role in the 2020 election, and looks forward to deepening the community's engagement in government and politics in the months and years ahead.With Harris breaking barriers as the first Black and South Asian woman elected to national office, Dewan said “for South Asians who wondered whether this moment could ever be possible, today affirms that America at its best is a land of limitless opportunities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-lawmakers-say-biden-harris-will-heal-america-101611205897937.html

Bush.Haines, who has earned bipartisan praise, served in several national security positions under the Obama administration, including deputy CIA director and White House deputy national security adviser, The Hill reported.During her opening statement, she pledged to keep the intelligence department away from the politics and said, "To be effective, the director of national intelligence must never shy away from speaking truth to power, even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult."Following the confirmation, Biden took to Twitter to laud the Senate for confirming Haines as director of national intelligence."I applaud the Senate for putting partisanship aside to prioritize our national security. Americans can rest easy tonight knowing Avril Haines has been confirmed as the Director of National Intelligence," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avril-haines-is-first-official-member-of-president-joe-biden-s-cabinet-101611205211176.html
21-01-2021||World||Taiwan's 'de-facto' ambassador to US attends Joe Biden's inauguration||Taiwan's ties with its most important global backer the United States are off to a strong start under President Joe Biden's government, after the island's de facto ambassador attended an inauguration for the first time with an official invitation.Former President Donald Trump's administration ramped up support for Taiwan, increasing arms sales and sending senior officials to Taipei, angering China and stirring even greater enmity from Beijing towards Washington.That had made Trump a popular figure in democratic Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, and raised concern in its government that Biden may not be as helpful.Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the U.S. commitment to Taiwan was "rock-solid" after the island's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's swearing in on Wednesday."President Biden will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in the Asia-Pacific region - and that includes Taiwan."Taiwan's foreign ministry said it was the first time an inauguration committee had formally invited the island's Washington representative and showed the close friendship between Taiwan and the United States based on shared values."These shared values are democracy, freedom and human rights," said ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou.The United States ended formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, switching recognition to China, though Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.In a video message on her Twitter account, Hsiao, who is close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, said she was honoured to be there representing Taiwan's government and people."Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective," she said.Tsai sent her congratulations too, saying she hoped the two sides could work together to maintain regional democracy, freedom, peace and stability.Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday he was in favour of greater engagement with Taiwan.Tsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwans-de-facto-ambassador-to-us-attends-joe-biden-s-inauguration-101611204858289.html
21-01-2021||World||China to impose virus testing on Lunar New Year travellers, cases rising||China plans to impose strict Covid testing requirements during the Lunar New Year holiday season, when tens of millions of people are expected to travel, as it battles the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.Millions of residents in Hebei province surrounding Beijing, the northeastern Jilin province and Heilongjiang have been put into lockdown in recent weeks amid what is the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.Authorities are asking people to stay home during the Lunar New Year holidays in February as part of the efforts to prevent another debilitating outbreak.A total of 144 new cases were reported on Jan. 20, the National Health Commission said on Thursday, matching the total reported on Jan. 14 and marking the highest number of daily infections since March 1. This still remains a fraction of what China saw during the height of the outbreak in January-February 2020, however.Of the 126 new local infections, Heilongjiang accounted for 68 while Jilin reported 33. Hebei, which had so far seen the biggest spike in cases this month, reported 20 new cases, and Beijing reported two cases.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed infections, rose to 113 from 58 a day earlier.In a notice posted online, China's National Health Commission said people returning to rural areas from other provinces over the Lunar New Year period would have to produce a negative COVID-19 test taken within seven days.A majority of China's 280 million rural migrant workers usually travel home to their villages at this time of year.Those that work with imported cold chain products, or quarantine facility workers, among other groups, would also have to produce a test, even if they remained in the same province, said the notice.Rural areas' epidemic control, as well as infections spread via imported frozen goods, have been blamed by officials as weak links partially responsible for the current outbreaks.An announcement from an NHC official during a Wednesday news conference had suggested everyone returning home would have to take a test. Official media Xinhua then published an article urging officials to clarify details "as soon as possible."The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 88,701, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-impose-virus-testing-on-lunar-new-year-travellers-cases-rising-101611203484001.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden bets big on immigration changes in opening move||For the opening salvo of his presidency, few expected Joe Biden to be so far-reaching on immigration.A raft of executive orders signed Wednesday undoes many of his predecessor’s hallmark initiatives, such as halting work on a border wall with Mexico, lifting a travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries and reversing plans to exclude people in the country illegally from the 2020 census.Six of Biden's 17 orders, memorandums and proclamations deal with immigration. He ordered efforts to preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program known as DACA that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. as children from deportation since it was introduced in 2012. He also extended temporary legal status to Liberians who fled civil war and the Ebola outbreak to June 2022.The Homeland Security Department announced a 100-day moratorium on deportations “for certain noncitizens,” starting Friday, after Biden revoked one of Trump’s earliest executive orders making anyone in the country illegally a priority for deportations.That's not it. Biden’s most ambitious proposal, unveiled Wednesday, is an immigration bill that would give legal status and a path to citizenship to anyone in the United States before Jan. 1 — an estimated 11 million people — and reduce the time that family members must wait outside the United States for green cards.Taken together, Biden's moves represent a sharp U-turn after four years of relentless strikes against immigration, captured most vividly by the separation of thousands of children from their parents under a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings. Former President Donald Trump's administration also took hundreds of other steps to enhance enforcement, limit eligibility for asylum and cut legal immigration.The new president dispelled any belief that his policies would resemble those of former President Barack Obama, who promised a sweeping bill his first year in office but waited five years while logging more than 2 million deportations.Eager to avoid a rush on the border, Biden aides signaled that it will take time to unwind some of Trump's border policies, which include making asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Homeland Security said that on Thursday it would stop sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico to wait for hearings but that people already returned should stay put for now.It "will take months to be fully up and running in terms of being able to do the kind of asylum processing that we want to be able to do,” Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters.Despite the deliberative pace in some areas, Biden's moves left pro-immigration advocates overjoyed. Greisa Martinez Rosas, executive director of United We Dream, called the legislation “the most progressive legalization bill in history.”“We made it,” she said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. "We made this day happen."It is even more striking because immigration got scarce mention during the campaign, and the issue has divided Republicans and Democrats, even within their own parties. Legislative efforts failed in 2007 and 2013.More favorable attitudes toward immigration — especially among Democrats — may weigh in Biden’s favor. A Gallup survey last year found that 34% of those polled supported more immigration, up from 21% in 2016 and higher than any time since Gallup began asking the question in 1965.Seven in 10 voters said they preferred offering immigrants in the U.S. illegally a chance to apply for legal status, compared with about 3 in 10 who thought they should be deported to the country they came from, according to AP VoteCast. The survey of more than 110,000 voters in November showed 9 in 10 Biden voters but just about half of Trump voters were in favor of a path to legal status.Under the bill, most people would wait eight years for citizenship but those enrolled in DACA, those with temporary protective status for fleeing strife-torn countries and farmworkers would wait three years.The bill also offers development aid to Central America, reduces the 1.2 million-case backlog in immigration courts and provides more visas for underrepresented countries and crime victims.The proposal would let eligible family members wait in the United States for green cards by granting temporary status until their petitions are processed — a population that Kerri Talbot of advocacy group Immigration Hub estimates at 4 million.Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens who have been waiting outside the country for more than six years are just getting their numbers called this month. Waits are even longer for some nationalities. Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens from Mexico have been waiting outside the United States since August 1996.The bill faces an enormous test in Congress. Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said Wednesday that he would lead the Senate effort. Skeptics will note that Ronald Regan's 1986 amnesty for nearly 3 million immigrants preceded large numbers of new arrivals and say to expect more of the same.In a taste of what's to come, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, described the bill as having “open borders: Total amnesty, no regard for the health and security of Americans, and zero enforcement.”To be clear, enforcement has expanded exponentially since the mid-1990s and will remain. Biden's bill calls for more technology at land crossings, airports and seaports and authorizes the Homeland Security secretary to consider other steps.Biden warned advocates last week that they should not hold him to passage within 100 days, said Domingo Garcia of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was on a call with the president.“Today we celebrate," Carlos Guevara of pro-immigration group UnidosUS said Wednesday. "Tomorrow we roll up our sleeves and get to work.”___Associated Press writers Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida, and Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bets-big-on-immigration-changes-in-opening-move-101611203491888.html

21-01-2021||World||US to re-enter Paris Agreement: All you need to know about climate accord||One of the first executive orders Joe Biden signed as US President was to reverse his predecessor Donald Trump’s order to exit the Paris Agreement on climate change. This was one of several decisions taken by Biden on his first day in office.Here’s a look at some key points on Paris Agreement:1. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It comes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As of December 2020, all 197 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement and 189 still remain party to it.Also Read | On Day 1, Biden sets the ball rolling on immigration, climate change, Covid-192. The agreement was negotiated and adopted by 196 parties in Paris on December 12, 2015 and came into effect on November 4, 2016. India, too, is a party to the agreement, having ratified it on April 22, 2016.3. The Paris agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, limit the increase in average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius and, if possible, limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.4. Under the agreement, countries have to determine, plan and regularly report on what they are doing to mitigate global warming. However, it is not binding on any country to set specific targets to be achieved by specific dates.5. On June 1, 2017, then-US President Donald Trump announced that his country would exit the accord and re-enter only on terms that are “fair to the United States.” Trump said his decision to withdraw from the accord under his “America first” policy.6. The US’ exit from the accord came into effect on November 4, 2020, a day after presidential elections took place. The Trump administration had given a formal notice to exit the agreement exactly a year earlier.7. Under Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a party can give notice to leave the accord only three years after the agreement has come into effect in that country. The deal came into effect in the US on November 4, 2016, four days before that year’s presidential polls. The withdrawal from the treaty, meanwhile, comes into effect 12 months after the notice is given.8. Besides the US, eight other countries are not a party to the agreement, including Iran. The US is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and ahead of India.9. Now that President Biden has signed an executive order to re-join the treaty, the United States will once again become a member of the Paris Agreement in 30 days’ time.10. The third meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement will take place in Glasgow, Scotland from November 1-12, 2021. It will take place as a part of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-re-enter-paris-agreement-all-you-need-to-know-about-climate-accord-101611201064366.html
21-01-2021||World||Immigrants feel positive about reforms to immigration rules under Biden||Immigrants cheered President Joe Biden's plan to provide a path to US citizenship for about 11 million people without legal status, mixing hope with guarded optimism Wednesday amid a seismic shift in how the American government views and treats them.The newly inaugurated president moved to reverse four years of harsh restrictions and mass deportation with a plan for sweeping legislation on citizenship. Biden also issued executive orders reversing some of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies, such as halting work on a US-Mexico border wall and lifting a travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries. He also ordered his Cabinet to work to keep deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the US as children."This sets a new narrative, moving us away from being seen as criminals and people on the public charge to opening the door for us to eventually become Americans,” said Yanira Arias, a Salvadoran immigrant with Temporary Protected Status who lives in Puerto Rico, a US territory.Arias is among about 400,000 people given the designation after fleeing violence or natural disasters.“It sets a more hopeful future for immigrants in the US, but it all depends on the Congress, especially the Senate,” Arias, a national campaigns manager for the immigrant advocacy group Alianza Americas, said of the citizenship effort.Success of the legislation is far from certain in a divided Congress, where opposition is expected to be tough. The most recent immigration reform attempts on a similar scale failed — in 2007 under then-President George W. Bush and in 2013 under then-President Barack Obama.Ofelia Aguilar, who watched Biden's inaugural address on TV with four other female farmworkers in agricultural Homestead, Florida, said she nevertheless felt positive about prospects for immigration reform.“I am hopeful that he'll give us legal status,” said Aguilar, who was pregnant and alone when she came to the US from Mexico in 1993. She worked in the fields for years before starting her own business farming jicama root.“There is hope!” Aguilar cried out after Biden was sworn in. “So many people have suffered.”Some of the farmworkers at the backyard gathering about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Miami said they were disappointed Biden didn't mention immigration reforms in his speech.“I have faith in God, not in presidents,” said Sofía Hernández, an agricultural worker who has lived in the US without legal status since 1989. “So many have said they are going to do things, and I don't see any results."Hernandez came from Mexico, seeking economic opportunity. Her three children were born in the US and she regularly sent money to her family back home before her parents died.“My dream is to go and see my family and come back to stay with my children,” Hernandez said.In New York, Blanca Cedillos said she also was disappointed Biden did not mention immigration during the speech she watched with a half-dozen other masked immigrants at the Workers Justice Project.“I was hoping he would say something,” said Cedillos, a Salvadoran who lost her job as a nanny during the coronavirus pandemic and now gets by with a few housecleaning jobs and a weekly food box from the nonprofit that offers services to immigrants.Cedillos has lived in the US without authorization for 18 years and hopes to eventually visit her four children in Central America, then return legally to the U.S.“I have told them that that trip may happen now. Hopefully, if this new president gives me the opportunity,” she said.Guatemalan construction worker Gustavo Ajché, who came to the U.S. in 2004, watched the Spanish language broadcast with Cedillos.“I don’t want to get too excited because I might get frustrated afterward, like has happened in the past,” Ajché said. “I have been here many years, I have paid my taxes, I am hoping something will be done.”In Phoenix, Tony Valdovinos, a local campaign consultant who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico as a small child, said he isn't celebrating yet.He's among those who have benefited from the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.“It's hard to put your heart into it when these things have failed in the past,” Valdovinos said. “We've been beaten down so much.”Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition in Miami, said she feels much the same way.“I’m so happy and relieved, but we are still afraid of getting our hearts broken again,” she said. “We’ve been through this so many times, but we really need to bring through a solution that goes forward.”Los Angeles janitor Anabella Aguirre wants that solution not only for herself, but for her two daughters, both DACA recipients now starting their careers.“Like thousands of mothers and fathers, I want for my daughters to have something better in this country,” Aguirre said. "We hope that today, this dawn, brings hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrants-feel-positive-about-reforms-to-immigration-rules-under-biden-101611200644124.html

Trump’s disclosure, which listed 10 gifts, was the fourth of his presidency, but the previous ones listed no gifts.Other presents included sets of golf clubs from former PGA President Derek Sprague, former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, PetProducts.com CEO Allen Simon and Illinois sporting goods maker Bettinardi Golf.Trump received two championship belts — one from the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s Colby Covington and another from wrestling fan Randy Jackson of North Carolina.Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. gave Trump a leather bomber jacket worth $529.And Apple CEO Tim Cook gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro computer — the first built at an Apple factory in Austin, Texas.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem presented Trump with a $1,100 bronze sculpture of Mount Rushmore, where Trump once held a rally.A spokeswoman for the former president did not immediately return a message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-discloses-40-000-in-gifts-received-during-final-year-101611198696436.html

The order includes an "immediate termination" of the national emergency declaration that allowed the Trump administration to redirect billions of dollars to the wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-order-to-end-trump-s-muslim-travel-ban-101611197159886.html

I expect they will certainly discuss the important relationship with Canada and his decision of Keystone XL pipeline," she said."His early calls will be with partners and allies," Psaki said.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have an all-female White House senior communications team.Psaki was also a State Department spokesperson during the Obama administration and previously served as deputy White House communications director and deputy White House press secretary.Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order that revokes a key permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, hours after taking office as the 46th commander-in-chief.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is "disappointed" to see Biden sign an executive order revoking the Keystone XL oil pipeline's permit."Earlier today, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States of America. While we welcome the President's commitment to fight climate change, we are disappointed but acknowledge the President's decision to fulfill his election campaign promise on Keystone XL," Trudeau said in a statement.

21-01-2021||World||Where Biden stood, reminders of a failed insurrection||On the very spot where President Joe Biden delivered his inaugural address, an insurrectionist mob had tried — and failed — to overturn his election just two weeks before. Nearby, at the Capitol's West Terrace doors, a police officer was brutally assaulted with a flagpole in a one of the siege's most chaotic moments.And from the podium, the starkest sight of all: a National Mall mostly empty, dotted with troops, the usual crowd of spectators replaced by a silent field of American flags.The Associated Press has the privilege of a seat on the inaugural platform every four years in a tradition dating as far back as anyone can remember. But there had never been a ceremony quite like this, in the still-fresh aftermath of a violent challenge to the peaceful transition of power that the inaugural is designed to celebrate.Solemn in purpose and demeanor, Biden did not work the room — not much, anyway. He was on a clock. At noon, he would become president.And at that moment, the Democratic-heavy crowd gave the new president hearty applause, with some of the House lawmakers in attendance audibly voicing relief.Unlike Trump's 2017 inauguration, which featured a speech that promised an end to decades of “American carnage," Biden returned again and again to a theme of national unity.“I thought that inaugural ceremony today was so filled with energy, spirit and love,” said Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, senator and a losing presidential candidate in 2008 and 2016.Performers included Lady Gaga, whose soaring rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner" left some in the audience agape. Garth Brooks, a country superstar and Republican with a huge following in Trump strongholds, led the group in “Amazing Grace."The blue jean-clad Brooks, obviously elated, almost danced away, but not before greeting the new president and three ex-presidents — including an oops-I-almost-missed-you hug with former President George W. Bush.“He just said, ‘I love you guys,'" Clinton said, with a hearty laugh. “And we said, ‘We love you too, Garth.'"Republican Sen. James Lankford, from Brooks' native Oklahoma, said the message of grace is just what a riven nation needs.“He made time when he finished singing to then go personally greet every one of the former presidents there and give them a very non-socially distanced hug, to be able to touch base with everybody and to try to set an example for people to say, ‘Hey, let's figure out if we can actually extend some grace to each other during this time.'"Young poet laureate Amanda Gorman was beaming — under her mask — after receiving plaudits from Vice President Kamala Harris, Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.“I was really nervous while I was doing it, so I'm kind of glad it's over," Gorman told The Associated Press. Given the reception she was getting from so many big names and important people, she said, “I'm smiling but you can't see it."Biden delivered his 21-minute address before a teleprompter in a stand of photographers. The teleprompter ensured a quick pace and gave Biden helpful hints such as a reminder to “build" to the finish. Biden had just a handful of small verbal stumbles and couldn’t resist adding an unscripted “folks” — a personal trademark — toward the end.Before the ceremony, a morning mist left the platform icy. The wind whipped throughout. There were just enough snow flurries to tell stories about. And by the end, the sun came out and shown brilliantly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-biden-stood-reminders-of-a-failed-insurrection-101611195536326.html
21-01-2021||World||China sanctions Pompeo, 28 other US lawmakers, for disrupting relations||Moments after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, China announced that it has decided to sanction 28 Americans including former state Secretary Michael Pompeo and other Trump administration officials for violating Beijing's sovereignty, stating they had made "crazy moves" that "seriously disrupted" US-China ties.The Americans sanctioned by China include former Trump advisor John R Bolton and former White House chief strategist, who was charged with defrauding political donors who supported building a border wall that Trump advocated.The sanctioned individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China, according to the statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.The Ministry said that anti-China politicians in the US have "planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations"."China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China's sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such US moves on China-related issues. They include Michael R Pompeo, Peter K Navarro, former President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser Robert C O'Brien, David R Stilwell, Matthew Pottinger, Alex M Azar II, Keith J Krach, and Kelly DK Craft of the Trump administration as well as John R Bolton and Stephen K Bannon," it added.The statement comes a day after the Trump administration, in one of its final acts, declared that Beijing was committing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslims in a far western region.A day before Biden was to be sworn in as the president of the United States, then-Secretary of State Pompeo said that he has directed the Department of State to continue to investigate and collect relevant information regarding the ongoing atrocities occurring in Xinjiang.Antony J Blinken, Biden's pick for secretary of state, said on Tuesday that he agreed with Pompeo's move to declare that China's repression of the Uyghurs constituted genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-pompeo-28-other-us-lawmakers-for-disrupting-relations-101611192301321.html
21-01-2021||World||Explainer: What's next after US accused China of genocide||The US's accusation of genocide against China touches on a hot-button human rights issue between China and the West.In one of his final acts as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo declared Tuesday that China’s policies against Muslims in its Xinjiang region constitute “crimes against humanity” and “genocide.”The same day, British lawmakers narrowly rejected a proposal aimed at China that would have barred trade deals with any country deemed to be committing genocide.The far western region of Xinjiang is home to the predominantly Muslim Uighur ethnic group. China denies human rights violations and says its actions in Xinjiang are necessary to counter a separatist and terrorist threat.WHY IS CHINA ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE?Pompeo cited forced birth control among Uighurs, which an Associated Press investigation documented last year, and forced labor, which has been linked by AP reporting to products imported to the US, including clothing, cameras and computer monitors.“I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,” Pompeo said in a written statement, using an alternative spelling for Uighurs.WHAT IS CHINA'S RESPONSE?China strongly defends its human rights record and policies in Xinjiang, saying its constitution and laws treat all citizens equally. It denies imposing coercive birth control measures or forced labor, saying those behind the allegations are lying in an effort to smear China’s reputation and impede its development.Xu Guixiang, a deputy spokesperson for the Xinjiang branch of the ruling Communist Party, told reporters last week that birth control decisions were made of the person’s own free will and that “no organization or individual can interfere.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Wednesday called Pompeo a “doomsday clown” and said his designation of China as a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity was merely “a piece of wastepaper.”WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?The genocide designation does not trigger any immediate repercussions, but requires the US to take it into account in formulating policy toward China.It puts pressure on President Joe Biden to maintain a tough line against China. He and members of his national security team have expressed support for such a designation in the past.Antony Blinken, Biden’s choice to be secretary of state, said Tuesday that the Trump administration was right to take a tougher stance on China, but that it had approached the matter poorly by alienating US allies and not fully standing up for human rights elsewhere.HOW WILL CHINA RESPOND?China may wish to avoid an early skirmish with the Biden administration, saving its invective for Pompeo and calibrating its response based on the possibility of tensions easing now after they flared under Donald Trump.As with most sensitive issues, China has heavily restricted foreign media access to Xinjiang and sought to limit any domestic discussion to official pronouncements.Still, the “parting shot" from the Trump administration will likely further stress the relationship in the near term, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China. He said the already slim chances of reducing China-US tensions have been further limited in the coming weeks and months.WHAT HAPPENED IN LONDON?Lawmakers rejected by a 319-308 vote an amendment to a post-Brexit trade bill that would have forced the British government to revoke bilateral trade agreements with a country if the High Court of England found that it had perpetrated genocide.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab last week called the amendment “well-meaning” but ineffective and counter productive.A significant number of rebel Conservatives backed the proposal, as did Jewish, Muslim and Christian community leaders. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to continue facing vocal calls within his Conservative party for a stronger and more coherent policy on China over its alleged rights abuses and violations of international norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-s-next-after-us-accused-china-of-genocide-101611192168953.html

Biden’s call for unity bears significance in the aftermath of Capitol riots when his predecessor, Donald Trump, egged on his supporters to storm the Capitol building, leading to five deaths. In an apparent reference to the tumultuous period of transition, Biden said the country has learnt that democracy is “precious” and “fragile.”Here are 10 memorable quotes from Biden’s speech:1. "This is America’s day, this is democracy’s day, the day of history and hope. Today we celebrate a triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause. We have learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile. At this hour my friends, Democracy has prevailed."2. "I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. I also know they are not new.”3. “Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonisation have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial, and victory is never assured.”Read | 'My whole soul is in it': Joe Biden becomes emotional as he remembers Lincoln4. “Through civil war to the Great Depression, World War, 9/11...our better angels have always prevailed. And each of these moments...enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward...we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbours...we can treat each other with dignity and respect”5. “For without unity, there's no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only state of chaos...this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge...unity is the path forward.”6. “And today, we marked the swearing-in of the first woman in the American history elected to national office - vice president Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change.”7. “Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever."Read | 'Ready to serve': Kamala Harris' first tweet as US Vice-President8. "To all of those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably...is perhaps this nation's greatest strength."9. "Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and profit. Each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, especially as leaders ... to defend the truth and defeat the lies."10. "Here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That’s what we do for one another."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battle-is-perennial-top-10-quotes-from-joe-biden-s-speech-101611168685610.html

Harris, 56, who is the 49th Vice President of the US is also the first African-American and Indian-origin woman to hold this position. Leaders from across the globe congratulated her and President Joe Biden and looked forward to strengthening ties with the United States further.After taking the oath, Harris took to Twitter and wrote, “Ready to serve’- which already garnered over 525,000 likes and over 86,000 re-tweets at the time of writing this piece. Her official Twitter handle currently has more than 6 million followers, 778 followings and the bio states: “Vice President of the United States. Wife to the first @SecondGentleman. Momala. Auntie. Fighting for the people.” Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is the first ‘Second Gentlemen’- the first male spouse of a Vice President in the United States. He will use @SecondGentleman account on the social media site from today.Out of the 778 profiles that Harris follows, there are tennis player Serena Williams, actors Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Neil Patrick Harris, Mark Hamill and Chris Evans. She also follows celebrated author Padma Lakshmi and the official handle of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The tweets on her official handle are majorly focused on the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the impact of the crisis on the American economy, precautions to combat the disease and updates on the number of cases and deaths.Also Read| 'Ready to serve': Kamala Harris' first tweet as US Vice-PresidentKamala Harris was born in Oakland, California in 1964 to an Indian mother and an African-American father from Jamaica. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris- who hailed from Chennai, was a breast cancer researcher and had died of cancer in 2009. While her father, Donald, is a Jamaican American professor of economics. During the US 2020 Presidential campaign trail, Harris often spoke about how her parents would push her in her stroller at civil rights marches.Harris had won her first race for San Francisco district attorney in 2003, becoming the first black female to hold such an office in California. She also became the first black woman to be elected as California attorney general in 2010 and in 2016, she was the only second black woman ever to be elected as a US senator. Before departing as a senator from California, Harris tweeted, ‘ Thank you California—it has been an honor serving as your senator for the past four years.

21-01-2021||World||Biden assumes US presidency with a rousing call to unity||Joseph Robinette Biden Jr took office on Wednesday as the 46th US president, calling for an “end (to) this uncivil war” in a rousing speech that was aimed at uniting a country bitterly divided by his predecessor Donald Trump, and help it overcome challenges posed by Covid-19 pandemic, distrust of each other, and “a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated, and even manufactured”.On a cold and blustery morning on the US Capitol, Kamala Harris was sworn in as Vice-President before Biden, marking a series of firsts that will secure her a unique place in American history as the first woman, African American and American of Indian, South Asian and Asian descent ever elected to the high office that will put her just a heartbeat away from the presidency. She was administered the oath by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice.“Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause; the cause of democracy, the people, the will of the people, has been heard,” Biden said after being sworn into office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. “On this hallowed ground just a few days ago, violence sought to shake the Capitol’s very foundation. We come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power. As we have for more than two centuries.”The president said, “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, and conservative versus liberal. We can do this. If we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and you really need. And if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes as my mom would say just for a moment. Stand in their shoes.”In a message to the world, President Biden said: “America has been tested, and we’ve come out stronger for it.” He promised to “repair our alliances” and engage with the world once again, not to face yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges”.Biden’s inauguration was nothing like any before. It took place amid unprecedented security with more than 25,000 National Guard troops deployed all around the US Capitol and the White House, with military vehicles, tall wire fences and concrete blocks turning downtown Washington DC into a fortress, in anticipation of “armed protests by pro-Trump supporters who had on January 6 stormed the US Capitol, fired up by Trump’s false claims of election fraud.The Trumps did not attend the inauguration. They were on their way to their adoptive home state of Florida before the ceremony got underway. Former presidents and first ladies Barack Obama and Michelle Obama , George W Bush and Laura Bush and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton attended the event. Former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn Carter did not attend, as they are staying away from public events in recent months because of their advance age and Covid-19. Former Vice-President Dick Cheney and wife Lynne Cheney were also invited but were unable to attend on their doctors’ advice.Trump and Melania Trump took their last ride out of White House on Marne One, the presidential helicopter, at 8:00 am local time as scheduled, not honouring a long-running transfer-of-power ritual of welcoming their successors, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. Trump did leave a note for Biden on the Resolute Desk, respecting one part of the ritual at least.In a farewell speech at a military base outside Washington DC, Trump spoke of his achievements and boasted of his 75 million votes in an election he lost convincingly to Biden, by 232-306 in electoral college votes and 7 million in popular votes, which he has refused to acknowledge. “I will be watching; I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better,” Trump said to a modestly attended event, skipped by most Republicans leaders, including Vice-President Pence, who were mostly all at Biden’s inauguration. “I wish the new administration, great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again, we put it in a position like it’s never been before.”“We love you,” he said in conclusion. “We will be back in some form.”But the power capital was already coming together, with one of the most divisive US presidents out of the way. Congressional Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy joined Biden and Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer and at a prayer service before the inauguration, and then attended the swearing-in. Vice-President Mike Pence attended the inauguration as well as did Ted Cruz, one of the leading Republican senators to challenge Biden’s election.Biden will get down to work right away, and is expected to sign around a dozen executive orders, which his chief of staff Ronald Klain has said, return the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change and rescind a travel ban on nationals from certain Muslim-majority countries, reversing some of Trump most controversial orders. Biden will also issue an order mandating masks on federal property and interstate transport, in what has been called a “100 Day Mask Challenge”.Biden arrived from Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday, and headed to a solemn memorial service at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool for those who died in the Covid-19 pandemic. “To heal, we must remember. And it is hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal,” Biden said in brief remarks, adding, “It is important to do that as a nation.”“Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we have lost,” he said.The Biden inauguration committee, which organised the memorial, installed 400 lights around the pool, each representing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths. They were lit as Biden and Harris spoke.Iconic buildings outside Washington DC, such as the Empire State Building in New York and the Space Needle in Seattle were illuminated similarly as were others across the country.At a brief event in Wilmington, Delaware, before starting for Washington DC, the president-elect got emotional speaking about his journey so far and his eldest son Beau Biden who died of brain cancer in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assumes-us-presidency-with-a-rousing-call-to-unity-101611168860065.html

Imran Khan also mentioned areas where his country wants to work with the US, and regional peace is one of them."Look forward to working with @POTUS in building a stronger Pak-US partnership through trade & economic engagement, countering climate change, improving public health, combating corruption & promoting peace in region & beyond," Imran Khan tweeted in both English and Urdu.I congratulate President @JoeBiden on his inauguration. Look forward to working with @POTUS in building a stronger Pak-US partnership through trade & economic engagement, countering climate change, improving public health, combating corruption & promoting peace in region & beyondPakistan's proximity with China changed the dynamics of US-Pakistan relationship in the Trump regime. In 2018, Donald Trump stopped all financial and security aid to Pakistan, citing lack of cooperation in the fight against terrorism.As Biden is now at the helm of US presidency, alliances are likely to be rewritten. In his inauguration speech too, Biden talked about repairing alliances, of leading "not by the example of power but by the power of the example".Biden's defense pick Gen Lloyd Austin has recently expressed his understanding of India and Pakistan. Asked if there had been any change in Pakistan’s cooperation with the US after American security aid was cut off in 2018, Austin replied: “I understand Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-congratulates-joe-biden-mentions-peace-as-joint-agenda-101611167167324.html
