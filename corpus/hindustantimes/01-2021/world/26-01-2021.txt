26-01-2021||World||Antony Blinken succeeds Mike Pompeo as 71st secretary of state||The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony Blinken as America’s top diplomat, tasked with carrying out President Joe Biden’s commitment to reverse the Trump administration’s “America First” doctrine that weakened international alliances.Senators voted 78-22 to approve Blinken, a longtime Biden confidant, as the nation’s 71st secretary of state, succeeding Mike Pompeo. The position is the most senior Cabinet position, with the secretary fourth in the line of presidential succession.Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He has pledged to be a leading force in the administration’s bid to reframe the US relationship with the rest of the world after four years in which President Donald Trump questioned longtime alliances. He is expected to start work on Wednesday after being sworn in, according to State Department officials.“American leadership still matters,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his Jan. 19 confirmation hearing. “The reality is, the world simply does not organize itself. When we’re not engaged, when we’re not leading, then one of two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place, but not in a way that’s likely to advance our interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does and then you have chaos.”Blinken vowed that the Biden administration would approach the world with both humility and confidence, saying “we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad.”Despite promising renewed American leadership and an emphasis on shoring up strained ties with allies in Europe and Asia, Blinken told lawmakers that he agreed with many of Trump’s foreign policy initiatives. He backed the so-called Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, and a tough stance on China over human rights and its assertiveness in the South China Sea.He did, however, signal that the Biden administration is interested in bringing Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew in 2018.Trump's secretaries of state nominees met with significant opposition from Democrats. Trump’s first nominee for the job, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, was approved by a 56 to 43 vote and served only 13 months before Trump fired him in tweet. His successor, Pompeo, was confirmed in a 57-42 vote.Opposition to Blinken centered on Iran policy and concerns among conservatives that he will abandon Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.Blinken inherits a deeply demoralized and depleted career workforce at the State Department. Neither Tillerson nor Pompeo offered strong resistance to the Trump administration’s attempts to gut the agency, which were thwarted only by congressional intervention.Although the department escaped proposed cuts of more than 30% of its budget for three consecutive years, it has seen a significant number of departures from its senior and rising mid-level ranks, Many diplomats opted to retire or leave the foreign service given limited prospects for advancement under an administration that they believed didn't value their expertise.A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School and a longtime Democratic foreign policy presence, Blinken has aligned himself with numerous former senior national security officials who have called for a major reinvestment in American diplomacy and renewed emphasis on global engagement.Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was then-Vice President Biden’s national security adviser before he moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as special envoy for climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-succeeds-mike-pompeo-as-71st-secretary-of-state-101611683439510.html
26-01-2021||World||First private space crew paying $55M each to fly to station on a SpaceX rocket||The first private space station crew was introduced Tuesday: Three men who are each paying $55 million to fly on a SpaceX rocket.They'll be led by a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the trip for next January.“This is the first private flight to the International Space Station. It’s never been done before," said Axiom's chief executive and president Mike Suffredini, a former space station program manager for NASA.While mission commander Michael Lopez-Alegria is well known in space circles, “the other three guys are just people who want to be able to go to space, and we’re providing that opportunity," Suffredini told The Associated Press.The first crew will spend eight days at the space station, and will take one or two days to get there aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule following liftoff from Cape Canaveral.Russia has been in the off-the-planet tourism business for years, selling rides to the International Space Station since 2001. Other space companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin plan to take paying customers on up-and-down flights lasting just minutes. These trips — much more affordable with seats going for hundreds of thousands versus millions — could kick off this year.Axiom's first customers include Larry Connor, a real estate and tech entrepreneur from Dayton, Ohio, Canadian financier Mark Pathy and Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe, a close friend of Israel's first astronaut Ilan Ramon, who was killed in the space shuttle Columbia accident in 2003.“These guys are all very involved and doing it for kind of for the betterment of their communities and countries, and so we couldn’t be happier with this makeup of the first crew because of their drive and their interest," Suffredini said.Each of these first paying customers intends to perform science research in orbit, he said, along with educational outreach.Lopez-Alegria, a former space station resident and spacewalking leader, called the group a “collection of pioneers."Tom Cruise was mentioned last year as a potential crew member; NASA top officials confirmed he was interested in filming a movie at the space station. There was no word Tuesday on whether Cruise will catch the next Axiom flight. Suffredini declined to comment.Each of the private astronauts had to pass medical tests and will get 15 weeks of training, according to Suffredini. The 70-year-old Connor will become the second-oldest person to fly in space, after John Glenn's shuttle flight in 1998 at age 77. He'll also serve under Lopez-Alegria as the capsule pilot.Axiom plans about two private missions a year to the space station. It also is working to launch its own live-in compartments to the station beginning in 2024. This section would be detached from the station once it's retired by NASA and the international partners, and become its own private outpost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-private-space-crew-paying-55m-each-to-fly-to-station-on-a-spacex-rocket-101611681152965.html

About 83% of the guns were loaded.The rate was double that in 2019, when screeners found 5 guns for every million passengers. However, with 500 million more travelers screened in 2019, TSA officers found a record 4,432 guns that year.Screeners found 220 guns at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, followed by 176 at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, 126 at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, 126 at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, and 104 at Denver International Airport.Federal law prohibits passengers other than certain law enforcement officers from bringing guns or ammunition into the cabin. Federal law allows passengers to put guns in checked bags that go into the cargo hold if they are unloaded and in a locked case.Airlines don't have to permit guns even in checked bags. All leading US carriers temporarily banned guns in checked bags on flights to Washington, D.C.-area airports for a week after the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Those bans lapsed last weekend, three days after the inauguration of President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rate-of-guns-seized-at-us-airport-checkpoints-jumped-in-2020-101611680170592.html
26-01-2021||World||Moderna Covid-19 jabs can be up to six weeks apart: WHO||World Health Organization experts on Tuesday cautiously backed delaying second injections of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine in some situations, as they did for the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs.The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) also insisted international travellers should not be prioritised for any Covid-19 jabs for the time being.During a meeting last week, the experts discussed the Moderna vaccine which, like that of Pfizer-BioNTech, uses mRNA technology and is being rolled out across the world.Both vaccines require boosters after three to four weeks, but several countries facing limited vaccine supplies have said they will delay administering the second injection so that more people can benefit from receiving a first dose.The WHO's vaccine advisory group said it was best to respect the tested intervals between doses of 21 days in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 28 days for Moderna.But earlier this month, it said that in "exceptional circumstances" it was possible to wait for up to 42 days to administer the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and on Tuesday, it said the same for the Moderna jabs.Head of the SAGE, Alejandro Cravioto, warned in a virtual press briefing though that "the evidence we have does not go beyond that" six-week cut off.'As quickly as possible' The UN health agency has so far approved only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but it is expected to issue approval for the Moderna jab soon."We're working with Moderna to go as quickly as possible," WHO's vaccines chief Kate O'Brien told the online briefing.The two vaccines are very similar, the experts said, except for the storage requirements, with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab needed to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), while Moderna doses can be stored at -20 C.With vaccine supplies still limited, the WHO has called for health workers and the most vulnerable to be prioritised and SAGE reinforced the message on Tuesday."In the current period of very limited vaccine supply, preferential vaccination of international travellers would counter the principle of equity," SAGE said."Because of this, and the lack of evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of transmission, SAGE currently does not recommend Covid-19 vaccination of travellers."Allergic reactions 'rare' SAGE also recommended Tuesday that the Moderna vaccine, like the Pfizer-BioNTech one, should only be administered in settings that can deal with potential anaphylactic reaction.But the experts stressed this was the usual recommendation for most vaccination programmes, pointing to findings from US health authorities last week indicating that severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine was "rare".SAGE said there was not enough data to make recommendations on the use of the Moderna jab while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.And the experts said in situations where there was a shortage of vaccines, people who had been infected with Covid-19 in the previous six months and therefore likely had immunity could opt to postpone vaccination.But "we are not recommending that programmes exclude individuals on that basis", SAGE executive secretary Joachim Hombach told the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-jabs-can-be-up-to-six-weeks-apart-who-101611680419798.html
26-01-2021||World||Poland's population rapidly shrinking under pandemic||Statistics for 2020 show deaths spiked in Poland to a level unseen since World War II and births sharply declined, trends attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and described by some as a demographic crisis.The data reported Tuesday by the daily newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna came from a state register that includes weekly births and deaths.Poland, a nation with a population of more than 38 million, registered 357,400 births last year, the lowest number since 2005, and some 486,200 deaths from various causes, the highest number registered since the war, in which Poland lost millions of citizens.The overall data showed a population loss of some 129,000 people in 2020, compared with a decline of some 36,400 the year before.Poland's population has slowly decreased in the past two decades mostly due to the emigration of young people seeking better opportunities.The low birth rate surprised observers because some experts predicted the lockdown measures the Polish government has imposed on and off since mid-March would lead to a baby boom, the newspaper said. Communist-era martial law restrictions in Poland during the early 1980s produced such an uptick in births.Demography expert Piotr Szukalski told Dziennik Gazeta Prawna he thinks that deep concerns about the spread of the coronavirus are to blame.Minister of Family and Social Policy Marlena Malag ascribed the high death rate to the pandemic and said it would take a long time for the current government program of family benefits intended to boost the birth rate to reverse the negative trend.Commenting on data the state agency Statistics Poland released in December for 11 months of 2020, economist Rafal Mundry said the number of deaths was the highest since World War II, and the number of births the lowest in 15 years.“We have a huge demographic crisis,” Mundry said on Twitter.In 2019, some 30,000 people died in Poland each month on average. In November, when COVID-19 cases spiked, the country registered almost 60,400 deaths.The high death rate continued in the first three weeks of 2021, with almost 29,000 deaths, compared with some 24,800 deaths in the first three weeks of 2020, before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polands-population-rapidly-shrinking-under-pandemic-101611677612163.html
26-01-2021||World||US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly's, biotech firm Regeneron's Covid-19 antibodies study data shows promising results||US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly's combination of two synthetic antibodies against Covid-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent in high-risk patients with recent positive tests, the company said Tuesday.The results were called "very encouraging" by Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine."They are the first anti-viral drugs that demonstrably work in the first phase of the disease just after the virus has infected someone but before it has had time to cause a lot of damage," he said.The phase 3 trial involving 1,035 people achieved its main goal, and the study also met its secondary goals of reducing patients' viral load and their time to recover from the disease.Patients were assigned either a placebo or the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, the two antibodies, at 2.8 grams each.There were 11 hospitalizations in the patients who received the therapy, or 2.1 percent of that group.In the placebo arm, there were 36 deaths or hospitalizations, or 7.0 percent of the group.The therapy thus represented a risk reduction of 70 percent, and the result was statistically significant, meaning it was unlikely to have occurred by chance.There were 10 deaths total, all of which occurred in patients taking placebo, and none in the therapy group."Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together have the potential to be an important treatment that significantly reduces hospitalizations and death in high-risk COVID-19 patients," Lilly's chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky said.The company said it would continue to study the drug in another trial to examine whether lower doses would yield the same impact.A peer-reviewed scientific paper is still awaited.- 'Passive vaccination' -In another development, US biotech firm Regeneron announced positive interim results from its phase 3 study of REGEN-COV, a combination of two antibodies, for use as a passive vaccine.An exploratory analysis looked at data from approximately 400 patients, roughly half given the 1.2 grams of the drug by a subcutaneous injection, the other half given a placebo.Out of 223 given the placebo, eight went on to get symptomatic Covid-19, while none of the 186 given REGEN-COV did -- in other words a 100 percent reduction in symptomatic infections.It also reduced the overall rate of infection, whether with symptoms or without, by 50 percent.Finally, the drug markedly decreased the levels of the virus among people who received the drug and became asymptomatically infected versus those in the placebo group."These data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected," said George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's president and chief scientific officer.The final results of the study are expected in the second quarter.- Slow uptake -Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made versions of the body's natural infection-fighting defenses.Our bodies develop these proteins in response to pathogens, and vaccines train the immune systems to be prepared without encountering the live microbe itself.Giving people ready-made antibodies can help those who are at high risk of severe disease because of weak immunity or underlying conditions.Many scientists have welcomed their Covid fighting potential, and both Lilly and Regeneron have received US emergency use authorizations for their therapies.But their uptake has been limited by several factors, from a lack of patient interest to not enough staffing and specific places inside hospitals to administer them.It can also be challenging to identify suitable candidates who are at high risk but haven't yet progressed to severe Covid, because by that stage targeting the virus has less impact than using drugs to reduce the body's overactive immune response.In its press release, Lilly acknowledged some of these difficulties."Lilly has received feedback from front-line nurses and doctors administering these infusions regarding the complexity and time requirements for preparation and administration," the statement said.As a result, the company is working with the Food and Drug Administration to potentially reduce the infusion time from the current 60 minutes to as little as 16 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eli-lilly-regeneron-covid-19-antibodies-study-data-shows-promising-results-101611679252906.html
26-01-2021||World||New warning system in Bangladesh to tackle rising landslide risk||A new system that can warn people of landslides nearly a week in advance is set to be launched in Bangladesh later this year, helping tackle increasing risks from a disaster linked to climate-change-driven extreme rainfall, experts said on Tuesday.Developed by the United Nations and Bangladesh's environment ministry, the warning system uses satellite imagery, rainfall measurements and other meteorological data to predict landslides in vulnerable regions.Right now, landslide alerts are provided more informally, based on rain-gauge readings, which amounts to "now-casting, not forecasting" and doesn't take into account geological data, said a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization spokesman.Initially, the new alerts are likely to be introduced in May, when the monsoon season begins, in Cox's Bazar in southeast Bangladesh.Besides at-risk Bangladeshis, the area is home to nearly a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who have lived there since they fled their country in 2017.Researchers have gathered data on the area including soil properties and the history of landslides, as well as rainfall thresholds likely to trigger events, FAO officials said.The information will be used to produce warnings at least five days in advance of expected landslides, they said.If succesful, the system - developed by the FAO and the International Organization for Migration - could be expanded to other parts of the country as well, they added.Experts on adapting to climate change said such warnings could save lives, particularly among the country's most vulnerable."Increased heavy downpours which may be due to climate change will definitely cause greater likelihood of more landslides in the hilly areas," said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development."It would be ... very important for the communities vulnerable to landslides to get warnings to enable them to survive," he added. Bangladesh is highly threatened by landslides, particularly during monsoon periods, and the number of disasters has been on the rise due to increasingly severe weather, losses of soil-holding trees and excavation work in hilly areas.Between 2000 and 2018 landslides killed at least 700 people in the Chittagong Hill districts in southeastern Bangladesh, according to the FAO.The low-lying nation is often included on lists of countries most at risk from the impacts of rising global temperatures, from more extreme storms to floods.Scott Hussey, a spokesman for FAO, said it was important to remember "that no early warning system related to any hazard can be 100% accurate".Making the system work effectively will require continual work to refine and upgrade it, as well as efforts to create better awareness of landslide risks among local communities, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via e-mail.Solaiman Haider, a senior official from Bangladesh's Department of Environment, said the system was promising but still in its early stages."We will come to know how well it works and to what extent people accept this during the monsoons," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-warning-system-in-bangladesh-to-tackle-rising-landslide-risk-101611668554875.html
26-01-2021||World||Trump impeachment trial faces challenge from Republican Senator Paul||The Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the deadly Capitol siege could draw its first challenge on Tuesday, with a Republican senator arguing that trying a former president would violate the US Constitution.Trump is the only president to have been impeached by the House of Representatives twice and is the first to face a trial after leaving power, with the possibility of being disqualified from future public office if convicted by chamber's 100 senators serving as jurors. The trial is expected to begin on Feb. 9.Senator Rand Paul, a Trump ally, has pledged to force a vote on whether the Constitution allows the Senate to try the former president who is now a private citizen. Trump left office on Jan. 20.The House approved a single article of impeachment - the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal trial - on Jan. 13, accusing him of inciting an insurrection with an incendiary speech to supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. A police officer and four others died in the melee."I will force a vote on whether the Senate can hold a trial of a private citizen," Paul wrote on Twitter late on Monday, voicing an objection also raised by other Republicans.Paul is expected to speak on the Senate floor around midday.There is a debate among scholars over whether the Senate can hold a trial for Trump now that he has left office. Many experts have said "late impeachment" is constitutional, arguing that presidents who engage in misconduct late in their terms should not be immune from the very process set out in the Constitution for holding them accountable.The Constitution makes clear that impeachment proceedings can result in disqualification from holding office the future, so there is still an active issue for the Senate to resolve, these scholars have said.At least 17 Republican would need to join all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided Senate for Trump to be convicted, a two-thirds threshold that appears unlikely to be reached. Trump remains a powerful force among Republicans and his supporters have vowed to mount election challenges to lawmakers in the party who support conviction.Some Republicans have criticized Trump's false claims of voting fraud and his failed efforts to overturn President Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory. But no Senate Republicans have said definitively that they plan to vote to convict him.A vote on Paul's objection could come on Tuesday afternoon, when the 100 senators are expected to be sworn in for their role as jurors. Paul's office was not immediately available for comment.Paul also has objected to plans to have Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy preside at the trial. U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presided at Trump's first impeachment trial, which ended in his acquittal in February 2020 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son.Paul cited language in the Constitution that states: "When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside."Although the Constitution calls on the chief justice to preside over presidential impeachment trials, a senator presides when the impeached is not the current president, a Senate source said. First elected to the chamber in 1974, Leahy, 80, holds the title of Senate president pro tempore.The nine House Democrats who will serve as prosecutors set the trial in motion on Monday by delivering the article of impeachment to the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-trial-faces-challenge-from-republican-senator-paul-101611674884022.html
26-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron push for return to pre-Trump cooperation||The leaders of Germany and France separately called for governments to work more closely together, signalling their hope that the end of Donald Trump’s four-year term in the US will herald the return of transatlantic collaboration.A week after Joe Biden’s inauguration, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron used virtual addresses to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Davos Agenda to talk up the value of international cooperation and to push for coordinated action on issues ranging from digital taxation to trade and climate change.“This is the hour of multilateralism,” German Chancellor Merkel said. “We see that in such an existential case the attempt to isolate fails long term -- at least in relation to this pandemic it failed.”The German leader, who regularly clashed with Trump’s America First doctrine, said it was an “important sign” that the US is rejoining the World Health Organization and called on President Biden to unblock the World Trade Organization.It was a theme picked up by France’s president, Macron, who said that multilateralism “was blocked by the US administration that didn’t believe in it” under Trump.“I have great hopes this year, with a US partner who I hope will come back,” he said. “We need to build an efficient multilateral system that will allow a new consensus.”Merkel wants the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to quickly reach an agreement on digital taxation and called for a global antitrust regime to tackle cross-border competition issues, while Macron welcomed the US’s new commitment to the Paris climate accord.In a telephone call between Biden and Macron on Sunday, the two men covered issues from NATO to climate change. When the new US president spoke to Merkel on Monday, Biden spoke of his intent to “revitalize the transatlantic alliance, including through NATO and with the European Union,” according to a White House readout. Merkel invited Biden to visit Germany once pandemic-related travel restrictions ease.Multilateralism, and in particularly cooperation between the EU and a post-Trump US, was a theme explored by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her Davos address earlier in the day.“The challenges to our democracy, the pandemic, climate change -- in his inauguration speech President Joe Biden so aptly spoke of a cascade of crises and, indeed, we face an outstanding set of challenges,” von der Leyen said. “But we can meet them if we work together; that is what we all have to learn again after four long years.”She spoke in particular about the difficulties posed to democracy and freedom of speech by social media and said she wanted Europe and the US to join forces to “create a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-and-emmanuel-macron-push-for-return-to-pre-trump-cooperation-101611676411326.html
26-01-2021||World||Iran approves Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine||Iran has approved Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday, in a win for Moscow as it aims to bolster its geopolitical clout.Iran, which is fighting the Middle East's deadliest outbreak, has said it will only rely on vaccines made by Russia, India or China, while also working to produce a homemade jab.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAfter talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Zarif confirmed Sputnik V had been approved on Monday, adding: "In the near future we hope we will be able to purchase it, as well as start joint production."Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei this month banned the use of vaccines made by the United States and Britain, calling the jabs "completely untrustworthy".Iran had earlier said it would wait for the World Health Organization's approval of Russia's jab before buying it.Russia registered the shot -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- in August last year, before the start of large-scale clinical trials, leaving some experts wary.Sputnik V's developers have since said the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective and several countries outside of Russia have begun administering it, including Argentina.Russia last week filed for registration of Sputnik V in the European Union, while EU member Hungary broke ranks and purchased two million doses of the jab before the bloc had approved it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-approves-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-101611675397816.html
26-01-2021||World||UK hits grim Covid-19 death toll figure of 100,000||The UK on Tuesday hit another grim Covid-19 milestone as the country's death toll from the deadly virus crossed 100,000 since the peak of the pandemic last year.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) assessment of death certificate data reveals that there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since last year. The UK government's daily death toll figures rely on positive coronavirus tests in the past 28 days and are therefore slightly lower, at 98,531.The ONS figures show that a total of 7,245 registered deaths in England and Wales mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate in the week ending January 15, which is up from 6,057 deaths the week before and is the highest weekly number since April 24, 2020."It is a tragedy that we have now seen more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. This is a dreadful milestone to have reached, and behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,” said Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, a membership organisation for the state-funded National Health Service (NHS)."We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects – but, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities disproportionately,” he said, urging continued “vigilance” among all communities and strictly following the rules of social distancing.“The vaccine offers hope for the future. This is a key phase in the fight to end Covid-19 but we must stay the course until the end is truly in sight,” he added.The latest figures come as the UK government is considering further measures in its fight against a high rate of infections, including the possibility of imposing compulsory 10-day hospital quarantine for travellers entering Britain from regions believed to be at a high risk of spreading new variants of coronavirus.“The NHS is still under intense pressure across all parts of the country with 37,899 people in UK hospitals with Covid-19 – and that includes 4,076 on ventilators,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, as he reiterated the message for people to continue following lockdown restrictions.The minister highlighted that his department-led vaccination programme remains on track to meet the government-set target of covering all those under the top priority groups by mid-February, despite vaccine supply pressures.“The rate limiting factor to this vaccination programme remains supply. As we know, supply is tight. We’ve had a very strong performance in this past week. And I’m confident that the NHS will deliver every shot that’s made available to it,” he said, adding that 78.7 per cent of all over 80s have now been vaccinated as of Monday.The government has also rolled out a new Community Champions scheme through local councils, fielding popular celebrities including British Indian actors Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar, to help combat reluctance among minority communities towards being vaccinated.“It is vital that everyone has access to accurate and up to date information about Covid-19. False information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives,” said Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.Over 23 million pounds funding has been allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from Covid-19 and boost vaccine take up.“We want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine and I have been working closely with faith and community leaders to ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine,” said Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi.“The expansion of the Community Champions scheme will help everyone get the advice and information they need about Covid-19 vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hits-grim-covid-19-death-toll-figure-of-100000-101611674968027.html
26-01-2021||World||China hopes Joe Biden will 'learn a lesson' from Donald Trump's wrong policies||Day after the White House said that US President Joe Biden is committed to stopping China's economic abuses, Beijing on Tuesday said that it "hopes" that the new US administration will "learn a lesson" from the previous Donald Trump administration.Speaking at the regular press briefing, Zhao Lijian, Ministry of Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, said, "We hope the new US administration will learn from the Trump administration's lessons where they carried out the wrong policies on China. We hope the new administration will view China and China-US relations in an objective and rational manner, implement China policies that are positive and constructive, meet with China half way, focus on cooperation, manage differences, and bring China-US relations back on the right track of sound and stable development."On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, said that Washington has seen over the last few years that China is growing more authoritarian at home, challenging security and prosperity abroad."We're committed to -- the President is committed to stopping China's economic abuses on many fronts, and the most effective way to do that is through working in concert with our allies and partners to do exactly that," she added.She said that Washington is in "serious competition" with Beijing and added that the Chinese Government is engaged in conduct that it "hurts American workers, blunts our technological edge, and threatens our alliances and our influence in international organizations.""What we've seen over the last few years is that China is growing more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. And Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity, and values in significant ways that require a new US approach."The President's view is that the US needs to play a "better defence" that must include holding China accountable for its unfair and illegal practices and making sure that American technologies aren't facilitating China's military build-up, the White House secretary said.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hopes-joe-biden-will-learn-a-lesson-from-donald-trump-s-wrong-policies-101611673034756.html
26-01-2021||World||Thai court acquits 80-year-old writer of defaming monarchy||An 80-year-old writer accused of defaming Thailand's monarchy in 2015 because of comments he made at a public seminar about the constitution was acquitted Tuesday by the Criminal Court.The court ruled that Bundit Aneeya had not violated the lese majeste law because he had not specifically referred to royalty and had not used rude language.The punishment for violating the law is three to 15 years’ imprisonment on each count.The court last week gave a record sentence of 43 1/2 years under the law to a woman arrested six years ago who posted audio clips online deemed critical of the monarchy. The former civil servant had her nominal sentence of 87 years halved because she pleaded guilty.In the past two months, the authorities have pursued lese majeste cases against at least 54 people, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.They acted after growing public criticism of the monarchy, once virtually unknown, by a youth-led pro-democracy movement. The protest movement seeks reform of the monarchy, which it says is unaccountable and has excessive power in what is supposed to be a democratic constitutional monarchy.After King Maha Vajralongkorn took the throne in 2016 following his father’s death, he informed the government that he did not wish to see the lese majeste law used. But as the protests grew last year and criticism of the monarchy got harsher, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha warned a line had been crossed and the law would be used.Bundit was prosecuted for saying at a seminar at Bangkok’s Thammasat University that “Human value and dignity of Thais must be higher than dust under someone’s feet.”By tradition, Thai citizens who see themselves as subjects of the king refer to themselves as “the dust under your feet” when formally addressing the monarch.The seminar was convened by an activist group opposed to the junta that took power in a 2014 military coup, and solicited public comments on a draft constitution to replace the one nullified in the army takeover.Police and military agents monitored the meeting and took Bundit into custody as soon as he made a proposal for five principles that should be enshrined in the charter, including human dignity.He was formally accused only in 2017, when a military prosecutor alleged that his remark was a derogatory reference to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.The lese majeste law is supposed to cover the king, his immediate family and any regent, but has sometimes been applied more broadly.It was the third lese majeste case filed against Bundit, who is in poor health. He was convicted in one previous case, for which he received a suspended sentence, and acquitted in the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-court-acquits-80-year-old-writer-of-defaming-monarchy-101611670545952.html
26-01-2021||World||Iran urges Joe Biden to lift sanctions affecting medicines as it fights Covid-19||Iran urged US President Joe Biden on Tuesday to lift sanctions which it said were hampering Tehran's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Tehran also said it had approved Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine for domestic use, and that it was trying to buy vaccines from AstraZeneca and other companies.Sanctions reimposed by former US President Donald Trump formally exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, but many foreign banks have been deterred from doing business with Iran."Since (Biden's) administration claims not to be anti-science like the previous one ..., one expects it to free the transfer of Iran's own foreign exchange resources to fight the coronavirus and for health and food, and lift banking sanctions quickly," government spokesman Ali Rabiei told state television.He also threatened that Iran would block short-notice inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities by the United Nations atomic agency if Washington did not lift sanctions.In 2018, Trump pulled Washington out of Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with world powers aimed at limiting its nuclear programme, and reimposed US sanctions that had been lifted under it.During a visit to Moscow, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Tuesday that Tehran planned to import and produce the Sputnik V vaccine.Deputy Health Minister Qassem Janbabaei told state television that "AstraZeneca in Sweden" was among companies from which it was considering buying vaccines from overseas, but made no reference to the Anglo-Swedish company's British ties.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top authority, has banned the government from importing US and British-made vaccines, which he said were unreliable and may be used to spread the infection to other nations.President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that vaccinations would begin in the coming weeks.Tehran launched human trials of the first of its three domestic vaccine candidates late last month, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite US sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.Iran is also participating in the COVAX scheme that aims to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries.Iran has recorded nearly 1.39 million cases of Covid-19 and 57,560 deaths, according to government data, but there has been a decline in new infections and deaths in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-urges-joe-biden-to-lift-sanctions-affecting-medicines-as-it-fights-covid19-101611667419979.html
26-01-2021||World||UK launches new global platform to track new Covid-19 variants||The UK launched a New Variant Assessment Platform on Tuesday, which it says will offer the country's world-leading genomics expertise to identify new variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 to countries who do not have the resources to do so.As part of the UK’s Presidency of the G7 this year, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined the plans in a speech at the think tank Chatham House – the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London as he laid out his vision for a stronger, more collaborative and effective global health system, not just in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, but to ensure the international community is better prepared for future threats.“This pandemic has shown that the foundations of so many of the exciting experiences that make life worth living are contingent not just on our health, or the health of our neighbours, but the health of people we’ve never met. When one of us suffers, we all suffer,” said Hancock.“So we must work to promote health security in every single part of the world. Not only will this Platform help us better understand this virus and how it spreads, but it will also boost global capability in this important field, so we’re all better prepared for whatever lies ahead,” he said.Countries will be offered UK capacity to analyse new strains of the virus through the launch of the platform led by Public Health England (PHE), working with NHS Test and Trace and academic partners as well as the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) SARS-CoV-2 Global Laboratory Working Group. In due course, it will be led by the National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP) and will involve PHE laboratories and staff as well as academic partner capabilities.Dr Isabel Oliver, Director of Public Health England’s National Infection Service, said: “We know that the virus will evolve over time and certain mutations could potentially cause the virus to spread faster, make people sicker, or possibly affect how well vaccines work. Genomic testing is crucial to our efforts to control the virus – it allows us to keep an eye on how the virus is changing and to respond before it’s too late.“This new initiative will bring Public Health England’s cutting edge science to countries that have little or no ability to sequence and analyse Covid-19 virus strains themselves. It will also give us crucial early warning of new variants emerging around the world that might endanger the UK.”The platform will be working directly on samples provided from abroad or will provide expert advice and support remotely where the partner country already has some capabilities in this area but requests further assistance. The offer could include training and resources as well as personnel and equipment.Countries will be able to apply for assistance by contacting the WHO where an existing channel does not already exist with the UK.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) describes the move as vital work to combat the spread of coronavirus by identifying more Covid-19 variants around the world to keep the global community one step ahead of any mutations.The UK has carried out more than half of all SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to the global database, and this capability helped PHE’s scientists identify the variant in Kent, southern England, informing new measures to tackle the spread of the virus.“New variants of coronavirus can be threats to the progress made so far with treatments and vaccines, so it is vital that the global community is able to react to them quickly and decisively,” the DHSC said.The aim of the new platform is for the UK’s genomic expertise to guide the global response to controlling the spread of deadly viruses and saving lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-launches-new-global-platform-to-track-new-covid-19-variants-101611670055368.html
26-01-2021||World||China, New Zealand ink trade deal as Beijing calls for reduced global barriers||China and New Zealand signed a deal on Tuesday upgrading a free trade pact to give exports from the Pacific nation greater access to the world's second-largest economy.The pact comes as Beijing seeks to establish itself as a strong advocate of multilateralism after a bruising trade war with the United States, at a time when the coronavirus has forced the closure of many international borders.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed the signing of the expanded deal."China remains one of our most important trade partners...For this to take place during the global economic crisis bought about by Covid-19 makes it particularly important," she told a news conference.The pact widens an existing trade deal with China to ensure it remains fit for purpose for another decade, Trade Minister Damien O’Connor said in a statement.It provides for tariffs to be either removed or cut on many of New Zealand's mostly commodities-based exports, ranging from dairy to timber and seafood, while compliance costs will also be reduced.For a factbox on key deal points, please click on the square brackets:"The upgrade shows the two sides' firm determination to support multilateralism and free trade," Zhao Lijian, a spokesman of China's foreign ministry, told a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.The previous day, speaking at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, President Xi Jinping had criticised isolationism and "Cold War" thinking and called for barriers to trade, investment and technological exchange to be removed.In recent months, Beijing has signed an investment pact with the European Union and joined the world's largest free trade bloc in the 15-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes New Zealand.China has also expressed interest in joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) Agreement, the successor to a pact from which Washington withdrew.China's new deal with Wellington also opens up sectors such as aviation, education and finance. In exchange, New Zealand will increase visa quotas for Chinese language teachers and tour guides, the official Xinhua news agency said.New Zealand was the first developed nation to sign a free trade pact with China in 2008, and has long been touted by Beijing as an exemplar of Western engagement.China is now New Zealand’s largest trading partner, with annual two-way trade of more than NZ$32 billion ($21.58 billion).But ties have been tested under Ardern's government as New Zealand criticised China’s influence on small Pacific islands and raised human rights concerns about Muslim Uighurs.Ardern also backed Taiwan’s participation at the World Health Organization (WHO) despite a warning from Beijing.The wider trade pact also comes as Beijing's ties with neighbouring Australia worsened after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first reported in central China.Australia has appealed to the World Trade Organization to review China's decision to impose hefty tariffs on imports of its barley.New Zealand, which will host the regional Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this year, has said it would be willing to help negotiate a truce between China and Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-new-zealand-ink-trade-deal-as-beijing-calls-for-reduced-global-barriers-101611650515131.html

He said 0.014% had contracted milder forms of COVID-19.Israel began what has become the world's fastest per capita distribution of vaccines against the new coronavirus on Dec. 19, using the shot developed by the American firm Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioNTech.According to Health Ministry figures, 23% have received the first shot and more than 6% the second, between 21 and 28 days later.The ministry blames highly communicable variants originating abroad for setbacks in Israel's bid to halt the spread of the virus.A week after beginning vaccinations, it imposed its third national lockdown, which officials say may need to be extended into February.But last Thursday it reported a reproduction number - known as "R" - of less than 1, which indicates that epidemic is no longer growing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-serious-covid-19-cases-among-israelis-given-pfizer-shot-says-health-minister-101611663440110.html
26-01-2021||World||Twitter bans major Republican donor Mike Lindell over Capitol riots||Twitter on Monday (local time) banned Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow who is a major Republican donor and supporter of former President Donald Trump, for repeated violations of its new policy enacted after the Capitol riots in the US.According to a report by CNN, the decision to ban Lindell's account was taken based on Twitter's new policy whereby people who repeatedly share election misinformation can be permanently banned."The account you referenced has been permanently suspended due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy," the Twitter spokesperson said.Though it is not clear which tweets led to the ban on Lindell's account, Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling MyPillow products after Lindell voiced continued support for former President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and voicing false statements publicly about the validity of the election, CNN reported.According to an earlier report by New York Times, Lindell, a big Republican donor, had called the violence in the Capitol as "very peaceful".He had further stated, "There was probably some undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people and did some damage to windows and got in there."Twitter's Civic Integrity policy states: "You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes".This has resulted in Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene being locked out of her account for 12 hours two weeks ago, CNN said.Earlier this month, Twitter had banned Donald Trump citing the Capitol riots."After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence," Twitter said.On January 6, a group of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest legislators confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid.Trump had made a speech among thousands of supporters reiterating his claim a massive voter fraud had robbed his election victory and encouraged supporters to maintain support to "stop the steal."Five people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot dead by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-bans-major-republican-donor-mike-lindell-over-capitol-riots-101611663449083.html
26-01-2021||World||Italian PM Conte resigns, leaving country adrift in the midst of the pandemic||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned after losing his Senate majority, plunging the country into political uncertainty just as it’s battling the pandemic and a recession.Weakened by the defection of a junior partner, Conte offered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella on Tuesday, according to a statement from the president’s office. The head of state, who oversees attempts to forge new governments, will hold a round of talks with party leaders before he nominates someone to forge a fresh coalition, the statement said.Conte is angling for a new mandate to form what would be his third government in four years. His plan, according to officials familiar with his thinking, is to forge a broader alliance including pro-European centrists and unaffiliated lawmakers -- and possibly even bringing back some members of ex-Premier Matteo Renzi’s Italy Alive party, who abandoned his second administration earlier this month.But Mattarella could also decide that there’s a better candidate to pull together a majority in the fragmented parliament, or even that elections are necessary to return the country to political stability.After fighting for two weeks to shore up his position, Conte’s hand was forced by the prospect of losing a Senate vote on the judiciary due as soon as Wednesday. A defeat there would have damaged his authority and reduced his chances of being granted a new opportunity by Mattarella, according to an official who spoke before the resignation.The timing of the turmoil has baffled many Italians, with the more than 400 people a day dying while Conte and Renzi tussled and growing evidence of a further hit to the country’s battered public finances. But there was also unease at Conte’s willingness to use emergency powers just as the prospect of the European Union’s recovery package is raising the stakes.Officially, Renzi’s dispute with Conte was driven by disagreements over how the 209 billion euros ($250 billion) of grants and loans should be spent and how the spending should be controlled. But there’s also an awareness that whoever is in power over the next two years stands to reap the political gains from that windfall.Compared to previous bouts of political instability in recent years, Italy’s bond markets have been tranquil, thanks largely to the support provided by the European Central Bank’s stimulus. The nation’s 10-year yield spread over Germany, a key gauge of risk, reached its lowest point in almost five years earlier this month and even now is trading less than 20 basis points higher at around 120 basis points.For the time being, though, the Treasury is starting to factor in a bigger hit to the country’s battered public finances this year as another extended lockdown holds back the recovery, a senior government official said.Treasury models suggest the budget deficit may reach as much as 9.2% of output this year, that official said. The government is also looking at a deteriorating outlook for growth and could see the economy expand as little as 4.5% in a worst-case scenario, according to the official. The government’s official projection from October is for a 6% expansion.For the 56-year-old Conte, a lawyer plucked from Florence academia to head his first government in 2018, it’s the second time he’s seen his coalition fall apart. When Matteo Salvini of the anti-migrant League abandoned Conte in 2019, the premier replaced him with the center-left Democratic Party.This time around, the Democrats and Conte’s main allies, the Five Star Movement, are divided even internally on whether or not to negotiate with Renzi, with many believing he cannot be trusted after sniping at the coalition for months and then pulling out, the officials said. One consideration that delayed Conte’s resignation was the concern that Renzi would seek to maneuver someone else into position to replace him as prime minister.While some of the premier’s allies have raised the prospect of early elections to resolve the impasse, coalition leaders still see this is an unlikely option, officials said. Conte’s supporters fear that the center-right would win a snap vote, and fewer seats will be available after parliament was downsized in a constitutional reform.Polls suggest that Five Star would face a drubbing and Renzi’s party could be wiped out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-resigns-amid-political-turmoil-101611662877262.html

The government musters a comfortable majority in the Parliament.The Reform Party emerged as the winner of Estonia's 2019 general election under Kallas' lead but she failed to form a government at the time.Kallas stressed gender balance in forming the new Cabinet, placing several women in key positions such as Reform's Keit Pentus-Rosimannus as finance minister and Eva-Maria Liimets, Estonia's ambassador to the Czech Republic, as the foreign minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/estonias-new-government-sworn-in-with-kaja-kallas-as-first-ever-woman-pm-101611661571850.html
26-01-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden won't have infinite time to rejoin nuclear deal, says Iran||Iran warned the Biden administration on Tuesday that it will not have an indefinite time period on its disposal to rejoin the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.Iran also said it expects Washington to swiftly lift crippling economic sanctions that former President Donald Trump imposed on the country after pulling America out of the atomic accord in 2018, as part of what he called maximum pressure against Iran.Trump cited Iran's ballistic missile program among other issues in withdrawing from the accord. And when the Trump administration increased sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal's limits on its nuclear development.The remarks Tuesday by Iran's Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei are part of pressure that Tehran is trying to exert on the U.S. as it seeks to increase its leverage and get the Biden administration to quickly return to the deal.President Joe Biden has moved swiftly to dismantle Trump's legacy by signing a series of executive actions that reverse course on a wide range of issues, including climate change and immigration.Though Biden has pledged to return to the nuclear deal, Rabiei said there has yet to be any communication between Iran and Biden on the subject.“The U.S. will not have all the time in the world,” Rabiei said. “We are waiting for the official announcement of their stance as well as the lifting of sanctions.”In the meantime, he added that Iran would take a step further away from the nuclear deal by imposing a “restriction” on inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog in late February.In December, Iran's parliament approved a law under which part of the inspections that the deal had provided for would be suspended in February if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not offer relief from oil and banking sanctions.Tensions between Tehran and Washington have steadily increased. During Trump's final days as president, Tehran seized a South Korean oil tanker and begun enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels, while the U.S. has sent B-52 bombers, the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine into the region.Iran has also increased its military drills, including firing cruise missiles as part of a naval drill in the Gulf of Oman this month.Iran has missile capability of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), far enough to reach archenemy Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.Last January, after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad, Tehran retaliated by firing a barrage of ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, resulting in brain concussion injuries to dozens of American soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-won-t-have-infinite-time-to-rejoin-nuclear-deal-says-iran-101611661910017.html

26-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine firms must deliver, says EU chief||Companies producing Covid-19 vaccines "must deliver", EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday as tensions mounted between her European Commission and pharmaceutical firms over delayed deliveries."Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," she said in a live video address to an online-only version of the annual World Economic Forum usually held in Davos, Switzerland."And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations," she said.The Commission is demanding answers of British-Swedish group AstraZeneca and US company Pfizer about delays both have announced to their deliveries to the European Union.In a sign of concern that pharmaceutical groups might be selling the earmarked doses to higher bidders outside the bloc, it is making a move to require the companies to notify authorities of any exports to outside the European Union.Von der Leyen underlined that initiative in her speech, saying "we will set up a vaccine export transparency mechanism" to "ensure" the firms meet their contractual obligations to the EU.The issue is sensitive for von der Leyen, who spearheaded efforts to have the Commission procure more than two billion doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines for the bloc's 27 member states, home to 450 million people.Last week -- after Pfizer's announced delay but before AstraZeneca's -- von der Leyen vowed the aim was to inoculate 70 percent of adults in the EU by the end of August. That goal now looks in jeopardy.The pace of the EU rollout has lagged behind the United States, Britain and Israel, though member states including Malta, Denmark and France have started to accelerate their programmes.In her speech, von der Leyen said the Commission's vaccine procurement was not for the EU alone but also for poorer non-EU countries who are to be supplied through a COVAX vaccination alliance co-led by the World Health Organization.As part of a longer-term strategy to head off this and future health crises, von der Leyen said the EU would propose a public-private entity under a new European Health Emergency Response Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-firms-must-deliver-says-eu-chief-101611660783195.html

We suggest the use of lower doses rather than higher doses because higher doses may lead to other problems," Harris said.She added that a WHO-led team of independent experts, currently in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the first human cases were detected in December 2019, is due to leave quarantine in the next two days to pursue its work with Chinese researchers on the virus origins.She declined to commment on reports of delays in roll-out of vaccines in the European Union. She said she had no specific data and the WHO's priority was for health workers in all countries to be vaccinated in the first 100 days of the year.AstraZeneca, which developed its shot with Oxford University, told the EU on Friday it could not meet agreed supply targets up to the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-issues-new-clinical-advice-on-treating-covid-19-patients-101611660210443.html

Conte won confidence votes in parliament last week, but fell short of an absolute majority, forcing him to take the gamble of resignation.Mattarella, who is the largely ceremonial head of state, can ask Conte to try to form a broader coalition government, appoint a largely technical government to steer the country through the pandemic, or he can dissolve parliament and call elections two years early.The current coalition of the 5-Star Movement, Democratic Party and smaller Leu party are all hoping for a third Conte government. Conte's first government starting in 2018 was a 5-Star alliance with the right-wing League of Matteo Salvini that lasted 15 months. His second, with the Democrats, lasted 16 months.Salvini and center-right opposition parties are clamoring for early elections, hoping to capitalize on polls prior to the government crisis that showed high approval ratings for the League and the right-wing Brothers of Italy party of Giorgia Meloni.Salvini has blasted the “palace games and buying and selling of senators” of recent days as Conte has tried to find new coalition allies, saying Conte is incapable of leading Italy through the crisis.“Let’s use these weeks to give the word back to the people and we’ll have five years of a serious and legitimate parliament and government not chosen in palaces but chosen by Italians,” Salvini said in a video statement Monday.Democratic leader Nicola Zingaretti says early elections are the last thing the country needs. He tweeted Monday: “With Conte for a new clearly European-centric government supported by an ample parliamentary base, that will guarantee credibility and stability to confront the challenges Italy has ahead."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-giuseppe-conte-to-resign-seek-nod-to-form-new-coalition-101611655335657.html
26-01-2021||World||China deploys warships in South China Sea after US aircraft carrier sails by||China on Tuesday deployed warships including amphibious ones for a naval drill in the disputed waters of the South China Sea (SCS) in the backdrop of the US sending an aircraft carrier group in the maritime zone for a “freedom of the seas” operation.Three of China’s front-line docking ships, comprising the Wuzhishan, Changbaishan and Kunlunshan of the southern theatre navy, started an exercise focusing on actual combat training and beach landing exercises in the SCS, a state media report said.More warships from the Chinese navy are set to join the drill, which is expected to formally begin on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, a notice issued by China’s Maritime Safety Administration prohibited entry into a portion of waters in the Gulf of Tonkin to the west of the Leizhou peninsula in southwestern China from January 27-30.The American aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the SCS on Saturday to promote “freedom of the seas”, the US military said, barely days after Joe Biden began his term as president. China claims nearly the entire SCS, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan, which China says is a breakaway region.“The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told reporters on Monday when asked about the presence of US ships in the SCS region.“This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region,” Zhao added.On Tuesday, Zhao reiterated that Beijing hopes Washington will change its policies towards China under the Biden administration.Zhao said in the past few years, the Trump administration had made directional errors, treating China as a strategic competitor or even a threat, and accordingly adopted a series of wrong actions that interfere with China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.“This has led to an unusually severe situation in Sino-US relations that has never been seen since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. This is not in the fundamental interests of the two peoples,” Zhao said.On December 23, the US Navy said China had falsely claimed that it expelled an American warship from the SCS a day before, adding that Beijing was trying to assert its illegitimate claims in the maritime region.Beijing had said the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) southern theatre command deployed ships and aircraft to warn US destroyer USS John S. McCain as it sailed through disputed waters of the SCS.“The PRC’s statement about this mission is false. USS John S. McCain was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory,” Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, told HT in a statement.The US Navy spokesperson said that its ship conducted its operation and left “on our timeline” and were “not expelled”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deploys-warships-in-south-china-sea-after-us-aircraft-carrier-sails-by-101611655702976.html

There is growing anger in the EU about delivery delays from AstraZeneca Plc, which is expected to deliver fewer jabs to the continent in the first quarter than previously expected.Britain has been using both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in its inoculation program, with the latter manufactured domestically.“We have great confidence in Pfizer and their delivery program,” Zahawi said, though he acknowledged “tight” supplies. “We work very closely with our EU partners.”The UK aims to offer vaccines to about 15 million people in its top 4 priority groups by Feb. 15. That includes care home residents, the over 70s and frontline health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-warns-eu-against-vaccine-nationalism-in-row-over-supplies-101611653404948.html
26-01-2021||World||Dutch Covid-19 riots add to political tension ahead of elections||The Netherlands witnessed a third straight evening of riots after the government imposed a curfew to curb the coronavirus pandemic, adding to uncertainty in the run-up to national elections in March.Police arrested more than 150 people after incidents in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and smaller Dutch cities on Monday, according to local media reports. Caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the disturbances as “criminal violence.”It’s not yet clear what impact the unrest will have on elections scheduled for March 17. Rutte’s government resigned on Jan. 15 over a scathing report on childcare benefits, making him the head of a caretaker cabinet until a new government is formed. That process could take months.The latest opinion polls show that 53-year-old Rutte, who has enjoyed strong public support throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, is likely to stay on as premier as his VVD party consolidates its position as front-runner. In Dutch politics, the largest faction in parliament takes the lead in forming a cabinet.Since the start of the curfew on Saturday, there has been widespread unrest in what a local police union has dubbed the worst riots in four decades. People began throwing fireworks at police officers on Sunday in a protest at a square near Amsterdam’s Van Gogh museum, and images showed others looting a supermarket at Eindhoven’s main train station.The incidents come as the country is in a lockdown, with non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed until at least Feb. 9. The nationwide curfew was added to the government’s arsenal amid concern over new coronavirus variants that may spread more quickly.At the same time, overall case numbers have come down in recent weeks. The latest weekly data will be released later on Tuesday.While some protesters seemed focused on destroying property, others voiced their opposition to what they believe is an unjust infringement of their freedom by the government.“This has nothing to do with fighting for freedom,” Rutte said on Monday in The Hague, adding that in his view, 99% of the Dutch people are adhering to the rules -- including the curfew.“We are taking these measures not for the fun of it, but because we are fighting the virus and it is that virus that is taking the freedom from us at the moment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-covid-19-riots-add-to-political-tension-ahead-of-elections-101611653966940.html

Some countries even acquired up to four times what their population needs ... to the exclusion of other countries".Ramaphosa, who currently chairs the African Union, said African countries wanted access to vaccines as quickly as other nations.South Africa's Covid outbreak is the worst in Africa, and the continent as a whole is struggling to secure sufficient vaccines to start countrywide inoculation programmes for its 1.3 billion people."We are all not safe if some countries are vaccinating their people and other countries are not vaccinating," Ramaphosa said.

26-01-2021||World||USIBC recommends big ideas to Biden administration to boost Indo-US ties||The US-India Business Council on Tuesday recommended a slew of big ideas to the new Biden Administration to strengthen the India-US partnership, including reconstituting the existing US-India Trade and Commercial dialogue and creating a new digital partnership under the headship of Vice President Kamala Harris.US India Business Council (USIBC), on the occasion of India’s 72nd Republic Day, also recommended to the Biden Administration to restructure the US-India Strategic Energy Dialogue to include Climate and Sustainable Growth and create a US-India Scholars Endowment to support higher education exchanges.The ideas also include reimagining and reconstitute existing US-India Trade and Commercial Dialogues into a single US-India Strategic Trade Dialogue, creating a new US-India Global Digital Partnership to be headed by Vice President Harris and restructuring the US-India Health Dialogue to expand the mandate and include private sector participation, according to the USIBC.The recommendations reflect USIBC’s long standing view that the natural partnership between the two nations can be leveraged to strengthen both countries’ economic recoveries and create a foundation for economic growth and job creation in the years ahead, it said.USIBC president Nisha Desai Biswal said: “As leaders around the globe reconsider their approach to global trade and investment, both the US and India can and should do more to achieve the shared goal of USD 500 billion in two-way trade”.USIBC said it stands ready to support the Biden administration on work to develop the economic policies that will transform the two economies and create millions of high-quality jobs at home and abroad.The US and India share a common set of values, robust democratic systems, and cultures of entrepreneurship, as well as long standing people-to-people ties that make the two countries natural partners, it said.India-US commercial relationship has seen fast-paced growth over the past decade, with bilateral goods and services trade growing 12.6 per cent in 2019 to reach USD 146.1 billion. Still, the relationship holds significant untapped potential.Business-friendly policies can unlock upwards of USD 150 billion in new trade over the next four years, as resolution of regulatory issues for both US and Indian companies opens the door for more expansive growth, the USIBC said.In its submission, the USIBC recommended that the new USISTD be co-chaired by the US Secretary of Commerce, the US Secretary of State, and the US Trade Representative, who would invite the Government of India to name similar counterparts.The USISTD should focus on reducing trade impediments to strengthen the strategic relationship and support a goal of USD 500 billion in two-way trade by 2024.For the USISTD to succeed, both governments must build a comprehensive “wish list” of core issues of importance to industry, it said.The USIBC has also recommended the two sides set up an expert group consisting of senior officials, industry representatives and academic thought leaders to build a document for discussion under the USISTD.The USIBC, in collaboration with an India-based counterpart, can partner with the US and Indian governments to launch this expert group, it said.Proposing the creation of a US-India Global Digital Partnership (USIGDP) to facilitate discussions between critical stakeholders across government and industry, USIBC said that following the model of the National Space Council, the USIGDP should be headed by Vice President Harris, who would delegate critical elements of the discussion to relevant departments or agencies.Through discussion with the Government of India, appropriate counterpart(s) within the Prime Minister’s Office could be identified, it said.The US and India are leaders in the digital economy, which powers a vast share of global innovation, trade and investment, and STEM job creation.A successful Indian-American diaspora— including many in the tech sector—provides US and Indian industry with access to capital, technology, and a high-quality pool of technical talent.“The Biden administration should invest in partnerships that position the US and India to lead the next generation of technology development,” USIBC said.Observing that the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped global health discussions and priorities, USIBC recommended restructuring and re-energising the US-India Health Dialogue to create a forum that can tackle important policy issues in a post-pandemic era.To create a sustainable and resilient recovery, the US-India Health Dialogue should promote economic, trade, health, and social collaboration between the two governments and private sector institutions from both countries, it said.Noting that the US-India Strategic Energy Dialogue is a dynamic platform for discussion, but in recent years has moved away from climate goals, USIBC said that with the appointment of US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, it is an opportune time to reintroduce climate into the existing dialogue.This discussion could be co-chaired by Special Presidential Envoy Kerry and the US Secretary of Energy and would leverage expertise from government, industry, US National Laboratories, and research institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usibc-recommends-big-ideas-to-biden-administration-to-boost-indo-us-ties-101611652005647.html
26-01-2021||World||Trump opens office to ‘carry on’ his administration’s agenda||Former President Donald Trump has opened an office to “advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda” of his administration, according to a statement released Monday night.The ex-president’s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, created a new email distribution system via one of his private companies for Trump’s statements because the 2020 campaign’s email infrastructure has been suspended by the vendor it had been using, Campaign Monitor, according to two people familiar with the matter.A slew of technology platforms excised Trump accounts or subgroups, including those on Twitter, Facebook, Shopify, Twitch and Instagram, after the Jan. 6 riot by pro-Trump supporters at the US Capitol.The statement from the Office of Donald J. Trump was issued less than an hour before House Democrats crossed the US Capitol to deliver an article of impeachment against the former president to the Senate. That sets in motion Trump’s second impeachment trial. He is accused of inciting the mob that broke into the Capitol as Congress was about to certify the results of the election he lost to Joe Biden.One of Parscale’s companies, Nucleus, built an email distribution system meant to circumvent outside vendors. Aides want to prevent media companies from silencing or “canceling” Trump in the future, one of the people said.The letterhead on the statement indicated that the office will operate out of Palm Beach, where Trump moved after leaving the White House last week. According to the statement, the “office will be responsible for managing President Trump’s correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism.”Later, in a statement released by the Save America leadership political action committee he formed after the election, Trump endorsed his former press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for governor of Arkansas. She announced that she was running earlier Monday.Also on Monday, a Trump adviser said he had no plans to break from the Republican Party to pursue a third party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-opens-office-to-carry-on-his-administration-s-agenda-101611651145194.html

26-01-2021||World||President Biden more bullish on vaccines, open to 1.5 million daily shot goal||President Joe Biden appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting the nation could soon be injecting 1.5 million shots on an average per day.Biden signaled on Monday his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers.It was among a flurry of moves by Biden during his first full week to show he's taking swift action to heal an ailing economy as talks with Congress over a USD 1.9 trillion stimulus package showed few signs of progress.Biden reiterated that he believes the country is in a precarious spot and and that relief is urgently needed, even as he dismissed the possibility of embracing a scaled-down bill to secure passage faster. Among the features of the stimulus plan are a national vaccination program, aid to reopen schools, direct payments of USD 1,400 to individuals and financial relief for state and local governments.“Time is of the essence,” Biden said. “I am reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here.”Biden's new vaccination target comes after he and his aides faced criticism for the 100 million goal in his first 100 days in office. The US has exceeded a pace of 1 million doses per day over the last week.“I think we may be able to get that to ... 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,” Biden said, “but we have to meet that goal of a million a day.”Biden added that he expects widespread availability of the vaccines for Americans by spring, with the US. “well on our way to herd immunity” necessary to end the pandemic by summer.Even so, he warned the nation was going to be “in this for a while, and could see between “600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.”As of Sunday, the federal government had distributed 41.4 million vaccine doses to states and other jurisdictions.Of that, 21.8 million doses had been administered, or about 53 per cent.About 3.2 million people had received their full two-dose vaccination, a little less than 1 per cent of the population.That's according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Already, more than 420,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus.Biden's team held a call Sunday to outline the stimulus plan with at least a dozen senators, while the president also privately talked with lawmakers.“There's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes there has to be progress in the next couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.She warned that action needed to be taken before the US reaches an “unemployment cliff” in March, when long-term unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.But Republicans on Capitol Hill were not joining in the push for immediate action.One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said after Sunday's call that “it seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.”Collins described the additional funding for vaccinations as useful while cautioning that any economic aid should be more targeted.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that “any further action should be smart and targeted, not just an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it.”Biden sought to downplay the rhetoric from GOP lawmakers, saying, “I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works.”“This is just the process beginning,” he added. “No one wants to give up on their position until there's no other alternative.”Monday's order will likely take 45 days or longer to make its way through the federal bureaucracy, during which time wrangling with Congress could produce a new aid package.That would be a follow-up to the roughly USD 4 trillion previously approved to tackle the economic and medical fallout from the coronavirus.The order was aimed at increasing factory jobs, which have slumped by 540,000 since the pandemic began last year.“America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future,” Biden said before signing the order in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “We're ready, despite all we're facing.”Biden's order would modify the rules for the Buy American program, making it harder for contractors to qualify for a waiver and sell foreign-made goods to federal agencies.It also changes rules so that more of a manufactured good's components must originate from US factories. America-made goods would also be protected by an increase in the government's threshold and price preferences, the difference in price over which the government can buy a foreign product.It's an order that channels Biden's own blue-collar persona and his promise to use the government's market power to support its industrial base, an initiative that former President Donald Trump also attempted with executive actions and import taxes.“Thanks to past presidents granting a trade-pact waiver to Buy American, today billions in U.S. tax dollars leak offshore every year because the goods and companies from 60 other countries are treated like they are American for government procurement purposes,” said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch and a critic of past trade agreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-more-bullish-on-vaccines-open-to-1-5-million-daily-shot-goal-101611650460131.html
26-01-2021||World||Under Joe Biden, China faces renewed trade pressure||The US-Chinese trade war isn’t going away under President Joe Biden.Biden won’t confront Beijing right away, economists say, because he wants to focus on the coronavirus and the economy. But he looks set to renew pressure over trade and technology grievances that prompted President Donald Trump to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in 2017.Negotiators might tone down Trump’s focus on narrowing China’s multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States and push harder to open its state-dominated economy, which matters more in the long run, economists say. But no abrupt tariff cuts or other big changes are expected.“I think Biden will focus more on trying to extract structural reforms,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics. “It’s going to take some time before we get any shift or explicit announcements.”Biden is evaluating tariffs on Chinese goods and wants to coordinate future steps with allies, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday. She gave no indication of possible changes.“The president is committed to stopping China’s economic abuses,” Psaki said.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, appealed to Washington to learn from Trump's “erroneous policies” and adopt a “constructive attitude" but gave no indication of possible changes by Beijing.“Cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides,” Zhao said Tuesday.Trump acted on complaints that are shared by Europe and other traders, but Washington has little to show for its bruising war. It brought President Xi Jinping’s government to the bargaining table but roiled global trade, raised consumer prices and wiped out jobs.The last major development was a year ago, when Beijing promised in the “Phase One” agreement of January 2020 to buy more soybeans and other US exports and stop pressuring companies to hand over technology.China fell short on those purchases. Amid the coronavirus turmoil, it bought about 55% of what it promised. As for tech policy, some economists say those changes matter but question whether it counts as a win. They say Beijing might have made them anyway to suit its own plans.China faces more opposition than ever in Washington due to its trade record, territorial disputes with neighbors, crackdown on Hong Kong, reports of abuses against ethnic Muslims and accusations of technology theft and spying.“The ground has shifted in a significant way,” said Nathan Sheets, a former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs in the Obama administration.Katherine Tai, Biden’s choice to succeed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, sounded a hawkish note on China in a speech this month.“We face stiffening competition from a growing and ambitious China,’’ said Tai. “A China whose economy is directed by central planners who are not subject to the pressures of political pluralism, democratic elections or popular opinion.’’That means China has to make changes if wants to make progress, said Raoul Leering, global trade analyst for ING. He said that while many of Trump’s statements were “close to nonsense,” he was right that China has more trade barriers and official intervention in the economy than the United States.“It will depend on China, the speed at which they reform and change policies, to see whether Biden will roll back trade barriers,” he said.After 2 1/2 years and 13 rounds of talks, negotiators have yet to tackle one of the biggest irritants for China’s trading partners — the status of politically favored state companies that dominate industries from banking to oil to telecoms.Europe, Japan and other governments criticized Trump’s tactics but echo complaints that Beijing steals technology and breaks market-opening promises by subsidizing and shielding companies from competition.Those complaints strike at the heart of a state-led development model Communist Party leaders see as the basis of China’s success.They are building up “national champions” including PetroChina Ltd., Asia's biggest oil producer, and China Mobile Ltd., the world's biggest phone carrier by subscribers. The party in 2013 declared state industry the “core of the economy.”Outside the state sector, the party is nurturing competitors in solar power, electric cars, next-generation telecoms and other fields.Beijing could offer to drop its claim to being a developing economy, a status it insists on despite having become one of the biggest manufacturers and a middle-income society, Leering said. Under WTO rules, that allows the Communist Party to protect industries and intervene more in the economy.Giving that up “would be a very important gesture,” Leering said.Trump’s opening shot in 2017 was a tax hike on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes and suspended soybean imports, hitting farm states that voted for Trump in 2016.The US trade deficit with China narrowed by by 19% in 2019 over a year earlier and by 15% in the first nine months of 2020.That failed to achieve Trump’s goal of moving jobs to the United States. Importers shifted instead to Taiwan, Mexico and other suppliers. The total US trade deficit dipped slightly in 2019, then rose nearly 14% through November last year.Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office estimates tariff hikes cost the average US household nearly $1,300 last year. Businesses postponed investments, undoing some of the benefits of Trump’s 2017 corporate tax cut.A study by the US-China Business Council and Oxford Economics found the US economy lost 245,000 jobs due to the tariffs. It said even a modest reduction would create 145,000 jobs by 2025.Trump stepped up pressure by cutting off access to US technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and other companies seen by American officials as possible security risks and a threat to US industrial leadership. Americans were ordered to sell shares in Chinese companies Washington says have links to the military.The Communist Party responded by vowing to accelerate its two-decade-old campaign to make China a self-reliant “technology power.”Psaki, the White House spokeswoman, said Biden also was reviewing those issues but gave no indication of possible changes.Biden wants to hold Beijing accountable for “unfair and illegal practices” and make sure American technology doesn't facilitate its military buildup, Psaki said.Zhao, the Chinese spokesman, called on Washington not to “politicize or weaponize” science and technology and to avoid “groundless accusations to smear China.”Biden’s envoys have the option of fine-tuning Trump’s penalties by dropping some in exchange for Chinese policy changes, said Kuijs. But he and other economists say rolling back tariffs and curbs on access to technology and financial markets is unlikely to be a priority.“It is difficult to see a US reversal of the recent hawkish trends in China policy,” Sylvia Sheng of JP Morgan Asset Management said in a report.Tech curbs are unlikely to be eased because Washington "regards China as a competitor,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.Tariff cuts look like the only short-term option, Tu said.

26-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Chinese media float conspiracies, smear foreign vaccines||China on Monday said the issue of supplying Covid-19 vaccines to countries that need the jabs should not be marred by “malign competition” or “rivalry” but its tightly controlled state media is simultaneously running a smear campaign against both Indian and western vaccines.Not only are Chinese official media outlets questioning the efficacy of western vaccines and safety records, but the Chinese foreign ministry is also – like its diplomats did last year – plugging conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus.A statement from foreign ministry spokesperson to state media recently implied the coronavirus could have emerged from a laboratory at the Fort Detrick Army Medical Command in the US state of Maryland.“If America respects the truth, then please open up Fort Detrick and make public more information about the 200 or more bio-labs outside of the US, and please allow the WHO expert group to go to the US to investigate the origins,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying told The Global Times.Hua’s statement comes in the backdrop of a World Health Organization (WHO) team currently stationed in China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The article and Hua’s statement were well-timed. The hashtag “American’s Ft. Detrick”, started by the Communist Youth League, had been viewed more than a billion times on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.The WHO team’s presence in China is particularly sensitive for China as it continues attempts to deflect criticism about the authorities’ slow response to the Covid-19 outbreak at the beginning.A flurry of articles in Chinese state media in the past weeks have also promoted Chinese vaccines while criticising western and Indian ones.India’s efforts to make and supply vaccines to neighbouring countries have not been spared by Chinese media.The Global Times has published stories critical of the vaccines made in India and whether India has the capacity to supply the shots globally.A recent article in the nationalist tabloid not only raised questions about India’s capacity to manufacture vaccines after the fire at the Serum Institute, but also claimed that Indians in China were “embracing” Chinese vaccines.Last week, Reuters news agency calculated that Global Times, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, “had published more than ten reports in the past week critical of vaccines and inoculation schemes in the West”.About half of those reports referred to reported deaths of some frail, elderly patients in Norway after being inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the Reuters report said.The Global Times ran a report quoting Chinese experts as saying Australia should not use western vaccines and opt for Chinese ones.The state-run China Daily newspaper on Monday ran a report extolling China’s vaccines and the country’s efforts to supply doses to developing countries.“While western countries invest enormous capital in developing vaccines to fight the increasing number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, China is fulfilling its promise to make vaccines a global public good,” the article said.There have been questions about the lack of clinical data related to Chinese vaccines.Business and political news website, Caixin, quoted a leading Chinese vaccine expert as saying that China’s needs to share more data on the vaccines -- a rare instance of a Chinese media outlet taking a critical look at the developing story on vaccines. “Ding Sheng, dean of Tsinghua University’s School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and director of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), called for the original clinical trial data from Chinese experimental vaccines to be made public so that experts can better assess their efficacy and eliminate lingering safety concerns which have emerged in China and abroad,” the website reported.“The clinical data (of our vaccines) need to be further disclosed,” Ding said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-media-float-conspiracies-smear-foreign-vaccines-101611646701770.html
26-01-2021||World||UK jobless rate rises to highest since 2016||Britain's unemployment rate rose to 5.0%, its highest since early 2016, in the three months to November as the coronavirus pandemic continued to take its toll on the economy and the country went back into a lockdown, official figures showed.Separate data, also released by the Office for National Statistics, showed the number of employees on company payrolls in December was down 2.7% on a year earlier and 828,000 lower than at the start of the pandemic in February.British unemployment has been kept down by the government's Job Retention Scheme, which supported 2.4 million jobs as of Oct. 31, down from a peak of 8.9 million in May.The programme is Britain's most expensive Covid economic support measure, costing 46.4 billion pounds ($63 billion) up to mid-December, and is due to end on April 30.Finance minister Rishi Sunak will set out future job support measures at his annual budget on March 3. Rising Covid cases last year repeatedly forced him to scrap plans to end the Job Retention Scheme."This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost as a result is a tragedy," Sunak said after Tuesday's data."Whilst the NHS (National Health Service) is working hard to protect people with the vaccine we’re throwing everything we’ve got at supporting businesses, individuals and families."Friday's data showed that the number of people in employment dropped 88,000 in the three months to the end of November, a smaller fall than the 100,000 drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.The jobless rate was below the 5.1% poll forecast.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said this month that he believed the underlying jobless rate was higher, as the official definition excludes people without work who have temporarily postponed their job search due to the pandemic.Britain went into a new Covid lockdown on Jan. 5 due to a rapidly rising death toll that is now close to 100,000, the highest in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-jobless-rate-rises-to-highest-since-2016-101611646465651.html
26-01-2021||World||Covid-19 pandemic may take four to five years to end, says Singapore minister||It may take four to five years for the Covid-19 pandemic to end and the world to look to a post-Covid normal but that to with much uncertainities, Singapore’s Education Minister Lawrence Wong has warned.Speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on Monday, Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce, said there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be "reset" once the pandemic is over, the Channel News Asia reported.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "At some point of time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-Covid normal. What will this new post-Covid world look like? No one can tell," Wong said.He said there was still a great uncertainty about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years.He said adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and "maybe a good part of next year"."Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy," he said during the conference.The government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Wong conceded that there could still be "bumps along the way".He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them."In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time," he said."So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe," the report quoted the minister as saying.Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a "software update" or a "reboot" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus."We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widened the gulf between the haves and the have-nots," he said.Wong said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups.But this year, the temporary measures will have to "taper down" as the economy improves.However, the minister foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world."The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable," he said, adding that it will have to be done in a "sustainable manner over the long term".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-may-take-four-to-five-years-to-end-says-singapore-minister-101611640892385.html
26-01-2021||World||Justin Trudeau’s Liberals oust Indian-Canadian MP Ramesh Sangha from party caucus||Canada’s ruling Liberal Party has removed Indian-Canadian MP Rameshwer Singh Sangha, also known as Ramesh Sangha, from its caucus after consultations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In a statement, chief government Whip Mark Holland said the Punjab-origin MP who represents the riding of Brampton Centre in the Greater Toronto Area was ejected for making “baseless and dangerous accusations against a number of his caucus colleagues”.Holland added that after he was made aware of the accusations, he consulted with Trudeau and “the necessary steps were taken”.The nature of the accusations was not explained in Holland’s statement, though Sangha has in the past alleged that his party was “pandering” to pro-Khalistan elements. As National Post reported in 2019, he had told Punjabi-language radio channel 5AAB, “There is no doubt, there cannot be two opinions that the Liberal Party is pandering to Khalistan supporters.”More recently, while commenting on the resignation of Sikh cabinet minister Navdeep Bains, Sangha asked during the course of an interview with Y Network, another Punjabi-language group, “Are such people fit to be ministers?”He was speaking in the context of extremism in politics. When Bains quit suddenly this month, he attributed that decision to seeking to spend more time with his family.The release from Holland said, “As we have made clear time and time again, we will not tolerate conspiracy theories, or dangerous and unfounded rhetoric about parliamentarians or other Canadians. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for many Canadians to experience suspicions because of their background; we all know where this can lead. The Liberal caucus continues to stand firm against racism and intolerance.”Sangha was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 2015 defeating a minister in the previous Conservative Party government, Bal Gosal. He was re-elected in 2019. Considered a pro-India Sikh MP, he was also former chair of the Canada-India Parliamentary Friendship Group.A retired Indian Air Force officer, Sangha also claimed a close relationship with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.While Sangha is no longer part of the Liberal caucus, he will continue in parliament as an independent MP.The Hindustan Times tried to reach Sangha for a comment, but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-liberals-oust-indian-canadian-mp-ramesh-sangha-from-party-caucus-101611640760536.html
26-01-2021||World||UN chief urges global alliance to counter rise of neo-Nazis||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged coordinated global action on Monday to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy and the resurgence of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and hate speech sparked partly by the COVID-19 pandemic.The U.N. chief also urged international action “to fight propaganda and disinformation.” And he called for stepped up education on Nazi actions during World War II, stressing that almost two-thirds of young Americans do not know that 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust.Guterres spoke at the annual Park East Synagogue and United Nations International Holocaust Remembrance Service marking Wednesday’s 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, held virtually this year because of COVID-19.He said the pandemic “has exacerbated longstanding injustices and divisions”“Propaganda linking Jews with the pandemic, for example, by accusing them of creating the virus as part of a bid for global domination, would be ridiculous, if it were not so dangerous,” he said. “This is just the latest manifestation of an anti-Semitic trope that dates back to at least the 14th century, when Jews were accused of spreading the bubonic plague.”The secretary-general said it’s sad but not surprising that the pandemic has triggered another eruption of Holocaust denial, distortion and minimizing history.“In Europe, the United States and elsewhere, white supremacists are organizing and recruiting across borders, flaunting the symbols and tropes of the Nazis and their murderous ambitious,” he said. “Tragically, after decades in the shadows, neo-Nazis and their ideas are now gaining currency,”Guterres said U.S. authorities have warned that neo-Nazis are on the rise across the country and around the world. In some unnamed countries, he said, neo-Nazis have infiltrated police and state security services and their ideas can be heard in debates of mainstream political parties.“The continued rise of white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology must be seen in the context of a global attack on truth that has reduced the role of science and fact-based analysis in public life,” he said.Guterres said fragmentation of the traditional media and the growth of social media are contributing to the absence of shared facts.“We need coordinated global action, on the scale of the threat we face, to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy, and to fight propaganda and disinformation,” he said.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor, warned that “if we do not carry the tragic lessons of history, they are doomed to be repeated.”“This guiding principle -- memory not amnesia -- is a moral imperative to quell the rise of hate, which is greater today than at any time since the end of World War II,” he said.Schneier said Nazi swastikas are again defacing synagogues and cemeteries in France, Germany and most recently Montreal, and among those storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 were people wearing shirts saying “Camp Auschwitz” and “6MWE” -- short for “Six Million Wasn’t Enough.”“Children are not born with hatred; they are taught how to hate,” the 90-year-old rabbi said. “Holocaust education in schools is a must.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-urges-global-alliance-to-counter-rise-of-neonazis-101611633350483.html
26-01-2021||World||Ex-Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders running for Arkansas governor||Sarah Sanders, Donald Trump's former chief spokeswoman, announced she's running for Arkansas governor at a time other Republicans are distancing themselves from the former president facing an impeachment charge that he incited the deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol.But the former White House press secretary, who left the job in 2019 to return to her home state, ran the other direction with an announcement Monday that embraced Trump as much as his rhetoric.“With the radical left now in control of Washington, your governor is your last line of defense,” Sanders said in a nearly eight-minute video announcing her 2022 bid that prominently featured pictures of the president as well as some of his favorite targets.Trump, who publicly encouraged Sanders to run, wasted no time putting his seal of approval on her bid. The former president on Monday night backed Sanders' candidacy — his first official, public endorsement since leaving office — and called her a “warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct."The daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders is the most high-profile Trump official to seek major office and is doing so less than a week after the tumultuous end of his presidency. Her candidacy could showcase just how much of a hold Trump still has on the GOP.“Trump is simply not a liability here,” said Janine Parry, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas. “At least for the time being, we’re in a state where he remains an asset.”That’s even as the Senate is preparing for an impeachment trial over the Jan. 6 insurrection by Trump supporters that was aimed at halting the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked the president last week, saying he “provoked” the siege. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told reporters days before Biden’s inauguration he wanted Trump’s administration to end, though he also opposed the president’s impeachment.Sanders’ announcement makes a brief reference to the Capitol siege that left five dead, equating it with violence that occurred at some protests last year over racial injustice and the 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice that injured U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise and four others.“This is not who we are as Americans,” Sanders said in the video, but not mentioning Trump’s role in encouraging his supporters who stormed the Capitol.She joins a Republican primary that already includes two statewide elected leaders, Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. The three are running to succeed Hutchinson, who is unable to run next year due to term limits. No Democrats have announced a bid to run for the seat.Griffin and Rutledge had already spent months positioning themselves ahead of Sanders’ entry by lining up endorsements, raising money and trying to stake their claims as the most conservative candidate. Griffin has called for the outright elimination of the state’s income tax, while Rutledge signed on to Texas’ ultimately unsuccessful lawsuit challenging the result of the presidential election.Following the riot, Griffin and Rutledge issued statements condemning the storming of the Capitol but not addressing Trump’s role in stirring up his backers. Combined, the two have raised more than $2.8 million for the race.Griffin on Monday criticized Sanders for promising in her video to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities that violate immigration laws. He noted a 2019 measure Hutchinson signed into law already does just that by cutting off funding to cities that don’t cooperate with immigration authorities.“It sounds like she needs to catch up on what’s been going on in Arkansas,” Griffin said in a statement.Rutledge, meanwhile, said in a statement the race was about “who has a proven record and not merely rhetoric.”The race could also get even more crowded. Republican State Sen. Jim Hendren, a nephew of Hutchinson’s, is considering a run for the seat and said he hoped to make a decision within the next three weeks.“Right now we have three announced candidates but they all do represent the far right part of the Republican Party,” said Hendren, who has been much more willing to criticize Trump and hasn’t ruled out an independent bid. “The question I have to decide is, is there room for a more pragmatic, centrist type of approach?”Sanders was already well known in Arkansas politics, going back to when she appeared in ads for her father’s campaign. She managed Sen. John Boozman’s 2010 election and worked as an adviser to Sen. Tom Cotton’s in 2014.During Sanders’ nearly two-year tenure at the White House, daily televised briefings led by the press secretary ended after Sanders repeatedly sparred with reporters who aggressively questioned her. She faced questions about her credibility, but she also earned reporters’ respect working behind the scenes to develop relationships with the media.She remains an unknown on many issues and wasn’t made available for interviews Monday, though she staked out some positions in her introductory video that include reducing the state’s income tax.Her introductory video indicates she’s leaning more on her time with Trump, with it featuring images of or calling out those who frequently drew his ire including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and CNN.Republicans hold a firm grip on Arkansas, with the GOP holding all statewide and federal seats. They also hold a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. Trump in November won the state by nearly 28 percentage points, one of the biggest margins in his ultimate loss to Biden.State Democratic Party Chairman Michael John Gray on Monday called the GOP primary a “race to the bottom.” But national party leaders indicated Sanders’ candidacy may draw more resources and attention to a long-shot race that will coincide with 2022 congressional midterm elections.“As we close the book on a dark chapter in our history, we must make sure Trump’s brand of politics stays in the past," Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison tweeted. “Now, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is running on his record."Hutchinson, who has remained generally popular since taking office in 2015, said he didn't plan on endorsing anyone at this time in the race.“I am a voter, so I will follow the campaign with interest, but I have a job to do for the next two years, and I will devote my energies to bring Arkansas out of the pandemic and to revitalize our economy," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extrump-spokeswoman-sarah-sanders-running-for-arkansas-governor-101611633115841.html
26-01-2021||World||Greta Thunberg calls out three decades of 'blah, blah, blah' on climate change||Launching a scathing attack on world leaders and organisations over the issue of climate change, environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Monday said that world leaders speak of an existential climate emergency and yet instead of taking action, they set up "hypothetical distance targets, way into the future."Speaking at the Davos Agenda Summit, the young climate activist said, "My name is Greta Thunberg and I am not here to make deals. You see, I don't belong to any financial interest or political party so I can't bargain or negotiate. I am here to once again remind you of the emergency we are in. The crisis that you and your predecessors have inflicted upon us.""The crisis that you continue to ignore. I am here to remind you of the promises that you have made to your children and grandchildren and to tell you that we are not willing to compromise on the minimum safety levels that still remain," she said.Citing the current scientific knowledge on climate change, she said: "The climate and ecological crisis can no longer be solved within today's systems. According to the current best available science that's no longer an opinion, it's a fact. And we need to keep this in mind as countries, businesses and investors now rush forward to present their ambitious climate targets and commitments.""The longer we avoid this uncomfortable truth and longer we pretend that we can solve the climate and ecological emergency without treating it as an emergency, the more precious time we will lose. And this is time we do not have," she added.Over the emission targets set by the world bodies, Greta said, "Today, we hear leaders all over the world speak of an existential climate emergency and yet instead of taking action you would in an emergency, they set up vague, hypothetical distance targets, way into the future. Target based on loopholes and incomplete numbers. Target like net-zero emissions 2050. Targets that equal surrender.""We understand that the world is a complex place and that change doesn't happen overnight. But you now have had more than three decades of blah blah blah. How many more do you need?" she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-calls-out-three-decades-of-blah-blah-blah-on-climate-change-101611631203933.html
26-01-2021||World||Xi Jinping warns Davos forum against 'new Cold War'||Chinese President Xi Jinping warned global leaders at an all-virtual Davos forum Monday against starting a "new Cold War" while he championed multilateralism.Representing the only major economy to record economic growth last year, Xi presented himself as the defender of multilateralism, as he did at the same forum four years ago when Donald Trump was about to assume the US presidency.Without naming the United States, Xi seemed to have a message for Trump's successor Joe Biden, who entered the White House just a few days ago, but who is not addressing the annual World Economic Forum (WEF)."To build small cliques or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others... will only push the world into division," Xi told the world's political and economic elite as the Biden administration plans to revitalise global alliances to counter China's growing influence.Trump had chosen open confrontation and verbal attacks, without tangible results for the enormous US trade deficit with China.Though Biden may be dismantling one by one the controversial measures of the Trump era, he has nonetheless signalled the United States will closely look out for its own interests.An executive order is to give US companies and products priority in contracting with the federal government as part of an overall plan to save industrial jobs by increasing investments in factories and workers.Meanwhile, European leaders presented agendas of their own at the WEF -- normally held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos but taking place virtually this year because of the pandemic.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier defended a controversial accord signed by the European Union and China in late December to provide increased mutual market access.The deal duplicates "a lot of the arrangements that the US already has with China," Altmaier said.- 'Year of recovery' -Herbert Diess, head of the German auto giant Volkswagen, which has several plants in China, noted that the country represented a great opportunity for European companies.But some members of the European Parliament and activist groups say the accord should be contingent on Beijing's ratifying international conventions banning forced labour.And Kenneth Roth, head of Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation, commented on Twitter that Xi "promotes global collaboration on Covid-19, so long as it doesn't involve investigating his three-week cover-up of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan, which enabled the virus to go global."A year ago, the emergence of a mysterious flu-like disease in China prompted few comments at the forum when it took place at its usual site in Switzerland.A year later, the world is still struggling to contain the coronavirus, which has killed more than two million people and cost 225 million jobs, according to the UN's International Labour Organization.The world's richest people have barely been touched, the non-governmental organisation Oxfam charged.Meanwhile, "it could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recover," Oxfam said in the study titled "The Inequality Virus".Optimism raised late last year by new vaccines has been tempered by production delays and new variants, and many countries are again mulling lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus.But European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde nonetheless forecast that 2021 will be "the year of recovery".She said that while renewed economic activity "seems to be a little bit delayed," it "should not be derailed".Other forum subjects broached on the first day was global taxation of digital giants, a priority for France that until recently has been opposed by the United States.French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed a more conciliatory tone from the new Biden administration on the subject.He hoped that a multilateral accord under the auspices of the the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) could be reached by the middle of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-warns-davos-forum-against-new-cold-war-101611631036488.html
26-01-2021||World||US Senate votes overwhelmingly to confirm Yellen as first female Treasury chief||Janet Yellen won overwhelming Senate confirmation as the first woman to lead the U.S. Treasury on Monday, setting her quickly to work with Congress on coronavirus relief, reviewing U.S. sanctions policy and strengthening financial regulation.The Senate voted 84-15 to confirm Yellen, with all opposition coming from Republicans, several of whom have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid plan, tax hikes and other spending initiatives.Shortly after the vote, House of Representatives Democrats delivered to the Senate a charge of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting insurrection in a speech to supporters before the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The planned February trial has stoked some partisan divisions in the chamber, but those were largely absent on Monday."Secretary Yellen's confirmation shatters another glass ceiling," Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement. "In a field dominated by men, it's refreshing to finally see a woman leading the Treasury Department."Yellen, 74, made history in 2014 when she became the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve. A portrait of the economist and daughter of a Brooklyn, New York, family doctor will join those of 76 other secretaries in Treasury's hallways, dating back to the first, Alexander Hamilton.The White House had no immediate comment on when Yellen would be sworn in, or by whom.She won the votes of 34 Republicans in a strong bipartisan vote, with a number of them pledging to work with her."I hope bipartisanship continues & we can work 2gether on commonsense tax/fiscal policy for all Americans," Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote on Twitter.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz congratulated Yellen and voiced hope that she could help lead progress on reaching an international agreement on digital taxation. He told Reuters: "Janet Yellen is a very impressive person."Yellen will play a key role in working with Congress on Biden's coronavirus stimulus plans and on his pledges to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.Treasury will oversee Biden's plans to help finance these initiatives by trying to persuade Congress to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year.Republicans have expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits during Trump's term with 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending.Yellen told senators at her confirmation hearing last week that they needed to raise the minimum wage and "act big" on stimulus measures or risk a longer, more painful recession brought on by the pandemic.SANCTIONS REVIEWYellen also said during her confirmation hearing that she would conduct an immediate review of U.S. financial sanctions policy administered by Treasury to ensure that they were used "strategically and appropriately" after a major ramp-up of such measures under the Trump administration.Yellen's confirmation less than a week after Biden took office is quick by recent standards. Her Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump's 2017 inauguration on a party-line vote.The Treasury on Monday announced more members of Yellen's team, bringing back some Obama administration veterans who served at the agency.The Treasury named Natalie Wyeth Earnest as counselor to the secretary for strategic communications. Earnest served as assistant secretary for public affairs at Treasury under former Secretary Jack Lew and in various communications roles under former Secretary Tim Geithner.Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy, was named as deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in Treasury's Office of Legislative Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-votes-overwhelmingly-to-confirm-yellen-as-first-female-treasury-chief-101611628342005.html
26-01-2021||World||Mexican president Obrador works from isolation after positive Covid-19 test||Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador worked from isolation Monday, a day after announcing that he tested positive for COVID-19, and was absent from his daily news conference for the first time in his two years in office.The president, who has rarely been seen wearing a mask, stayed out of sight as his country topped 150,000 deaths, the fourth-highest level in the world. He has been criticized for his handling of Mexico’s pandemic and for not setting an example of prevention in public.He spoke by phone Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and spokesman Jesus Ramirez said afterward on Twitter that Mexico would receive 24 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, though it has not yet been approved for use in the country.Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said Mexico has already received the results of Phase 3 efficacy testing on the Russian vaccine, but he did not release any figures on how well it works. He said those figures would be published soon. He said Mexico could begin receiving shipments of the vaccine in late January or February, though it has not yet been authorized for use.López Obrador appeared “with resolute spirit, working and looking good,” Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, who is also isolating and awaiting test results, said on Twitter.López-Gatell said the president's symptoms so far were basically a fever.Also Monday, the son of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim announced that his father has COVID-19 and is responding to treatment. Carlos Slim Domit wrote on Twitter that his father started having minor symptoms a week ago and sought care at one of the country’s foremost hospitals.The president announced the diagnosis Sunday on his official Twitter account, saying, “The symptoms are mild but I am already under medical treatment."The 67-year-old López Obrador had a “light” case of COVID-19 and was “isolating at home,” said José Luis Alomía Zegarra, Mexico’s director of epidemiology.On Monday, Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero said the president had designated her to hold the daily briefings until his return. She said López Obrador was well and strong.“He is carrying out his functions as president of the republic. He will continue keeping an eye on public affairs,” she said. Sánchez Cordero, who spoke without wearing a mask, said she was awaiting test results of her own.Despite his age and high blood pressure, López Obrador has not received a vaccine, though Mexico has received batches of Pfizer-BioNTech doses. He has said that health workers would be the first to get them. Under the government plan, people over 60 will start being vaccinated in February.López Obrador has maintained a busy travel schedule, taking commercial flights. He spent the weekend in San Luis Potosi and Nuevo Leon states, where he was photographed without a mask.He has also resisted locking down the economy, noting the devastating effect it would have on so many Mexicans who live day to day. The country registered 659 newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths Monday, bringing the total to 150,273. However, Mexico tests very few people, and government excess death estimates suggest the real death is closer to 195,000. The country has more than 1.7 million infections, which have pushed the health system of the capital city close to saturation.Early in the pandemic, asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador took two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.“The protective shield is the ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’” López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, “Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me."In November, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, urged Mexico's leaders to be serious about the coronavirus and set examples for its citizens, saying that “Mexico is in bad shape” with the pandemic. He did not name López Obrador.“We have said it in general. Wearing a mask is important. Hygiene is important, and physical distancing is important, and we expect leaders to be examples,” he added.On Monday, the WHO chief said via Twitter: “I am sorry to hear that you have tested positive for #COVID19, President @lopezobrador— . I wish you swift recovery. Stay strong!”At the start of the pandemic López Obrador was criticized for leaning into crowds and giving hugs. The eternal campaigner, his political style has always been hands-on and personal. As the pandemic grew, he began limiting attendance to his events and maintaining his distance from supporters.But on Friday, López Obrador posted a photo of himself, Ebrard, a translator and former chief of staff Alfonso Romo gathered around a table for a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden. None was wearing a mask.As in other countries, the mask question has polarized the Mexican public and appeared to divide reaction to López Obrador's infection as well, said Ivonne Acuña Murillo, political science professor at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. She noted a range of responses, from people wishing him a speedy recovery to those who appeared gleeful at his illness.López Obrador is known to be stubborn and more often doubles down on a position rather than retreat in the face of criticism.“He really is an individual of convictions and fixed ideas,” Acuña said. “He doesn’t easily change his positions and decisions.” Still, she thought it was more likely that he would begin wearing a mask than making a dramatic change in his optimistic discourse about the pandemic.Along a Mexico City boulevard Monday, Gabriel Osorio, who was wearing a mask and protective glasses with his suit and tie, said it was a risky situation.“We hope that he recovers and returns soon," Osorio said. "Also, I didn’t think that he took the correct measures to take care of himself.”Mexico City street vendor Eduardo Sanchez wished the president luck. “We’re all exposed to that,” he said through his mask. “Everyone, old or young, has to take care of themselves.”Other Latin American leaders who have tested positive for the coronavirus include Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, Guatemala’s Alejandro Giammattei, Honduras’ Juan Orlando Hernández and Bolivia’s then-interim President Jeanine Ánéz. All have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-obrador-works-from-isolation-after-positive-covid-19-test-101611628069432.html
26-01-2021||World||Twitter users fact check misinformation in new trial program||Twitter Inc said on Monday it launched a pilot program that has users flag tweets that they believe are misleading and write notes to provide context.The project, called Birdwatch, is initially offered in the United States, the social media firm said in a blog post.Twitter and other social media companies have been under pressure to combat misinformation on their platforms. Twitter last year started adding labels and warnings about misinformation on the site, including about the Covid-19 pandemic and the US election.Birdwatch is on a separate section of Twitter https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch, and only pilot participants, who apply to the program, will write posts identifying and rebutting misinformation. Their notes will initially not be visible on Twitter for users outside of the pilot group but will be visible on the Birdwatch site.Twitter said it ultimately expects to have between 1,000 and 100,000 Birdwatchers who are being admitted on a rolling basis and who will not be paid."Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors," said Twitter Vice President of Product Keith Coleman in the blog post.Pilot participants can rate the helpfulness of notes from other contributors."We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn't dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors," said Coleman in the blog post."We believe this is a model worth trying," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-users-fact-check-misinformation-in-new-trial-program-101611626507444.html

Trump was issued less than an hour before an article of impeachment against the former president was to be delivered from the House to the Senate at the US Capitol. That will set in motion Trump’s second impeachment trial. Trump is accused of inciting the mob that broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress was about to certify the election that he lost to Joe Biden.The letterhead on the statement indicated that the office will operate out of Palm Beach, where Trump moved after leaving the White House last week. The statement said the “office will be responsible for managing President Trump’s correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-opens-office-to-carry-on-agenda-of-his-administration-101611623669721.html
26-01-2021||World||US detects first case of Brazil coronavirus variant||The first case of a coronavirus variant that recently emerged in Brazil has been confirmed in the United States, health authorities in the state of Minnesota said Monday.The Minnesota Department of Health said in a statement that the "Public Health Laboratory has found the variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known as the Brazil P.1 variant in a specimen from a Minnesota resident with recent travel history to Brazil."The patient, who is a resident of the Twin Cities metro area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, tested positive for Covid-19 in early January and was advised to isolate, the statement said. Further lab information revealed the case to be the Brazil variant.This case, as well as the discovery of three cases of the British coronavirus variant in Minnesota in the past few weeks, underscores "why it is so important to limit travel during a pandemic as much as possible," state epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said in the statement.President Joe Biden on Monday re-imposed a travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe.Biden also extended the ban to travelers who have recently been to South Africa amid warnings that new, more transmissible coronavirus variants are already establishing themselves in the United States.The new president last week tightened mask wearing rules and ordered quarantine for people flying into the United States, as he seeks to tackle the country's worsening coronavirus crisis.More than 25 million Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the US since the pandemic began, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The milestone was reached only five days after the US, the world's wealthiest and hardest-hit nation, recorded 400,000 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-detects-first-case-of-brazil-coronavirus-variant-101611623450296.html
26-01-2021||World||US Covid-19 numbers drop, but race against new strains heats up||Coronavirus deaths and cases per day in the US dropped markedly over the past couple of weeks but are still running at alarmingly high levels, and the effort to snuff out Covid-19 is becoming an ever more urgent race between the vaccine and the mutating virus.The government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the improvement in numbers around the country appears to reflect a “natural peaking and then plateauing” after a holiday surge, rather than the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December.The US is recording just under 3,100 deaths a day on average, down from more than 3,350 less than two weeks ago. New cases are averaging about 170,000 a day after peaking at almost 250,000 on Jan. 11. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has fallen to about 110,000 from a high of 132,000 on Jan. 7.States that have been hot spots in recent weeks such as California and Arizona have shown similar improvements during the same period.On Monday, California lifted regional stay-at-home orders in favor of county-by-county restrictions and ended a 10 p.m. curfew. The shift will allow restaurants and churches to resume outdoor operations and hair and nail salons to reopen in many places, though local officials could maintain stricter rules.Elsewhere, Minnesota school districts have begun bringing elementary students back for in-person learning. Chicago’s school system, the nation’s third-largest district, had hoped to bring teachers back Monday to prepare for students to return next month, but the teachers union has refused. Illinois announced that more counties will be able to offer limited indoor dining.“I don’t think the dynamics of what we’re seeing now with the plateauing is significantly influenced yet — it will be soon — but yet by the vaccine. I just think it’s the natural course of plateauing,” Fauci told NBC’s “Today.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, said that a predicted holiday surge was reduced by people traveling less than expected, and an increase in mask-wearing in response to spikes in infections has since helped bring the numbers down.Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said too few people have been vaccinated so far for that to have had a significant impact on virus trends. She said she can’t predict how long it will take for the vaccines' effects to be reflected in the numbers.Rivers said she is concerned that the more contagious variants of the virus could lead to a deadly resurgence later this year.“I think we were on track to have a good — or a better, at least — spring and summer, and I’m worried that the variants might be throwing us a curveball,” she said.Nationwide, about 19.3 million people, or less than 6% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of the vaccine, including about 3 million who have gotten the second shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 55% of the 41 million doses distributed to the states by the federal government have been injected into arms, by the CDC's count.The virus has killed over 419,000 Americans and infected more than 25 million, with a widely cited University of Washington model projecting the death toll will reach about 569,000 by May 1.And health experts have warned that the more contagious and possibly more deadly variant sweeping through Britain will probably become the dominant source of infection in the US by March. It has been reported in over 20 states so far. Other mutant versions are circulating in South Africa and Brazil. The variant from Brazil was detected for the first time in the US in a Minnesota resident who recently traveled to the South American country, state health officials said Monday.The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to mutate. The fear is that it will ultimately render the vaccines ineffective.To guard against the new variants, President Joe Biden on Monday added South Africa to the list of more than two dozen countries whose residents are subject to coronavirus-related limits on entering the US.Most non-U.S. citizens who have been to Brazil, Ireland, Britain and other European nations will be barred from entering the US under the rules re-imposed by Biden after President Donald Trump had moved to relax them.Fauci said scientists are already preparing to adjust Covid-19 vaccines to fight the mutated versions.He said there is “a very slight, modest diminution” of the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against those variants, but “there’s enough cushion with the vaccines that we have that we still consider them to be effective" against both.Moderna, the maker of one of the two vaccines being used in the US, announced on Monday that it is beginning to test a possible booster dose against the South African variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the move was out of “an abundance of caution” after preliminary lab tests suggested its shot produced a weaker immune response to that variant.The vaccine rollout in the US has been marked by disarray and confusion, with states complaining in recent days about shortages and inadequate deliveries that have forced them to cancel mass vaccination events and tens of thousands of appointments.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said shortages are preventing the city from opening more large-scale vaccination sites.“Here you have New York City ready to vaccinate at the rate of a half-million New Yorkers a week, but we don’t have the vaccine to go with it,” de Blasio said. “A lot of other places in the country are ready to do so much more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-numbers-drop-but-race-against-new-strains-heats-up-101611623175614.html

This week, we expect to reach 100 million reported cases," Tedros said.He further said people should continue to adhere to precautionary measures to impede the spread of the coronavirus until the majority of the global population was vaccinated."There is so much all we can do to navigate our way out of this pandemic while we all wait our turn to be vaccinated: physical distancing, avoiding crowds, masks, hands hygiene, ventilation and more. You might be sick of hearing it. You might be sick of doing it, but this virus is not sick of us," the WHO chief added.The global number of Covid-19 cases reached 98,794,942, with the cumulative death toll rising to 2,124,193, according to the WHO data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-struggling-with-covid-19-vaccine-supply-distribution-says-who-expert-101611621827356.html

And thanks to the combined efforts of Britain, India and many other nations, we are on the road to success against Covid. So, I look forward to visiting India later this year, strengthening our friendship, and striving for the quantum leap in our relationship that Prime Minister Modi and I have both pledged to achieve,” he said.Addressing the Indian diaspora in the UK, he added,“All over the world, this virus is compelling people to stay apart, including family and friends in Britain and India, who form what Prime Minister Modi has called the “living bridge” between us. “But for now, let me wish everyone in India as well as those celebrating here in Britain, a very happy Republic Day,” the British prime minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-greets-india-on-r-day-says-working-together-to-eliminate-covid-101611620758554.html
26-01-2021||World||Election lawsuit citing ‘Lord of the Rings’ is tweaked after ‘a Bit of Rest’||Citing JRR Tolkien’s absent King Aragorn in a lawsuit seeking to nullify November’s US election might have been a bit much, supporters of Donald Trump acknowledged in a new filing after being ridiculed online.“This lawsuit does NOT seek to ‘install Donald Trump as president,’” because the whole election was illegal, they told the court on Monday to clarify their aims. Instead, the supporters said, they just want to “curb the power of a disputed Congress and President” while their case is heard.The suit, filed Jan. 18 in federal court in Waco, Texas, names House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, among others. It “merely seeks a return to the system of government contemplated by the founders of this nation -- a republic where representatives are elected by its citizens -- through a new election,” the group said.In a request for a temporary restraining order against the new government, the group cited Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy to argue that President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Congress have no legitimate claim to governance.‘Rightful King of Gondor’“During the course of the epic trilogy, the rightful King of Gondor had abandoned the throne,” and so “a steward was appointed to manage Gondor until the return of the King, known as ‘Aragorn,’” it said. It asked the court to “appoint a group of special masters (the ‘Stewards’)” to check the power of “the illegitimate President until this Constitutional crisis can be resolved through a peaceful legal process.”Monday’s filing is marked by a tone of concern, or perhaps exasperation, at being misunderstood.“Salon.com and other media outlets, apparently due solely to counsel making a literary analogy (something not remotely uncommon to legal writing), have characterized this lawsuit as a mere fantasy,” the group said. “And perhaps they are right in a sense. Admittedly, Counsel has struggled greatly with the question of what is an appropriate remedy when an entire federal election has been conducted illegally.”The solution appears to have come after a brief recharge.“After getting a bit of rest and pondering it over the weekend,” the plaintiffs said, they had submitted an alternative proposed temporary restraining order -- one that “does not seek to appoint any ‘Stewards.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/election-lawsuit-citing-lord-of-the-rings-is-tweaked-after-a-bit-of-rest-101611621171080.html
26-01-2021||World||Donald Trump impeachment goes to Senate, testing his sway over GOP||Democrats marched the impeachment case against Donald Trump to the Senate Monday night for the start of his historic trial, but Republican senators were easing off their criticism of the former president and shunning calls to convict him over the deadly siege at the US Capitol.It's an early sign of Trump's enduring sway over the party.The House prosecutors delivered the sole impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection," making the ceremonial walk across the Capitol to the Senate. But Republican denunciations of Trump have cooled since the Jan. 6 riot. Instead Republicans are presenting a tangle of legal arguments against the legitimacy of the trial and questions whether Trump's repeated demands to overturn Joe Biden's election really amounted to incitement.What seemed for some Democrats like an open-shut case that played out for the world on live television, as Trump encouraged a rally mob to “fight like hell" for his presidency, is running into a Republican Party that feels very differently. Not only are there legal concerns, but senators are wary of crossing the former president and his legions of followers who are their voters. Security remains tight at the Capitol.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said if Congress starts holding impeachment trials of former officials, what's next: “Could we go back and try President Obama?”Besides, he suggested, Trump has already been held to account. “One way in our system you get punished is losing an election.”Arguments in the Senate trial will begin the week of Feb. 8, and the case against Trump, the first former president to face impeachment trial, will test a political party still sorting itself out for the post-Trump era. Republican senators are balancing the demands of deep-pocketed donors who are distancing themselves from Trump and voters who demand loyalty to him. One Republican, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, announced Monday he would not seek reelection in 2022 citing the polarized political atmosphere.For Democrats the tone, tenor and length of the upcoming trial, so early in Biden's presidency, poses its own challenge, forcing them to strike a balance between their vow to hold Trump accountable and their eagerness to deliver on the new administration's priorities following their sweep of control of the House, Senate and White House.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans appear more eager to argue over trial process than the substance of the impeachment case against Trump, perhaps to avoid casting judgment on the former president's “role in fomenting the despicable attack” on the Capitol.He said there's only one question "senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience: Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?”Failing to conduct the trial would amount to a “get-out-jail-free card” for other officials accused of wrongdoing on their way out the door, Schumer said.On Monday, it was learned that Chief Justice John Roberts is not expected to preside at the trial, as he did during Trump’s first impeachment, potentially affecting the gravitas of the proceedings. The shift is said to be in keeping with protocol because Trump is no longer in office.Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D- Vt., who serves in the largely ceremonial role of Senate president pro-tempore, is set to preside.Leaders in both parties agreed to a short delay in the proceedings that serves their political and practical interests, even as National Guard troops remain at the Capitol amid security threats on lawmakers ahead of the trial.The start date gives Trump’s new legal team time to prepare its case, while also providing more than a month's distance from the passions of the bloody riot. For the Democratic-led Senate, the intervening weeks provide prime time to confirm some of Biden’s key Cabinet nominees.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., questioned how his colleagues who were in the Capitol that day could see the insurrection as anything other than a “stunning violation” of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power.“It is a critical moment in American history,” Coons said Sunday in an interview.An early vote to dismiss the trial probably would not succeed, given that Democrats now control the Senate. Still, the mounting Republican opposition to the proceedings indicates that many GOP senators would eventually vote to acquit Trump. Democrats would need the support of 17 Republicans — a high bar — to convict him.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he doesn't believe the Senate has the constitutional authority to convict Trump after he has left office.“I think a lot of Americans are going to think it’s strange that the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove from office a man who left office a week ago,” Cotton said.Democrats reject that argument, pointing to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. Democrats also say that a reckoning of the first invasion of the Capitol since the War of 1812, perpetrated by rioters egged on by a president as Electoral College votes were being tallied, is necessary to ensure such a siege never happens again.A few GOP senators have agreed with Democrats, though not close to the number that will be needed to convict Trump.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said he believes "what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense.” Romney said, “If not, what is?”But Romney, the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump when the Senate acquitted the then-president in last year’s trial, appears to be an outlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-impeachment-goes-to-senate-testing-his-sway-over-gop-101611620799468.html
26-01-2021||World||Bolsonaro thanks China for fast-tracking Covid-19 vaccine supplies||Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, a longtime China skeptic, thanked Beijing on Monday for rapidly approving the export of active ingredients for local Covid-19 vaccine production, as his government scrambles to secure scarce shots."They are already being sent to Brazil and will arrive in the next few days,' he said in a Twitter post.The supplies are enough to produce about 8.5 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's Covid-19 vaccine at Sao Paulo's Butantan biomedical center, the lab said.China had also fast-tracked approval for supplies of active ingredients to make AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine in Brazil, Bolsonaro tweeted.Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who says he will not take any Covid-19 shot, has been criticized for the slow and patchy nature of Brazil's vaccine rollout.The setbacks to the national immunization plan are the latest example of his poor handling of the pandemic, critics say. Latin America's largest nation has over 217,000 Covid-19 deaths, second in the world after the United States.With few vaccines to inoculate Brazil's 210 million people and a rampant second wave, the country now finds itself almost entirely reliant on the Sinovac vaccine that Bolsonaro, a China hawk, had previously ridiculed.Butantan has a contract with Sinovac for 46 million doses. The first 6 million were ready for use and have been distributed around Brazil. The rest have to be completed by Butantan.Brazil's federally-funded Fiocruz Institute, which has a deal with AstraZeneca to produce up to 100 million doses of its vaccine, said on Monday it expects China to send the active ingredient needed to make the shots locally around Feb. 8.It had previously said it could deliver finished doses in March, but now says it will await the Chinese shipment before giving a more specific time frame."It is not possible to disclose a detailed production schedule at this time," Fiocruz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-thanks-china-for-fast-tracking-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-101611619929346.html
26-01-2021||World||China tests Joe Biden’s will on strategic flash point of Taiwan||China’s decision to fly more than a dozen military aircraft, including strategic bombers, into the Taiwan Strait this weekend sends an early warning to President Joe Biden on one of the most volatile issues between Beijing and Washington.The sortie by eight Xian H-6K bombers and five other planes Saturday was the third-largest such incursion by People Liberation Army aircraft in the past year, according to Taiwanese Defense Ministry data. Moreover, H-6K bombers are believed to be capable of carrying land-attack cruise missiles that give Chinese forces the ability to strike overseas bases from a safe distance.The US State Department issued a statement affirming Washington’s “rock-solid” commitment to Taipei and urging Beijing “to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure.” China should “instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.The incursion sent “a clear signal to the Biden administration that China stands ready to defend its sovereignty over Taiwan and that it is a red line that the U.S. should not dare to cross,” said Yongwook Ryu, assistant professor of East Asian international relations at at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “We will see quite a bit of jostling between China and the U.S. over Taiwan in the early phase of the Biden administration, as the two giants seek to figure out where they can cooperate and test each other’s resolve.”The 70-year-old dispute over Taiwan has re-emerged since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party president, as its president in 2016. China’s Xi Jinping, who has vowed to work toward unifying the two sides, has cut off communication with Taipei and launched a pressure campaign over Tsai’s refusal to accept that both sides belong to “One China.”Former US President Donald Trump -- propelled by his own battles with China -- dramatically expanded ties with Taipei, approving the first fighter jet sale in 30 years and the most senior visit by a U.S. cabinet official since Washington switched ties from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. China has pushed back by carrying out frequent military exercises near the island and, in August, firing “carrier killer” ballistic missiles into the South China Sea.Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Monday that the U.S. planned to review Trump’s policies while consulting with allies and lawmakers in Washington to build consensus on a China strategy. “Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity and values in significant ways that require a new U.S. approach,” Psaki said.Psaki’s remarks came in response to Xi’s speech at a virtual World Economic Forum in which he urged world powers to shun an “outdated Cold-War mentality” and defended China’s right to follow its own path. Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing that the U.S. should “refrain from sending wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces, to avoid harm to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”The State Department statement placed the onus on China to re-engage with Taiwan, while indicating a desire to preserve the longstanding ambiguity about Taiwan’s status. The U.S. pledged to stand by existing agreements with China and spoke of the interests of the “people on Taiwan,” rather than the people “of Taiwan.”“The U.S. wants to prevent China from miscalculating, so it is likely to continue to make clear U.S. interests in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and its resolve to oppose China’s intimidation of Taiwan,” said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has advised both the State and Defense departments.Chinese state media paid little attention to the State Department remarks, an article in the Global Times newspaper cited its reference to upholding existing agreements as evidence the U.S. was returning to a more “mainstream” Taiwan policy. The Communist Party newspaper described the PLA drills as part of existing training plans and not intended as a signal to the US.Meanwhile, a US aircraft carrier group entered the disputed South China Sea to “conduct routine operations,” the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Saturday. It was unclear whether the USS Theodore Roosevelt’s trip was intended a specific signal, since such voyages are usually planned long in advance.China has repeatedly come up in calls between top Biden aides and their allies in recent days. Newly confirmed US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin agreed in a call Sunday with Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi to oppose any attempts to change the status quo in the East or South China seas, according to a Japanese Defense Ministry statement.Alexander Huang, a professor of international strategic relations at Tamkang University, speculated that Xi was trying to test Biden’s limits.“Xi is looking to see how the new Biden administration will respond to Chinese behavior,” Huang said. “Whether they believe that the Biden administration will take a strong stance on Taiwan or a soft and indecisive one, they will take lessons from that as they begin a wide range of dialogues on issues from trade to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-joe-biden-s-will-on-strategic-flash-point-of-taiwan-101611620451499.html
26-01-2021||World||Britain to help other countries track down coronavirus variants||Britain will share its genomic sequencing capabilities with other countries to help quicker identify new variants of the coronavirus in places with less ability to do so, its health ministry said on Tuesday.New variants of the coronavirus have alarmed scientists, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the prospect of a "vaccine-busting" variant could mean that lockdown measures are needed for longer and new travel restrictions are introduced.Britain said it had carried out more than half the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to a global database, and would launch a New Variant Assessment Platform which could be used for coronavirus variants and also future pandemics."Our New Variant Assessment Platform will help us better understand this virus and how it spreads, and will also boost global capacity to understand coronavirus, so we're all better prepared for whatever lies ahead," Health Minister Matt Hancock will say in a speech at Chatham House, according to advance extracts released by the health ministry.The three major variants of concern identified so far were discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. All three variants are thought to be more transmissible.The variant discovered in Britain could also be associated with higher mortality, although the evidence around that is uncertain.Scientist have also highlighted particular concern that vaccines might not work as well against the variants found in South Africa and Brazil.Moderna said on Monday it believe its COVID-19 vaccine protects against the British and South African variants, although it will test a new booster shot aimed at the South Africa variant after concluding the antibody response could be diminished.Britain's health minister and health officials have said they believe the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines being rolled out in the country work against the UK variant.

And in light of the contagious variant B1351, South Africa has been added to the restricted list."She said beginning Tuesday international travellers coming into the US must provide proof of a negative test within three days of travel to airlines prior to departure.Noting the danger posed by the pandemic, the proclamation said, "The Federal Government must act swiftly and aggressively to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The national emergency caused by the Covid-19 outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security."Last week, Biden had announced that travellers flying to the US from foreign countries will be required to mandatorily quarantine upon their arrival and pass a Covid-19 test before departure.Prior to this, he had mandated wearing face masks and observing social distancing on government property, urging "every American to mask up for the next 100 days."The new administration has also predicted that the US death toll will top 500,000 next month from its current count of nearly 419,000, adding that wearing masks is the "the single best thing we can do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-sign-order-keeping-travel-restrictions-on-europe-says-white-house-101611618752355.html
26-01-2021||World||US virus numbers drop, but race against new strains heats up||Coronavirus deaths and cases per day in the U.S. dropped markedly over the past couple of weeks but are still running at alarmingly high levels, and the effort to snuff out Covid-19 is becoming an ever more urgent race between the vaccine and the mutating virus.The government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the improvement in numbers around the country appears to reflect a “natural peaking and then plateauing” after a holiday surge, rather than the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December.The US is recording just under 3,100 deaths a day on average, down from more than 3,350 less than two weeks ago. New cases are averaging about 170,000 a day after peaking at almost 250,000 on Jan. 11. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has fallen to about 110,000 from a high of 132,000 on Jan. 7.States that have been hot spots in recent weeks such as California and Arizona have shown similar improvements during the same period.On Monday, California lifted regional stay-at-home orders in favor of county-by-county restrictions and ended a 10 p.m. curfew. The shift will allow restaurants and churches to resume outdoor operations and hair and nail salons to reopen in many places, though local officials could maintain stricter rules.Elsewhere, Minnesota school districts have begun bringing elementary students back for in-person learning. Chicago’s school system, the nation’s third-largest district, had hoped to bring teachers back Monday to prepare for students to return next month, but the teachers union has refused. Illinois announced that that more counties will be able to offer limited indoor dining.“I don’t think the dynamics of what we’re seeing now with the plateauing is significantly influenced yet — it will be soon — but yet by the vaccine. I just think it’s the natural course of plateauing,” Fauci told NBC’s “Today.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, said that a predicted holiday surge was reduced by people traveling less than expected, and an increase in mask-wearing in response to spikes in infections has since helped bring the numbers down.Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said too few people have been vaccinated so far for that to have had a significant impact on virus trends. She said she can’t predict how long it will take for the vaccines' effects to be reflected in the numbers.Rivers said she is concerned that the more contagious variants of the virus could lead to a deadly resurgence later this year.“I think we were on track to have a good — or a better, at least — spring and summer, and I’m worried that the variants might be throwing us a curveball,” she said.Nationwide, about 18.5 million people, or less than 6% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine, including about 3 million who have gotten the second shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only slightly more than half of the 41 million doses distributed to the states by the federal government have been injected into arms, by the CDC's count.The virus has killed over 419,000 Americans and infected more than 25 million, with a widely cited University of Washington model projecting the death toll will reach about 569,000 by May 1.And health experts have warned that the more contagious and possibly more deadly variant sweeping through Britain will probably become the dominant source of infection in the U.S. by March. It has been reported in over 20 states so far. Other mutant versions are circulating in South Africa and Brazil. The variant from Brazil was detected for the first time in the U.S. in a Minnesota resident who recently traveled to the South American country, state health officials said Monday.The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to mutate. The fear is that it will ultimately render the vaccines ineffective.To guard against the new variants, President Joe Biden on Monday added South Africa to the list of more than two dozen countries whose residents are subject to coronavirus-related limits on entering the U.S.Most non-U.S. citizens who have been to Brazil, Ireland, Britain and other European nations will be barred from entering the U.S. under the rules re-imposed by Biden after President Donald Trump had moved to relax them.Fauci said scientists are already preparing to adjust COVID-19 vaccines to fight the mutated versions.He said there is “a very slight, modest diminution” of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against those variants, but “there’s enough cushion with the vaccines that we have that we still consider them to be effective" against both.Moderna, the maker of one of the two vaccines being used in the U.S., announced on Monday that it is beginning to test a possible booster dose against the South African variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the move was out of “an abundance of caution” after preliminary lab tests suggested its shot produced a weaker immune response to that variant.The vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been marked by disarray and confusion, with states complaining in recent days about shortages and inadequate deliveries that have forced them to cancel mass vaccination events and tens of thousands of appointments.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said shortages are preventing the city from opening more large-scale vaccination sites.“Here you have New York City ready to vaccinate at the rate of a half-million New Yorkers a week, but we don’t have the vaccine to go with it,” de Blasio said. “A lot of other places in the country are ready to do so much more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-virus-numbers-drop-but-race-against-new-strains-heats-up-101611618919493.html
26-01-2021||World||AstraZeneca denies report vaccine less effective in elderly||AstraZeneca denied on Monday its Covid-19 vaccine is not very effective for people over 65, after German media reports said officials fear the vaccine may not be approved in the European Union for use in the elderly.German daily papers Handelsblatt and Bild said in separate reports the vaccine - co-developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University - had an efficacy of 8% or less than 10%, respectively, in those over 65.German officials were concerned that the vaccine may not receive approval from the EU's medicines authority EMA for use in those over 65, Bild said in its online edition.The reports mark another potential issue for AstraZeneca, which told the EU on Friday it could not meet agreed supply targets up to the end of March after running into vaccine production problems.Frustration was already growing among European countries because Pfizer and partner BioNTech announced a temporary slowdown in vaccine supplies earlier in January.In a written response, AstraZeneca described the German media reports saying its Covid-19 vaccine was shown to have a very low efficacy in the elderly as "completely incorrect".It said Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation supported the vaccine's use in the elderly. It also said that a strong immune responses to the vaccine had been shown in blood analysis of elderly trial participants.Britain on Dec. 30 became the first country to approve the two-shot vaccine and did not impose an upper age limit. It has so far focused on the elderly and healthcare workers for its immunisation campaign.AstraZeneca's main trial in Britain started testing on adults no older than 55 because it initially focused on healthcare personnel and frontline workers in active duty.Elderly trial participants were recruited later so that infections, which are needed to arrive at reliable efficacy data, were also coming in later.Researchers at Oxford University said in a paper published in medical journal The Lancet on Dec. 8, when details of key vaccine trials held in Britain and Brazil were released, that efficacy data based on infections in the elderly were still limited."Efficacy data in these cohorts are currently limited by the small number of (infection) cases, but additional data will be available in future analyses," they said in the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-denies-report-vaccine-less-effective-in-elderly-101611618932361.html
26-01-2021||World||Jill Biden signals she'll be more active as first lady||Five days into her new role, Jill Biden signaled Monday that she'll be a more active first lady, with a trio of virtual appearances before governors' spouses, young Latinos and library officials.She also used the meetings to promote President Joe Biden's call for national unity and his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief proposal, which is facing resistance from some Republicans lawmakers.Jill Biden's early moves seemed designed to signal that she intends to be more active than her predecessor, Melania Trump. Mrs. Trump often allowed weeks to pass between her public appearances.Mrs. Trump also was largely absent from Washington in the opening months of Donald Trump's administration. She returned to New York shortly after the inauguration in January 2017 to live with their son, Barron, as he finished out the school year uninterrupted.On Monday, Jill Biden took on the role of top surrogate for the president, encouraging unity and promising the administration would listen to all voices.“We can’t do this alone," she told the governors' spouses meeting over Zoom. "Congress will need to pass the legislation and, ultimately, it will take state and local leadership.”Biden pushed the same message to a Zoom meeting, or “charla,” with young Latinos.“We need you in this effort,” she told them. “No one can speak to your communities like you can, and you know how much this matters.” Blacks and Latinos are among those suffering the most severe economic and life-and-death consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.In a videotaped message to the American Library Association's midwinter virtual conference, the first lady pledged that “empathy, resilience, diversity, learning and trust” will be the “foundation of the administration that we will build.”“We're going to invest in all communities. We going to listen to all Americans,” she said. “We're going to work to heal the pain that has come from this time of crisis.”Two days after last Wednesday's inauguration, Biden visited the Whitman-Walker Health clinic to highlight services for cancer patients. Afterward, she made an unannounced stop at the U.S. Capitol to deliver chocolate chip cookies to National Guard members as a thank you for providing security for the swearing-in.Jennifer Pickens, an author who studies the White House, said Biden, 69, had “hit the ground running, as she should.”“She has had the benefit of being married to a statesman of nearly 50 years and has come to the role of first lady after spending eight years as the second lady, something we have not had since first lady Barbara Bush,” Pickens said.Barbara Bush was married to George H.W. Bush, who spent eight years as vice president to Ronald Reagan before he was elected president in 1988. Bush lost his reelection bid in 1992.Joe Biden was a U.S. senator for 36 years, followed by eight years as vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-signals-she-ll-be-more-active-as-first-lady-101611618286421.html
26-01-2021||World||US justice department probes if staff tried to alter election outcome||The Justice Department’s inspector general has opened an investigation into whether department staff members sought to use the agency to alter the outcome of the 2020 election and overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.The department didn’t say what prompted Inspector General Michael Horowitz to open the inquiry, but it came after the New York Times reported that Jeffrey Clark, the acting head of its civil division, had discussed a plan with former President Donald Trump to pressure politicians in Georgia to overturn the state’s results.Clark’s name wasn’t mentioned in the department’s two-paragraph release on Monday. He resigned from the Justice Department on Jan. 14, less than a week before the end of Trump’s presidency, and didn’t have a new job lined up at the time. The Times reported on Friday that Clark’s efforts included an attempt to remove then acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who had deflected Trump’s attempts to use the Justice Department in a baseless attack on the election results.The inspector general’s office “is making this statement, consistent with DOJ policy, to reassure the public that an appropriate agency is investigating the allegations,” spokeswoman Stephanie Logan said in a statement Monday.Clark acknowledged meeting with Trump but said he didn’t devise a plan to oust Rosen, or “formulate recommendations for action based on factual inaccuracies.”“There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president,” he told Bloomberg Law on Friday, adding that legal privileges prevented him from “divulging specifics regarding the conversation.”The Justice Department’s role in Trump’s months-long effort to reverse the results of the election adds to a growing list of examples of the former president’s bold attempts to pressure government officials to ignore the law in order to throw out the will of voters.Clark’s alleged role in this effort has been cited by Democrats in Congress who are seeking to convict Trump in a Senate impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol. They have vowed to open their own investigation.Before stepping down last month, Attorney General William Barr, known as a Trump loyalist, told the Associated Press that he had “not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”Horowitz, who was nominated for the watchdog post by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2012, has overseen numerous politically charged investigations into the conduct of Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, including fallout from the probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Investigations by the inspector general, who can make referrals to criminal authorities, can take years to conclude and for the results to be made public.The investigation into potential meddling in the 2020 presidential election is limited to current and former Justice Department employees, according to the statement Monday.(Adds background on election-meddling allegations in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-probes-if-staff-tried-to-alter-election-outcome-101611615888767.html
26-01-2021||World||Italian PM Giuseppe Conte to resign on Tuesday to chart comeback||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign on Tuesday morning to avoid a damaging defeat in the Senate and maneuver to return at the head of a new government.Conte will preside over a cabinet meeting at 9 a.m. in Rome and then head to President Sergio Mattarella’s office to formally step down, according to a government statement.The idea is that by preemptively offering his resignation to Mattarella, who oversees the formation of ruling coalitions, Conte will then be asked to take another shot at putting together a government, according to officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential deliberations.The Five Star Movement, the biggest force in the current parliament, and lawmakers of the center-left Democratic Party had both been urging the premier to resign after a junior ally ditched the alliance, officials said.The trigger was a vote in the Senate later this week in which Conte probably wouldn’t have had a majority. Five Star has plunged in the polls and stands to lose the most in early elections if the government collapses and Mattarella decides they are unavoidable.Meanwhile, the Italian Treasury is starting to factor in a bigger hit to the country’s battered public finances this year as another extended lockdown holds back the recovery, a senior government official said.Treasury models suggest the budget deficit may reach as much as 9.2% of output this year, the official said. The government is also looking at a deteriorating outlook for growth and could see the economy expand as little as 4.5% in a worst-case scenario, according to the official.The prospect of spiraling borrowing and political instability in a country that’s already the European Union’s problem child is likely to prompt concern in Brussels and Frankfurt, where officials spent much of 2020 unlocking fiscal and monetary aid to help Italy and countries similarly crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.Any government in power will also have to decide how to spend the EU’s recovery package and speed up the pace of vaccinations.Conte’s NemesisAfter resisting pressure to quit following the defection earlier this month of the Italy Alive party led by former Premier Matteo Renzi, Conte appears to have concluded that resigning now and coming back to head a “unity government” is his best option, officials said.There is also the fact that Renzi and Conte have a long-standing dislike of each other and have been ill at ease in a coalition of mutual convenience.Conte could seek to forge a new coalition. That might include centrists, unaffiliated lawmakers, Renzi’s Italy Alive party or members of it, as well as lawmakers from Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right Forza Italia, the officials said.While some of the premier’s allies have raised the prospect of early elections to resolve the impasse, coalition leaders still see this is an unlikely option, with some fearing that a vote would usher in the center-right opposition led by Matteo Salvini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-to-resign-on-tuesday-to-chart-comeback-101611615697806.html
26-01-2021||World||Biden bullish on Covid vaccines, says open to 1.5 million shots daily||President Joe Biden on Monday appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting that the nation could soon be vaccinating 1.5 million Americans on average per day.Biden signaled his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers. It was among a flurry of moves by Biden during his first full week to show he's taking swift action to heal an ailing economy as talks with Congress over a $1.9 trillion stimulus package showed few signs of progress.Biden reiterated that he believes the country is in a precarious spot and and that relief is urgently needed, even as he dismissed the possibility of embracing a scaled-down bill to secure passage faster. Among the features of the stimulus plan are a national vaccination program, aid to reopen schools, direct payments of $1,400 to individuals and financial relief for state and local governments.“Time is of the essence," Biden said. “I am reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here."Biden's new vaccination target comes after he and his aides faced criticism for the 100 million goal in his first 100 days in office. The US has exceeded a pace of 1 million doses per day over the last week.“I think we may be able to get that to ... 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day," Biden said, “but we have to meet that goal of a million a day.”Biden added that he expects widespread availability of the vaccines for Americans by spring, with the US “well on our way to herd immunity” necessary to end the pandemic by summer. Even so, he warned the nation was going to be “in this for a while, and could see between "600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.”As of Sunday, the federal government had distributed 41.4 million vaccine doses to states and other jurisdictions. Of that, 21.8 million doses had been administered, or about 53%. About 3.2 million people had received their full two-dose vaccination, a little less than 1% of the population. That’s according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Already, more than 420,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus.Biden's team held a call Sunday to outline the stimulus plan with at least a dozen senators, while the president also privately talked with lawmakers.“There's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes there has to be progress in the next couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. She warned that action needed to be taken before the U.S. reaches an “unemployment cliff” in March, when long-term unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.But Republicans on Capitol Hill were not joining in the push for immediate action.One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said after Sunday's call that “it seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.” Collins described the additional funding for vaccinations as useful while cautioning that any economic aid should be more targeted.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that “any further action should be smart and targeted, not just an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don’t need it.”Biden sought to downplay the rhetoric from GOP lawmakers, saying, “I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works."“This is just the process beginning," he added. "No one wants to give up on their position until there’s no other alternative.”Monday’s order will likely take 45 days or longer to make its way through the federal bureaucracy, during which time wrangling with Congress could produce a new aid package. That would be a follow-up to the roughly $4 trillion previously approved to tackle the economic and medical fallout from the coronavirus.The order was aimed at increasing factory jobs, which have slumped by 540,000 since the pandemic began last year.“America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future," Biden said before signing the order in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “We’re ready, despite all we’re facing."Biden’s order would modify the rules for the Buy American program, making it harder for contractors to qualify for a waiver and sell foreign-made goods to federal agencies. It also changes rules so that more of a manufactured good’s components must originate from US factories. America-made goods would also be protected by an increase in the government’s threshold and price preferences, the difference in price over which the government can buy a foreign product.It's an order that channels Biden's own blue-collar persona and his promise to use the government's market power to support its industrial base, an initiative that former President Donald Trump also attempted with executive actions and import taxes.“Thanks to past presidents granting a trade-pact waiver to Buy American, today billions in US tax dollars leak offshore every year because the goods and companies from 60 other countries are treated like they are American for government procurement purposes," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch and a critic of past trade agreements.While Trump also issued a series of executive actions and tariffs with the goal of boosting manufacturing, he didn't attempt to rewrite the guidance for what constitutes a US-made component or tighten the process for granting exemptions to buy foreign goods, a key difference from Biden’s agenda, Biden's administration said.The order also has elements that apply to the separate Buy America program that applies to highways and bridges. It aims to open up government procurement contracts to new companies by scouting potential contractors. The order would create a public website for companies that received waivers to sell foreign goods to the government, so that US manufacturers can have more information and be in a more competitive position.Past presidents have promised to revitalize manufacturing as a source of job growth and achieved mixed results. The government helped save the automotive sector after the 2008 financial crisis, but the number of factory jobs has been steadily shrinking over the course of four decades.The number of US manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979 at 19.5 million and now totals 12.3 million, according to the Labor Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bullish-on-covid-vaccines-says-open-to-1-5-million-shots-daily-101611615446587.html
