The motion is set to go through with the votes of all Democrats and between 10 to 20 Republicans, making Trump the only American president to be impeached twice, and within 19 months. His first impeachment was in December 2019.Democrats have brought just one article of impeachment against the president: “incitement of insurrection”, for the attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6.“We know that we faced enemies to the Constitution, we know we experienced the insurrection that violated the sanctity of the people’s capital and attempted to overturn the duly recorded will of the American people, and we know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country,” said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker starting the debate to be followed by the vote.She added: “He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”The House judiciary committee had laid the impeachment case in a report on Tuesday. “President Trump committed a high crime and misdemeanor against the nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election,” it had said, adding, “The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.”Pence announced his decision on the 25th Amendment of the American constitution — which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to sideline the president finding him unable to govern — in a letter to Pelosi as the House was just about to take a vote on a resolution calling for him to do just that.“I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our constitution,” Pence wrote. “Under our constitution, the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedence.” House Democrats went ahead with the vote anyway, and won by 223-205.Democrats have enough votes to pass the impeachment resolution on their own. But they will be joined by an increasing number of Republicans, outraged by President Trump’s actions before and during the riots; that he incited them to attack the Capitol and refused to call them off for hours.Liz Cheney, who is third in seniority in the House Republican caucus, John Katko, senior-most Republican in House committee on homeland security; Adam Kinzinger, Fred Upton and Jaimie Herrera Beutler have all said they will vote to impeach the president. Between 10 and 20 Republicans are expected to vote in support of impeachment.But the most devastating blow for Trump was losing the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. He had been one of Trump’s closest allies. He is said to be “pleased” now with the impeachment, seeing an opportunity there to purge him from the party, the New York Times reported. Trump could be convicted by the Senate without McConnell’s support.Trump struck defiant note in a series of remarks on Tuesday. He defended his January 6 speech, which triggered the supporters, as “totally appropriate” and sought to characterise the impeachment as a continuation of the “witch hunt” that led to his first impeachment, in December 2019. In Texas, he said he will survive the 25th Amendment, but warned “will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration”.Investigations into the Capitol attack, in the meantime, are growing “unprecedented” in scope. The FBI and the justice department said more than 160 cases are being investigated with more to follow. Charges being considered range from forcible entry to assaulting officials to sedition and conspiracy.And US military’s joints chiefs of staff issued a statement condemning the January 6 attack. “We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection,” it said.The military leaders also signalled support and acknowledgment of the incoming administration. “On January 20, 2021, in accordance with the Constitution, confirmed by the states and the courts, and certified by Congress, President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-says-trump-must-go-he-is-a-clear-and-present-danger-101610561604724.html
13-01-2021||World||US finalises wages for H-1B visa holders||The United States has announced the finalisation of a rule that will force American employers to offer foreign workers on H-1B and similar visa programmes the same, or higher, wages as their local counterparts.The change announced on Tuesday is intended to prevent employers from hiring low-cost foreign workers to replace Americans, which has been a key criticism of the foreign workers programme. India, which accounts for upwards of 70% of the annual 85,000 H-1B visas granted, is a major source of such foreign workers.Labour secretary Eugene Scalia said these measures will strengthen wage protections, address “abuses in visa programmes, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour”.“These changes help ensure that these important foreign worker programmes function as Congress intended, while securing American workers’ opportunities for stable, good-paying jobs”.The new rule will come into effect 60 days from publication in the Federal Register, the American gazette.Last week, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued another final rule to amend the lottery system to select H-1B applications by prioritising those for high-paying jobs.“The H-1B temporary visa programme has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs,” USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow said last Thursday. “The current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the programme to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominately resulted in the annual influx of foreign labour placed in low-wage positions at the expense of US workers.”The Trump administration has been modifying the H-1B visa programme to make it harder for the scheme to be used to replace Americans workers with cheaper foreign workers, under “Buy American, Hire American” policy championed by outgoing President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-finalises-wages-for-h-1b-visa-holders-101610560164948.html
13-01-2021||World||US issues final wage rules for H-1B, green card holders to prevent 'abuses'||The US department of labour (DOL) on Tuesday announced final wages rule in its last-minute attempt to push the so-called protectionist policy of the Trump administration. The department said that the US employers, seeking H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 visas for foreign workers, must attest that they will pay non-immigrant workers the higher of the prevailing wage or the actual wage paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications.The final wages rule also directs employers to recruit US workers for the position, on the prevailing wage issued by the department, when seeking to hire an immigrant under an EB-2 or EB-3 classification. US secretary of labour Eugene Scalia said in a statement that the department is taking these steps to strengthen “wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour.”The final rule was announced days after the department published an interim final rule and invited public comments. It will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Scalia said that the department has adjusted the wages levels used in the interim final rule to “better reflect market wages and included provisions to smooth the transition to the new wage levels.”“The prevailing wage rates in these programs serve to protect US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower-cost foreign labour into the US labour market,” the department stated.The H-1B visa allows American companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The US employers have been hiring tens of thousands of foreign worker every year from countries like India and China. Last week, USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow claimed that the H-1B visa program has been “exploited and abused by employers” primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-final-wage-rules-for-h-1b-green-card-holders-to-prevent-abuses-101610559373356.html

In a letter addressed to soldiers, civilian employees and their family members, the US army called on them to uphold their values during this critical period. The army said that the violent riot at the Capitol was an attack on the Congress and the Constitutional democracy, reminding all soldiers and civilians to “uphold the army's apolitical standards.”“Democratic elections are a constitutional right, and the military has no role in determining their outcome. The Nation expects all member of the United States Army to follow the law and do the right things the right way, whether we are in or out of uniform,” the letter read.The message was sent out on Wednesday just before the House was scheduled to convene to vote on an article of impeachment, an attempt to oust President Donald Trump. The army stressed that American soldiers and civilians have committed themselves to safeguard democratic ideal while adhering to civilian authority by swearing an oath to support and defend the Constitution.“To maintain the sacred trust of the American people, it is important that all those who represent the Army, in any capacity, remain models of professionalism, character, and integrity,” the army further stated.Read: Trump impeachment 2.0: List of Republicans who will join Democrats in House voteThe letter was signed by Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston. The unusual reminder followed a rare memo by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which they said the deadly insurrection at the Capitol was anti-democratic and a criminal act, emphasising that the right to free speech gives no one the right to commit violence.Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly warned of armed protests being planned at all 50 state capitals and in Washington DC in the run-up to the inauguration. The federal agency has received information on a group calling for others to join them is storming state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in case Trump is removed as President before the inauguration day.“Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitals from January 16 through at least January 20, and at the US Capitol from January 17 through January 20," according to the internal FBI bulletin obtained by several US media outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uphold-apolitical-standards-us-army-s-rare-message-amid-threats-of-violence-101610554725095.html
13-01-2021||World||US imposes new sanctions on Iranian foundations in last days of Trump's term||The United States on Wednesday blacklisted two Iranian foundations controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and their subsidies, saying the institutions enabled Iran's elite to sustain a 'corrupt' system of ownership over large parts of the economy.The designations announced by the US Treasury Department target Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO) and Astan Quds Razavi (AQR), their leaders and subsidies. They are the latest action to reinforce the "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran pursued by President Donald Trump's administration.Republican Trump is due to hand over power to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden after losing the Nov. 3 election."EIKO has systematically violated the rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime, including political opponents, religious minorities, and exiled Iranians," the Treasury said in a statement.The sanctions freeze any US assets of those targeted and generally bar Americans from doing business with them. Anyone who engages in certain transactions with these individuals and entities runs the risk of being hit with US sanctions.US-Iranian tensions have risen since Trump two years ago abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and restored harsh economic sanctions designed to force Tehran into a wider negotiation on curbing its nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy forces.Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, has said he will return the United States to the nuclear deal, if Iran resumes compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iranian-foundations-in-last-days-of-trump-s-term-101610554752465.html
13-01-2021||World||Progress stalls in Afghan peace talks as sides await Joe Biden||Afghan peace talks that resumed four days ago are effectively on hold, sources from both sides said on Wednesday, as negotiators wait for President-elect Joe Biden to signal whether he will stick to Donald Trump's aggressive schedule to pull out troops.After a month-long break, some negotiators from both sides have yet to return to Doha, the Qatari capital that has served as venue for negotiations between the Afghan government and the insurgents to end decades of war. A diplomatic source in Kabul said expectations were low for progress before Biden takes office on Jan. 20.The sides "do not want to commit to anything before the 20th. They wanted to have the process going in the meantime because that was one of the requirements of the international community, so they have the process. But it is stagnant," he said.In an agreement reached last year, Trump, who had long promised to end America's longest war, signed the United States up to a full withdrawal in coming months. But that depends on the Taliban meeting security conditions which the Afghan government says have not been met. Biden and his advisors have so far given few clues as to their plans.'TOUGH DECISIONS'"We are waiting for the new U.S. administration and their policies towards Afghanistan to see whether they would respect the peace accord,” a Taliban negotiator told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly."If they don't honour their commitment of withdrawing their forces as promised...then we would need to make tough decisions by appointing hardliners to key positions on the ground."After months of little progress, the sides finally agreed ground rules for talks late last year. The talks then broke up in December, in part to allow negotiators to return home for consultations with their leadership.The sides announced last week they would re-start talks on Saturday. But so far only limited meetings between smaller teams called 'contact groups' have taken place, three diplomatic and Afghan government sources told Reuters.Around four top members of the Taliban negotiating team were not yet in Qatar, the group's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. He said this was due to logistical issues travelling from remote areas where they were visiting family. They would arrive in the next few days and the delay would not affect the talks, he said.Some Afghan government negotiators were also not yet in Doha. One, who has been receiving treatment for cancer, told Reuters she planned to travel there this week.Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute think tank, said one reason for the delay on the Taliban side could be that negotiators needed more time to confer with the group's leaders."It's not yet fully clear why they are delayed, but with the growing speculation this can't go on too much longer without some sort of explanation," she said. The delayed return "reflects the existing lack of momentum".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progress-stalls-in-afghan-peace-talks-as-sides-await-joe-biden-101610554233143.html

13-01-2021||World||Emotions run high as US House begins debate on impeaching Donald Trump||A week after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol, the House of Representatives began debate on Wednesday as lawmakers considered impeaching him for his role in an assault on American democracy that stunned the nation and left five dead.At least five Republicans have said they would join Democrats in voting for an article of impeachment - a formal charge - of inciting an insurrection just seven days before he is due to leave office and President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. If the House approves it, Trump would become the first president impeached twice.House impeachment of Trump would not immediately remove him from office but would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. It remained unclear whether such a trial would take place in time to expel Trump from office. As lawmakers debated the matter, National Guard troops and police were stationed around the Capitol to provide security.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat, said Democrats intended to send the impeachment charge, once approved, to the Senate "as soon as possible," and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named nine impeachment managers who would present the House's case during a Senate trial.The extraordinary swiftness with which Democrats were moving reflects the ongoing danger that Trump poses to national security, according to top Democrats. It also increases pressure on Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, to consider holding an immediate trial.McConnell has said no trial could begin until the chamber returns from its recess on Jan. 19. But Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is set to become the majority leader after two newly elected Democratic senators from Georgia are seated and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is sworn in later this month, told reporters the Senate could be recalled to handle the matter if McConnell agrees.'CRIME SCENE'Washington is on high alert after the Jan. 6 riot, with a week to go in Trump's term. Thousands of National Guard troops were to be on hand and some service members wearing fatigues, with weapons at hand, could be seen sleeping inside the Capitol building on Wednesday ahead of the session.The House convened just after 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) in the same chamber where lawmakers hid under chairs last Wednesday as rioters clashed with police in the halls of the Capitol."We are debating this historic measure at an actual crime scene," Democratic Representative Jim McGovern said as the session opened. "This was a well-organized attack on our country that was incited by Donald Trump."House Republicans who opposed the impeachment drive argued Democrats were going too far, as Trump was on the verge of leaving office, and argued for the creation of a commission to study the events surrounding the siege."Instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further," Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole said on the floor. Cole was one of 139 House Republicans who voted against certifying the Nov. 3 presidential election results on Wednesday, hours after the violence, after Trump made false claims of widespread voting fraud.Republican Representative Jason Smith accused Democrats of acting recklessly and urged the House not to impeach Trump in order to help "heal the nation."Democrats moved forward on an impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence rejected an effort to persuade him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution to remove Trump.As the House prepared for the impeachment vote, there were signs Trump's hold on the Republican Party was beginning to ebb. At least five House Republicans, including Liz Cheney, a member of her party's leadership team, said they would vote for his second impeachment - a prospect no president before Trump has faced."There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said in a statement.Trump "summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack" on the Capitol, she said.Republicans Jaime Herrera Beutler, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton also said they supported impeachment.In a break from standard procedure, Republican leaders in the House have refrained from urging their members to vote against impeaching Trump, saying it was a matter of individual conscience.The New York Times reported that McConnell was said to be pleased about the impeachment push, another sign Trump's party is looking to move on from him after the attack on Congress.The House previously voted to impeach Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter ahead of the election, as Democrats accused him of soliciting foreign interference to smear a domestic political rival. The Republican-led Senate in February 2020 voted to keep Trump in office.The article of impeachment accused Trump of "incitement of insurrection," saying he provoked violence against the U.S. government in a speech to thousands of supporters near the White House shortly before the Capitol siege. The article also cited Trump's Jan. 2 phone call asking a Georgia official to "find" votes to overturn Biden's victory in the state.'TOTALLY APPROPRIATE'In his first public appearance since last Wednesday's riot, Trump showed no contrition on Tuesday for his speech shortly before the siege."What I said was totally appropriate," Trump told reporters.At a meeting to set the rules for Wednesday's impeachment vote, Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who helped craft the impeachment measure, said it had the support of 217 lawmakers - enough to impeach Trump.A two-thirds majority of the Senate is needed to convict Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to vote for conviction.Democrats could also use an impeachment trial to push through a vote blocking Trump from running for office again.Only a simple Senate majority is needed to disqualify Trump from future office, but there is disagreement among legal experts as to whether an impeachment conviction is needed before a disqualification vote.A different part of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, also provides a procedure for disqualifying Trump from future office with a simple majority of both chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emotions-run-high-as-us-house-begins-debate-on-impeaching-donald-trump-101610551530820.html
13-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to appoint 'Indo-Pacific coordinator' to address concerns from China||US president-elect Joe Biden is set to create a new position within the National Security Council (NSC) and appoint veteran foreign policy expert Kurt Campbell to focus on challenges emerging from China in the Indo-Pacific, according to media reports on Wednesday.Campbell, a former top Pentagon official who also served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Obama administration and helped frame the “pivot to Asia”, is expected to join as the “Indo-Pacific coordinator”.The job will give him “broad management over the NSC directorates that cover various parts of Asia and China-related issues", The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed Biden transition officials.Campbell will report to incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and the NSC will have several “coordinators”, who will have more authority than the “senior directors” below them, The Post said.Biden was considering creating the new position inside the White House “because of the rising importance attached to tackling a range of challenges from China”, the Financial Times reported.A person familiar with the decision told the Financial Times that it was “partly taken because of the need to better integrate China policy across different government agencies with a veteran Asia expert at the helm”. The person added Biden “recognised that China was an issue that every government agency — not just the traditional foreign policy, defence and economic-related departments — would have to grapple with more than in the past”.Campbell is considered to be close to both incoming secretary of state Antony Blinken and incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan. He is also seen as one of the more hawkish Democrats on China.Earlier this month, Campbell and Rush Doshi, expected to be named China director in the NSC, wrote an article for Foreign Affairs magazine that said the US will have to build a coalition of allies and partners to address challenges from China in the Indo-Pacific.“A strategy for the Indo-Pacific today would benefit from...the need for a balance of power; the need for an order that the region’s states recognize as legitimate; and the need for an allied and partner coalition to address China’s challenge to both. Such an approach can ensure that the Indo-Pacific’s future is characterized by balance and twenty-first-century openness rather than hegemony and nineteenth-century spheres of influence,” the article said.In another article for Foreign Affairs in 2018, Campbell argued the US strategy of engaging China in the hope that it would liberalise and reform hadn’t worked.“Neither carrots nor sticks have swayed China as predicted. Diplomatic and commercial engagements have not brought political and economic openness. Neither US military power nor regional balancing has stopped Beijing from seeking to displace core components of the US-led system. And the liberal international order has failed to lure or bind China as powerfully as expected. China has instead pursued its own course, belying a range of American expectations in the process,” that article said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-appoint-indo-pacific-coordinator-to-address-concerns-from-china-101610550486678.html
13-01-2021||World||UK's PM Johnson pledges Covid-19 vaccine program to operate 24-7||Britain's coronavirus vaccine program will operate around the clock seven days a week “as soon as we can,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged Wednesday as the UK accelerates efforts to inoculate millions of its most vulnerable people against coronavirus.Johnson said “at the moment, the limit is on supply” of the vaccines rather than on the ability of the country's health service to deliver jabs quickly. The push to inoculate millions quickly comes as a more contagious variant of Covid-19 is sweeping across Britain and driving hospitals to their breaking points.The UK is already under an indefinite national lockdown to curb the spread of the new variant, with nonessential shops, gyms and hairdressers closed, most people working from home and schools largely offering remote learning. But some are calling for even tougher measures.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tightened restrictions Wednesday, barring the consumption of alcohol outdoors and barring the public from going inside a business to collect takeaways.The UK government has set a goal of delivering the first vaccine dose to everyone over 70, as well as frontline health care workers, nursing home residents and anyone whose health makes them especially vulnerable to the virus, by the middle of February. That’s more than 15 million people.Vaccinations will be given at hundreds of doctors’ offices and community pharmacies, 50 mass vaccination sites at convention centers and sports stadiums, as well as at 223 hospitals.Britain is already using Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca and has approved one made by Moderna, but that one is not expected to be delivered until spring.But the pace of vaccinations remains a constant source of discussion.Johnson’s comments came as his vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, testified before a parliamentary committee that the government now had “line of sight” of deliveries to the end of February but sidestepped questions about week-by-week vaccine deliveries.“In any manufacturing process, especially one where you’re dealing with a biological compound, a novel vaccine, is lumpy at the outset,” he told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. “There’s no doubt that it was, but getting better. ... We have millions of doses coming through in the weeks and then next month and the month after.”The challenge, Zahawi said, was not just getting vaccine shots into people's arms, but the difficulty of reaching vulnerable people. Greater daily volumes of inoculations could be achieved if specific groups weren't targeted, he said.In a reflection of the frantic demand, Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, asked the committee to help gain permission for people working in the vaccine process to get priority for the Covid-19 shots.“One of the things that I’m worried about is actually maintaining a continuous supply and work on this vaccine,” he said as he appealed for workers to be immunized. “If you have an outbreak at one of the centers — which we’ve had actually — or in one of the groups in Oxford working on new variants, or the people that are working on the regulatory files, everything stops.''On the timing front, the government is desperately trying to protect people with vaccines before hospitals are overwhelmed with cases of the new, more infections virus variant. Britain already has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 83,000 deaths.England’s health care system may move patients into hotels to ease the pressure on hospitals struggling to handle rising Covid-19 admissions.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Wednesday that the National Health Service was looking at ways to reduce the strain on hospitals, including moving patients to hotels when appropriate.“We would only ever do that if it was clinically the right thing for somebody,” Hancock told Sky News. “In some cases, people need sit-down care, they don’t actually need to be in a hospital bed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-pm-johnson-pledges-covid-19-vaccine-program-to-operate-247-101610550349658.html
13-01-2021||World||Two friends in the contest, India has a tough call to make for UNHRC presidency||India and China are expected to play key roles in choosing the next president of the UN Human Rights Council, with New Delhi faced with the tough challenge of choosing between rival candidates from two countries with which it has close ties.The current president, Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, completed her year-long term on December 31 and the post was set to go to Nazhat Shameem Khan, Fiji’s top diplomat in Geneva and a noted human rights activist.However, China and Russia opposed her candidature at the last minute and backed a Bahraini candidate, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Human Rights Council is currently working without a chief for the first time in its 15-year history.With a key meeting of the council to be chaired by the president scheduled for January 18, hectic efforts are underway to find a solution to the impasse. Both India and China are seen as key players in the Asia-Pacific group, which is slated to hold the presidency of the UN’s human rights body this year.India has close ties with both Fiji, where more than a third of the population is of Indian-origin, and Bahrain, a key energy partner and home to some 350,000 Indian expatriates. This factor, the people cited above, has complicated the process of choosing a candidate for New Delhi.There are concerns in some quarters as Bahrain’s candidate is being backed by China and also apprehensions that some members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) could use a possible Bahraini presidency to raise issues that are of concern to India, the people said.On December 16, the 47-member Human Rights Council elected Keva Lorraine Bain of the Bahamas, Ali Ibn Abi Talib Abdelrahman Mahmoud of Sudan and Monique TG van Daalen of the Netherlands to three of four posts of vice presidents for a one-year term beginning on January 1. They represent the Latin American and Caribbean states, African states and Western European and other states respectively in the five-member bureau or the council’s top decision-making body.However, the council was unable to choose a president because of opposition to the Fijian candidate, primarily from China, which was concerned about Khan’s past reputation as a human rights advocate, the people said.Some reports have suggested China is also keen on having a friendly candidate in the council’s top post at a time when the US is expected to rejoin the body under president-elect Joe Biden. President Donald Trump had pulled the US out of the council in 2018.The Asia-Pacific group had sought additional time in December for consultations on filling the position of president and a vote may be needed to break the impasse. In such circumstances, both India and China are expected to play key roles, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-may-play-key-roles-in-ending-impasse-over-election-of-unhrc-chief-101610548965935.html

"So, the city of New York will no longer have anything to do with the Trump Organization."Trump addressed thousands of supporters on Jan. 6, reiterating his unsupported claim that his re-election was stolen. He urged them to march to the Capitol where Congress was affirming Joe Biden's election by the Electoral College.The crowd quickly overwhelmed Capitol security, with many of them entering the building and forcing a halt to the proceedings as lawmakers took cover in a secure location. Five people died as a result of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-to-cut-contracts-with-trump-organization-says-mayor-101610548342408.html
13-01-2021||World||Donald Trump on verge of second impeachment after Capitol siege||President Donald Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time in an unprecedented House vote Wednesday, a week after he encouraged a mob of loyalists to “fight like hell” against election results just before they stormed the US Capitol in a deadly siege.The House chaplain opened the session with a prayer for “seizing the scales of justice from the jaws of mob-ocracy.”While Trump's first impeachment in 2019 brought no Republican votes in the House, a small but significant number of leaders and lawmakers are breaking with the party to join Democrats, saying Trump violated his oath to protect and defend US democracy.The stunning collapse of Trump's final days in office, against alarming warnings of more violence ahead by his followers, leaves the nation at an uneasy and unfamiliar juncture before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.Trump, who would become the only US president twice impeached, faces a single charge of “incitement of insurrection.”The four-page impeachment resolution relies on Trump’s own incendiary rhetoric and the falsehoods he spread about Biden’s election victory, including at a White House rally on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, in building its case for high crimes and misdemeanors as demanded in the Constitution.“If inviting a mob to insurrection against your own government is not an impeachable event, then what is?” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a drafter of the article of impeachment.Trump took no responsibility for the riot, suggesting it was the drive to oust him rather than his actions around the bloody riot that was dividing the country.“To continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger,” Trump said Tuesday, his first remarks to reporters since last week’s violence.A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot and killed a woman during the siege. Three other people died in what authorities said were medical emergencies. Lawmakers had to scramble for safety and hide as rioters took control of the Capitol and delayed by hours the last step in finalizing Biden's victory.The outgoing president offered no condolences for those dead or injured, only saying, “I want no violence.”At least five Republican lawmakers, including third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming, were unswayed by the president's logic. The Republicans announced they would vote to impeach Trump, cleaving the Republican leadership, and the party itself.“The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,” said Cheney in a statement. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.”Unlike a year ago, Trump faces impeachment as a weakened leader, having lost his own reelection as well as the Senate Republican majority.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is said to be angry at Trump, and it's unclear how a Senate impeachment trial would play out. The New York Times reported that McConnell thinks Trump committed an impeachable offense and is glad Democrats are moving against him. Citing unidentified people familiar with McConnell's thinking, the Times reported McConnell believes moving against Trump will help the GOP forge a future independent of the divisive, chaotic president.In the House, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California, a top Trump ally, scrambled to suggest a lighter censure instead, but that option crumbled.So far, Republican Reps. John Katko of New York, a former federal prosecutor; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Air Force veteran; Fred Upton of Michigan; and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state announced they, too, would join Cheney to vote to impeach.The House tried first to push Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to intervene, passing a resolution Tuesday night calling on them to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to remove Trump from office. The resolution urged Pence to “declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office.”Pence made it clear he would not do so, saying in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that it was “time to unite our country as we prepare to inaugurate President-elect Joe Biden."Debate over the resolution was intense after lawmakers returned the Capitol for the first time since the siege.Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, argued that Trump must go because, as she said in Spanish, he’s “loco” — crazy.In opposition, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said the “cancel culture” was just trying to cancel the president with his ouster.While House Republican leaders are allowing rank and file lawmakers to vote their conscience on impeachment, it's far from clear there would then be the two-thirds vote in the evenly divided Senate needed to convict and remove Trump. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”With just over a week remaining in Trump's term, the FBI warned ominously of potential armed protests by Trump loyalists ahead of Biden’s inauguration. Capitol Police urged lawmakers to be on alert.New security in place, lawmakers were required to pass through metal detectors to enter the House chamber, not far from where Capitol police, guns drawn, had barricaded the door against the rioters. Some Republican lawmakers complained about the screening.Biden has said it's important to ensure that the "folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage — that they be held accountable.”Fending off concerns that an impeachment trial would bog down his first days in office, the president-elect is encouraging senators to divide their time between taking taking up his priorities of confirming his nominees and approving Covid-19 relief while also conducting the trial.The impeachment bill draws from Trump's own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud.Like the resolution to invoke the 25th Amendment, the impeachment bill also details Trump's pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes and his White House rally rant to “fight like hell” by heading to the Capitol.While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, there is precedent. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.Trump was impeached in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine but acquitted by the Senate in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-verge-of-second-impeachment-after-capitol-siege-101610548311714.html
13-01-2021||World||US House convenes to impeach Donald Trump for his role in Capitol assault||A week after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol, the US House of Representatives gathered on Wednesday to impeach the president for his role in an assault on American democracy that stunned the nation and left five dead.At least five Republicans have said they would join Democrats to impeach Trump for the second time, just seven days before he is due to leave office and President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.A vote of the House majority to impeach would trigger a trial in the still Republican-controlled Senate, although it was unclear whether such a trial would take place in time to expel Trump from the White House.Washington is on high alert after the riot and with a week to go in Trump's term. Thousands of National Guard troops were planned to be on hand and some members in fatigues, with weapons at hand, could be seen sleeping inside the Capitol building on Wednesday ahead of the session.The House convened just after 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) in the same chamber where lawmakers hid under chairs last Wednesday as angry rioters clashed with police in the halls of the Capitol.Democrats moved forward on an impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence rejected an effort to persuade him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove Trump."I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution," Pence said in a letter Tuesday evening to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Despite the letter, the House passed a resolution late Tuesday formally calling on Pence to act. The final vote was 223-205 in favor.As the House prepared for the impeachment vote, there were signs Trump's once-dominant hold on the Republican Party was beginning to ebb.At least five House Republicans, including Liz Cheney, a member of her party's leadership team, said they would vote for his second impeachment - a prospect no president before Trump has faced."There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said in a statement.Trump "summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack" on the Capitol, she said.Republicans Jaime Herrera Beutler, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton also said they supported impeachment.In a break from standard procedure, Republican leaders in the House have refrained from urging their members to vote against impeaching Trump, saying it was a matter of individual conscience.The New York Times reported that the Republican majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell, was said to be pleased about the impeachment push, another sign Trump's party is looking to move on from him after the attack on Congress.'TOTALLY APPROPRIATE'In his first public appearance since last Wednesday's riot, Trump showed no contrition on Tuesday for his speech last week in which he called on his supporters to protest Biden's victory by marching on the Capitol."What I said was totally appropriate," Trump told reporters.At a meeting to set the rules for Wednesday's impeachment vote, Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who helped craft the impeachment measure, said the impeachment drive had the support of 217 lawmakers - enough to impeach Trump.House Republicans who opposed the impeachment drive argued Democrats were going too far, as Trump was on the verge of leaving office."This is scary where this goes, because this is about more than about impeaching the president of the United States. This is about cancelling the president and cancelling all the people you guys disagree with," said Republican Representative Jim Jordan, one of Trump's staunchest defenders when the president was impeached in 2019 after encouraging the government of Ukraine to dig up political dirt on Biden.Pelosi on Tuesday named nine impeachment managers who would present the House's case during a Senate trial. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat, said Democrats intended to send impeachment charges, once approved, to the Senate "as soon as possible."It remained unclear how swiftly such a trial would take place. McConnell has said no trial could begin until the chamber returns from its recess on Jan. 19.But Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is set to become the majority leader after two Democrats from Georgia are seated and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is sworn in later this month, told reporters the Senate could be recalled to handle the matter.A two-thirds majority of the Senate is needed to convict Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to vote for conviction.Democrats could also use an impeachment trial to push through a vote blocking Trump from running for office again.Only a simple Senate majority is needed to disqualify Trump from future office, but there is disagreement among legal experts as to whether an impeachment conviction is needed before a disqualification vote.A different part of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, also provides a procedure for disqualifying Trump from future office with a simple majority of both chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-convenes-to-impeach-donald-trump-for-his-role-in-capitol-assault-101610548541105.html
13-01-2021||World||FBI says it warned about prospect of violence ahead of Capitol riot||The FBI warned law enforcement agencies ahead of last week's breach of the US Capitol about the potential for extremist-driven violence, US officials said on Tuesday, contradicting earlier statements that they were caught off guard by the assault by supporters of President Donald Trump.Nearly a week after the riot, officials said they were combing through mountains of evidence and vowed to aggressively seek out those who perpetrated the brazen attack on the US Capitol. Though most of the charges brought so far have been misdemeanors, acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said the Justice Department was considering bringing sedition charges against some of the rioters, effectively accusing them of attempting to overthrow or defeat the government.“This is only the beginning,” Sherwin said. “We’re going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent because, regardless of it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found.”The Justice Department has created a specialized strike force to examine the possibility of sedition charges, which could carry up to 20 years in prison. Officials said they were utilizing some of the same techniques in the riot probe as they use in international counterterrorism investigations, examining the money flow and movement of defendants leading up to the breach. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for the rioters to be added to a no-fly list, a tool most commonly associated with terrorisms investigations.The statements by FBI and Justice Department officials on Tuesday were intended as both a defense of federal law enforcement preparations before the deadly riot and as a warning to participants. But they also raised new questions about the coordination across agencies for the Jan. 6 riot, which was sparked by Trump's calls for his supporters to fight Congress' vote confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.In the immediate aftermath of the riot, some law enforcement officials, including the Capitol police chief, said they were unaware of serious concerns leading up to Jan. 6 and had prepared only for a free-speech protest.But on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported on the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI’s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could commit “war” in Washington the following day. Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the joint terrorism task force.D'Antuono was among the officials who suggested law enforcement had simply been caught off guard, saying on Friday: “There was no indication that there was anything other than First Amendment protected activity.”He did not explain the discrepancy in his statements, though he suggested Tuesday that the Norfolk warning was based on nonspecific information in terms of individual leads to investigate, characterizing it as a “thread on a message board" that was not attributable to any specific person.In a statement Tuesday night, the FBI said the report's author had warned that the “FBI might be encroaching on free speech rights" in pursuing further action, and that the document itself did not necessarily associate the comments with a national security threat or crime. It highlighted D'Antuono's remarks at the news conference suggesting that without knowing the identity of the people whose words were cited in the report, there was not much that could be done with the information.US Capitol Police and other official didn't immediately respond to questions about their own initial assessments of the threat.A US defense official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was not notified about the FBI warning.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that it is unclear whether any defense or military officials heard about the notification from the FBI, but that statements in recent days from all the leaders indicate they weren’t aware that violence of that level was expected at the Capitol.Defense and National Guard officials, including McCarthy, have said in interviews over the past several days they were told by DC. that they believed the protests would be similar to the ones on Nov. 14 and Dec. 12. And they said that federal law enforcement authorities said that there was activity on Twitter, but that they weren’t expecting the level of violence they ultimately saw last Wednesday.Even without intelligence from law enforcement, there had been ample warning about pro-Trump demonstrations in Washington. But Capitol Police did not bolster staffing and made no preparations for the possibility that the planned protests could escalate into massive, violent riots, according to several people briefed on the law enforcement response. Officials turned down help offered by the Pentagon three days before the riot.When backup was finally requested, it took more than two hours for troops to mobilize near the Capitol. By then the mob had raged inside for more than four hours.Once the mob began to move on the Capitol, a police lieutenant issued an order not to use deadly force, which explains why officers outside the building did not draw their weapons as the crowd closed in. Officers are sometimes ordered to keep their weapons holstered to avoid escalating a situation if superiors believe doing so could lead to a stampede or a shootout.In this instance, it also left officers with little ability to resist the mob. In one video from the scene, an officer puts up his fists to try to push back a crowd pinning him and his colleagues against a door. The crowd jeers, “You are not American!” and one man tries to prod him with the tip of an American flag.The rampage through the halls of Congress sent lawmakers of both parties and Trump’s own vice president into hiding, as crowds called for Mike Pence’s lynching for his role overseeing the vote count. The scene also undermined the hallmark of the republic — the peaceful transition of power. At least five people died, including one Capitol Police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-says-it-warned-about-prospect-of-violence-ahead-of-capitol-riot-101610545979693.html
13-01-2021||World||Explainer: Who's been charged in the deadly Capitol siege?||Prosecutors have brought dozens of cases after the deadly attack at the US Capitol, and they promise more charges are to come as investigators work to identify members of the pro-Trump mob.Investigators are combing through thousands of tips, photos, videos and social media accounts to collect evidence against the attackers who overran the Capitol to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the next president.Officials predict hundreds of criminal cases will ultimately be filed and said they are considering sedition charges against some of the rioters.Some questions and answers about the investigation into the Capitol breach:How many people have been charged?The top federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia said Tuesday that 70 people have been charged so far. About 20 federal cases have been made public, and 40 others have been filed in D.C. Superior Court.The people charged in Superior Court are mainly accused of things like curfew violations and gun crimes. Those being tried in federal court, where prosecutors can generally secure longer sentences, are charged with offenses such as violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, assaulting a federal law enforcement officer and threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.On Tuesday, federal agents arrested the son of a New York City judge, who was seen inside the Capitol wearing a fur costume and a police vest authorities say he stole during the mayhem. Aaron Mostofsky faces charges including theft of government property.Federal authorities on Sunday arrested two men who were photographed with plastic restraints inside the Capitol. Investigators said they used social media and livestream videos to identify Eric Munchel of Tennessee as the masked person seen in photos carrying plastic hand restraints in the Senate chamber.Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was photographed on the Senate floor carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing a military-style helmet and vest, authorities said. He confirmed to The New Yorker that he was the man in the photographs and claimed he found the handcuffs on the floor. “I wish I had not picked those up,” he said.Why haven't more people been charged?The recent arrests are “just the tip of the iceberg,” said Steven D’Antuono, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.Authorities have opened about 170 investigations into people who potentially committed a crime, said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The number of charges will likely grow to into the hundreds, he said.The vast amount of evidence and the number of people involved mean it will take months for investigators to sort through everything, Sherwin said. Federal agents are scouring more than 100,000 pieces of digital media they have received from the public, D’Antuono said.Sherwin vowed that authorities are in it for the “long haul.”"Even if you’ve left D.C., agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door if we find out you were part of the criminal activity at the Capitol," D’Antuono said.U.S. attorneys across the country have also said people could face charges in their home states if they traveled to Washington and took part in the assault.Could there be more serious charges?Prosecutors are looking at “significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy," Sherwin said. He has organized a group of national security and public corruption prosecutors whose sole focus is to bring that type of charge for the “most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol."After protests across the US over police brutality in the summer, then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen t old prosecutors in September that they should consider using the sedition charge against violent demonstrators. Rosen, who took over the top Justice Department job when Attorney General William Barr stepped down last month, said the charge does not require proof of a plot to overthrow the US government and gave the hypothetical example of a group that “has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force.”The FBI has also opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol police officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.Could Trump be charged?Trump urged the crowd to march on the Capitol, even promising to go with them, though he didn’t. The president told his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election, while his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for “trial by combat.”The legal bar for charging the president or any other speakers at the rally with inciting violence is high. Experts say it might be tough to prove in a normal prosecution that the president intended for violence to happen on Capitol Hill.However, Trump faces a charge of “incitement of insurrection” in an impeachment resolution to be debated by the House on Wednesday as part of an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency.Could any officers face charges?At least two Capitol police officers have been suspended — one who took a selfie with the attackers and another who put on a Make America Great Again hat. At least a dozen more are under internal investigation for their behavior during the uprising, according to lawmakers.The Capitol officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was trying to climb through a broken window into the speaker’s lobby, has been placed on administrative leave per agency policy, and the shooting is under investigation by Capitol police and the Metropolitan Police Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-who-s-been-charged-in-the-deadly-capitol-siege-101610546018672.html
13-01-2021||World||In a rare memo, top US military leaders remind troops of limits of free speech||Amid worry about renewed violence on Inauguration Day, the military's top leaders issued a written reminder to all service members Tuesday that the deadly insurrection at the Capitol last week was an anti-democratic, criminal act, and that the right to free speech gives no one the right to commit violence.A memo signed by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also reminded military members that Joe Biden was duly elected as the next president and will be sworn in to office on Jan. 20.The memo was unusual in that the military leadership, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, felt compelled to remind service members that it is wrong to disrupt the constitutional process. The language went further than statements by the civilian leader of the Pentagon, Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, by describing the assault as an act of sedition and an insurrection. Miller has called it “reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the United States Constitution.”It comes as law enforcement agencies attempt to determine the full extent of criminal activity at the Capitol and to discover the extent of participation by current or past military members.It has already been established that some military veterans participated in the riots at the Capitol, but the extent of any active-duty involvement has not been established. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran, on Monday wrote to the Defense Department requesting that its criminal investigative organizations cooperate with the FBI and the US Capitol Police in investigating whether current and retired members of the armed forces were part of a “seditious conspiracy” against the government.The Joint Chiefs memo did not allude directly to the question of military involvement.“We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law,” the memo said. "The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.“As service members, we must embody the values and ideals of the nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values and oath; it is against the law.”Gen. Robert Abrams, who as commander of US forces in South Korea is one of the Army's most senior generals but is not a member of the Joint Chiefs, wrote on Twitter that no military member should misunderstand what happened Jan. 6.“There is no ambiguity of what occurred at the Capitol — that was an attempted insurrection,” he wrote. “If you are serving in uniform and think it was something else, I would encourage (you) to sit down and read the constitution that you swore an oath to support and defend. No gray area there either. No room on our team if you are not willing to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign AND domestic.”Ahead of next week's inauguration and President Donald Trump's departure from office, the National Guard is gearing up to provide support to law enforcement agencies. There is no plan to use active-duty forces in security operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-rare-memo-top-us-military-leaders-remind-troops-of-limits-of-free-speech-101610545973683.html

Philip Howard, director of the institute and the report’s co-author said: “Our report shows misinformation has become more professionalised and is now produced on an industrial scale. Now, more than ever, the public needs to be able to rely on trustworthy information about government policy and activity”. “Social media companies need to raise their game by increasing their efforts to flag misinformation and close fake accounts without the need for government intervention, so the public has access to high-quality information,” he added.The OII team warns the level of social media manipulation has soared, with governments and political parties spending millions on private sector ‘cyber troops’, who drown out other voices on social media. Citizen influencers are used to spread manipulated messages; these include volunteers, youth groups and civil society organisations, who support their ideologies, it adds.Key findings include: Private ‘strategic communications’ firms are playing an increasing role in spreading computational propaganda, with researchers identifying state actors working with such firms in 48 countries; almost $60 million has been spent on firms who use bots and other amplification strategies to create the impression of trending political messaging. The report adds that social media has become a major battleground, with firms such as Facebook and Twitter taking steps to combat ‘cyber troops’, with some $10 million spent on social media political advertisements. The platforms removed more than 317,000 accounts and pages from ‘cyber troops’ actors between January 2019 and November 2020.The 2020 report draws upon a four-step methodology to identify evidence of globally organised manipulation campaigns, including content analysis of news articles on cyber troop activity, secondary literature review of public archives and scientific reports, generating country-specific case studies and expert consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-manipulation-a-growing-threat-to-democracies-oxford-study-101610546303113.html

Its parents are seven-year-old Maruska and an 11-year-old male, Manas.“Maruska, a first-time mom, behaves wonderfully,” zoo president Radoslaw Ratajszczak was quoted as saying.“She looks after her daughter, allows her to nurse, and is very delicate, despite weighing more than 2 tons. For example, when she lies down, she’s very careful not to crush the little one, and even gently moves her aside.” Ratajszczak said.The new baby is being cared for away from the public so far.The Indian rhinoceros was close to extinction but thanks to a protection program launched in the 1970s there are some 3,600 now, including over 170 living in 66 zoos around the world.The Indian rhinoceros can stand 3.8 meters ( 12 ft., 5 inches) tall and weigh up to 3 tons. They live in the wet, grassy areas of the northern India. They mainly feed on grass, leaves and twigs but also on fruit and aquatic vegetation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/endangered-indian-rhinoceros-baby-is-born-in-zoo-in-poland-101610543405112.html

Biden's Democratic Party will control Congress, boosting the chance his ideas become law."We will support efforts by the new Congress and incoming Administration to pass comprehensive immigration reform that improves employment-based visa programs that enhance American competitiveness, gives greater assurance to immigrant workers and employers, and promotes better and more humane immigration processing and border security practices," said Google senior vice president Kent Walker in a blog post.Walker added Google's philanthropic arm would donate $250,000 to the organization United We Dream, which helps immigrants unlawfully living in the United States after arriving as children secure work permits and avoid deportation using the deferred action program, or DACA.A court ruling expected soon threatens to pause renewals and applications for those permits, Walker said. Recipients are often called "Dreamers."Google has in the past teamed with fellow large technology companies when making statements on immigration policy. But only one other tech company spoke out on the issue this week.Uber Technologies Inc told Reuters it continued to support "Dreamers" and welcomed "the new Administration's effort to reform our nation's immigration system."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-backs-biden-immigration-efforts-covers-fees-in-dreamer-program-101610541748253.html

He added that his comment reflected only his personal view."My own personal view is you want to protect as many people as quickly as possible so you want to get through the nine categories and then move towards teachers ... police officers, shop workers," he told lawmakers on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-favours-vaccinating-teachers-police-ahead-of-2nd-dose-deployment-101610539396372.html
13-01-2021||World||China Covid pandemic control goes rural ahead of Lunar New Year||China is concentrating its pandemic prevention efforts in the rural areas as officials urge people to not travel home for the Lunar New Year festival while the country combats its most serious latest outbreak of Covid-19.Authorities said Wednesday local clinics and hospitals in villages need to strengthen their vigilance for any new Covid-19 cases, and local governments must take responsibility at every level — from county to town to village.The government is bracing for the world's largest annual migration in which hundreds of millions travel home for Lunar New Year break in February, many of them workers from cities going back to their home villages.“In the period leading up to Lunar New Year, we urge the public that those who do not need to travel, should not travel, and if one must travel, please observe all travel information and try to stagger travel to off-peak times,” Wang Bin, an official with the National Health Commission, told a news conference. “And to do personal protective measures and avoid crowded places with lots of people.”Meanwhile, millions of people are lining up in freezing temperatures to receive a second round of coronavirus tests in a city south of Beijing that is at the heart of the latest outbreak.The health commission on Wednesday announced another 90 confirmed cases in Hebei province, whose capital Shijiazhuang has accounted for the vast majority of the recent surge. Another 16 cases were reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one in the northern province of Shanxi.China had largely contained domestic spread but frigid winter temperatures have brought new outbreaks, even as China pushes to vaccinate 50 million people by mid-February. The Hebei outbreak is of particular concern because of the province’s close proximity to Beijing. Travel to and from three cities — Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang — has been suspended and residents of some communities have been told to stay home for the next week.All of Shijiazhuang’s roughly 10 million people have been ordered to undergo a second round of testing as authorities seek to isolate the sources of infection, some of which have been tentatively linked to wedding gatherings.Similar measures have been ordered around the country, particularly in Wuhan where 11 million people were placed under lockdown for 76 days last winter during the early days of the pandemic.The increased numbers come as World Health Organization experts prepare to fly on Thursday to Wuhan at the start of their investigation into the origins of the pandemic. Chinese officials said they would cooperate “closely” with the WHO in the investigation following rare criticism of the WHO head that Beijing was dragging its feet in issuing the necessary permissions.China has strictly controlled all research into the origins of the coronavirus and have used state media to promote theories that the virus may have actually been brought to China from outside.On Dec. 15, China started a mass vaccination campaign for select groups. Health workers have given over 10 million doses of one of the domestically produced Covid -19 vaccines, officials said Wednesday. Currently, China has only approved one vaccine for general use in populations aged 18-59 — an inactivated virus shot from state-owned Sinopharm.It has also approved three vaccines for emergency use, including two from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac, a private company.Sinovac's CEO announced at the same news conference that they have supplied more than 7 million shots to provinces across the country. Its vaccine has not yet been sent to regulators for final market approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-covid-pandemic-control-goes-rural-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-101610539630787.html

13-01-2021||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro sabotaged anti-Covid efforts, says Human Rights Watch||Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has tried to sabotage efforts to slow the spread of Covid-19 in his country and pursued policies that undermine the rights of Brazilians, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday.Other institutions, such as the Supreme Court and Congress, have stepped up to protect Brazilians and blocked some of Bolsonaro's most damaging policies, the rights group said in the Brazil chapter of its annual world report.Bolsonaro wanted to remove the authority of states to restrict people's movements, as they sought to contain the world's second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak after the United States, but the Supreme Court ruled against him.The top court also intervened to stop his government withholding Covid-19 data from the public and ordered the administration to draft a plan to protect Brazil's vulnerable indigenous peoples from the pandemic, while Congress passed a bill forcing it to provide emergency health care to indigenous communities.Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the gravity of Covid-19, calling it "a little flu" and criticizing lockdowns and social distancing measures. HRW said he has disseminated misleading information about the virus.The president's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Bolsonaro has argued that lockdowns badly damage Brazil's economy and leave many out of work.Outside of the pandemic response, Bolsonaro has also undermined women's rights, lashed out at reporters and civil society groups, and stigmatized and bullied independent Brazilian media, HRW said."The Supreme Court and other institutions have helped to protect Brazilians and to block many, although not all, of Bolsonaro's anti-rights policies. They need to remain vigilant," said Anna Livia Arida, HRW's Brazil Associate Director.Weakened environmental law enforcement has also allowed the illegal use of fires to clear land to soar again in the Amazon region. Deforestation hit a 12-year high in 2020, when an area of forest seven times the size of London was cleared, according to the government's space research institute (INPE)."President Bolsonaro's policies have been a disaster for the Amazon rainforest and the people who defend it," Arida said."He blames indigenous people, nongovernmental organizations and local residents for environmental destruction, instead of acting against criminal networks that are the driving force behind the lawlessness in the Amazon," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-sabotaged-anti-covid-efforts-says-human-rights-watch-101610535873241.html

Discussions about the issue were first reported by the Guardian newspaper.“We would only ever do that if it was clinically the right thing for somebody,” Hancock told Sky News. “In some cases, people need sit-down care, they don’t actually need to be in a hospital bed.”Britain already has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 83,000 deaths, and the number of hospital beds filled by Covid-19 patients patients is still rising. Hospitals in England English are now treating 55% more Covid-19 cases than during the first peak of the pandemic in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-may-move-patients-into-hotels-to-ease-hospital-strain-101610539425188.html

But the things have dramatically changed within less than 13 months and some of the House GOP members have come up in support to impeach the president for the second time. While there is scepticism around the trial and conviction of Trump in the Senate, the race to impeach the outgoing president has gathered momentum.Here’s the list of House Republicans in support of Trump’s impeachment:Liz Cheney: The third-highest-ranking Republican leader in the House issued a statement on Tuesday, saying she would vote to impeach the president. Referring to the insurrection that caused injuries, deaths and destruction at the US Capitol, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney said that the president summoned and assembled the mob and “lit the flame of this attack.” She further stated that the president could have “immediately and forcefully intervened” to stop the violence.“He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” Cheney added. "I will vote to impeach the President."Read: Controversies that dogged US President Donald Trump's time in officeAdam Kinzinger: The 42-year-old US Representative from Illinois, a known Trump critic, broke ranks with the majority of GOP colleagues, announcing that he will vote in favour of impeachment. Kinzinger said in a statement that the country was in uncharted waters and there was no doubt in his mind that the president broke his oath of office and incited the insurrection. He accused Trump of using his position in the “Executive to attack the Legislative”.“So in assessing the articles of impeachment brought before the House, I must consider: if these actions...are not worthy of impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense? I will vote in favor of impeachment,” Kinzinger said.John Katko: The former federal prosecutor was the first Republican to publicly announce that he would support the impeachment proceedings. Katko, a US representative for New York's 24th congressional district, said that impeachment of sitting president is a decision he does not take lightly. Outlining the facts related to the Capitol riots, the Republican member said it cannot be ignored that Trump encouraged the insurrection – both on social media ahead of January 6 and in his speech that day. While Katko emphasised that there must be a continuance of government and a peaceful transition of power, the GOP member said that he also stated the need to “follow the law and the facts and hold this President accountable for his actions.”“To allow the President of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy. For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this President,” Katko said in a statement.Read: Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment voteFred Upton: The representative from southwest Michigan said that Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that the nation cannot tolerate any effort to impede the peaceful transfer of power. Referring to Trump’s latest remark in which he called his rally “totally appropriate”, Upton said the president sent the wrong signal to those who support the core of democratic principles and took a solemn oath to the Constitution.“I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process. I fear this will now interfere with important legislative business and a new Biden administration. But it is time to say: Enough is Enough,” Upton said in a statement, adding that he would vote to impeach.Jaime Herrera Beutler: The representative of Washington State is the latest Republican to announce her support in the favour of impeachment. Beutler said the offences of the president were impeachable based on the “indisputable evidence we already have.” She stated that Trump’s denouncement to the violence was not only “pathetic” but also served as a “wink and nod” to those who perpetuated it.“I understand the argument that the best course is not to further inflame the country or alienate Republican voters,” she said. “But I am a Republican voter. I believe in our Constitution, individual liberty, free markets, charity, life, justice, peace and this exceptional country. I see that my own party will be best served when those among us choose truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-2-0-list-of-republicans-who-will-join-democrats-in-house-vote-101610538479140.html
13-01-2021||World||Covid-19: UK armed forces dealing with ‘most dangerous situation’||Record numbers of personnel from British armed forces have been deployed to help deal the “most dangerous situation” in living memory facing hospitals, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and ministers implored Britons not to flout current lockdown rules.This is the largest peacetime resilience operation ever undertaken by the UK armed forces and is drawing on every corner of expertise of the military, defence secretary Ben Wallace told parliament on Wednesday, as new cases and deaths continued to surge.Johnson confirmed in parliament on Wednesday that vaccination centres will soon be open 24 hours to enable more people to be vaccinated.There have been several reports of Britons weary of continuing restrictions violating them, prompting Scotland Yard in London and other police forces imposing heavy fines. Some hospitals are shifting non-Covid patients to hotels to free up space for new coronavirus patients.According to chief medical officer Chris Whitty, “Hospitals are always busy in the winter but the NHS in some parts of the country is currently facing the most dangerous situation anyone can remember”.Wallace said a record 5,300 personnel committed to winter and Covid operations have been supporting 56 different tasks in the UK and abroad, including the vaccine rollout, NHS support and community testing across the UK.Nearly 1,600 military medical professionals are deployed in the hospitals every day, from intensive care nurses to specialist surgeons, which means that very few defence medics are not currently deployed or working in the NHS.Wallace said: “Our country faces an unprecedented challenge and our Armed Forces are working hand in hand with the NHS. We will continue to bolster those on the front line as they protect and care for the most vulnerable”.Chief of the defence staff General Nick Carter added: “These are really challenging times for everyone at the moment. We all have a role to play in supporting those on the frontline in the fight against the virus”.The ministry of defence said the military is also working with education authorities to ensure that staff, vulnerable children and children of key workers can continue to attend school. Military planners and liaison officers are also embedded in local authorities and government departments, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-armed-forces-dealing-with-most-dangerous-situation-101610539283616.html
13-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un Sister slams ‘Weird Group’ in South Korea for spying||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a new rhetorical attack on their neighbor, slamming South Korea for spying on its actions during a rare party congress that included a military parade in Pyongyang.Kim Yo Jong, in a statement released by the state’s official Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday condemned South Korea for taking a “hostile approach toward fellow countrymen in the North,” and called the country’s intelligence officials “idiots,” for paying so much attention to what Pyongyang was doing during the gathering.Her comments followed the eight-day ruling party congress that concluded Tuesday. Her brother Kim Jong Un outlined Pyongyang’s military goals during the gathering of party officials that included boosting his nuclear arsenal in the face of U.S. “hostilities.”“The southerners are a truly weird group that’s hard to understand,” she said, criticizing South Korea’s military intelligence for tracking the movements in Pyongyang. She also disclosed that North Korea may have held a military parade Sunday night.“Why do they crane their necks to follow what’s happening in the North?” Kim Yo Jong said, according to the KCNA report.Her comments come after South Korean President Moon Jae-in made a fresh appeal this week for cooperation between the neighbors on the heavily armed peninsula.Despite a litany of insults and provocations, which included the June destruction of a joint liaison office just north of the border that was the president’s most tangible symbol of his reconciliation push, Moon has steadfastly embraced rapprochement with Pyongyang, which has shown no interest in taking the aid he has offered.During the ruling party congress, leader Kim declared the U.S. the “biggest main enemy” and said he would do “everything” to advance Pyongyang’s nuclear and military capabilities, laying out a renewed diplomatic challenge to the incoming administration of Joe Biden.North Korea is due to convene its parliament on Jan. 17, KCNA said, a meeting that could give further indications about how it will engage with Seoul and Biden.The state has not yet aired footage of the military parade, after it broadcast a slickly edited program hours after an October parade that was the biggest display of new weaponry in years. The event with thousands of goose-stepping soldiers included a new intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said was designed to deliver multiple nuclear warheads to the U.S.The ‘Princess’Kim Yo Jong’s status has changed from first deputy director of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea to vice department director of the Central Committee of WPK, according to KCNA, in what appears to be a demotion in the party structure.But the sister who was reportedly dubbed “Princess Yo Jong” by her father and former leader Kim Jong Il is a direct bloodline member of the ruling family, a status that exceeds posts in the party structure. Her name is still being called before most other party officials in the state broadcasts.Kim Yon Jong’s statement “shows that she is still in charge of South Korean affairs, regardless of her official title,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center based in Washington. “We can’t say that her political status has declined.”Kim saw her profile rise among political analysts as the likely successor to her brother when a prolonged absence in April raised questions about his health. She also took a more prominent role on policies toward the country’s two biggest adversaries, the U.S. and South Korea.Kim Yo Jong made her debut at a major global event in 2018 when she served as her brother’s envoy to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, sitting behind U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at opening ceremonies.The upcoming Summer Olympics planned for Tokyo in July could offer her another chance to stand on the world stage. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told a news conference Wednesday that he’s willing to meet Kim Jong Un without preconditions and wouldn’t miss a chance that may arise with the upcoming games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-sister-slams-weird-group-in-south-korea-for-spying-101610538609983.html
13-01-2021||World||China scrambles to control Covid outbreak, more than 28 million locked down||China is scrambling to control a new wave of Covid-19 outbreak, locking down some 28 million people across two provinces, carrying out mass-scale nucleic acid tests and appealing to citizens not to travel ahead of the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays in February.Several provinces and cities across China have put in place travel restrictions as health authorities work overtime to contact-trace and isolate suspected cases who have travelled out from the locked down regions.More than 28 million residents in four cities in the provinces of Hebei and Heilongjiang have been put under home quarantine with intercity travel suspended and intracity movements restricted.China has recorded the biggest daily jump in Covid-19 cases in more than five months with 115 new confirmed cases reported for Tuesday in the mainland compared with 55 a day earlier. This was the highest daily increase since July 30.The increase in new infections comes as a World Health Organization team is slated to arrive in China on Thursday to probe the origins of the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The team will fly from Singapore to Wuhan on Thursday.The new infection numbers – though fewer than daily numbers in many Covid-hit places in the world – are a source of worry for the Communist Party of China-led government, which has repeatedly trumpeted its success in controlling the pandemic since it emerged from a Chinese city in late 2019.Officials said that new clusters have been triggered through community transmission.The national health commission (NHC) spokesperson, Mi Feng said the new outbreaks are characterised by long duration, wide coverage, rapid transmission, older patients, and high proportions in rural areas. In some places, community transmission and multi-generation transmission, Mi told a press conference on Wednesday, adding that the situation was complex and severe.The worst affected Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, has put three cities - Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang - into lockdown as part of the efforts to keep the virus from spreading further.The northeastern province of Heilongjiang province on Wednesday declared a Covid-19 emergency, putting the city of Suihua and its 5.2 million residents, under lockdown.Tieli, a city of about 300,000 people that borders Suihua, according to agency reports, said on Wednesday it will not allow any people or vehicles to leave for three days as part of new prevention measures.The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at 87,706, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.Meanwhile, China is administering domestically developed vaccines to specific groups with high infection risks, including medical workers, airport staff and people handling cold-chain imported products.“Over 1 million people in Beijing had received the first dose of vaccine as of 11 am Monday. The city is expected to complete administering the first dose of the jab among specific groups by Friday,” Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said in a report on Wednesday.The WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that a WHO team in China is working with producers of the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines for potential emergency use listings.“I’m pleased that a WHO team is in China currently working with producers of the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines to assess compliance with international quality manufacturing practices ahead of potential emergency use listing by WHO,” Tedros said at a media briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-scrambles-to-control-covid-outbreak-more-than-28-million-locked-down-101610538562949.html

Earlier this week, J&J's chief executive officer said the company was on track to have close to a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses by 2021-end, and that it was in the final stages of analyzing data from a large trial of the vaccine.J&J and the US Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.In August, J&J signed a $1 billion contract with the US government to supply up to 100 million doses by mid-2021.Approval for J&J's vaccine could help speed up the vaccination effort in the United States as it likely requires a single dose unlike the two currently approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are to be administered in two-dose series weeks apart.J&J said in December it expects interim data from the late-stage trial by the end of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-may-not-meet-us-covid-19-vaccine-supply-target-by-spring-report-101610538164871.html
13-01-2021||World||CCP wants different theory of global relations that won't create freedom: Pompeo||As relations between the United States and China continue to worsen, secretary of state Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) wants "a very different theory" of international relations that's controlled in a way that won't create security, freedom and prosperity.Pompeo, in an interview with Hugh Hewitt of The Hugh Hewitt Show, said that all Washington asks is that the CCP fulfills the promises that "it has made to not only the United States but to the world for all these years.""I think the world, and that includes the American people, will continue to demand that the United States secure freedoms for them, and that includes pushing back against the challenge of our time. That is the challenge of the Chinese Communist Party and its capacity and intention to expand its influence and ultimately deliver a world that is very different, one not governed by the rule of law, by respect for sovereignty, all the things that the world has come to know in the post-World War II environment," he said in the interview as quoted by the transcript provided by the Department of State."The Chinese Communist Party wants to upend with a very different theory of international relations, one dominated by the East, one controlled in a way that won't create more security, freedom, more prosperity," Pompeo added.When asked about whether President-elect Joe Biden would stand up to the CCP, the top US diplomat said that he was confident that the American people including Biden would make sure that America remains the country it has for the last 240-plus years."I am confident the American people will demand that whoever is leading their country, President-elect Biden included, respond to that in a way that continues to make sure that America remains the country it has for the last 240-plus years, and that the world continue to operate under a set of rules that are based in human rights, based in the law, based in respect for sovereignty," he said.Pompeo lashed out at the CCP for refusing to allow anybody to get access to the information they need to figure the origins of Covid-19 adding that he was not optimistic about the World Health Organization's (WHO) visit to China."It sounds like yesterday or the day before they may finally have let the World Health Organization enter. I hope, but I'm not optimistic, that they will actually let them do the work that needs to be done: see records, see the lab, see the original work that was done, see - talk to, interview all of the people, not with minders around, but in a situation where those people would be free to speak their mind. I hope that investigation can be thorough," he said.When asked about whether he would accept any other alternative explanation that Covid-19 originated from Wuhan, he said that the CCP "has offered not one, not two, but at least three alternative theories for where this began.""They continue to attempt to obfuscate. Everything that we have seen indicates that this began not only inside of China but at Hubei province, Wuhan," he added.On the subject of whether China owes reparations to the world, Pompeo said that there "will be hundreds and hundreds of thousands" more people continue to live in poverty as a direct result of the economic challenges that the 'Wuhan virus' has foisted upon the world."I think the world will respond to this in a way that recognizes what the Chinese Communist Party did by delaying their activation of the promises that they had made to the World Health Organization, and there will be costs that are attached to that as a direct result of the things that the Chinese Communist Party did," he said.Pompeo, who has been critical of the world health body, said it was corrupted by China's influence, "and bought cheap." "WHO investigators still can't access Wuhan - a year after the first cases were reported #ChinaLiedMillionsDied," he said in a tweet on Monday.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ccp-wants-different-theory-of-global-relations-that-won-t-create-freedom-pompeo-101610537624970.html
13-01-2021||World||US must reverse Trump course, make human rights central: Human Rights Watch||US President-elect Joe Biden needs to restore the country's credibility on human rights at home and abroad, the head of New-York based Human Rights Watch told Reuters on Wednesday, after what he said were four years of abuse of democratic principles.Speaking to Reuters before the release of the activist group's annual report, Kenneth Roth said outgoing president Donald Trump had flouted human rights at home and been inconsistent in criticising other countries' rights records.Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, should make human rights a cornerstone of US foreign policy, said Roth, HRW executive director."Trump has been a complete disaster for human rights, he flouted human rights at home with the fomenting of the January 6 attack on the Capitol being just the latest example of the natural culmination of four years of abuse of democratic principles," Roth told Reuters Television in Geneva.With eight days remaining of Trump's term, the House will vote on Wednesday on an article of impeachment accusing him of inciting insurrection in a speech to his followers last week before a mob of them stormed the Capitol, leaving five dead.Trump has denied responsibility for the violence and previous allegations of violating human rights. He has said his critics stole the election to block his "Make America Great Again" and "America First" policies, but produced no evidence.Roth accused Trump of having "cozied up to every friendly autocrat under the sun" while reserving criticism on human rights issues for his "perceived adversaries" - Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, and "sometimes China"."But that kind of utterly inconsistent approach had no credibility. There was no force to his criticism when people knew that it was serving another political agenda, not a principled agenda," he said.Biden should articulate human rights as a "guiding principle of US foreign policy and then to stick with it, even when that’s difficult", Roth said.He urged him to call off arms sales to countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel and criticise Indian prime minister Modi over his policy towards Muslims, "even though India is going to be an important ally in contesting China".Roth also called for Biden to re-engage with the United Nations' Human Rights Council, a Geneva forum which Trump quit in June 2018, "even though it criticizes Israel".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-reverse-trump-course-make-human-rights-central-human-rights-watch-101610536229327.html
13-01-2021||World||Intense Israeli airstrikes in east Syria said to kill dozens||Israeli warplanes carried out intense airstrikes on eastern Syria early Wednesday, apparently targeting positions and arms depots of Iran-backed forces. Dozens of fighters were killed or wounded, according to an opposition war monitor.A senior US intelligence official with knowledge of the attack told The Associated Press that the airstrikes were carried out with intelligence provided by the United States — a rare incidence of publicized cooperation between the two countries over choosing targets in Syria. The official said the strikes targeted a series of warehouses in Syria that were being used in a pipeline to store and stage Iranian weapons.The US official, who requested anonymity to speak about sensitive national security matters, said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed Tuesday’s airstrike with Yossi Cohen, chief of Israel’s spy agency Mossad, at a public meeting in popular Washington restaurant Café Milano on Monday.The official said the warehouses also served as a pipeline for components that support Iran’s nuclear program.Syria’s state news agency SANA said the strikes hit areas in and near the towns of Deir el-Zour, Mayadeen and Boukamal along the border with Iraq. An unnamed military official was quoted as saying Syrian air defenses responded to the incoming missiles. It gave no further details.An opposition war monitor reported at least 18 strikes in Deir el-Zour and along the border with Iraq, saying several arms depots were hit. Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 40 people were killed, including nine Syrian troops, and the rest were Iran-backed fighters. It said 37 were wounded.“They burnt Iranian positions in Deir el-Zour,” said Omar Abu Laila, a Europe-based activist from Syria’s eastern Deir el-Zour province who runs an activist collective that reports on news in the border area. He recorded at least 16 targeted buildings, warehouses or bases for Iranian, Lebanese and Iraqi militias in the towns of Boukamal, Mayadeen and Deir el-Zour.Israel has launched hundreds of strikes against Iran-linked military targets in Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations.The Observatory said it recorded 39 Israeli strikes inside Syria in 2020 that hit 135 targets, including military posts, warehouses or vehicles. In those attacks, at least 217 people were killed, mostly Iranian-allied militiamen, according to the Observatory.The strikes come at a time of heightened tension in the region in the final days of President Donald Trump’s administration.Many fear retaliation for the US killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani last year may come before Trump leaves office, or that conflict could erupt to scuttle efforts by Joe Biden’s incoming administration to negotiate with Iran.Israel views Iranian entrenchment on its northern frontier as a red line, and it has repeatedly struck Iran-linked facilities and weapons convoys destined for Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.The strikes also come amid intensifying low-altitude Israeli warplane missions in Lebanese skies that have caused jitters among residents and prompted Lebanon to file an urgent complaint to the UN about the violations of its airspace. Israeli officials have said the overflights are necessary because Hezbollah is violating the 2006 UN resolution that bars it from building up its military capabilities and operating near the Israeli border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intense-israeli-airstrikes-in-east-syria-said-to-kill-dozens-101610536447012.html

The demonstration was organized by Crime Minister, one of several groups that have sprung up in recent months calling for Netanyahu to resign over the trial and his government's handling of the coronavirus.For months, protesters have held weekly demonstrations outside the prime minister's office and at major road intersections and bridges across the country.Netanyahu was indicted last year on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust linked to three corruption cases. He has denied any wrongdoing and accuses the media, law enforcement and judicial officials of waging a “witch hunt” against him.The protesters Wednesday morning read the indictment outside his residence. He was supposed to appear in court Wednesday, but the hearing was postponed to Feb. 8 because of a coronavirus lockdown that heavily restricts public gatherings.Netanyahu is once again fighting for re-election ahead of a nationwide vote in March — the fourth to be held in Israel in less than two years. Polls show his Likud party winning the most seats but being unable to form a coalition government because of rivalries with other right-wing leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-hold-dawn-protest-over-pm-s-corruption-trial-101610522856407.html
13-01-2021||World||As China Covid-19 cases rise, millions more placed under lockdown||China posted its biggest daily jump in Covid cases in more than five months on Wednesday, stepping up containment measures that have seen four cities put under lockdown, as the world's second biggest economy scrambles to head off a new wave of infections.Most of the new cases were reported near the capital, Beijing, but a province in the far northeast also saw a rise in infections, official data showed, amid a resurgence that has seen more than 28 million people put under home quarantine.While the Chinese city of Wuhan was the initial epicenter of the novel coronavirus, which emerged there in late 2019, China had in recent months largely kept it at bay.On Wednesday, the National Health Commission reported a total of 115 new confirmed cases on the mainland, compared with 55 the previous day, the highest daily increase since July 30.It said 107 of the new cases were local infections. Hebei, the province that surrounds Beijing, accounted for 90 cases, while northeastern Heilongjiang province reported 16 new cases.The wave of infections is likely to put a damper on next month's Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their home towns. Far fewer are expected to hit the road this year, and many provinces have asked migrant workers to stay put during the break.A "massive" resurgence is unlikely during the holiday if control and prevention measures are enforced properly, Feng Zijian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a media briefing.The spike in new cases comes as a World Health Organization team of experts investigating the origins of the pandemic is set to arrive on Thursday in Wuhan. The team will have to spend 14 days in quarantine, NHC spokesman Mi Feng said.Much remains unknown about the origins of the coronavirus and China has been sensitive about accusations of a cover-up that delayed its initial response and allowed the virus to spread. A health expert affiliated with the WHO said previously that expectations should be "very low" that the team would reach a conclusion from its trip.Testing capacityHebei province has put three cities - Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang - into lockdown, while Beijing city authorities have stepped up screening and prevention measures.China has administered more than 10 million vaccine doses, NHC official Wang Bin said on Wednesday, and has ramped up testing capacity to 12.55 million people per day, or 10 times the level last March.Heilongjiang province on Wednesday declared a Covid-19 emergency. The city of Suihua, which borders the provincial capital Harbin, put its 5.2 million people under lockdown.Most of the cases in Heilongjiang have been found in Wangkui county, under Suihua's jurisdiction. Tieli, a city of about 300,000 that borders Suihua, said on Wednesday it would ban people and vehicles from leaving for three days as part of new Covid-19 prevention measures.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 38 from 81 cases a day earlier. Seven of those were reported in Jilin, a northeastern province bordering Heilongjiang.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 87,706, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-china-covid-19-cases-rise-millions-more-placed-under-lockdown-101610533121047.html
13-01-2021||World||Japan widens Covid-19 emergency for 7 more areas as cases surge||Japan expanded a coronavirus state of emergency for seven more prefectures Wednesday, affecting more than half the population amid a surge in infections across the country.Prime Minister Yoshide Suga’s announcement comes less than a week after he declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and three nearby prefectures. The new declaration, which adds seven other prefectures in western and central Japan, takes effect Thursday and lasts until Feb. 7.The government is asking bars and restaurants in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures to close by 8 pm, employers to have 70% of their staff work from home and residents in the affected areas avoid going out for nonessential purposes.Suga has been criticized as being to slow to act as the country’s number of reported coronavirus infections and deaths roughly doubled over the past month to about 300,000 and 4,100. Both states of emergency were declared only after local leaders had pleaded with him to do so.Experts have warned that even the state of emergency measures, which are non-binding and largely rely on voluntary cooperation, may be insufficient to significantly slow the infections.Unlike the earlier seven-week emergency Japan had in April and May last year, schools, gyms, theaters and shops will stay open.Suga has faced criticism for not taking strong enough government action earlier in the outbreak. He mostly limited his interventions to asking the public to take basic safety measures such as wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding drinking and dining in groups until mid-December, when he finally announced the suspension of a government-subsidized tourism campaign.Suga eventually took action after calls from the local leaders, while his support ratings nosedived in polls showing the public increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of the virus.Suga took office in mid-September and pledged to keep the infections under control while also getting the economy back on track. He also promised to successfully hold the Tokyo Olympic, which were postponed from last year until this coming summer.Despite the current surge in infections, Japan has reported far fewer infections than many countries of its size.Japan made it through earlier surges in infections without a lockdown, but experts and officials warn that people are growing fatigued and are becoming less cooperative than before.In a bid to more effectively enforce virus measures, Suga has said he will seek a legal revision in parliament next week to allow authorities to penalize business owners who defy official requests for coronavirus measures, while legally providing compensation to those who comply. Suga’s government also plans to revise the infectious disease control law so it can penalize patients who defy self-isolation requirements, hospitalization or cooperation with health authorities, Japanese media reports say.Japan Medical Association President Toshio Nakagawa said at a news conference Wednesday that medical systems in the country have been collapsing, with regular daily treatment at many hospitals compromised due to the growing burden of coronavirus patients.“I’m afraid a fear of explosive infections as in the U.S. and Europe can become a reality,” he said, urging people to cooperate, regain their sense of crisis and urgency.Japanese coronavirus measures have relied heavily on widespread mask wearing, contact tracing and other safety measures. But the number of new cases in the current outbreak has made contact tracing impossible, prompting Tokyo and neighboring prefectures to announce a cutback on the strategy to relieve the burden on local public health officials.Experts have also raised concerns about cases of more contagious variant of the coronavirus that has spread across Britain. About 30 cases of the new variant have been detected since late December. Another variant was also detected in four people arriving from Brazil this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-widens-covid-19-emergency-for-7-more-areas-as-cases-surge-101610532705606.html

We hope that with vaccinations picking up the pace we will reach the point of full recovery in the shortest possible time," the crown prince wrote on Twitter.According to the statistics of the ourworldindata.org web portal, which compiles official data on Covid-19 in each country, the UAE ranks second in the world after Israel and first among the Arab states in the number of vaccinations.The vaccine is currently available to any individual aged over 18. The UAE authorities intend to inoculate 50 per cent of the country's over-9-million population during the first quarter of 2021. In December, Abu Dhabi approved two vaccines against the coronavirus, namely the one developed by US firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and the one by China's Sinopharm.Among other things, western media have reported that some of the wealthiest citizens of the United Kingdom prefer receiving a shot in Emirati private clinics without waiting for their turn for vaccination back home.In December, the UK informed the World Health Organisation of a mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is reported to be 70 per cent more transmissible than other coronavirus strains. Although the new strain has not been proven to be more pathogenic, many states shut their borders and suspended travel with the United Kingdom. The UAE, however, remains open for UK travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-1-2-million-people-in-uae-get-covid-19-vaccine-abu-dhabi-crown-prince-101610531766467.html

There has been a dramatic rise in the risk index," Speranza told the lower house of parliament.Italy has registered 79,819 Covid-19 deaths since its outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the second-highest toll in Europe and the sixth-highest in the world.

13-01-2021||World||Trump impeachment 2.0: All you need to know about historic vote on January 13||The US House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday on one article of impeachment against President Donald Trump after vice president Mike Pence rejected a resolution that called on him to invoke 25th Amendment of the Constitution. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Pence said that the 25th Amendment is not a means of "punishment or usurpation", and invoking it would set a "terrible precedent". Now that the Democrats have exhausted all options to remove Trump from the office, their initiative to impeach him for the second time has gathered momentum, with some House Republicans turning their back on the outgoing president.What are the charges against Trump?House Democrats have introduced a single article of impeachment against Trump, charging him with “incitement of insurrection” that led to the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 when the Congress was scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win. In the final text of the resolution to impeach the president, Democrats stated that Trump engaged in “high crimes and misdemeanours” by inciting violence against the government of the United States.The Democrats have accused Trump of repeatedly issuing false statements in which he had asserted that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud. They have alleged that the outgoing president incited members of the crowd at The Ellipse in Washington, DC, in an attempt to interfere with the joint session of the US Congress.Read | Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment voteThe impeachment article also mentions Trump’s previous efforts to overturn the election by attempting to obstruct the certification of the results. It highlights Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, in which he was caught on tape urging the official to "find" enough votes to overturn the election results of the state.“In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,” the text reads.How likely is Trump’s impeachment?The House of Representatives will vote on the article of impeachment and the majority of members would require to vote in favour to get Trump impeached for the second time during his four-year tenure. Though Republicans narrowed their disadvantage in the recently concluded House elections, Democrats held onto their majority.While the House Republicans didn’t vote for Trump’s impeachment in 2019, three GOP colleagues have come up in support of his impeachment and removal from the office. Republican House members Liz Cheney, John Katko and Adam Kinzinger have said that they would vote for impeachment. It is now highly likely that Trump will get impeached by the House with Democratic majority, with additional support from some Republicans, making him the only president in the history of the United States to be impeached twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-2-0-all-you-need-to-know-about-historic-vote-on-january-13-101610531350615.html

Now Broadsheet revelations have again exposed the massive scale of our ruling elite corruption & money laundering,” Khan tweeted.“These revelations (are) tip of the iceberg. We want complete transparency from the Broadsheet on our elites money laundering and on who stopped investigations,” he said.Khan said these revelations had repeatedly exposed what he had been saying in his "24-year fight against corruption which is the biggest threat to the country's progress"."These elites come to power and plunder the country. They do money laundering to stash their ill-gotten gains abroad, safe from domestic prosecution. Then they use their political clout to get NROs. That is how they kept their plundered wealth safe," he said, adding that the nation suffered as a consequence.He went to add that these elites cannot hide behind the "victimisation" card on these international revelations.National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) was the law enacted by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf to waive off all cases and corruption charges against former premier Benazir Bhutto, her husband Asif Ali Zardari and dozens of others in 2007 to strike a political deal with her.The infamous law has become synonymous with the political concession to make political deals.After Moussavi's revelations, Khan formed an inter-ministerial committee to probe the allegation of corruption against people mentioned.“The cabinet formed an inter-ministerial committee, which will reveal details of the individuals mentioned in the Broadsheet scandal,” Information Minister Shibli Faraz said.He said that Khan had decided to make the names public after thorough scrutiny.The UK company Broadsheet LLC was registered in the Isle of Man in the time former president Pervez Musharraf and it entered into a deal with Pakistan’s National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to track down ill-gotten foreign assets of Pakistani.The contract was terminated in 2003 by the NAB.Dawn reported that a lawyer associated with the company earlier told the newspaper that the Sharifs were the “top target” of the Broadsheet investigation.The company's owner alleged that someone claiming to be associated with Sharif approached him in 2012 and offered a sum of money to drop the probe against him.The timing of fresh allegations against Sharif coincides with his party fully supporting an Opposition alliance to topple Khan’s government on the allegations of electoral fraud.Sharif, 70, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) supremo, has been living in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court permitted him to go abroad for four weeks for treatment.The three-time former prime minister, convicted in two corruption cases -- Avenfield properties and Al-Azizia -- was declared a proclaimed offender by the Islamabad High Court after he failed to appear before it despite several warnings.

13-01-2021||World||US carries out its first execution of female inmate since 1953||A Kansas woman was executed Wednesday for strangling an expectant mother in Missouri and cutting the baby from her womb, the first time in nearly seven decades that the US government has put to death a female inmate.Lisa Montgomery, 52, was pronounced dead at 1:31 am after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. She was the 11th prisoner executed at the facility since July when President Donald Trump, an ardent supporter of capital punishment, resumed federal executions following 17 years without one.As a curtain was raised in the execution chamber, Montgomery looked momentarily bewildered as she glanced at journalists peering at her from behind thick glass. A woman standing over her shoulder leaned over, gently removed Montgomery’s face mask and asked if she had any last words.“No,” Montgomery responded in a quiet, muffled voice. She said nothing else.She tapped her fingers nervously for several seconds — a heart-shaped tattoo on her thumb — showed no signs of distress, and quickly closed her eyes. As the lethal injection began, Montgomery kept licking her lips and gasped briefly as pentobarbital, the lethal drug, entered her body through IVs on both arms. A few minutes later, her midsection throbbed for a moment, but quickly stopped.Montgomery lay on a gurney in the pale-green execution chamber, her glasses on and her grayish brown hair spilling over a green medical pillow. At 1:30 a.m., an official in black gloves with a stethoscope walked into the room, listened to her heart and chest, then walked out. She was pronounced dead a minute later.“The craven bloodlust of a failed administration was on full display tonight,” Montgomery’s attorney, Kelley Henry, said in a statement. “Everyone who participated in the execution of Lisa Montgomery should feel shame.”“The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,” Henry said. “Lisa Montgomery’s execution was far from justice.”It came after hours of legal wrangling before the Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution to move forward. Montgomery was the first of the final three federal inmates scheduled to die before next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to discontinue federal executions.In a separate ruling Tuesday, which the government can still seek to overturn, another federal judge halted the scheduled executions later this week of Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs. Johnson, convicted of killing seven people related to his drug trafficking in Virginia, and Higgs, convicted of ordering the murders of three women in Maryland, both tested positive for COVID-19 last month.The men's attorneys argued that lung damage caused by the coronavirus would make it more likely that the lethal injection would cause them severe pain. If they aren't executed before Biden becomes president, they may likely never be put to death.Montgomery killed 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then cut the baby girl from the womb with a kitchen knife. Montgomery took the child with her and attempted to pass the girl off as her own.An appeals court granted Montgomery a stay of execution Tuesday, shortly after another appeals court lifted an Indiana judge’s ruling that found she was likely mentally ill and couldn’t comprehend she would be put to death. But both appeals were lifted, allowing the execution to go forward.As the only woman on federal death row, Montgomery had been held in a prison in Texas and was brought to Terre Haute on Monday night.Montgomery’s legal team says she suffered “sexual torture" for years, including gang rapes, as a child, permanently scarring her emotionally and exacerbating mental-health issues that ran in her family.At trial, prosecutors accused Montgomery of faking mental illness, noting her killing of Stinnett was premeditated and included meticulous planning, including online research on how to perform a C-section.Henry balked at that idea, citing brain scans that supported the diagnosis of mental illness. She said the issue at the core of legal arguments was not whether she knew the killing was wrong in 2004 but whether she fully grasped why she was to be executed.According to her lawyers, Montgomery suffered from depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. At around the time of the killing, they say she had a rare condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman’s false belief she is pregnant triggers hormonal and physical changes as if she were actually pregnant.Montgomery also experienced delusions and hallucinations, believing God spoke with her through connect-the-dot puzzles, defense experts said.Details of the crime at times left jurors in tears during her trial.Prosecutors told the jury Montgomery drove about 170 miles (274 kilometers) from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Stinnett. She strangled Stinnett, performed a crude cesarean and fled with the baby.Prosecutors said Stinnett regained consciousness and tried to defend herself as Montgomery cut the baby girl from her womb. Later that day, Montgomery called her husband from Topeka, Kansas, telling him she had delivered the baby earlier in the day at a birthing center.Montgomery was arrested the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who is now 16 years old and hasn’t spoken publicly about the tragedy.Prosecutors said the motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children. Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.Anti-death penalty groups said Trump pushed for executions prior to the November election in a cynical bid to burnish a reputation as a law-and-order leader.The last woman executed by the federal government was Bonnie Brown Heady on Dec. 18, 1953, for the kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old boy in Missouri.The last woman executed by a state was Kelly Gissendaner, 47, on Sept. 30, 2015, in Georgia. She was convicted of murder in the 1997 slaying of her husband after she conspired with her lover, who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-its-1st-execution-of-female-inmate-since-1953-101610527834096.html

Here are some major events that took place during his term in the White House and before the US Capitol riots:1. Border wall: Stopping illegal immigration, including from Mexico, was one of Trump’s major poll planks. On January 25, 2017, just four days after taking oath, he signed Executive Order 13767, directing that a wall be built on the US-Mexico border. The construction began in 2019 but is yet to be completed.2. Protests against ‘Muslim’ ban: Widespread protests broke out after Trump signed Executive Order 13769 on January 27, 2017. In reality a travel ban, it was called a ‘Muslim’ ban as it barred immigration to the US from countries with substantial Muslim population.3. US withdraws from Paris climate accord: In accordance with his “America first” policy, Trump announced on June 1, 2017, that the US would be withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement, popularly known as the Paris climate accord.4. ‘March for our lives’ protests: Amid a spiral in gun violence, with many incidents taking place in schools and campuses, student-led ‘March for our lives’ protests, in support of gun control legislation, took place on March 24, 2018.5. Withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal: On May 8, 2018, the US announced its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCOPA), known in popular parlance as the “Iran nuclear deal.” It was signed on July 14, 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), and Germany.6. Trump meets Kim Jong-un: The two leaders met for the first time on June 12, 2018 in Singapore, in what was the maiden meeting between leaders of the US and North Korea. Trump and Kim met for a second time in Hanoi on February 27-28, 2019 and followed it up with a meeting on the heavily militarised border between South and North Korea on June 30, 2019.7. Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: The ISIS chief detonated a suicide belt as the US Special Forces carried out a raid targeting him in Barisha, Syria, on October 26-27, 2019. “Baghdadi died whimpering and crying and screaming,” Trump would announce at a press conference.8. First “impeachment” and acquittal: The US House of Representatives “impeached” Trump on December 18, 2019 after he was found “guilty” of actions which led to him being charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. However, on February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted by the Senate.9. Killing of Qasem Soleimani: A US drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on January 3, 2020. This led to a spike in tensions between the US and Iran, leading to events that many speculated would result in the “third world war.”10. George Floyd murder and BLM protests: The killing at the hands of the Minneapolis Police of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, triggered massive outrage.

13-01-2021||World||Indonesian searchers hunt for crashed plane's voice recorder||Divers searching for a crashed jet's cockpit voice recorder were sifting through mud and plane debris on the seabed between Indonesian islands on Wednesday to retrieve information key to learning why the Sriwijaya Air jet nosedived into the Java Sea over the weekend.Indonesian navy divers on Tuesday recovered the flight data recorder from the jet that disappeared Saturday minutes after taking off from Jakarta with 62 people aboard. The information on both black boxes will be key to the crash investigation.The 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 had resumed commercial flights last month after almost nine months out of service because of flight cutbacks caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The US Federal Aviation Administration sent an airworthiness directive requiring operators of various Boeing 737 aircraft models, including the 737-500, to carry out engine checks before they can be flown again after being out of service. The order followed reports of engines shutting down in mid-flight because of corrosion in a key valve.Director General of Air Transportation Novie Riyanto said the plane was inspected on Dec. 2, including checks for engine corrosion, and was declared airworthy by Indonesia’s Transportation Ministry on Dec. 14. It resumed commercial flights on Dec. 22, according to ministry data. After returning to service, the plane made 132 flights, including the last one, according to aviation-data firm Flightradar24.Aviation experts said planes that are parked for long stretches can be returned to flight safely.“It depends on how the airline maintains the aircraft while it is grounded,” said William Waldock, an aviation-safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. He said airlines should run engines periodically and perform other maintenance. “It tends to keep everything lubricated, and it reduces the likelihood of corrosion building up in places you don’t want it to be,” he said.John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, said preparing a long-grounded jet can be an intensive and expensive chore, taking a team of mechanics up to two weeks to check engines and make sure that electronic, hydraulic and fuel systems are operating and free of contamination.Goglia said that his initial thought on learning about the plane’s long grounding “was if they did the proper due diligence, because sometimes that stuff doesn’t show up for a little while.”Navy officials have said the two black boxes were buried in seabed mud under tons of sharp objects in the plane’s wreckage, slowing the search efforts. A signal that may be from the cockpit voice recorder was detected near where the flight data recorder was recovered, between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain just north of Jakarta.At least 160 divers were deployed Wednesday to boost the search for the recorder that holds conversations between pilots.More than 3,300 rescue personnel, 13 helicopters, 54 ships and 20 raft boats searched Wednesday in the area of the java Sea where the jet crashed and have found parts of the plane and human remains.Bambang Suryo Aji, the National Search and Rescue Agency’s operations director, told reporters that bad weather and high waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high forced authorities to suspend the search in the afternoon.So far, the searchers have sent 139 body bags containing human remains to police identification experts. Anguished family members have been providing samples for DNA tests to the disaster victim identification unit, which on Tuesday said it had identified four victims.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the team it is sending to join the crash investigation will arrive in a few days.The four NTSB investigators will be joined by personnel from the US Federal Aviation Administration, General Electric and Boeing, who have expertise in operations, human performance, airplane structure and systems, the NTSB wrote on Twitter.The airline’s data showed that both pilots in command of the plane were highly experienced and had relatively good safety records.Capt. Afwan, who goes by one name, began his career as an air force Hercules pilot and had several decades of flying experience. He was known to his relatives and friends as a devout Muslim and preacher. Afwan’s co-pilot, Diego Mamahit, was equally qualified.Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator with Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said the crew did not declare an emergency or report technical problems before the plane nosedived into the sea.Indonesia's aviation industry grew quickly after the nation's economy was opened following the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s. Safety concerns led the United States and the European Union to ban Indonesian carriers for years, but the bans have since been lifted due to better compliance with international aviation standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-searchers-hunt-for-crashed-plane-s-voice-recorder-101610519472695.html
13-01-2021||World||Iran holds missile drill in Gulf of Oman amid tensions||Iran’s navy began a short-range missile drill in the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday, state TV reported, amid heightened regional tensions over Tehran’s nuclear program and a US pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.The two-day missile drill was being held in the gulf's southeastern waters and two new Iranian-made warships joined the exercise: The missile-launching Zereh, or “armor," and the Makran, a logistics vessel with a helicopter pad named for a coastal region in southern Iran.President Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from Iran’s nuclear deal, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Trump cited Iran’s ballistic missile program among other issues in withdrawing from the accord.When the US then ramped up sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits on its nuclear development as a series of escalating incidents pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year.In recent weeks, Iran has increased its military drills. On Saturday, the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard held a naval parade in the Persian Gulf and a week earlier Iran held a massive drone maneuver across half the country.Also last week, Iran seized a South Korean oil tanker and its crew members in the Gulf, and continues to hold the vessel at an Iranian port. The Islamic Republic has apparently sought to increase its leverage over Seoul ahead of negotiations over billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in South Korean banks tied to US sanctions on Iran.On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of having secret ties with the militant al-Qaida network and imposed new sanctions on several senior Iranian officials. Iran has denied the accusation.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday said in a televised speech during a Cabinet meeting that US sanctions will fail. “We are witnessing the failure of a policy, the maximum pressure campaign, economic terrorism,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-holds-missile-drill-in-gulf-of-oman-amid-tensions-101610520950995.html
13-01-2021||World||China sees spike in coronavirus cases ahead of WHO team visit||China's Covid-19 cases crossed the 100-mark for the first time in recent months, ahead of Thursday's visit of the WHO team to Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.The number of coronavirus cases in China climbed to 115 on Tuesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday, adding that 107 of the infections were locally transmitted and the rest arrived from outside.Of the locally transmitted cases, 90 were reported in north China's Hebei Province, which neighbours Beijing; 16 in Heilongjiang Province and one in Shanxi Province, the NHC said.As of Tuesday, China reported a total of 87,706 Covid-19 cases and 4,634 deaths due to the virus.The sudden spike in cases after China contained the virus raised concern as the surge comes ahead of the Spring Festival, the biggest annual holiday in the Chinese lunar calendar.The week-long festival, which also marks the Chinese New Year, will commence on February 12 during which millions of Chinese travel to home and abroad to celebrate the holidays.While Beijing, which has reported few cases, is tightening control because of the surge in infections in neighbouring Hebei province where millions of people are under lockdown due to the fast spread of the virus, provinces across the country are taking measures to contain the disease.Local governments across China are shutting down funerals and weddings to cut down the risk of coronavirus spreading across rural areas, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday.Funerals and weddings in China’s rural areas sometimes involve hundreds and maybe even thousands of guests. They are an important element of traditional Chinese culture and low attendances involve a huge loss of face for the families.The surge of the virus comes ahead of the long-awaited visit of the 10-member World Health Organisation (WHO) team to Wuhan, where Covid-19 first emerged in December 2019.The team will directly fly from Singapore to Wuhan, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. It is not clear whether they would go through 14-day quarantine.The WHO team's visit has become a bone of contention as Beijing, which questions the widely-held view about the virus' origins in Wuhan, had delayed granting permission to it.China has been proactively questioning the view that the deadly outbreak took place in a wet market in Wuhan where live animals, birds and reptiles are sold and spread to humans. The market remained closed and sealed since early last year.Observers say it is to be seen what comes out of the visit as China is asserting that the virus has emerged in several places in the world and it only reported first and wants WHO team to visit other countries as part of the world health body's investigations into the origins of Covid-19.Meanwhile, another team of WHO officials is assessing compliance with international quality manufacturing practices ahead of potential emergency approval for China’s Covid-19 vaccines Sinovac and Sinopharm, state-run China Daily quoted WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying.China has granted emergency approval for Sinopharm. Over nine million people in China have already been administered the vaccine.A number of countries, including Egypt, the UAE, Jordan and Indonesia, have authorised the Covid-19 vaccines produced by China for emergency use. And many more countries, including Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Nigeria, have ordered the vaccines or are cooperating with Beijing in procuring or rolling out the vaccines, the China Daily reported.Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday received the Covid-19 vaccine shot developed by China's biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-ahead-of-who-team-visit-101610520968666.html
13-01-2021||World||Saudi Aramco seeks $7.5 billion loan for pipeline investors||Saudi Aramco is lining up a loan of about $7.5 billion for potential investors in its oil pipelines, according to people familiar with the matter.The world’s biggest oil producer has begun talks with lenders to secure favorable terms for the funding package that would then be offered to investors, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The discussions are occurring in parallel with the sale of a stake in a pipeline unit, which could raise about $10 billion for Aramco, the people said.A pipeline deal would be the first phase of Aramco’s effort to raise money from leasing rights or stakes in non-core assets, mirroring what Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has done in the past few years. The Saudi company is working with advisers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Moelis & Co., the Wall Street investment bank that’s also involved in the Adnoc deals.Aramco declined to comment.Adnoc, which pumps most of the oil and gas in the United Arab Emirates, has generated more than $15 billion from the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The company sold shares in its fuel-retail arm and leasing rights for properties and natural-gas pipelines.Aramco, which for years maintained only minimal corporate debt, is increasingly tapping new sources of funding as it looks to maintain annual dividend payments of $75 billion at a time of lower oil prices. Most of those payouts go to the Saudi state, which needs the money to fund its budget.The company listed in Riyadh in late 2019, but is still 98% owned by the government.The firm’s gearing, a measure of debt to equity, has risen to 21.8%, above its target range of 5% to 15%. Debt also rose because it took on loans to pay for a $69 billion acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., a local chemical maker, last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-aramco-seeks-7-5-billion-loan-for-pipeline-investors-101610512245455.html
13-01-2021||World||North Korea ends party meeting with calls for nuclear might||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed all-out efforts to bolster his country's nuclear deterrent during a major ruling party meeting where he earlier laid out plans to work toward salvaging the broken economy.Separately, Kim’s powerful sister criticized South Korea’s military for saying it had seen an apparent military parade taking place in Pyongyang. Kim Yo Jong, who was described last year as being in charge of inter-Korean relations, said in a statement Wednesday that such close tracking proved Seoul’s “hostile approach” toward its rival.The eight-day Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday came as Kim Jong Un faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.Pandemic-related border closures and floods and typhoons that wiped out summer crops further shocked an economy already devastated by mismanagement and US-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons program.“We must further strengthen the nuclear war deterrent while doing our best to build up the most powerful military strength,” Kim said during his closing remarks at the congress, which were published by state media.North Korean state television later showed Kim, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a black Mao suit, delivering the speech to thousands of party elites, who responded with thunderous cheers and applause.Kim said the country must “continue to give fresh spur” in making the military more elite and powerful so that it could cope with “any form of threat and emergency.”“The hostile forces will try to check our advance more frantically, and the world will watch how the political declaration and fighting program of our (party) are realized,” he said.Kim also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries in a five-year plan. Outside experts say such sectors would be crucial to North Korean hopes to revitalize industrial production that has been decimated by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.South Korean intelligence officials and analysts have said there are signs that the North is taking dramatic steps to strengthen government control over markets, including suppressing the use of US dollars and other foreign currencies.Such measures, which are apparently aimed at forcing people to exchange their foreign currency savings for the North Korean won, demonstrate the government’s sense of urgency over its depleting foreign currency reserves, said Lim Soo-ho, an analyst at a think tank run by Seoul’s spy agency.Foreign currencies have been broadly used in both trade and private market transactions in North Korea since 2009 when a botched currency revaluation under the rule of Kim’s father sparked hyperinflation and public unrest.The KCNA said the North will convene its rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday to adopt the decisions made by the congress into law.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump. Their diplomacy deteriorated after the collapse of their talks in Vietnam in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.During the congress, Kim doubled down on his ambitions to expand the North’s nuclear capabilities and announced plans to develop more sophisticated military assets, including longer-range missiles that could potentially target the American homeland, new tactical nuclear weapons, nuclear-powered submarines, spy satellites and hypersonic weapons.It's unclear whether the North is fully capable of acquiring such systems. While the country is believed to have accumulated at least dozens of nuclear weapons, outside estimates on the exact status of its nuclear and missiles programs vary widely.In comments that were apparently aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration, Kim labeled the United States as the North’s “principal enemy” and said the fate of bilateral relations would depend on whether Washington discards what Pyongyang perceives as hostile policies.Kim during the congress was also named as the ruling party’s general secretary, a title formerly held by his late father and grandfather, in a move apparently aimed at further bolstering his authority.The statement from Kim's sister suggested she is still handling the North's relations with South Korea, but KCNA referred her as a “vice department director” of the ruling party’s Central Committee, indicating she had been demoted from her previous status as first vice department director.Seen as the most powerful woman in North Korea, Kim Yo Jong has come in and out of prominence under her brother’s rule.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff had said Monday that it had obtained intelligence showing a North Korean military parade in Pyongyang on Sunday night and was checking whether it was an official event or a rehearsal.“We are only holding a military parade in the capital city, not military exercises targeting anybody nor launch of anything. Why do they take trouble craning their neck to follow what’s happening in the (North)?,” Kim Yo Jong said.“The (South Koreans) are a truly weird group hard to understand. They are the idiot and top the world’s list in misbehavior as they are only keen on things provoking world laughter.”North Korean state TV has not shown a military parade as of Wednesday morning. During its last military parade in October, the North unveiled a series of new strategic weapons, including what appeared to be its biggest-yet intercontinental ballistic missile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-ends-party-meeting-with-calls-for-nuclear-might-101610516894555.html
13-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s impeachment on cards after Mike Pence refuses to invoke 25th amendment||US Vice-President Mike Pence has refused to invoke the 25th amendment of the constitution to remove President Donald Trump from office immediately, but his last act of loyalty may have come too late for his boss, who is rapidly losing the support of top Republicans, some of whom have announced their support for his impeachment to be voted on Wednesday.Pence announced his decision on the 25th amendment in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the House was just about to take a vote on a resolution calling for him to do just that.“I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our constitution,” Pence wrote. “Under our constitution, the 25th amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedence.”House Democrats went ahead with the vote anyway, and won by 223-205. They will move to consider and pass a resolution on Wednesday to impeach Trump for “incitement of insurrection” for the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.Democrats have enough votes to pass the impeachment resolution on their own. But they will be joined by an increasing number of Republicans, outraged by Trump’s actions before and during the riot.Liz Cheney, who is third in seniority House Republican caucus, John Katko, senior-most Republican House committee, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton have said they will vote to impeach the president. They could be joined by others as the party leadership is not insisting on a unity vote.The most devastating loss for Trump was the support of Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the upper chamber. He had been one Trump’s close allies. But he is now said to be “pleased” with the impeachment plan, seeing an opportunity there to purge him from the party, The New York Times reported. Trump could be convicted by the Senate without McConnell’s support.Democrats have named their impeachment managers to present their case. They also released a report in support of the impeachment. “President Trump committed a high crime and misdemeanor against the nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.” it said. “The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.”Trump struck defiant note in a series of remarks on Tuesday. He defended his January 6 remarks, which triggered the supporters, as “totally appropriated” and sought to characterise the impeachment as a continuation of the “witch hunt” that led to his first impeachment in December 2019. In Texas, he said he will survive the 25th amendment, but warned that the episode “will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration”.Investigations into the Capitol attack are growing “unprecedented” in scope. The FBI and the justice department said more than 160 cases are being investigated with more to follow. Charges being considered range from forcible entry into the premises, to assaulting officials, to sedition and conspiracy.The US military’s joints chiefs of staff issued a statement condemning the January 6 attack, saying, “We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.”The statement added, “On January 20, 2021, in accordance with the constitution, confirmed by the states and the courts, and certified by Congress, President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th commander in chief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-impeachment-on-cards-after-mike-pence-refuses-to-invoke-25th-amendment-101610517081826.html
13-01-2021||World||Meet German chancellor Angela Merkel’s potential successors||Germany’s political future will start to take shape when 1,001 delegates from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union pick a new leader at a virtual congress on Saturday.The winner of a tight three-way race will be in prime position to run as the conservative bloc’s chancellor candidate, but there are two other contenders who might do better with voters. The messy process will set up a tense few months for Germany’s strongest political group.Here’s a look at the top contenders from the CDU and its CSU sister party to succeed Merkel after the Sept. 26 national election:Armin Laschet, the Continuity CandidateA Merkel ally and defender of her migration policy, Laschet has governed Germany’s most-populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia since he ousted the Social Democrats in 2017. That gives him a significant power base as head of the CDU’s biggest regional chapter.The 59-year-old is a moderate committed to European integration and the most likely to protect and foster Merkel’s legacy. However, his political star has faded during the coronavirus pandemic. NRW is one of the hardest-hit states and his initial, more laissez-faire approach was badly received by some voters.In the ruthless Berlin political arena, Laschet is untested. If he wins Saturday’s vote, his supporters are hoping he doesn’t wilt in the same way as a party colleague who struggled with the transition from the state level to the federal stage: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Merkel’s handpicked successor took over as party chief in 2018 but faltered under the pressure and decided to step aside.Friedrich Merz, Merkel’s NemesisAt 65 the oldest of the candidates, Merz is a long-time Merkel rival and has portrayed himself as a challenger to the CDU establishment she dominates. A champion of the party’s conservative, pro-industrial wing, moderates view him as a relic of a back-slapping, old-boy’s club that belongs in the past.After having his political career eclipsed by the chancellor, Merz stormed back onto the scene in 2018 in an attempt to take control of the party, only to be thwarted in a close contest by Kramp-Karrenbauer. A corporate lawyer, he returned temporarily to his job at BlackRock Inc. before mounting his latest bid for Germany’s top political post.Merz -- who chaired the CDU/CSU’s parliamentary group from 2000 to 2002 -- has the backing of the party’s youth wing and is relatively popular among the CDU rank and file. However, the fact that he is not widely embraced by the broader electorate could scupper his chances.Norbert Roettgen, the Rebel ReturnedThe chairman of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee has the dubious distinction of being the only cabinet member whom Merkel fired outright.A former protege of the chancellor, Roettgen’s ambition got the better of him when he secured the leadership of the CDU in NRW in 2010 -- notably by defeating Laschet. But he failed badly against the SPD in a regional vote two years later and refused to give up his post as environment minister at the national level. That act of hubris triggered his ouster.In the years since, the 55-year-old moderate has built a reputation as something of a party rebel. He led a revolt among CDU lawmakers against Merkel’s tolerance of China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and disagreed with her backing for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Germany and Russia.While a long shot, he could be a compromise candidate who looks like a break with Merkel without a hard shift to the right. In the weeks leading up to the contest, he has mounted a savvy media campaign that appears to have boosted his chances of pulling off an upset.Markus Soeder, the Bavarian WildcardBavaria Premier Soeder, head of the CDU’s sister party in the prosperous southern state, is consistently ranked as one of Germany’s most popular politicians.That means he could be the conservative bloc’s most potent weapon for September’s national vote, although he has repeatedly said he intends to stay put. His chances could increase if Laschet or Roettgen win, while Merz would almost certainly want the chancellor candidacy for himself.The fact remains, however, that only two CSU chiefs have contested the chancellorship since World War II and both lost.Once a party rabble-rouser, 54-year-old Soeder has morphed into a dominant leader of his home state, becoming premier in 2018 and CSU chairman a year later.He improved his standing among conservatives at the CDU party conference in 2018, when he brought delegates to their feet with a punchy speech that overshadowed Kramp-Karrenbauer’s weaker performance. He has also been a high-profile presence during the pandemic, consistently pushing for tougher restrictions.Jens Spahn, the Young PretenderHealth Minister Spahn removed himself from the CDU leadership race early on and threw his backing behind Laschet. Since then, what many voters perceive as his competent handling of the coronavirus pandemic has burnished his reputation. He even overtook Merkel in one ranking published in late December.After gauging support among party officials for a possible chancellorship bid, Spahn has said he currently has no plans to run.The openly gay 40-year-old’s ambitions were clear when he put his hat in the ring in 2018 as a candidate for CDU leader with nothing to lose. Although he finished third, he got much of the positive media attention.A standard-bearer of the party’s right wing, Spahn made a name for himself with attacks on Merkel over her handling of the euro crisis and the influx of migrants in 2015. Perceived problems with Germany’s rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine could hinder his progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-s-potential-successors-101610516855848.html
13-01-2021||World||Congressmen, who voted for certification of elections, facing threats: Ro Khanna||US lawmakers who voted for the certification of the November 3 presidential election to confirm the victory of Joe Biden as the next president are facing violent threats, including death threats, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has said.Khanna, in an interview to CNN News on Tuesday, said the threats were being received by Congressmen from both the Democratic and the Republican parties."What people don't realise is that the threat of violence is not just against Democrats or progressives. It's actually against Republicans. I have talked to some of my colleagues -- I don't want to say who -- but they have had death threats,” Khanna told CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin."People who have voted for certification, they are facing the threats of violence. So, this is a terrible situation for many people who are serving, and it crosses party lines," the Democratic leader from California said.A Joint Session of the US Congress on January 6 formally certified the Electoral College victory of Biden as the next US President and Kamala Harris as the Vice President in the November 3 election.The Electoral College votes were approved after both the Senate and the House of Representatives rejected objections raised by the Republicans to the votes in the states of Pennsylvania and Arizona.Biden, a Democrat, received 306 votes while Trump, a Republican, got 232. To win the race for the White House, a candidate should garner at least 270 Electoral College votes out of the 538 up for grabs.Responding to a question on Tuesday, Khanna said the argument of President Donald Trump that the impeachment move is causing tremendous damage to the country does not hold logic."It says if someone commits a crime, robs a bank, and then says, well, the person to blame is the police for arresting them or the prosecution for holding them accountable,” he said.The US House of Representatives is all set to vote on articles of impeachment against President Trump on Wednesday. Trump has been charged with 'incitement of insurrection' for his actions on January 6 when he delivered a speech inciting his supporters to lay siege to the Capitol, an action that temporarily halted the counting of Electoral College votes and resulted in the deaths of five individuals, including an officer of the US Capitol Police.“What we need is accountability for the act, and then we do need to figure out how we start to stitch this country together. And, Brooke, it's not going to be easy, because the reality is, there is still a large base of Donald Trump supporters in these constituencies who believe him,” Khanna added.“We have to be candid about that, that this country is divided. And the question is, how are we going to have a peaceful transition of power and then convince a chunk of that base that it's time to heal this country?” he said.On the eve of the impeachment vote, Khanna said Republicans are in a tough spot right."They're facing enormous pressure. And I think many of them are grappling with their conscience, and then what some of the base and constituency is demanding,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congressmen-who-voted-for-certification-of-elections-facing-threats-ro-khanna-101610516528576.html

"But it is still some way away, and the situation is likely to get worse first."While the industry saw some modest improvement in bookings after the vaccine announcement news in the fourth quarter of 2020, the trend was reversed towards the end of December and into the first few days of 2021."We've actually seen quite a sharp drop-off in bookings, which means that the immediate outlook looks pretty challenging," said Pearce citing the impact of spiking virus cases and imposition of further travel restrictions by governments across the world.Bookings for the first quarter of 2021 are down 75 per cent, 82 per cent and 81 per cent year-on-year respectively for January, February and March.At the same point of the fourth quarter of 2020 -- which Pearce said was already weak -- IATA figures show forward bookings were down 71 per cent, 81 per cent and 80 per cent year-on-year respectively for October, November and December.The tough booking outlook comes as the aviation industry continues to experience a reversal of the traffic recovery trend that peaked in the northern hemisphere summer season last year.In early January, the majority of international travel markets are showing very little change from the April 2020 lows, said Pearce adding that while performance of global financial markets suggests the pandemic is over, IATA disagrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/challenging-outlook-for-airlines-despite-vaccine-progress-iata-101610516444425.html
13-01-2021||World||Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment vote||Republicans offered only modest reproach when President Donald Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a white supremacist rally. They stayed in line when Trump was caught pressuring a foreign leader and later defended his handling of a deadly pandemic.But with a sudden force, the wall of Republican support that has enabled Trump to weather a seemingly endless series of crises is beginning to erode.Trump's weakened standing among his own party will come into sharper focus on Wednesday when the House is expected to impeach the president for inciting a riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A handful of Republicans have already said they'll join the effort, a number that could grow as the vote nears.The choice facing Republicans isn't just about the immediate fate of Trump, who has just seven days left in his presidency. It's about whether the party's elected leaders are ready to move on from Trump, who remains popular with the GOP but is now toxic in much of Washington.How they proceed could determine whether the party remains viable in upcoming elections or splinters in a way that could limit their relevance.“We’re at the moment now where we’re seeing a fracturing, a breaking, because of the unprecedented situation — the sedition, the violence, the death,” said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategy who left the party because of Trump.The stunning nature of the deadly insurrection — and Trump's role in fueling it — has shaken many lawmakers. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, gave rank-and-file conservatives the green light to abandon Trump in a scathing statement Tuesday evening."There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” she charged.While stunning, the fast-moving developments do not ensure Trump will be forced from office before Democrat Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. The timing of a Senate trial is unclear and could spill into Biden's presidency.But for the first time, there are real signs that a significant faction of Republicans want to purge Trump from their party.Already, three Trump Cabinet members have resigned in protest. Former Attorney General Bill Barr, who left the White House less than a month ago, accused his former boss of a “betrayal of his office.”It took almost a week for Vice President Mike Pence, whose relationship with Trump has soured considerably since he and his family were forced into hiding during the Capitol siege, to publicly declare he would not to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office.The president still enjoys some level of Republican support. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a top Trump ally just honored this week at the White House, refused on Tuesday to concede that President-elect Joe Biden won the election outright, the same demonstrable falsehood that sparked the riot.Trump emerged from his White House fortress for the first time since the riots for a trip to the wall his administration built along the Texas border. As he left Washington, he was careful to insist “we want no violence," but denied any responsibility for the insurrection.Once he reached the border, his remarks to a small crowd were fairly muted. In the end, he spoke for just 21 minutes and spent less than 45 minutes on the ground in what was expected to be the final trip of his presidency.Before leaving, he offered an ominous warning to Democrats leading the charge to remove him from office: “Be careful what you wish for.”That veiled threat came as the nation — and members of Congress — braced for the potential of more violence ahead of Biden's inauguration. The FBI warned this week of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington.Capitol security officials made the extraordinary decision to require members of Congress to pass through metal detectors to enter the House chamber beginning on Tuesday, although some Republicans resisted the new rule.It's unclear whether the chaos in Washington represents an existential threat to the party, but it almost certainly threatens to undermine the GOP's short-term political goals.Several major corporations, many of them reliably Republican donors, have promised to stop sending political donations to any of the 147 Republicans who perpetuated Trump's false claims of election fraud by voting to reject Biden's victory last week.The fundraising challenge comes at a bad time for the GOP. History suggests that the Republican Party, as the minority party in Washington, should regain control of the House or Senate in 2022.At the same time, a collection of ambitious Republicans are trying to position themselves to run for the White House in 2024. They are also contending with Trump's legacy.One of them, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, reminded reporters on Tuesday that he's condemned the Trump presidency from the very beginning.“I’ve been in the same place I’ve been for the whole four years. A lot of people have just changed their position,” Hogan said, while vowing not to leave the GOP. “I don’t want to leave the party and let these people who did a hostile takeover four years ago take over.”Despite Hogan's confidence, a significant portion of the Republican Party’s political base remains deeply loyal to the president, and has already shown a willingness to attack anyone — especially Republicans — who is not. That helps explain why two other 2024 prospects, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, voted to reject Biden's victory last week, even after the uprising.“Republican leaders do not know how to move forward,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz said. “Everybody’s afraid that Donald Trump will tell people to come after them, but they also realize they’re losing the center of America. They’re trapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-republican-wall-eroding-ahead-of-impeachment-vote-101610515371106.html
13-01-2021||World||EU to initiate launcher alliance to enhance space autonomy||The European Space Program needs a European launcher alliance to ensure independent access to space, European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said Tuesday.The launcher alliance will be initiated in the next few months, said Breton, who delivered a keynote speech at the European Space Conference in Brussels, Belgium.The European Union (EU) needs to develop a "more offensive, aggressive, coherent global strategy" about the launchers, according to the commissioner.French launcher Ariane and Italian launcher Vega, although competitive on the global space market, might not be able to rival non-EU competitors in the future."The standards for launchers are currently being redefined outside of Europe. We all know that. We must ask ourselves, will our current approach successfully get us to 2050?" Breton said.Calling for a reflection over the disruptions in the implementation of the space programs, the commissioner preferred fast reaction and intensified discussions about how to keep the EU's position as a key player on the global space stage.Breton said he will gather relative actors in the next months to initiate a European launcher alliance to jointly define with the European Space Agency, the member states, the European parliament and the industry "a common road map for the next generation of launchers and technologies relevant to ensure an autonomous access to space."Space autonomy is "not about closing the door to our partners. It is just about developing and maintaining our infrastructures, technologies, skills, competencies, and reducing critical dependencies on third countries, so we can rely on our own if necessary," he added.Addressing the conference on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel stressed that space action is "at the heart of" European strategic autonomy."Less dependence, more influence," he added.The EU plans to spend Euros 14.9 billion (USD 18.2 billion) in the space program in 2021-2027, which will help step up support for a space industrial base from data to the Internet of Things, broadband, Earth observation and launch systems, Michel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-initiate-launcher-alliance-to-enhance-space-autonomy-101610515606543.html
13-01-2021||World||US Supreme Court clears way for first federal execution of a female inmate||The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Justice Department to carry out the first execution of a female death-row inmate in almost seven decades.The rulings, handed down just after midnight on Wednesday, allow the federal Bureau of Prisons to proceed with the execution of Lisa Montgomery.The court lifted an injunction that had been put in place by the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals that had temporarily halted Montgomery’s execution. It came hours after the Supreme Court also lifted a separate injunction by the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.Montgomery is scheduled to be put to death at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana.Her lawyers have argued she is not mentally competent and should not be executed. They say she suffered from years of physical and emotional abuse and is severely mentally ill.Lisa Montgomery faced execution Tuesday for killing 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then cut the baby girl from the womb with a kitchen knife. Montgomery took the child with her and attempted to pass the girl off as her own.But an appeals court granted a stay of execution Tuesday, shortly after another appeals court lifted an Indiana judge's ruling that found she was likely mentally ill and couldn't comprehend she would be put to death. If a higher court puts the execution back on, Montgomery, the only female on federal death row, would receive a lethal injection at a federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. By Tuesday night, the Supreme Court lifted a separate injunction that was put in place by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.Separately, a federal judge for the U.S. District of Columbia halted the scheduled executions later this week of Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs in a ruling Tuesday. Johnson, convicted of killing seven people related to his drug trafficking in Virginia, and Higgs, convicted of ordering the murders of three women in Maryland, both tested positive for COVID-19 last month.Delays of any of this week's scheduled executions beyond Biden’s inauguration next Tuesday would likely mean they will not happen any time soon, or ever, since a Biden administration is expected to oppose carrying out federal death sentences.One of Montgomery’s lawyers, Kelley Henry, told The Associated Press Tuesday morning that her client arrived at the Terre Haute facility late Monday night from a Texas prison and that, because there are no facilities for female inmates, she was being kept in a cell in the execution-chamber building itself.“I don’t believe she has any rational comprehension of what’s going on at all,” Henry said.Montgomery has done needle-point in prison, making gloves, hats and other knitted items as gifts for her lawyers and others, Henry said. She hasn’t been able to continue that hobby or read since her glasses were taken away from her out of concern she could kill herself.“All of her coping mechanisms were taken away from her when they locked her down” in October when she was informed she had an execution date, Henry said.Montgomery’s legal team says she suffered “sexual torture,” including gang rapes, as a child, permanently scarring her emotionally and exacerbating mental-health issues that ran in her family.At trial, prosecutors accused Montgomery of faking mental illness, noting that her killing of Stinnett was premeditated and included meticulous planning, including online research on how to perform a C-section.Henry balked at that idea, citing extensive testing and brain scans that supported the diagnosis of mental illness.“You can’t fake brain scans that show the brain damage,” she said.Henry said the issue at the core of the legal arguments are not whether she knew the killing was wrong in 2004 but whether she fully grasps why she is slated to be executed now.In his ruling on a stay, U.S. District Judge James Patrick Hanlon in Terre Haute cited defense experts who alleged Montgomery suffered from depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.Montgomery, the judge wrote, also suffered around the time of the killing from an extremely rare condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman’s false belief she is pregnant triggers hormonal and physical changes as if she was actually pregnant.Montgomery also experiences delusions and hallucinations, believing God spoke with her through connect-the-dot puzzles, the judge said, citing defense experts.“The record before the Court contains ample evidence that Ms. Montgomery’s current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government’s rationale for her execution,” the judge said.The government has acknowledged Montgomery’s mental issues but disputes that she can’t comprehend that she is scheduled for execution for killing another person because of them.Details of the crime at times left jurors in tears during her trial.Prosecutors told the jury Montgomery drove about 170 miles (274 kilometers) from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Stinnett. She strangled Stinnett performing a crude cesarean and fleeing with the baby.Prosecutors said Stinnett regained consciousness and tried to defend herself as Montgomery used a kitchen knife to cut the baby girl from her womb. Later that day, Montgomery called her husband to pick her up in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant in Topeka, Kansas, telling him she had delivered the baby earlier in the day at a nearby birthing center.Montgomery was arrested the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who is now 16 years old and hasn’t spoken publicly about the tragedy.Prosecutors said the motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children. Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.Anti-death penalty groups said Trump was pushing for executions prior to the November election in a cynical bid to burnish a reputation as a law-and-order leader.The last woman executed by the federal government was Bonnie Brown Heady on Dec. 18, 1953, for the kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old boy in Missouri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-clears-way-for-first-federal-execution-of-a-female-inmate-101610514776507.html
13-01-2021||World||‘No Regrets’: US Capitol rioter Brandon Fellows tells his story from inside||Brandon Fellows has never attended a Trump rally before last week. He said he was motivated to drive to Washington after seeing a tweet from the president. “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” President Donald Trump wrote on Dec. 19. “Be there, will be wild!”Fellows didn’t know about a planned march that would eventually overtake the U.S. Capitol. He said he had simply come to see Trump give a speech.But within hours of watching Trump’s speech, Fellows had his feet propped up on a table in the office of a U.S. Senator, smoking a joint. He roamed the halls of the Capitol, heckled police officers and posted videos along the way on Snapchat.“I have no regrets,” said Fellows, a 26-year-old former grocery store worker from upstate New York who now makes money cutting trees and repairing chimneys. “I didn’t hurt anyone, I didn’t break anything. I did trespass though, I guess.”Indeed, in the days since the upheaval, Fellows said his profile on the dating app Bumble is “blowing up” after he posted pictures of himself at the Capitol.Fellows was among hundreds of Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, forcing Vice President Michael Pence, members of Congress and their staffs into hiding. Five people died in the melee, including a rioter who was shot by police and a Capitol Police officer from unspecified injuries suffered during an altercation with the intruders.Fellows’s story provides a detailed account of how one Trump supporter ended up participating in the Capitol riot, an event that has spawned mass condemnation and prompted House Democrats to pursue impeachment for a second time in less than two years.His story also offers a real-world example of a Trump supporter who absorbed false information on social media and heeded the president’s call to take action. It’s an illustration of why so many technology companies have taken steps since the Capitol riot to crack down on conspiracies that have proliferated on its platforms, including Twitter’s ban on Trump’s account.Fellows, who lives in a converted school bus, said he stopped working last spring because of fears of Covid-19. But he said he became disillusioned when New York state denied him unemployment benefits. “For awhile, in early March and April, I was super poor,” he said.Fellows said he gets much of his news from conservative commentators on YouTube, including Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder. He said he has also started watching Newsmax and One America News, which have both promoted false claims of a rigged election.He said his political views have created friction with his family, so much so that on Christmas Day only his grandparents invited him to dinner. They asked him to eat on his bus because he didn’t take Covid-19 seriously enough, he said.At the Capitol, he said, even though many of the rioters were people he wouldn’t normally get along with, it “felt like family.”“We were there for one common cause, which is making a statement that the government is crushing down on us,” he said.His stepfather of 14 years, Timothy Monroe, said he wasn’t surprised when he learned that Fellows was inside the Capitol. “He knows what he believes,” Monroe said. “You can’t really change it with any kind of reality.”Fellows said he came to D.C. in part because he believes that the election was rigged. But his primary motivation was his anger at government measures to prevent Covid-19, such as lockdowns of restaurants and gyms.On Jan. 6, Fellows said he arrived outside of the Ellipse, a park adjacent to the White House, just after 1 a.m. He was one of the first people in line to get into Trump’s rally and sat just five rows away from where the president spoke, video shows. Fellows came prepared for the cold weather, wearing snow pants, a leather jacket with an American flag emblazoned on the back and a knit hat that resembles a knight’s helmet and beard.“This is the last stand,” Fellows said, in an interview with a Bloomberg News reporter prior to Trump’s speech. “I feel like I’ve seen a lot of the election fraud evidence, and I don’t understand why nothing is being done.” Trump’s claims of election fraud in the Nov. 3 election have been rejected by state and federal courts, as well as some members of his own party.Following the conclusion of Trump’s speech, Fellows joined in on the march on Pennsylvania Avenue, headed toward the Capitol. “I was like ‘Oh cool, there’s gonna be a march,’” he said. “I’ve never been in a march.”By the time he arrived, he said the barriers protecting the perimeter had already been overrun. As he was scaling a wall to reach the Senate side of the Capitol, he said he was thinking, “I’m not missing this, this is history.” Fellows helped others climb over the wall, videos show.Fellows said he watched a fellow Trump supporter bashing in a door at the Capitol with a cane and eventually break through the door. A crowd of rioters pushed through only to be pushed back outside by police officers. Once the building was overrun, he said he initially hesitated before going in but did so after hearing that people inside weren’t being arrested. He got in through a broken window.In the 30 minutes or so he was in the Capitol, he filmed dozens of videos and posted them on Snapchat.In one of them, which was reviewed by Bloomberg News, he heckled Capitol Police officers who weren’t wearing helmets.“Where’s your helmet, bro?” Fellows asked an officer. “I wasn’t issued one, because they ran out,” the officer replied.“They don’t care about you? Are you guys rookies, is that why?” Fellows shot back. “I’ve been here eight years,” the officer said. “Pretty cool what happened here today,” Fellows replied.Another video shows his muddy boots propped on a table in Senator Jeff Merkley’s office, where Fellows said he took two puffs from a joint someone handed to him. “This one is going to get me incriminated,” Fellows said of the video in Merkley’s office.In a video posted to Twitter, Merkley surveyed the damage in his office in which a door was smashed “off its hinges” and artwork was torn from the wall. “It was unlocked, they could have simply opened the door,” Merkley said. “So count this office trashed.”After leaving Merkley’s office, Fellows said he wandered the Capitol and asked a police officer for directions to the National Statuary Hall. The police officer explained that the statues represent each state and provided directions on how to get there, according to Fellows’s video of the encounter. “Dude, you’re super cool,” Fellows said.Fellows’s interactions with police officers inside the Capitol led him to believe there wouldn’t be consequences for going inside. “Did I think I was going to get in trouble?” Fellows said. “Uh, no.”After leaving the Capitol, Fellows posed for pictures next to a line of police officers in riot gear and on an abandoned police motorcycle.He said he is planning to return to Washington for more protests surrounding President-Elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, and he predicted there would be more violence. The FBI issued a warning that there are plans for armed protests in D.C. and at all 50 state capitals in the days leading up to the inauguration.“Obviously Trump started a movement in a way, but I think we started something even bigger by doing this,” Fellows said. But now the law enforcement is rounding up others who participated in the Capitol intrusion, he believes he too may be arrested.“Do you think I’m going to go to federal prison?” Fellows asked. “I was told federal prison is not fun.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-regrets-us-capitol-rioter-brandon-fellows-tells-his-story-from-inside-101610514887266.html
13-01-2021||World||Demoted? Pushed aside? Fate of Kim Jong Un's sister unclear||Where is Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s influential sister?That is a question many who watch the cloistered, nuclear-armed country are wondering after she failed to appear in absolute leader Kim Jong Un’s newly released lineup for the country’s powerful Politburo in recent days.Some say Kim Jong Un may have demoted his sister over general policy failures. Others, however, believe he could be worried about her rapid rise and increasingly high profile as he tries to bolster his domestic authority in the face of growing economic challenges.Rumors that Kim Yo Jong is her brother’s heir apparent could be dangerous because they "raise the issue of Kim’s hold on power and health inside North Korea," said Oh Gyeong-seob, an analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. This, he said, is why Kim Jong Un is slowing down her rise in power.The development is a surprise because Kim Yo Jong, who became an alternate member of the Politburo last year, was widely expected to receive a full bureau membership during a ruling Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday. A Politburo membership is viewed as crucial for high-level officials hoping to thrive in Kim Jong Un's government because he's made key decisions at bureau meetings, including the 2013 move to execute his powerful uncle Jang Song Taek, and the 2012 purge of military chief Ri Yong Ho.When the eight-day congress, the first of its kind since 2016, opened last week, Kim Yo Jong, who is thought to be about 32, sat on the leadership podium, standing out amid the often elderly, overwhelmingly male party cadres. But when the congress on Monday announced a list of 30 alternate and full members of the Politburo, including the 37-year-old Kim Jong Un, her name wasn’t there.Kim Yo Jong hasn't been purged or forced to quit politics, a fate that some officials have met under Kim Jong Un, and she still retains her membership in the party’s Central Committee, also a high-level body. But when she released a statement criticizing South Korea on Wednesday, state media identified her as a “vice department director” of the party, a lower rank than her previous title of “first vice department director.”Kim Jong Un is urging his 25 million people to rally behind his leadership to overcome what he has called his nation's “worst-ever” difficulties. North Korea has faced coronavirus-related economic shocks, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent U.S.-led sanctions over its pursuit of illicit nuclear weapons. During the congress, Kim vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal and build a stronger, self-reliant economy.“The congress’ purpose is to solidify Kim Jong Un’s leadership. If Kim Yo Jong had become a full Politburo member, all eyes would have been on her ... and Kim Jong Un likely felt that as a burden,” Ko Young-hwan, a former deputy head of the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said during a TV news program Monday.Previously little known to outsiders, Kim Yo Jong has soared politically since her brother inherited power after their father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.The current Kims are the third generation of their family to rule North Korea, and their leadership is based on a personality cult established after their grandfather Kim Il Sung founded the country in 1948. Their mythical “paektu” bloodline, named after the North’s most sacred mountain, allows only direct family members to rule the country.Kim Yo Jong rose to international prominence after her brother's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump and other world leaders in 2018 and 2019. In those meetings, her proximity to Kim Jong Un sparked speculation that she was serving as her brother’s chief of staff.In South Korea, she built an image as “a peace messenger” after she attended the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, becoming the first member of the North’s ruling family to visit the South.Last year, however, she abruptly changed course by launching harsh diatribes against South Korea and putting pressure on the United States to make concessions amid deadlocked nuclear diplomacy. North Korea’s state media said she was in charge of relations with South Korea, and outside experts speculated that she might be handing U.S. affairs as well.In her statement on Wednesday, she slammed South Korea for provoking the North by announcing that it had detected intelligence that North Korea held a military parade or a rehearsal for such a parade this week.When unconfirmed global rumors about Kim Jong Un’s health rose last year, some observers said Kim Yo Jong was next in line to rule North Korea if her brother became incapacitated. South Korea’s spy agency said later that she was virtually the North’s No. 2 official but hadn’t been anointed as her brother’s heir.“Kim Jong Un likely held his sister responsible for worsened (external) ties, as she had no achievements in relations with the US and South Korea,” said Kim Yeol Soo, an analyst with South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.Whatever the reason for her apparent loss of the Politburo job, many experts say her political clout likely remains unchanged thanks to her direct link to the paektu bloodline. There's also a feeling that Kim Jong Un could eventually give her another high-profile job.Oh, the analyst, said Kim Yo Jong is likely the second-most powerful woman in North Korean history after Kim Song Ae, the late second wife of Kim Il Sung.“Kim Yo Jong can meet and talk to Kim Jong Un freely anytime ... so we can’t help saying that she has a tremendous influence,” Oh said. “As she gets older, her roles will be bigger."But, he added, her rise could end if she covets more power. “She has to be careful about that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/demoted-pushed-aside-fate-of-kim-jong-un-s-sister-unclear-101610514167470.html
13-01-2021||World||US to require negative Covid-19 tests for arriving international air passengers||Nearly all air travelers will need to present a negative coronavirus test to enter the United States under expanded test testing requirements announced on Tuesday.Under the rules taking effect Jan. 26, nearly all travelers including US citizens must show a negative test within three days of departure or documentation of recovery from Covid-19, under an order signed by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield.Also Read: These 10 countries are recording highest daily Covid-19 casesAll travelers aged 2 and older must comply except passengers who are only transiting through the United States. The CDC will also consider waivers of testing requirements for airlines flying to countries with little or no testing capacity, including some places in the Caribbean.The order dramatically broadens a requirement imposed on Dec. 28 for travelers arriving from the UK as a more transmissible variant of the virus circulated there.In an interview, Marty Cetron, director of CDC's global migration and quarantine division, said, "We to have really up the ante... We have to take these mutations seriously."Canada imposed similar rules for nearly all international arrivals starting Jan. 7, as have many other countries.Click here for Covid-19 live updatesThe CDC confirmed last week it had circulated a proposal to expand the testing requirement after discussing the idea for weeks. Some senior White House officials opposed it, and officials briefed on the matter said last week that US public health officials had essentially given up winning approval until President-elect Joe Biden took office.At a White House meeting on Monday, Redfield again made an urgent case to adopt the testing requirements, people briefed on the meeting said. He raised concerns that vaccines could potentially not be effective against virus variants.Airlines for America, an industry trade group, praised the testing plan. Airlines had also wanted a ban to be dropped on most non-US visitors who have recently been in Brazil and most of Europe, but the White House opted not to end it.Cetron said the entry restrictions should "be actively reconsidered."Cetron confirmed the CDC has discussed the idea of expanding the testing requirement to domestic US flights but emphasized the new order only applies to international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-require-negative-covid-19-tests-for-arriving-international-air-passengers-101610511639188.html

But more importantly, the vaccine is the instrument to protect our family, our neighbor, Indonesian people and the human civilization,” Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Wednesday.“This vaccine is given to achieve herd immunity. All 70% of the world’s people must be vaccinated for that to be achieved. The participation of all Indonesians will greatly determine the success of this program,” he said.Conditional use of the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. vaccine is scheduled to be rolled out in the coming months with health care workers, civil servants and other at-risk populations prioritized first. It will be free for all Indonesian citizens.For Indonesia to vaccinate two-thirds of its population, 181.5 million people, to reach herd immunity, Sadikin said the two-shot vaccine would require almost 427 million doses, including the estimate that 15% may be wasted.Distribution will not be easy in the vast archipelago where transportation and infrastructure are inadequate in places. Health officials have cited concerns about keeping the vaccine refrigerated at the required 36–46 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain its safety and effectiveness.“We know that the cold-chain distribution is not complete. This is the obstacle,” Sadikin said Tuesday. “The cold-chain facilities are not enough so we are still distributing some of the vaccines. We are worried.”Indonesia received its first shipment of the Sinovac vaccines on Dec. 6 and locked it in cold storage surrounded by armed guards. Authorities began distributing the vaccines to key locations around the country while awaiting emergency use authorization.The vaccine was cleared for emergency use based on clinical trial data and after the Indonesian Ulema Council declared the vaccine holy and halal.Indonesia’s vaccination program is the first large-scale use of the Sinovac vaccine outside of China.Indonesia has recorded more than 846,000 cases of the virus, including over 24,600 deaths.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

13-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un vows to strengthen North Korea's nuclear arsenal||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed all-out efforts to bolster his country's nuclear deterrent during a major ruling party meeting where he earlier laid out plans to work toward salvaging the broken economy.Separately, Kim’s powerful sister criticized South Korea’s military for saying it had seen an apparent military parade taking place in Pyongyang. Kim Yo Jong, who was described last year as being in charge of inter-Korean relations, said in a statement Wednesday that such close tracking proved Seoul’s “hostile approach” toward its rival.The eight-day Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday came as Kim Jong Un faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.Pandemic-related border closures and floods and typhoons that wiped out summer crops further shocked an economy already devastated by mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons program.“While further strengthening our nuclear war deterrent, we need to invest every effort to build the strongest military capabilities,” Kim said during his closing remarks at the congress, which were published by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency.Kim also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries in a five-year plan. Outside experts say such sectors would be crucial to North Korean hopes to revitalize industrial production that has been decimated by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump. Their diplomacy deteriorated after the collapse of their talks in Vietnam in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.During the congress, Kim doubled down on his ambitions to expand the North’s military capabilities and announced plans to develop more sophisticated nuclear assets, including longer-range missiles that could potentially target the American homeland, spy satellites, new tactical nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines.In comments that were apparently aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration, Kim labeled the United States as the North’s “principal enemy” and said the fate of bilateral relations would depend on whether Washington discards what Pyongyang perceives as hostile policies.The statement from Kim's sister indicated she is still handling the North's relations with South Korea, but KCNA referred her as a “vice department director” of the ruling party’s Central Committee, indicating she had been demoted from her previous status as first vice department director.Seen as the most powerful woman in North Korea, Kim Yo Jong has come in and out of prominence under her brother’s rule.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff had said Monday that it had obtained intelligence showing a North Korean military parade in Pyongyang on Sunday night and was checking whether it was an official event or a rehearsal.“We are only holding a military parade in the capital city, not military exercises targeting anybody nor launch of anything. Why do they take trouble craning their neck to follow what’s happening in the (North)?,” Kim Yo Jong said.“The (South Koreans) are a truly weird group hard to understand. They are the idiot and top the world’s list in misbehavior as they are only keen on things provoking world laughter.”North Korean state TV has not shown a military parade as of Wednesday morning. During its last military parade in October, the North unveiled a series of new strategic weapons, including what appeared to be its biggest-yet intercontinental ballistic missile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-vows-to-strengthen-north-korea-s-nuclear-arsenal-101610500807603.html

We're a rule of law country."The remarks came during an interview that was arranged with Cook at Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley to discuss an announcement being made by the company on Wednesday.Cook did not specifically mention Trump, but said that anyone with a role in the insurrection should be held accountable under the law."I don't think we should let it go," Cook said."This is something we've got to be serious about. I think holding people accountable is important."Tech giants Amazon, Apple and Google have all cut ties with Parler, the social media platform popular with some conservatives.The three mega-corporations have accused the platform of continuing to post messages inciting violence even after the Jan 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters of Trump.Twitter has suspended the president's main account for the same reason.Trump's accounts have also been suspended by other big social media outlets including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch in the wake of the violence in the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-chief-wants-us-capitol-attackers-held-accountable-101610500624252.html
13-01-2021||World||US Vice President Pence rejects invoking 25th Amendment to oust Trump||Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday he won’t invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office, writing in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that it’s time for the nation to heal after last week’s attack on the Capitol.Pence’s letter comes in response to a resolution House Democrats will put to a vote Tuesday night urging him to use his constitutional authority to end Trump’s term early. Pence said he’s asking members of Congress to “avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment.”Also Read: House set to give Mike Pence ultimatum before moving to impeach Donald TrumpPence said that the 25th Amendment was designed to address presidential “incapacity or disability” and accused the House of Representatives of playing “political games.” Democrats still plan to vote on non-binding the 25th Amendment resolution, even though Pence said he won’t meet its demand.Democrats have also set up a vote as soon as Wednesday to impeach the president for the second time.“We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent threat,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues this weekend. “The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.”Democrats had hoped that Pence - who drew Trump’s ire for rebuffing his calls to reject election results, saying such a move was unconstitutional - would call on the cabinet to immediately remove Trump from power. The president has been widely rebuked for his role stirring last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol, which left five people dead and dozens more injured.Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said earlier Tuesday she would join with Democrats and vote to impeach the president.“On Jan. 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes,” the Wyoming lawmaker said in a statement. “The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”Also Read: Democrats give Mike Pence 24 hours to oust Donald Trump as US PresidentIf Trump is impeached by the House, two-thirds of the Senate would be needed to convict him. Trump escaped removal from office last year when only one Republican senator - Mitt Romney of Utah - voted with Democrats.Even though the Senate probably won’t be able to conclude the trial before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20, Democrats plan to push forward with Trump’s second impeachment because the process could include a vote to prohibit him from again seeking federal office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-mike-pence-rejects-invoking-25th-amendment-to-oust-t-101610500533705.html

13-01-2021||World||Mike Pompeo slams Iran for Al-Qaida support on his way out||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of having secret ties with the Al-Qaida network and imposed new sanctions on several senior Iranian officials.Pompeo’s comments come just a week before the Trump administration leaves office and appeared aimed at President-elect Joe Biden’s stated desire to resume negotiations with Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.In a speech to the National Press Club just, Pompeo attacked Iran for alleged secret ties with Al-Qaida, citing newly declassified intelligence suggesting Tehran harbored the group’s No. 2, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in August, reportedly by Israeli agents.Shiite-ruled Iran and predominantly Sunni Al-Qaida are not natural allies in the Islamic world and have had a fraught relationship since the Taliban, which harbored bin Laden, took over Afghanistan in 1996. Two years later, Iran accused the Taliban of murdering several of it diplomats in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.Although U.S. officials had previously confirmed the death of al-Masri and his daughter, the widow of Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza, Pompeo’s remarks were the first on-the-record comments supporting the claim.“Today, I can confirm publicly to the world for the first time, his death on Aug. 7 of last year,” Pompeo said. He also alleged that Iran had “closely monitored” Al-Qaida members before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and had stepped up such activity and had decided to actively support them following the nuclear agreement.Speaking after Pompeo's remarks, two senior US officials told reporters that Iran had facilitated al-Masri's stay in Tehran, including by sending security guards with him on shopping excursions and granting him access to a swimming pool. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence information, spoke on condition of anonymity.Pompeo claimed that ties between Al-Qaida and Iran vastly improved in 2015, when the Obama administration, along with France, Germany and Britain, were finalizing the nuclear deal. He offered no evidence for the claim. Pompeo has been adamantly opposed to the nuclear agreement since he was a member of Congress.“A sea change was happening within the Iran-al-Qaida axis,” Pompeo said. “Iran decided to allow Al-Qaida to establish a new operational headquarters, on the condition that Al-Qaida operatives inside abide by the regime’s rules governing Al-Qaida’s stay inside the country.”He said that since 2015, Iran has given Al-Qaida leaders greater freedom of movement inside Iran and have provided safe havens and logistical support to Al-Qaida. Pompeo asserted that Al-Qaida had now based its leadership in Tehran and was continuing to plot attacks on the US and Western targets from there.Iran has denied all such charges, and did so again on Tuesday.Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh Tuesday condemned Pompeo’s accusations as a "repeat of blaming and fabricating false evidence” against Iran since President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal and began to re-impose sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.Khatibzadeh derided Pompeo's accusations as an indication of the “failure of the maximum pressure campaign” by the Trump administration against Iran, the official IRNA news agency reported. He said Iran has had “a crystal-clear and defendable record” in fighting Al-Qaida and IS terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-slams-iran-for-al-qaida-support-on-his-way-out-101610478857716.html
13-01-2021||World||Brazil researchers report disappointing 50.4% efficacy for China's CoronaVac||A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac showed "general efficacy" of 50.4% in a late-stage trial in Brazil, researchers said on Tuesday, barely enough for regulatory approval and far short of earlier indications.The latest results are a major disappointment for Brazil, as the Chinese vaccine is one of two that the federal government has lined up to begin immunization during the second wave of the world's second-deadliest Covid-19 outbreak.The letdown after a more promising partial data disclosure last week may also contribute to criticism that vaccines developed by Chinese manufacturers are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.Last week, the Brazilian researchers had celebrated results showing 78% efficacy against Covid-19 cases, a rate they have since described as "clinical efficacy."Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo, said the new figure included infections classified as "very mild" because they did not require clinical assistance.Researchers at Butantan delayed announcement of their results three times, blaming a confidentiality clause in a contract with Sinovac.In the meantime, Turkish researchers said last month that CoronaVac was 91.25% effective based on an interim analysis. Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency use approval on Monday based on interim data showing it is 65% effective.Butantan officials said the design of the Brazilian study, focusing on frontline health workers during a severe outbreak in Brazil and including elderly volunteers, made it impossible to compare the results directly with other trials or vaccines.Still, Covid-19 vaccines in use from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc proved to be about 95% effective in preventing illness in their pivotal late-state trials.The disappointing CoronaVac data is the latest setback for vaccination efforts in Brazil, where more than 200,000 people have died since the outbreak began - the worst death toll outside the United States.Brazil's national immunization program currently relies on CoronaVac and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc - neither of which has received regulatory approval in Brazil.Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, which has stipulated an efficacy rate of at least 50% for vaccines in the pandemic, has already pressed Butantan for more details of its study, after it filed for emergency use authorization on Friday.AstraZeneca failed to deliver active ingredients to Brazil over the weekend, leaving the government scrambling to import finished doses of the vaccine from India to begin inoculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-researchers-report-disappointing-50-4-efficacy-for-china-s-coronavac-101610475117401.html
