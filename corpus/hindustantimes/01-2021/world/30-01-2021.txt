"Nobody knows if we'll need a booster... With production capacities now being extended, we'll order vaccines as a precaution. If we don't need them, good, but if we do then they'll be available."Some of Germany's powerful regional premiers joined the chorus of criticism of the federal government on Saturday, ahead of Monday's meeting of a new vaccination task force that will bring national and regional players around the same table with pharma companies and European Union representatives.Bavarian premier Markus Soeder proposed new rules allowing the state to have more say in directing vaccine supplies to those who need them most."We need an emergency vaccine economy in which the state sets clear rules," he told Die Welt newspaper, calling for authorities to consider authorising Chinese and Russian vaccines for use in Europe.Authorities reported 13,321 new infections in Germany on Saturday and 794 deaths, though the number of cases per 100,000 people over seven days fell by three to 91. The government says the number must be below 50 to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-health-minister-says-country-already-ordering-covid-19-vaccines-for-2022-101612030126591.html
30-01-2021||World||US Covid-19 cases trend downward, deaths roughly steady: Virus update||Coronavirus infections in the US continued a downward trend, with 162,390 new cases added on Friday.The European dispute over the supply of vaccines is threatening to unleash a wider political and economic conflict that could stymie global collaboration needed to end the pandemic. Virus mutations that likely offer some resistance to vaccine and antibody treatments are now prevalent in South Africa and Brazil.The World Bank committed $12 billion to African countries to support vaccination programs, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said. Novartis AG will be able to deliver “substantial amounts” of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s vaccine, its chief executive officer told Schweiz am Wochenende.Key Developments:Read | World Bank commits $12 billion for vaccinations in AfricaItaly cases slowItaly registered a decline in new virus cases on Saturday to 12,715 from 13,574 the previous day as the country prepares to ease virus restrictions from Monday for some regions, including the Rome and Milan areas. Daily deaths were also lower, at 421 compared with 477 a day earlier.The country’s Aifa medicines agency has approved the AstraZeneca vaccine, though it is recommending its use on people 18-55 years old, according to the Ansa newswire.UK cases moderateThe UK reported 23,275 new cases on Saturday, more than 3,500 fewer than the average of the previous seven days and 30% lower than a week ago. Another 1,200 people died within 28 days of a positive test, in line with the weekly average. More than 8.37 million people have received their first vaccination.Pakistan to begin receiving vaccinePakistan will receive as much as 17 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the Covax arrangement by the end of second quarter this year, the nation’s planning minister Asad Umar said. The South Asian nation got a letter from Covax indicating that the initial delivery of about 6 million doses would start this month, he said in a Twitter message. The nation, with a population of 220 million, plans to start vaccinating its frontline health workers first.NY cases steadyNew York state added 12,804 cases, in line with the recent trend of new infections well below the record of almost 20,000 on Jan. 14. Hospitalizations fell to 8,176, and the positive test rate rose slightly to 4.75%, though that number has been falling steadily in the last few weeks. Another 140 people died, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a tweet.Sweden to rule on testing for travelers Sweden’s government has promised to make a swift decision regarding a request by the Public Health Agency that anyone wishing to enter the country produce a negative Covid-19 result.“We are now sending the Agency’s request for a lightning-fast referral to the Police Authority, the Coast Guard and the Swedish Migration Board,” said Mikael Damberg, Sweden’s Minister of Home Affairs, at a press conference on Saturday.According to the proposal, non-Swedish citizens who want to enter the country would have to show a negative test that is no more than 48 hours, while Swedish citizens would be tested on the day of arrival.Portugal keeps adding ICU patientsPortugal, which is facing one of the world’s worst outbreaks, on Thursday reported 12,435 new confirmed coronavirus cases in a day, below the record 16,432 new cases announced on Thursday and taking the total to 711,018. The government reported 293 fatalities, less than a record 303 on Thursday, taking the total to 12,179 deaths. The number of patients in intensive-care units rose by 37 to 843. The country’s national health service has a capacity of about 1,200 intensive-care beds.German minister expresses optimismOne year after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Germany’s health minister is cautiously optimism about the future course of the crisis. “There will not be a second anniversary in this form,” Jens Spahn told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung in an interview. “Over the course of the year, we will get the pandemic largely under control - through the vaccinations and through the possibility of adapting the vaccine to mutations.”US cases continue to slowThe US added 162,390 cases on Friday, as new infections continue a downward trend, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. This week’s average number of cases is 15% less than the previous one.Deaths were roughly steady, with 3,582 new fatalities registered. That brings this week’s average slightly above last week’s. The US has recorded 25,924,374 total cases and 436,634 deaths to date.Vietnam confirms more local casesVietnam’s health ministry confirmed 27 more local virus cases and one imported case, bringing the tally of domestic patients since the new outbreak reported Jan. 28 to 208.The imported case was in Ho Chi Minh City. The new infections indicate the outbreak has spread beyond the northern region to the central part and south.Vietnam has registered 901 local infections since the start of the pandemic, according to the ministry’s newspaper Suc Khoe Doi Song.Deaths in Iran riseThe number of Covid-19 deaths in Iran rose by 82 in the last 24 hours, up from 71 yesterday. The country recorded 6,317 new infections since Friday, consistent with an average of 6,366 daily cases over the last week, the Health Ministry reported. Iran now has 1,411,731 known infections with a total of 57,889 Covid-19 fatalities.Malaysia adds 5,728 new casesMalaysia added a record number of coronavirus cases for a second day on Saturday, just days before the government decides on whether to prolong or tighten curbs on movement that are set to end next week. Authorities registered 5,728 new cases, up from Friday’s 5,725.Indonesia reports record casesIndonesia reported another record spike in Covid-19 infections as it struggled to roll out its mass vaccination program to combat Southeast Asia’s worst outbreak. The country confirmed 14,518 new cases in the 24 hours through midday Saturday, taking the total to 1,066,313. Nearly 30,000 have died from the virus so far.As many as 482,145 people had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as of Saturday, with 20,810 of them completing their second shot, official data show. The government is targeting to inoculate 598,400 people in January.Poland has 5,864 new cases, 303 deathsPoland registered 5,864 new coronavirus cases and 303 deaths from the virus over the past 24 hours. The government said this week that the pandemic situation has stabilized enough for it to reopen shopping centers from Feb. 1.Novartis prepares vaccine production, CEO tells SamWNovartis AG will be able to deliver “substantial amounts” of the Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine, Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan told Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende. The company has also been working on agreements to assume production of key parts of vaccines and putting them into vials, largely in Europe, but also in Asia.Norway extends national lockdown, Oslo to easeNorway extended national measures until mid-February and for Oslo to Feb. 10, Health Minister Bent Hoie said. It plans to ease curbs for schools and pre-schools in the Oslo area. Restaurants and individual stores will be allowed to reopen in Oslo. Stricter measures were introduced Jan. 23 to contain more contagious variants of the virus.Merkel urges Germans to remain cautiousGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel urged citizens to remain cautious so as to make a future easing of lockdown measures possible. “There is the very real danger from highly contagious viral mutations,” she said in her weekly podcast. “That’s why we have to be careful and cautious as we move through the next few weeks.”Germany isn’t ready yet to reopen daycare centers and schools, she added.World Bank commits $12 billion for Africa vaccinationsThe World Bank has committed $12 billion to African countries to support vaccination programs, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said.The money will be in the form of grants or on “highly concessional terms,” he said in a statement.Iran to get first batch of Russian vaccine next weekIran will receive the first batch of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine for Covid-19 by February 4, with two more deliveries due by the end of next month, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported, citing the Iranian ambassador in Moscow.An agreement has also been signed for production of the treatment in Iran, Kazem Jalali said, without providing further details. Earlier this week, the government said it had signed a deal with Russia for 2 million doses of the Russian vaccine.Astra-EU struggle opens fresh rift in bid to end pandemicA European dispute over supply of Covid-19 vaccines is threatening to unleash a wider political and economic conflict that could stymie global collaboration needed to end the pandemic.After accusing U.K. vaccine maker AstraZeneca of favoring deliveries to its home country, the EU announced a drastic plan to control exports of Covid shots. The retaliatory move may encourage more governments to use economic might -- or other means -- to protect their interests. The bloc is under pressure to speed up an immunization campaign that’s trailing those in Britain and the U.S.Moscow lures vaccine takers with ice creamIf the offer of immunity against Covid-19 isn’t enough to lure shoppers to get a vaccination at a Moscow shopping mall on Red Square, the organizers have sweetened the deal with free ice cream.Even so, there were few takers on a recent snowy afternoon for a city-sponsored Sputnik V injection and anyone looking to receive the free Russian shot could get it without a wait. While shortages, confusion and long lines hinder vaccination roll-outs in many countries, the Russian capital is a rare place faced with oversupply.Japan discovers new type of UK virus strainThree new types of the U.K. coronavirus strain, previously not detected in Japan, were discovered in patients at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, according to a research group studying Covid-19 cases at the hospital.None of the three patients infected with mutations of the U.K. strain had traveled abroad, meaning there is a high possibility that the variants are spreading in Japan, the group said in a statement on Friday. The patients were hospitalized during the period of November through late-December, with two of the three experiencing severe symptoms.Chicago talks with teachers’ union falterChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said no deal has been reached with the teachers’ union over resuming in-person learning even as kindergarten through eighth grade students are scheduled to return to classrooms on Monday.The school district expects teachers to return on Monday when those students have the option to return, Lightfoot said. Preschool and cluster students are also expected to come back.AMLO Says ‘Critical Stage’ of Covid-19 Infection has Passed (11:10 a.m. HK)“I’m appearing here so there are no rumors or misunderstandings,” Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, said in a video posted online late Friday. “I’m well.”In the video, AMLO walked through the national palace and said he would have to continue resting. He said he’s been following the distribution of vaccines and conditions at hospitals in Mexico, confirming other official remarks that he’s continued to govern while stricken with the virus.J&J’s McClellan says may be enough vaccines for all US adults by June: CNBCThere could be enough vaccinations for the entire U.S. adult population by the summer, Johnson & Johnson board member Mark McClellan said in an interview on CNBC.The US plans to buy 200 million doses from Moderna and Pfizer and the Department of Health and Human Services is boosting its supply to states to at least 10 million does per week, according to CNBC.McClellan said the US should boost the number of shots it administers each day to closer to 3 million.Mexico reports 16,374 New Covid-19 Cases, 1,434 more deathsMexico’s total coronavirus cases rose to 1,841,893, while deaths increased to 156,579, according to data released by the Health Ministry Friday night.The country has administered 662,217 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with 31,397 people receiving a second dose, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said. 13 states are at the highest risk level due to the virus.Separately, Mexico will receive 870,000 AstraZeneca doses from India in February, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in an online video.Virus mutations undercut optimism even as more vaccines emergeEmerging virus variants are forcing drugmakers to develop booster shots for a disease that could remain active for years.Vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. are already in use. Meanwhile, studies show those from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc. pack a punch against early forms of the virus, potentially paving the way for quick authorizations in the US for J&J’s vaccine and in the U.K. for Novavax’s shot.Now the bad news: Mutations that likely confer partial resistance to vaccines and antibody treatments are now prevalent in both South Africa and Brazil, and threatening to spread worldwide. The J&J shot was found in a late-stage trial to be 72% effective in the US, but that fell to 57% in studies done in South Africa. Novavax’s shot, 89% effective in the UK, was only 49% effective in South Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-trend-downward-deaths-roughly-steady-virus-update-101612026403300.html
30-01-2021||World||Pakistan opposition to oppose amendment by Imran Khan govt on Senate polls||Pakistan's Opposition parties have decided to oppose the constitutional amendment being introduced by Imran Khan to hold Senate polls through open ballot.Citing sources, Geo News reported that the leaders of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N), Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (JUI-F) discussed the matter after the government announced to introduce a bill in this regard."The Opposition has decided to not let the amendment pass through the parliament and a strategy would be finalised on Monday before the National Assembly session," sources said.According to Geo News report, adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan on Thursday had said that a bill comprising three amendments to the Constitution of Pakistan would be presented in Parliament next week ahead of the upcoming Senate elections.Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced his decision to hold early Senate elections as currently, the Senate is decisively controlled by the constituent parties of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).The federal government invoked the idea of early elections in order to change the power structure in the Senate.However, quashing his decision, the Election Commission of Pakistan said that the Senate elections cannot be held in February, as proposed by Imran Khan, as half of its members will be retiring on March 11.The News International reported the ECP as saying in its five clarifications, "Half of the Senate members will retire on March 11, 2021 after completing their six-year term. According to the Constitution, elections cannot be held 30 days in advance on seats that are vacant after the expiry of the term of the members of the Senate, the ECP said, quoting Article 224(3) of the Constitution. This means elections on vacant Senate seats cannot be held before February 10, 2021. The last four to five Senate elections have been held in the first week of March. This time too, the ECP will announce the date for the Senate elections at a suitable time, according to the law and Constitution, through an election programme. Conducting the Senate elections is the constitutional and legal responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan under articles 218 (3) and 224 (3) of the Constitution and Section 107 of the Election Act, 2017."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-to-oppose-amendment-by-imran-khan-govt-on-senate-polls-101612027651048.html
30-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl case: US presses Pakistan for ‘accountability’||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday pressed his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi to ensure “accountability” for Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been convicted over the killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl.The United Nations has also called for the convicted terrorist to be held accountable.Omar Sheikh is set to be released after Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld his acquittal by a lower court in a verdict that sparked outrage in the United States. A three-judge court, which ruled 2-1 to clear the way for Omar Sheikh’s release, has said it will explain its order at a later date.Blinken and Qureshi spoke for the first time on Friday after the Biden administration took office. They “discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Omar Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl”, the state department said in a readout of their call. “The secretary (of state) reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners,” it added.Blinken reinforced this message in a post on Twitter.At the United Nations in New York, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, had a similar message for Pakistan. “I don’t have a comment on the specific case. What is important is that there be accountability for those crimes committed,” he told reporters in response to a question about Omar Sheikh’s acquittal.Daniel Pearl, who was South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi in 2002. A video of his beheading was posted online.Omar Sheikh, who is British-born, was arrested and convicted for Pearl’s kidnapping and murder, and was eventually sentenced to death, which was commuted by the Sindh high court in April 2020 to seven years.He had already been in prison for 18 years by that time. His release was delayed as the Sindh state government and Pearl’s family appealed to the Supreme Court.White House press secretary Jen Psaki had earlier expressed “outrage” at the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order on Thursday, and Blinken had separately said the acquittal was an “affront to terrorism victims everywhere”. They had both reaffirmed US preparedness to prosecute Omar Sheikh in America, renewing an offer first made by the Trump administration in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-case-us-presses-pakistan-for-accountability-101612027581741.html
30-01-2021||World||Iran rejects new participants, negotiations on nuclear deal||Iran's foreign ministry on Saturday rejected any new negotiations or changes to the participants in Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers, after French President Emmanuel Macron said any new talks should include Saudi Arabia."The nuclear accord is a multilateral international agreement ratified by UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which is non-negotiable and parties to it are clear and unchangeable," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted by state media as saying.Iran began breaching the deal's limits on uranium enrichment activity after Washington withdrew from the pact in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump and reimposed economic sanctions on Tehran.President Joe Biden's new administration has said it will rejoin the deal but only after Tehran resumes full compliance with its terms.Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates have said that Gulf Arab states should be involved this time in any talks, which they say should also address Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for proxies around the Middle East.In his comments on Friday, cited by Al Arabiya television, Macron stressed the need to avoid what he called the mistake of excluding other countries in the region when the 2015 deal was negotiated.Saudi Arabia, which is locked in several proxy wars in the region with Tehran including in Yemen, supported Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.Macron said any new talks on the nuclear deal with Iran would be very "strict" and that a very short time remained to prevent Tehran from having a nuclear weapon.Khatibzadeh said Macron should "show self-restraint"."If French officials are worried about their huge arms sales to Persian Gulf Arab states, they better reconsider their policies," Khatibzadeh said. "French arms, along with other Western weapons, not only cause the massacre of thousands of Yemenis, but are also the main cause of regional instability."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-rejects-new-participants-negotiations-on-nuclear-deal-101612024600284.html
30-01-2021||World||Journalists sought for personal help by the Covid-19 curious||Calling a hospital to see if a bed was available for a Covid-19 patient isn't part of Houston television news anchor Chauncy Glover's job description. Neither is guiding a viewer online to find a place to be vaccinated.He's done both, and isn't alone. Listeners and readers across the country are reaching out directly to journalists for help during the coronavirus pandemic, and many are responding.“We are now doing more than we bargained for,” Glover said. “We have to be smarter on these topics. We have to know more. For so many people, it may be life or death.”It began for Glover last spring, when he came down with Covid-19 and told his story to KTRK-TV viewers. By phone, email and text, he was peppered with questions after getting back to work: What did it feel like? Should I be worried if I have this symptom? What did you do during quarantine to keep from going crazy?One viewer described symptoms that made Glover suggest he go to the hospital, and the news anchor followed up with calls to find space for him.During the past month, inquiries about how to get vaccinated have become most common. Southern California Public Radio, which has an aggressive community outreach program, had 275 questions about that in a two-day period last week, said Ashley Alvarado, director of community engagement.Listeners have also asked Alvarado's team about unemployment benefits, about whether or not they should cancel a family wedding or if it was illegal to hold a graveside service for a relative who died.A former journalist, Alvarado frequently tips reporters to potential stories based on what her department hears. Similarly, questions that science and medical reporter Lisa Krieger gets are fodder for features and consumer tips published in the Mercury News of San Jose, California, and partner newspapers in the Bay Area News Group.Read | Fresh data show toll South African coronavirus variant takes on vaccine efficacyCC Davidson-Hiers, a reporter for the Tallahassee Democrat in Florida, has lost track of how many requests she's gotten, many from elderly readers who can't navigate online vaccination sign-ups.It's an abrupt turnaround from last year, when her inbox was filled with vitriol from people who called her an alarmist or worthless human being trying to scare people, just because she was writing about Covid-19.Now, she emails links and suggestions to readers who contact her. When she gets calls, she will stay on the line and walk people through the process when they're struggling with the internet.“I absolutely love doing it,” Davidson-Hiers said. “I have to keep an eye on how sustainable it is. It's something we're all facing — the pressure of the pandemic and the stress of it all.”Alvarado has staggered the work hours of people answering calls and similarly guards the mental health of colleagues who hear stories of trauma over and over again.Several of the people Krieger speaks to are simply grateful to hear another human being, instead of speaking to machines and getting calls dropped, or directed to an alienating online experience.Krieger has spent nights and weekends answering messages. She speaks to church groups and her newspaper has set up online seminars. She realizes that her first responsibility is to report and write stories, but said management has supported her efforts to help readers.“This is payback time for us,” she said. “These are readers who are very loyal and they need us. The least we can do is return their calls and emails.”Glover has spent considerable time trying to convince people in Houston's Black community that the vaccines are safe. He's met with hardened skepticism, including people who disparage “Trump's vaccine.” He and colleague Mayra Moreno host televised town hall meetings aimed particularly at Black and Latino residents.Alvarado similarly tries to break down cultural barriers, and sends out a regular text message of coronavirus news to listeners who don't have Internet access.“For me, it's rewarding,” Glover said. “You work so hard to become that voice that people turn to and they trust what you're saying. To me, that's the ultimate goal of a journalist — to be trusted.”Davidson-Hiers generally guides people to help themselves. But on two occasions — once for a person who had no internet and another for someone at a loss for how to use it — she has set up vaccination appointments for readers.In retrospect, she was queasy for ethical reasons. Journalists are trained to observe and report, not to get involved in their stories.There's nothing wrong with doing your best to help people with information, said Kathleen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin. But it's wise to avoid situations where you learn someone's medical records, or make a specific medical appointment or recommendation, she said.What if something goes wrong?“I make sure I stay within my boundaries," Glover said. “I don't think there's anything wrong with helping people navigate a website. I'm not picking people up and taking them to doctors' appointments or driving them to the hospital.”Despite the extra work involved, San Jose's Krieger and many of her colleagues are happy to find another way of connecting their news organizations to the communities they serve.“Over recent years we've been told that journalism is dying and is becoming obsolete," she said. “It's gratifying to be a comfort to readers and provide them with information they literally can't get anywhere else. It's so rewarding and it's why we're in this business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-sought-for-personal-help-by-the-covid-19-curious-101612023983270.html
30-01-2021||World||Black Lives Matter: All you need to know about Nobel Peace Prize nominee||Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that was rejuvenated after the killing of an unarmed Black man by a white US police officer, has been nominated for Nobel Peace Prize. Black Lives Matter announced the news from its Twitter handle, saying people are waking up to their global call for racial justice and an end to white supremacy. “We hold the largest social movement in global history. Today, we have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,” it tweeted.Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc was founded in 2013 following the acquittal of 17-year-old African-American high school student Trayvon Martin’s murderer. George Zimmerman, a Hispanic American, fatally shot the teenager during an altercation but was acquitted by a court after claiming self-defence, triggering widespread outrage since Martin was unarmed.Last year, George Floyd’s death sparked global outrage after the video footage showed a white police officer pressing his knee against the victim’s neck. Black Lives Matter became a rallying cry which prompted political leaders, top business executives, and other public figures to condemn the police brutality and call for an end to systemic racism. US President Joe Biden, who was then a presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, had said that Floyd deserved better, calling for a thorough investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook penned an open letter in which pledged to “do more” to fight racial discrimination and injustice and told the Black community that their “lives matter”. The top executive said that George Floyd’s death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a “normal” future, adding a new future should be built that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice.Read | Black, British, forgotten: UK arts retell lost talesBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has also supported the impeachment of former president Donald Trump following the Capitol riots, urging US Senate to convict him. Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and executive director of the foundation, said that Republicans in Congress have “tolerated, and even enabled, his violent and divisive rhetoric for far too long”. “We call on the next administration to further hold Trump and former members of his administration accountable, and take bold action to end white supremacy in the United States,” Cullors had said in a statement.Notably, the foundation on Friday won Sweden's Olof Palme human rights prize for 2020 for promoting "peaceful civil disobedience against police brutality and racial violence" around the world. The organisers said that Black Lives Matter had its great global breakthrough in the summer of 2020 in connection with a number of cases of extreme brutality. It added that around twenty million people have taken part in the Black Lives Matter protests in the US alone.“That the all powerful raised voices of African Americans resonate so strongly also internationally, shows that this in essence is about global threats to human dignity and fundamental human rights: BLACK LIVES MATTER!” they stated.The foundation has its presence in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. According to the Black Lives Matter website, the movement’s mission is to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-all-you-need-to-know-about-nobel-peace-prize-nominee-101612022149706.html
30-01-2021||World||Black Lives Matter proposed for Nobel Peace Prize||Black Lives Matter, a movement which became a rallying cry after the killing by US police of an unarmed black man, has been proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize, a Norwegian MP said Saturday.Founded in the United States in 2013, the movement received an impetus in May after George Floyd died. A white policeman had knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes ignoring Floyd's pleas that he couldn't breathe.The incident fuelled protests in the United States that sped across the world."This movement has become one of the strongest global movements for working with racial injustice," Petter Eide, a socialist lawmaker who proposed BLM for the Peace Prize, told AFP."They have also been spread to many many countries, building up... awareness on the importance of fighting racial injustice," he said.Tens of thousands of people, including MPs and ministers from all countries, former Nobel laureates and distinguished academics, can propose candidates for the various Nobel prizes.The deadline ends on Sunday.Several other names have been mooted for the Peace Prize including controversial Wikileaks founder and whistleblower Julian Assange, former US president Donald Trump, media rights group RSF and a trio of Belarusian opposition leaders led by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.The Nobel prizes will be announced at the start of October. This year's prize went to the World Food Programme, the UN food agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-proposed-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612017694438.html
30-01-2021||World||Elon Musk plans to use Texas natural gas for his Starships||Elon Musk became the richest man in the world thanks to enthusiasm for Tesla Inc.’s sleek electric cars -- and the company’s stratospheric stock price. But while Musk is perhaps the most well known clean energy CEO, SpaceX, his other company, is likely to rely on drilling for natural gas to power Starship, the new spacecraft and rocket designed to carry humans to the moon, Mars and beyond.Musk’s SpaceX aims to use a site in South Texas to launch rockets to carry people and cargo to the moon and Mars. To do that, the company intends to drill gas wells to make its own fuel and electricity, according a Federal Aviation Administration document seen by Bloomberg.Musk has long derided the oil industry, touting renewable energy and electric vehicles as the keys to averting a climate catastrophe. But the FAA document and SpaceX’s comments to Texas regulators show how, at least in the short term, some of his goals will depend on plans for fossil-fuel extraction that are already drawing criticism from environmental groups.While Musk has said he ultimately aims to extract carbon from the atmosphere to produce fuel, a cost-effective method of doing so hasn’t been developed yet. The billionaire is donating $100 million toward a prize for the “best carbon capture technology.”The SpaceX site in Texas will be supplied by at least five nearby gas wells, along with two gas-fired power plants, according to the FAA document. Purified gas from the wells will be pumped into refrigeration equipment that turns it into liquid methane, the document shows. The methane can be combined with liquid oxygen and other compounds to make rocket fuel.SpaceX didn’t respond to requests for comment. But in a hearing last week with the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas in the state, the company’s lawyers said gas from the wells would be used for “rocket facility operations.”The document seen by Bloomberg appears to be an unfinished draft environmental review, an FAA spokesperson said. A public comment period that ended last week will be used to complete the official draft assessment. Once complete, the draft will be posted to the agency’s website for another round of public comments.The company is also seeking permission from the FAA to add a gas treatment plant and equipment that will turn the methane into its liquid form, and it plans to expand a nearby solar farm and build a desalination plant for water, agency records show.SpaceX originally built the coastal site for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, which are used to deploy satellites, but never used it for that purpose. The company is now seeking permission to use it as launch site for spacecraft that will carry people and cargo to the moon and mars, FAA records show.Read | Randeep Hothi: The Indian American who sued Elon MuskVertically IntegratedOne potential motivation for SpaceX’s plans to produce gas: vertical integration. Musk is a longtime fan of the strategy, which he’s used to keep control of his companies’ supply chains. By drilling for gas, SpaceX would avoid paying a third party to produce it and pipe it to the launch site.Depending on the liquid-oxygen-to-liquid methane fuel ratios, a single launch would require tens of millions of cubic feet of gas.Even without taking into account the need for gas to fuel SpaceX’s power plants at the Texas site, a minimum of 10 launches a year would require roughly half a billion cubic feet. That would cost roughly $1.37 million, based on current benchmark gas futures that trade in New York.To secure that gas, SpaceX launched a subsidiary named Lone Star Mineral Development in June. The company wasted no time in buying up mineral rights in the area, as well an 806-acre lease originally drilled by Houston-based oil company Sanchez Energy, which rebranded itself as Mesquite Energy after emerging from bankruptcy last year.It’s not clear how much gas Lone Star will be able to extract from the site, however. Cameron County, where the launch site is located, isn’t a prolific source of the fuel. Sanchez’s lease, put into production in 2011, yielded roughly 536 million cubic feet of gas during that first year, Railroad Commission data show. But after that, production continued to sag until the well taken out of service in March 2014.Geology isn’t the only hurdle for SpaceX’s gas-production plans. The company faces legal challenges for a parcel of land that makes up a small corner of the drilling lease. Closely held producer Dallas Petroleum Group LLC says it’s been paying property taxes on two wells there and is asking the Railroad Commission to resolve a dispute over control of the wells with Lone Star. It had previously sued Sanchez over access to the wells, and amended the suit on Friday to add SpaceX and Lone Star as defendants.Lone Star also bought two offshore rigs from drilling contractor Valaris Plc last year. They’ll likely be used as landing pads for SpaceX’s reusable rockets, FAA records show.Read | First private space crew paying $55M each to fly to station on a SpaceX rocketEnvironmental OppositionA coalition of a dozen environmental groups is already raising alarm over SpaceX’s expansion plans. The rocket launch site has gone far beyond the scope of its original permit, and the company’s plans threaten an environmentally sensitive wildlife corridor along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the coalition.At the launch site last year, “there were at least three explosions, some of which resulted in more fires that burned smaller areas” of public lands, EJ Williams, vice president at the American Bird Conservancy, said in an email. “These explosions directly impacted designated critical habitat used by federally listed and other declining species.”More traffic on the highway leading to the launch site has dramatically increased the number of animals killed by vehicles, and road closures for rocket launches have prevented biologists from studying threatened migratory bird species that nest nearby, according to David Newstead, a director of bird conservation projects for the Corpus Christi-based Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program.The FAA originally permitted SpaceX for 12 launches a year and 180 hours of road closures, but Newstead said his group documented more than 1,100 hours of highway closures last year.Because of changes to SpaceX’s plans for the Texas site, environmental groups want the FAA to use a more stringent and transparent process for reviewing the company’s proposals. For example, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires companies seeking to build new gas pipelines or export terminals to file regular public updates, whereas the FAA doesn’t mandate the same level of disclosure, said Patrick Anderson, chair of the Sierra Club’s Lower Rio Grande Valley chapter.Though SpaceX is seeking permission to produce gas in the near term, the Texas launch site ultimately could further Musk’s zero-carbon ambitions. Gas drilling could potentially be part of gaining longer-term experience with in-situ resource utilization, or ISRU, the practice of generating products with local materials. Although there are no fossil fuels on Mars, those who land there might need to drill for water or minerals.Musk could also use drilling to gain experience in developing carbon dioxide storage wells. SpaceX will likely have to use carbon capture on Mars to make fuels for the trip back home, which makes it crucial to get the technology right.Historically, liquid hydrogen was the fuel of choice for early outer space missions, while a rocket loaded with kerosene and liquid oxygen sent Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins to the Moon.But over the last few years, privately-held space exploration companies such as SpaceX and Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin have adopted and continue to invest in technology allowing them to use liquid methane as a fuel source, said Jim Bridenstine, a former NASA administrator under the Trump administration and now a full-time senior adviser with the Oklahoma City-based aerospace and defense private equity firm Acorn Growth Cos.When mixed with liquid oxygen, liquid methane improves fuel efficiency and gives rockets more thrust to escape Earth’s gravity, Bridenstine said. He views SpaceX drilling for natural gas in Texas as the latest example of Musk applying vertical integration.“Elon Musk believes in vertical integration but he vertically integrates with a purpose, one that reduces risks to improve quality control over technologically sophisticated components, drives down costs and improves access to space,” Bridenstine said. “We’ve seen that over and over again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-plans-to-use-texas-natural-gas-for-his-starships-101612016442939.html
30-01-2021||World||Biden faces calls to secure release of US man in Afghanistan||As the Biden administration considers whether it should pull remaining US troops out of Afghanistan in the coming months, some fear for the fate of an American who could be left behind: an abducted contractor believed held by a Taliban-linked militant group.On the one-year anniversary of Mark Frerichs’ abduction, family members and other supporters are urging the Biden administration not to withdraw additional troops without the Navy veteran being released from captivity. Frerichs was abducted one year ago Sunday while working in the country on engineering projects. US officials believe he is in the custody of the Haqqani network, though the Taliban have not publicly acknowledged holding him.“We are confident that he's still alive and well,” his sister, Charlene Cakora, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We don't have any thinking that he's dead or that he's injured.”For US diplomats, Frerichs' captivity is a piece of a much larger geopolitical puzzle that aims to balance bringing troops home, after a two-decade conflict, with ensuring regional peace and stability. Biden administration officials have made clear that they are reviewing a February 2020 peace deal between the United States and the Taliban, concerned by whether the Taliban are meeting its commitment to reduce violence in Afghanistan.Read | Biden warns of growing cost of delay on economic aid planThe Trump administration, which had made the release of hostages and detainees a priority, ended without having brought home Frerichs, who is from Lombard, Illinois. He is one of several Americans the Biden administration is inheriting responsibility for, including journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012, as well as US Marine Trevor Reed and Michigan corporate executive Paul Whelan, both of whom are imprisoned in Russia.It is unclear to what extent, if at all, Frerichs' fate will be complicated by the declining American military presence in Afghanistan committed to by the Trump administration. Days before President Joe Biden took office, the Trump administration announced that it had met its goal of reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan to about 2,500, part of a broader plan to remove all forces by May.The Biden administration must determine how to handle that commitment.New Secretary of State Antony Blinken held his first call Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and told him the administration was reviewing the peace deal. A State Department description of the conversation did not mention Frerichs. Separately, the Pentagon said the Taliban’s refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all US troops will be able to leave by May.Frerichs' supporters are concerned that a drawdown of military personnel from Afghanistan leaves the US without the leverage it needs to demand his release.“Further troop withdrawals that are not conditioned upon the release of American hostages will likely make it harder to subsequently secure their release,” the two Democratic senators from Illinois, Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin, wrote Biden in a letter provided to the AP.In an interview, Duckworth said she wrote Biden and Blinken to stress “that this needs to be a priority, that we need to bring him home.” She said Lloyd Austin, the new defense secretary, had given assurances that any negotiations about military presence would include discussion about detainees “as opposed to us just unilaterally pulling out of there.”Representatives of the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, which advocates for hostages, told new national security adviser Jake Sullivan in a conversation during the presidential transition period about concerns that Frerichs and Paul Overby, an American writer who disappeared in Afghanistan in 2014, weren't adequately prioritized during discussions with the Taliban, according to the organization's executive director, Margaux Ewen.The State Department is offering $5 million for information leading to Frerichs' return.“American citizen Mark Frerichs has spent a year in captivity. We will not stop working until we secure his safe return home,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.Frerichs remains in Afghanistan despite a year of steady diplomatic negotiations, including peace talks in November with then-Secretary of State Pompeo and Taliban and Afghan negotiators. The US and Taliban signed a peace deal last February, but much to the family's frustration, Frerichs' return was not made a predicate for the agreement even though he had been abducted weeks earlier.“I don’t want any troops to start packing up and heading out until Mark gets home safely, because I don't think we really have a leg to stand on once they're all out of there,” Cakora said. “You don’t leave Americans behind, and I just really want to make sure that he’s home safe.”Blinken told reporters Wednesday that the Biden administration wanted to take a detailed look at that deal, saying. “We need to understand exactly what is in the agreement” before deciding how to proceed. He said the administration had asked Trump’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, to remain on the job for continuity’s sake.In his call with Ghani the following day, according to the State Department, Blinken expressed “robust diplomatic support” for the peace process but said the US was reviewing the peace deal to assess whether the Taliban were living up to their commitment to “cut ties with terrorist groups.”There were other internal government discussions in the Trump administration.The Taliban had asked for the release of a combatant imprisoned on drug charges in the US as part a broader effort to resolve issues with Afghanistan. The request prompted dialogue between the State Department and the Justice Department about whether such a release could happen, though it ultimately did not, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.It is unclear whether those conversations will pick up in the new administration.A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-faces-calls-to-secure-release-of-us-man-in-afghanistan-101612016104768.html

The authorities performed 41,435 tests in the last one day. It showed that the positivity rate was 5.25%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-send-special-plane-to-china-to-receive-first-tranche-of-covid-19-vaccine-101612016052635.html
30-01-2021||World||China gene firm providing worldwide Covid-19 tests worked with Chinese military||BGI Group, the world's largest genomics company, has worked with China's military on research that ranges from mass testing for respiratory pathogens to brain science, a Reuters review of research, patent filings and other documents has found.The review, of more than 40 publicly available documents and research papers in Chinese and English, shows BGI’s links to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) include research with China’s top military supercomputing experts. The extent of those links has not previously been reported.BGI has sold millions of Covid-19 test kits outside China since the outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic, including to Europe, Australia and the United States. Shares of BGI Genomics Co, the company’s subsidiary listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, have doubled in price over the past 12 months, giving it a market value of about $9 billion.But top US security officials have warned American labs against using Chinese tests because of concern China was seeking to gather foreign genetic data for its own research. BGI has denied that.The documents reviewed by Reuters neither contradict nor support that US suspicion. Still, the material shows that the links between the Chinese military and BGI run deeper than previously understood, illustrating how China has moved to integrate private technology companies into military-related research under President Xi Jinping.Read | WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that treated early Covid-19 patientsThe US government has recently been warned by an expert panel that adversary countries and non-state actors might find and target genetic weaknesses in the US population and a competitor such as China could use genetics to augment the strength of its own military personnel.BGI has worked on PLA projects seeking to make members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority less susceptible to altitude sickness, Reuters found, genetic research that would benefit soldiers in some border areas.Elsa Kania, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank, who has provided testimony to U.S. Congressional committees, told Reuters that China’s military has pushed research on brain science, gene editing and the creation of artificial genomes that could have an application in future bioweapons. She added that such weapons are not currently technically feasible.BGI’s pattern of collaboration with the Chinese military was a “reasonable concern to raise” for US officials, said Kania.In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said it adheres to international standards and Chinese laws related to open science, data sharing and genomic research. It said its collaboration with military researchers was for academic purposes only.“BGI strongly rejects any accusations about links with the PLA, particularly in relation to our Covid-19 test kits,” it said in a statement.China’s defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment.'Enhance' soldier strengthChinese technology companies have come under increasing scrutiny by the United States and were subject to mounting restrictions under the administration of Donald Trump. In November, the Department of Commerce proposed a rule to add gene editing software to the US export control list, saying it could be used to create biological weapons. Officials in the new administration of President Joe Biden have signalled a continued tough approach to what they see as a rising threat from Beijing.A technology industry panel on artificial intelligence, appointed by the US government and chaired by former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, raised the alarm in October about China’s financial support for its biotechnology sector, its advantages in collecting biological data, and the PLA’s interest in potential military applications.The panel, which will deliver its final report in March, warned about adversaries using artificial intelligence to identify genetic weaknesses in a population and engineering pathogens to exploit them, and genetic research designed to enhance soldiers’ mental or physical strength.The panel recommended that the US government “take a more aggressive public posture regarding BGI,” citing national security risks posed by the company’s links to the Chinese government and its trove of genomic data.The US Department of State did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Reuters’ findings.In response to Reuters’ questions, China’s foreign ministry said the U.S. government had “wantonly misinterpreted and smeared China’s military-civil fusion policy,” and was imposing unreasonable sanctions that would hamper research.“China’s military-civil fusion policy is aimed at effectively mobilizing military and civilian resources, coordinating socio-economic growth and national defense development, and benefiting the public with scientific and technological progress. This policy is above board and beyond reproach,” the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.It added that this was “customary international practice” and said the US government had effectively pursued military-civil fusion for more than 100 years.Read | Chinese national charged with conspiring to export US power technology‘Key projects’BGI Group, based in Shenzhen, has grown quickly by selling genetic sequencing services to universities and health systems around the world and amassing a large DNA databank. It created China’s first cloned pig in 2010.One science paper authored by BGI founders Yang Huanming and Wang Jian along with the PLA’s Key Laboratory of High Altitude Medicine and the Third Military Medical University focused on experiments with the brains of monkeys suffering altitude sickness.The study, published in January 2020, stated that it was funded as one of the “key projects of military science and technology” by the PLA. A decade ago, the military university’s research sought to identify genes related to altitude sickness so the PLA could screen for susceptible soldiers. The latest research focused on how drugs interacting with genes could potentially protect a person from brain injury.An earlier 2017 study designed by BGI’s Wang and published in conjunction with a PLA research centre in Xinjiang looked at the effect of rapid mountain ascent on the bodies of “young, healthy men.”China has the world’s longest highland border, which includes its border with India, where fighting broke out between the two countries' troops in 2020. A 2018 paper by the same PLA laboratory stated that “high altitude disease is the main reason for reduced combat effectiveness and health damage to soldiers at high altitudes and influences the results of war.”Reuters was unable to contact Yang and Wang. BGI said its research collaboration with the PLA lab and the Third Military Medical University, where Yang has been a professor for almost two decades, was “for academic purposes only.”Sequencing CovidBGI jointly holds a dozen patents for tests that screen for genomes linked to disease with the military university, the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science, which is the top medical research institute of the PLA, and PLA hospitals.One patent was granted in 2015 to BGI and the Academy of Military Medical Science for a low-cost test kit to detect respiratory pathogens, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and coronaviruses.BGI’s current chief infectious disease scientist, Chen Weijun, is listed as an inventor on the patent documents. Chen was among the first scientists to sequence Covid-19, taking samples from a military hospital in Wuhan, according to sequence data later shared internationally.Chen is listed as affiliated with the Academy of Military Medical Science in three science papers reviewed by Reuters.In response to Reuters’ questions, BGI said in a statement that Chen has not been affiliated with the PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Science since 2012. Chen did not respond to a request for comment.BGI’s Covid-19 test kit did not use the method jointly patented with the PLA, the company said in the statement.Four BGI researchers have also been jointly affiliated with another military institution, the National University of Defence Technology (NUDT), according to publicly available science and conference papers reviewed by Reuters. Hunan-based NUDT is under the direct leadership of China’s Central Military Commission, the top-level body that steers the Chinese military and is headed by Xi.The NUDT is on a U.S. blacklist as a threat to national security because its Tianhe-2 supercomputer - one of the world’s most powerful - is used to simulate nuclear explosions, according to a Department of Commerce listing. That listing restricts U.S. companies from supplying NUDT with technology.One researcher, Peng Shaoliang, was instrumental in developing software to speed up BGI’s sequencing of human genomes using supercomputing developed by NUDT.Peng has won military awards for his work. He is a member of an expert group advising the Central Military Commission’s Science and Technology Commission, set up in 2016 when Xi began promoting a strategy to integrate China’s civilian and military research.Patent applications in 2020 show Peng is also a member of the PLA’s Institute of Military Medicine. Liao Xiangke, the head of the NUDT’s supercomputer programme and a major general in the PLA, has published seven scientific papers either co-authored with BGI researchers or crediting them for providing data and source code.BGI said in a statement to Reuters that Peng and Liao “were two collaborators of BGI for the project at the time for the purpose of academic exchange only. Since the project ended BGI has no more affiliation with them.”Peng and Liao did not respond to requests for comment.BGI said it uses Tianhe-2 on a commercial basis, as well as other supercomputing platforms, to speed up research. The papers it wrote with the NUDT were for academic purposes only, it said, and were open for public reference, while the programmes themselves have ended.Tianhe-2 has also been used to solve pharmaceutical, cryptology, engineering and climate problems that have no military application, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gene-firm-providing-worldwide-covid-19-tests-worked-with-chinese-military-101612013071228.html
30-01-2021||World||Fresh data show toll South African coronavirus variant takes on vaccine efficacy||Clinical trial data on two Covid-19 vaccines show that a coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa is lessening their ability to protect against the illness, underscoring the need to vaccinate vast numbers of people as quickly as possible, scientists said.The vaccines from Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson were welcomed as important future weapons in curbing deaths and hospitalizations in a pandemic that has infected more than 101 million people and claimed over 2 million lives worldwide.But they were significantly less effective at preventing Covid-19 in trial participants in South Africa, where the potent new variant is widespread, compared with countries in which this mutation is still rare, according to preliminary data released by the companies."Clearly, the mutants have a diminishing effect on the efficacy of the vaccines," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in a briefing. "We can see that we are going to be challenged."Novavax reported midstage trial results on Thursday that showed its vaccine was 50% effective overall at preventing Covid-19 among people in South Africa.That compared with late-stage results from the United Kingdom, in which the vaccine was up to 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19.On Friday, J&J said a single shot of its coronavirus vaccine was 66% effective overall in a massive trial across three continents.But there were wide differences by region. In the United States, where the South African variant was first reported this week, efficacy reached 72%, compared with just 57% in South Africa, where the new variant, known as B 1.351, made up 95% of the Covid-19 cases reported in the trial.Another highly transmissible variant first discovered in the UK and now in more than half of US states has been less able to evade vaccine efficacy than its South African counterpart.The new findings, however, raise questions about how highly-effective vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech, and Moderna Inc will fare against new variants. The two vaccines showed an efficacy of around 95% in trials conducted primarily in the United States before the new virus versions were identified in other countries."It's a different pandemic now," said Dr. Dan Barouch, a researcher at Harvard University Medical School's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who helped develop the J&J vaccine.Barouch said there are now a wide variety of new variants circulating, including in Brazil, South Africa and even the United States, that are substantially resistant to vaccine-induced antibodies.Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said there was "a high possibility" that emerging variants may eventually render the company's vaccine ineffective."This is not the case yet ... but I think it's a very high likelihood that one day that will happen," Bourla said at the World Economic Forum. The drugmaker is considering whether its vaccine needs to be altered to defend against the South African variant.'Stop Hospitals From Going Into Crisis'Experts said that all four vaccines still have great value in their ability to reduce severe Covid-19."The end game is to stop death, to stop hospitals from going into crisis - and all of these vaccines, even including against the South African variant, seem to do that substantially," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health SecurityFor example, J&J's vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa.J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels said he suspects a type of immune system reaction called a T-cell response is playing a protective role and may be helping to prevent severe disease."We knew that to a certain extent, but it's also better and very confirming that we can see that now in the clinic," Stoffels said in an interview.Nevertheless, Fauci said the decreased efficacy rates underscore the need to follow variants closely, and to accelerate vaccination efforts before new, and even more dangerous, mutations arise."The best way to prevent further evolution of a virus is to prevent it from replicating," Fauci said, "and you do that by vaccinating people as quickly as you possibly can."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-data-show-toll-south-african-coronavirus-variant-takes-on-vaccine-efficacy-101612012594816.html
30-01-2021||World||Biden warns of growing cost of delay on economic aid plan||President Joe Biden is warning of a steep and growing “cost of inaction” on his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan as the White House searched for “creative” ways to win public support for a package that is getting a cold shoulder from Senate Republicans.In the age of the coronavirus, it’s not as simple as jumping on a plane to travel the country and try to gin up a groundswell. And at a time of deep polarization, Biden may struggle to convince Republican voters of the urgency when Congress already has approved $4 trillion in aid, including $900 billion last month.Biden signaled on Friday for the first time that he's willing to move ahead without Republicans.“I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it," he told reporters. "But the Covid relief has to pass. No ifs, ands or buts.”His message so far has been that a fresh $1.9 trillion in aid would be a bargain compared to the potential damage to the world's largest economy if it doesn't pass. An aggressive push for vaccinations and generous aid to individuals would help put parents back to work and let children return to school and improve their lifetime earnings, Biden said at a Friday meeting with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in the Oval Office.“We have learned from past crises that the risk is not doing too much,” he said. “The risk is not doing enough.”Read | Biden just linked climate and security, next comes military moneyOnly a week into his presidency, Biden is confronting the challenge of selling his first major piece of legislation to a country he has pledged to unite. Private calls with Republican lawmakers have yet to produce any progress on reaching a deal, while Senate Democrats are now preparing to pass the measure strictly on partisan lines as soon as next week.Some Biden allies have expressed frustration that the administration has not more clearly defined what the massive legislation would actually accomplish. The new president instead has largely focused his first nine days in office on signing executive orders rolling back his predecessor’s policies.In particular, Biden, for whom the widespread distribution of coronavirus vaccines will be a defining test, has not explained what the increased money for testing and vaccination would achieve -- including how much quicker the White House believes it would help bring about an end to the pandemic.Biden's outreach to senators has largely brought criticism that the plan should be more targeted and that the country can afford to wait to see the effects of the stimulus dollars that were approved in December.Republican lawmakers see a need for speeding vaccinations, but one Senate aide said their offices are not being bombarded with calls for an additional aid package. Constituents are more focused on the looming impeachment trial, said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.This has left the Biden team trying to expand its outreach beyond Capitol Hill.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden recognizes the importance of speaking directly to the American people about his plan for vaccinations and supporting the economy, but the pandemic has limited his ability to safely travel to drum up support. The administration is relying on TV interviews by White House officials and allies with local media and national shows like “The View,” as well as calls with governors, local officials and progressive and civic groups.“We’re taking a number of creative steps, a little outside of the box,” Psaki said. “Certainly, his preference would be to get on a plane and fly around the country.”Part of the challenge is that Biden must convince the public how different components of his proposal would work together. His plan allots $400 billion to spearhead a national vaccination program and the reopening of schools. It also includes $1,400 in direct payments to individuals, which critics say should be more targeted. And it includes a raise in the minimum wage to $15 and aid for state and local governments, a nonstarter for most Republicans.Read | Three key issues in Pacific theatre to shape Joe Biden's China policyMany Republicans are under more political pressure from donors and activists back home to rein in spending than to approve more. Some Republicans particularly object to what are still seen by many as bailouts for cash-strapped state and local governments.Some do support a deal, just not what Biden is offering. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a member of a bipartisan group of legislators contacted by the administration, said he supports funds for vaccine distribution and even potentially extra jobless benefits, but he wants a full accounting of what funding remains from previous aid packages.“Unemployment insurance, they think it’s an emergency, well we have unemployment insurance in place until mid March. Where’s the emergency?” Portman said. “Am I against extending it, no I’m not. I think we should, based on some economic factors. But it just doesn’t make sense.”Recent economic reports show the economy is still under severe strain, yet there is also the potential for the strongest growth in more than two decades once the coronavirus is contained.The Commerce Department said Thursday the US economy shrank 3.5% last year, and on Friday it reported that consumer spending — the main driver of growth — had slumped 0.2% in December. But the consumer spending report also suggested that the expanded unemployment benefits from the $900 billion aid package passed that same month had managed to boost incomes.Gregory Daco, an economist at Oxford Economics, said, "The Covid relief bill of December essentially addressed the past, the dwindling aid at the end of 2020.” Now the administration must sell the public on what lies ahead.He said, “The American Rescue Plan — it’s a plan geared toward the future, bridging the gap between January and September, when people will be able to spend more freely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-of-growing-cost-of-delay-on-economic-aid-plan-101612012474578.html
30-01-2021||World||UAE amends citizenship law for expatriates. All you need to know.||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday announced the Emirati Nationality Law has been amended to grant citizenship to expatriates. The UAE's Prime Minister and ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said this change was made to attract and retain individuals with specialised skills. “We adopted law amendments that allow granting the UAE citizenship to investors, specialized talents & professionals including scientists, doctors, engineers, artists, authors and their families. The new directives aim to attract talents that contribute to our development journey,” he tweeted.We adopted law amendments that allow granting the UAE citizenship to investors, specialized talents & professionals including scientists, doctors, engineers, artists, authors and their families. The new directives aim to attract talents that contribute to our development journey.The changes to the law on nationality and passports will allow expatriates to become dual citizens for the first time. Dual citizenship was earlier banned in the Emirates. To become an Emirati citizen, the expatriates have to swear an oath of allegiance, abide by local laws.

Meanwhile, in 2020, the drills could not be held due to COVID-19 pandemic.Soon after resuming office, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin in a telephonic conversation with his South Korean counterpart Suh Wook assured Seoul of the US' "ironclad" commitment to defend its long-term ally through joint defence work.Similarly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated "the enduring strength and importance of the alliance between the US and South Korea" to South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha.Blinken further said strong ties between the US and South Korea is necessary as the latter is "the linchpin of peace, security and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and across the world".While the ties between the US and South Korea strengthens, China has become more worried as it sees the ties as a "part of a regional coalition to curb its own growing political and military influence".On January 26, in an attempt to woo South Korea, Chinese President Xi Jinping called up President Moon Jae-in to show his support to inter-Korea dialogue and talks between the US and North Korea."Although South Korea is economically dependent on China, national security is far more important than economics," SCMP quoted Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based scholar of international relations as saying."South Korea will be closer to the US in the Biden administration because its goal is to maintain peace in East Asia under the US' leadership," Shen added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strengthening-of-us-south-korea-ties-cause-concerns-in-china-101612010628379.html

The new directives aim to attract talents that contribute to our development journey,” he said.The UAE cabinet, local emiri or rulers’ courts and executive councils of the seven emirates will nominate those eligible for citizenship under clear criteria set for each category. The law will allow those provided UAE passports to “keep their existing citizenship”, he added.The changes to the law on nationality and passports, in effect, will allow expatriates to become dual citizens. The UAE has become one of the few countries in West Asia to grant citizenship to expatriates, who form a large chunk of the population in the region.The UAE alone is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. Experts also believe the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE could open up new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India, which has close relations with both countries.The categories that can qualify to acquire UAE nationality include investors, doctors, specialists, inventors, scientists, talents, intellectuals, artists and their families (spouse and children), according to an official statement.Citizenship will be granted through nominations from the courts of rulers and crown princes, executive councils of the seven emirates, and the cabinet, based on nominations by federal entities.The UAE cabinet introduced the changes in line with an order from President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan with the aim of attracting and retaining individuals with specialised skills.The amendments laid down conditions to be met by each category. For instance, investors must own a property in the UAE.Doctors and specialists must be specialised in a unique scientific discipline or scientific principles that are highly required in the UAE, and have acknowledged scientific contributions, studies and research of scientific value and practical experience of not less than 10 years, in addition to membership of a reputable organisation in the field of specialisation.Scientists must be active researchers at a university, research centre or in the private sector, with practical experience of not less than 10 years. They should have contributions in their field, such as winning a prestigious award, or securing substantial funding for research in the past decade. It is also mandatory to obtain a recommendation letter from recognised scientific institutions in the UAE.Inventors are required to obtain one or more patents approved by the UAE’s ministry of economy or any reputable international body, in addition to a recommendation letter from the ministry.Individuals with creative talents, such as intellectuals and artists, should be pioneers in culture and arts and winners of one or more international awards. A recommendation letter from related government entities is mandatory.After qualifying and before acquiring citizenship, the expatriates must swear an oath of allegiance, commit to abide by local laws and informing authorities in case they acquire or lose any other citizenship.UAE citizenship offers a range of benefits, including the right to establish or own commercial entities and properties, and other benefits granted by federal authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-amends-laws-to-grant-citizenship-to-expatriates-with-special-skills-talents-101612004427402.html

Others have received it over time as well.Saturday's announcement by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai who also serves as the autocratic nation's prime minister and vice president, said the offer could apply to artists, authors, doctors, engineers and scientists, as well as their families.Sheikh Mohammed wrote on Twitter that hereditary rulers in the country's seven emirates and at the federal level would nominate those for citizenship. Those granted citizenship also would be able to keep their initial citizenship.It wasn't immediately clear if the citizenship also would grant rights to the UAE's cradle-to-grave social programs for its nationals.The UAE is home to over 9 million people, only a tenth of them citizens. In November, the UAE announced plans to overhaul of the country’s Islamic personal laws, allowing unmarried couples to cohabitate, loosening alcohol restrictions and criminalizing so-called “honor killings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-to-offer-citizenship-to-select-foreigners-in-a-rare-move-101612000944312.html
30-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl murder: Where does the case now stand amid US pressure||Pakistan’s Supreme Court has reportedly fixed February 1 for the hearing on the Sindh government's petition against the acquittal of all accused involved in the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl. According to Pakistani daily The Express Tribune, the three-judge bench led by Justice Umar Ata Bandial will take up the plea seeking a stay on Sindh high court’s December 24 decision in which the court had declared the detention of the accused illegal.On Thursday, the top court dismissed the appeals against the acquittal and ordered the release of all the accused, which was denounced by Pearl’s family as “a complete travesty of justice.” In a phone call with Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, US secretary of state Antony Blinken has reinforced the concern about the ruling and potential release of the prisoners. He called on Qureshi to ensure accountability for British-born convicted al Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. According to the Pakistan Foreign Office, Qureshi “underscored that it was important and in the mutual interest that justice is served through legal means.”In January 2002, Pearl, who headed the South Asia bureau of The Wall Street Journal, was abducted in Karachi while working on a story about terror groups linked to al Qaeda. About a month later, a graphic video of Pearl’s beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi, sparking global outrage. Sheikh and three of his aides were arrested and, later, convicted by an anti-terrorism court in Pearl’s kidnapping and murder case.Sheikh was sentenced to death and his aides were sentenced to life in prison. In April 2020, Sindh high court overturned the murder conviction and found Sheikh only guilty of kidnapping the WSJ journalist, commuting Sheikh’s death sentence to seven years of imprisonment and acquitting the three others - Fahad Nasim Ahmed, Syed Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil.The Pakistan Peoples Party-led provincial government of Sindh then challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court and refused to release the four accused. The government kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order for three months and extended it further under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.The provincial government has challenged the December 24 decision, claiming that the release order did not contain detailed reasons. Sindh advocate general Suleman Talibuddin told the court during a hearing on last Monday that one of the observations in the court’s order suggested that the accused persons are not “enemy aliens” within the meaning of Article 10 (9) of the Constitution. “Meaning of this term is hitherto judicially unexplained," Talibuddin said.The court has now fixed the date for the hearing on the Sindh government's plea amid pressure from the United States as well as the United Nations. The bench will examine the legal term "enemy aliens" that needs to be explained in the context of the Daniel Pearl murder case. The Sindh government had claimed that the accused fall in the category of "enemy aliens" and told the apex court that they had placed material as proof on record as justification but the High Court rejected it."Now the Sindh government has requested the bench to pronounce authoritative judgment on the law and facts," read the order-sheet issued by the Justice Bandial bench.(with inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-murder-where-does-the-case-now-stand-amid-us-pressure-101612000526046.html
30-01-2021||World||EU in ‘damage control’ as bloc turns to vaccine export curbs||The European Union’s drastic plan to restrict exports of Covid-19 shots is more of a political ploy as prospects of successfully suing AstraZeneca Plc for reining in supplies of its vaccine appear slim, lawyers and trade experts said.The bloc’s executive arm announced on Friday that vaccine makers including AstraZeneca must obtain prior authorization before sending shots manufactured in the bloc to other countries. The escalation follows a very public dispute with the company triggered by production delays at a Belgian plant.“It’s pure damage control,” says Philip Haellmigk, an attorney in Munich who specializes in trade and customs controls. “This is a reaction to the failure of the EU to order enough vaccines in time” and is now about using “the tool of export control licenses to keep the vaccines in the EU,” he said.The move -- on the same day the EU’s drug regulator cleared the Covid-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford for all adults -- comes as pressure mounts on top EU officials for lagging far behind the U.K. and U.S. in the race to inoculate citizens. The EU had administered just 2.5 doses per 100 people in the bloc, compared with 8.3 in the U.S. and 11.9 in the U.K., according to Bloomberg data.EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis on Friday defended the restrictions, which will run until the end of March and allow EU states to block exports if a set of pre-defined criteria haven’t been met.“The protections and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act,” Dombrovskis told reporters in Brussels.The EU further fanned political tensions with the UK Friday by also seeking to limit exports to Northern Ireland before retreating hours later after a backlash over the move. Introducing restrictions between the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU, and Northern Ireland would contravene one of the key principles of the Brexit deal, which sought to avoid border controls after decades of violence over the status of Northern Ireland.The EU’s initial move prompted a rare show of unity from traditional political enemies in Northern Ireland, who uniformly decried the initial decision. Even with the Northern Ireland issue resolved, the bloc’s actions remain hugely controversial and have been criticized by the World Health Organisation, businesses and governments.Export curbs are not a new tool in the European Commission’s arsenal and are typically applied to goods deemed sensitive, including weapons. But they are likely to inflame relations with the UK.It “sets a dangerous precedent,” said Scott Rosenstein, health care adviser at the Eurasia group. “There has always been the expectation that when the supply exceeds the demand that countries who are manufacturing the vaccine will work to make sure that their domestic supply is spoken for. That’s what we’re seeing here.”Three Million DosesMessages left with the AstraZeneca press office were not immediately returned. Pascal Soriot, the company’s chief executive officer, has said that once it got EU approval it would ship at least 3 million doses immediately, with a target of 17 million by February.While the controversial step raises questions about legality, World Trade Organization rules regarding export restrictions have exemptions in the event of critical shortages of essential products or the need to protect human life and health.Far less clear are the chances of EU success in a simmering contractual dispute with AstraZeneca -- even with home advantage in Belgian courts.“What could they claim? Not so much at the moment, if you ask me,” said Christophe Ronse, a healthcare and IP lawyer for Altius in Brussels. “There is not so much they can do, unless they have some smoking gun. It’s an issue of political pressure.”Earlier on Friday, AstraZeneca succumbed to pressure from the commission to disclose its contract with the EU.‘Best Reasonable Efforts’But rather than providing proof that the drugmaker was in breach of the agreement, lawyers said the fine print including the phrase “best reasonable efforts” may give the drugmaker wiggle room to argue it didn’t violate contractual terms.While the contract refers to a “binding allocation” of initial Europe doses, that clause may be undermined by the best reasonable efforts expectation, said Christopher Newdick, a professor of health law at the University of Reading.“What does the word ‘binding’ mean in a general context of best endeavors?” said Newdick. “As so often happens, a problem has arisen which is not squarely addressed and so lawyers need to interpret these clauses in the context of the contract as a whole.”If the EU believed it had such a strong claim, it would have gone to court in Belgium to make an order in its favor, said Steven Barrett at Radcliffe Chambers in London.“By not going down that route, it has chosen a political solution,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-in-damage-control-as-bloc-turns-to-vaccine-export-curbs-101612000724089.html
30-01-2021||World||Capitol Police tighten Congress security in era of rising threats||The House's chief law enforcement officer is tightening security for traveling lawmakers as Congress reassesses safety in an era when threats against members were surging even before Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol.Capitol Police officers will be stationed at Washington-area airports and the city's Union Station train depot on busy travel days, the acting House sergeant at arms said in a memo obtained Friday. Timothy P Blodgett said he's set up an online portal so lawmakers can notify the agency about travel plans, and he urged them to coordinate trips with local police and airport officials and report suspicious activity to authorities.Capitol Police “will not be available for personal escorts,” said the email, sent late Thursday. “However, they will be in place to monitor as members move through the airport.” The steps underscored political divisions that grew increasingly acrid, even potentially dangerous, during Trump's invective-filled four years as president.In addition to personal verbal attacks against perceived foes, Trump stirred up supporters with relentless streams of bogus conspiracies like his false charge that Democrats stole November's election from him.The animosity lawmakers face has spread among themselves, with numerous Democrats saying they are wary of GOP colleagues who've said they carry guns in Washington. Republicans have bristled at new screening devices installed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that lawmakers are required to pass through when entering the House chamber, where carrying firearms is not allowed.“The enemy is within the House of Representatives,” Pelosi told reporters this week in a chilling characterization of Congress' internal tensions. She cited "members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.” In the latest instance of Capitol Hill's spiraling personal hostility, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., tweeted Friday that she was moving her office away from that of fellow freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., “for my team's safety.”Bush wrote that a maskless Greene and her staff “berated me in a hallway,” and wrote later that past Greene tweets have made her feel unsafe.Greene responded with a tweet of her own saying Bush was lying and that “She berated me,” posting video of the exchange. Greene, who has a history of incendiary social media posts, also described Bush, who is Black, as the leader of a “terrorist mob” of Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Greene has drawn fire for past social media posts reported by various news organizations in which she's suggested support for killing Democratic politicians, unfounded QAnon theories and racist views.In an interview on MSNBC, Bush said she shouted “put on a mask” and Greene's team responded by saying “stop inciting violence with Black Lives Matter.” “What does Black Lives Matter have to do with this? Put on a mask and save lives,” Bush said in the interview.Bush is now one of Congress' most progressive members. She has sponsored a measure that could lead to expulsion for lawmakers who — like Greene — backed Trump's unjustified effort to reverse his November election defeat.Congress' 535 members travel frequently between their homes and the capital, and many have said they feel vulnerable in their districts and when they travel. Videos have shown people insulting lawmakers at airports, including Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has criticized Trump.The January 6 Capitol riot “reminds us of the grim reality that members of Congress are high-profile public officials, and therefore face ongoing security threats from the same domestic terror groups that attacked the Capitol,” 32 House members, nearly all Democrats, wrote to congressional leaders this week.Five people died in the attack, including a Capitol Police officer, and the House impeached Trump on a charge of inciting insurrection.The House lawmakers' letter said while 902 threats against members of Congress were investigated in 2016, the number surged to 4,894 cases in 2018 and was tracking upward, according to Capitol Police testimony in 2019.Limited local police resources and social media strewn with personal information and their real-time locations make lawmakers more vulnerable when they are home, their letter said.The House members asked for tightened security procedures. Pelosi told reporters that some steps have already been taken and that she'll likely seek money to bolster safety.Members have been told they can use their office expenses to buy bullet-proof vests, which several have said they are wearing. Blodgett's letter said they can use those accounts for security for themselves and their offices, and said a Federal Election Commission opinion lets them use campaign funds for home security systems.The acting chief of the Capitol Police, Yogananda D. Pittman, said this week that “vast improvements” are needed to protect the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, including permanent fencing.Since January 6, the Capitol has been surrounded by a tall barrier and the grounds are patrolled by National Guard troops. Many lawmakers have long resisted giving the nation's symbol of democracy the look of a besieged compound, and leaders were noncommittal about permanent fencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-tighten-congress-security-in-era-of-rising-threats-101611999978473.html
30-01-2021||World||UN urges countries to repatriate 27,000 children from Syria||The UN counterterrorism chief is urging countries to repatriate the 27,000 children stranded in a massive camp in northeastern Syria, many of them sons and daughters of Islamic State extremists who once controlled large swathes of Iraq and Syria.Vladimir Voronkov told an informal meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday that “the horrific situation of the children in Al Hol (camp) is one of the most pressing issues in the world today.”The 27,000 children “remain stranded, abandoned to their fate,” vulnerable to be preyed on by Islamic State enforcers, “and at risk of radicalization within the camp,” he said.Al Hol, the largest camp for refugees and displaced Syrians in the country, is currently home to almost 62,000 residents, according to UN humanitarian officials. More than 80% are women and children, many who fled there after Islamic State militants lost their last Syrian stronghold in 2019. There are a number of other camps in the northeast as well.Voronkov said there are children from 60 countries in the camps who are the responsibility of their member states, not of Syria or the groups that control the camps. Kurdish fighters are guarding Al-Hol and other camps as well as thousands of Islamic State fighters and boys in prisons.He said a number of countries -- including Russia and Kazakhstan that convened the virtual meeting -- “have collectively repatriated nearly 1,000 children and their family members.”Voronkov said the experiences of the returnees are being compiled “and what we see thus far is that fears of security risks have been unfounded.”The executive director of the UN Counterterrorism Center stressed that children “must be treated primarily as victims” and youngsters under the age of 14 should not be detained or prosecuted.History has shown that children are resilient and can recover from violent experiences if they are supported in reintegrating into communities, Voronkov said.“Every effort should be made to ensure children are not kept in institutions but allowed to reintegrate with family members within their communities,” he said.Virginia Gamba, the U.N special representative for children and armed conflict, told the Security Council that children catalogued as being associated with armed groups including the Islamic State and al-Qaida “are the children who have been left adrift by conflict, like flotsam in the sea.”She echoed Voronkov’s call that they be treated “primarily as victims, not as security threats, and that detention be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible period.”The mental health, safety and overall development of foreign children held for a long time “in dramatic conditions” in camps in northeast Syria and Iraq “are at stake,” Gamba said.“They’re exposed to further trauma and stigmatization and are at risk because of their proximity to members of designated terrorist groups,” she said.Children have a right to a nationality and identity and must not remain stateless, Gamba stressed.Gamba said the repatriation of foreign children should be prioritized “with the best interest of the child,” and they must be assisted in reintegrating and getting an education, health care and jobs.“They must be given their childhood back in a safe environment where they can build a future away from violence,” Gamba said. “They deserve a chance at life, like any other child.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-urges-countries-to-repatriate-27-000-children-from-syria-101611998639590.html

30-01-2021||World||Antony Blinken dials Pak FM Qureshi, seeks accountability in Daniel Pearl's murder case||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken over phone with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and discussed the accountability of convicted terrorists responsible for the brutal murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, according to the State Department.Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country's powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Friday that Blinken reinforced America’s concern over Pakistan Supreme Court’s ruling acquitting Pearl’s killers."Blinken and Qureshi discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl,” Price said in a readout of the call.In addition, Blinken and Qureshi discussed the importance of continued US-Pakistan cooperation on the Afghan peace process, support for regional stability, and the potential to expand our trade and commercial ties, Price said.The Pakistan Foreign Office said in a statement that the two leaders discussed “recent developments in the Daniel Pearl case” and Qureshi “underscored that it was important and in the mutual interest that justice is served through legal means.”Qureshi congratulated Secretary Blinken on assuming his office, underscoring Pakistan’s commitment to forging a comprehensive partnership with the United States based on the convergence of interests on a whole range of issues, it said.Qureshi told Blinken that peace in Afghanistan through a negotiated political settlement was one of the fundamental convergences between the two countries.He said it was essential to have a reduction in violence leading to the ceasefire and to work towards securing an inclusive political solution in Afghanistan.Qureshi said Pakistan had facilitated the Afghan peace process and remained committed to working with the United States as a partner for peace, the Foreign Office said.Qureshi and Blinken also agreed to remain engaged and work together on advancing the two countries’ bilateral agenda and promoting common interests in the region and beyond, it said.A day earlier, Blinken expressed concern over the Pakistan Supreme Court’s decision of acquitting those involved in the sensational kidnapping and murder of Pearl and said that the judgement is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere.In a strongly-worded statement, Blinken urged Pakistan to explore all legal options to ensure that the killers of Pearl are brought to justice.“The United States is deeply concerned by the Pakistani Supreme Court’s decision to acquit those involved in Daniel Pearl’s kidnapping and murder and any proposed action to release them,” he said.Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as 'a complete travesty of justice.'Sheikh and his three aides - Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib - were convicted and sentenced in the abduction and murder case of Pearl in Karachi in 2002.Blinken said: “Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was indicted in the United States in 2002 for hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking, resulting in the murder of Pearl, the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, as well as the 1994 kidnapping of another United States citizen in India”.The court’s decision is an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan, he said.“We expect the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options to ensure justice is served. We take note of the Attorney General’s statement that he intends to seek review and recall of the decision. We are also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States for his horrific crimes against an American citizen,” Blinken said.The United States is committed to securing justice for Pearl’s family and holding terrorists accountable, he said.Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.A three-judge bench of Pakistan Supreme Court led by Justice Mushir Alam on Thursday dismissed the Sindh government's appeal against the Sindh High Court's (SHC) decision to overturn the conviction of Sheikh in the Pearl murder case. The beheading of the American journalist in 2002 had grabbed international headlines.The court ordered that three others, who had been sentenced to life in prison for their part in Pearl's kidnapping and death, also be freed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-dials-pak-fm-qureshi-seeks-accountability-in-daniel-pearl-s-murder-case-101611990173907.html
30-01-2021||World||As Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson weighs future, Donald Trump ties take a toll||After President Donald Trump lost his reelection bid, most Senate Republicans, his Justice Department and the courts dismissed or disputed his baseless claims about a “stolen election." Not Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.The GOP senator used his chairmanship of the Senate Homeland Security Committee to highlight Trump's allegations, claiming millions of Americans “have real, legitimate suspicions that this election was stolen” and worrying about “so many irregularities here.”That sort of fealty to Trump has endeared Johnson to the far-right base in his state, but it could prove costly if he decides to seek a third term in 2022. As Johnson weighs whether to run again, his embrace of Trump's anti-democratic campaign to overturn the election results already has angered some mainstream Republican allies, and is poised to motivate Democrats who have ridden opposition to Trump to new strength in the state.Observers note that Johnson, who rose out of the tea party movement more than a decade ago, has often behaved like a senator from a solidly red state. But November's election demonstrated that Wisconsin, which Democrat Joe Biden won by fewer than 21,000 votes, is anything but. The fight for his seat will be among the most competitive races next year.“I think if the election were a week from now he would be in a world of hurt,” said Fond du Lac County Republican Party Chair Rohn Bishop. Bishop criticized fellow Republicans like Johnson who parroted claims of illegal election activity, even as he remains a Johnson backer. But he notes that Johnson is at risk of losing moderate voters critical to winning."It may hurt him with the suburban voters. ... The election wasn’t stolen, and it’s hard to convince people they should vote for you when you try to throw away their legally cast ballots.”Johnson has long been aligned with Trump's hard-line policies and politics. He led the push to investigate Biden's son Hunter and rarely broke with the White House. Still, some Republicans were surprised to see the senator lend credence to Trump's post-election schemes, which included an attempt to throw out the ballots of 238,000 voters in the majority-Democratic areas of Milwaukee and Madison.Johnson's hearing on Dec. 16 to look into unfounded election fraud complaints largely perpetuated Trump’s baseless claims. And on Jan. 6, just before the U.S. Capitol was stormed, Johnson objected to counting the Electoral College votes from Arizona.The editor of the conservative website Right Wisconsin published a scathing column hours before the riot, saying that Johnson was on a “reckless path” by questioning the integrity of the election and that he should retire and would lose if he ran again.After the riot, Johnson did not vote to object. Still, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin’s largest newspaper, called for Johnson to resign for “stoking an insurrection.”Johnson responded with a column in the newspaper calling the editorial “unhinged and uninformed.” The Journal Sentinel took the rare step of annotating his response, providing 19 footnotes with additional context, fact checking and corrections.The Wisconsin State Journal, the state's second largest newspaper, has also called for Johnson's resignation, and the anti-Trump Republicans behind the The Lincoln Project have targeted Johnson for defeat, citing his support for election conspiracy theories and comparing him with disgraced former Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Joe McCarthy.Johnson remains popular with the GOP grassroots, a key factor as he mulls whether to run again, said GOP strategist Brian Reisinger, who worked on Johnson’s 2016 campaign. He noted that Johnson has been able to overcome naysayers who didn’t give him much of a chance of winning, first against then-incumbent U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in 2010 and again in a 2016 rematch.“There’s a lot of people who look at Ron Johnson, and they see the political durability that he’s had over the years despite being a dead man walking twice before,” Reisinger said.Johnson in 2016 pledged not to seek a third term, but backed off three years later, saying he wanted to see how the 2020 election turned out. He has also said he's considering running for governor in 2022.Johnson, 65, has said in recent weeks that he has not yet made a decision.“My bias has always been (to serve) two terms and go home,” Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel last month before Democrats won a pair of Georgia runoff elections to take majority control of the Senate. “That continues to be my preference, but at the same time, the Senate is kind of a firewall against total control by Democrats, which would be, I think, a very bad thing for this country.”Johnson and his spokesperson Ben Voelkel declined to comment on his plans.Republicans already have three Senate vacancies to defend. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio have said they will not run again in 2022. GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who turns 89 in 2022, is also on the ballot, and two-term Missouri Republican Roy Blunt has not said whether he’ll seek a third.If Johnson retires, it likely would be a free-for-all on both sides.A number of Republicans are eyeing a run for either Senate or governor, depending on what Johnson does. Potential Republican Senate candidates include U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, former U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy and Kevin Nicholson, who lost a 2018 Republican Senate primary.The list of Democratic hopefuls includes Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the state’s first Black lieutenant governor, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee.Alex Lasry, the senior vice president to the Milwaukee Bucks who helped spearhead the successful effort to get the 2020 Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee before the coronavirus sent the event nearly entirely online, is also considering a run. Lasry is the son of billionaire hedge fund manager and Democratic bundler Marc Lasry and could potentially self-finance his run.Another potential candidate is Steven Olikara, founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Millennial Action Project. Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson has already declared his candidacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-wisconsin-senator-ron-johnson-weighs-future-donald-trump-ties-take-a-toll-101611990985551.html

30-01-2021||World||Scientists develop new tool that may help reduce spread of Covid-19||Scientists have engineered a new tool which exposes aerosolised virus particles to microwaves in a controlled manner, an advance that may lead to the development of novel methods to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, studies have found that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spreads via aerosols that can be generated and spread through breathing, coughing, sneezing, or talking by infected individuals.While previous studies have explored the use of electromagnetic energy to deactivate viruses in bulk fluids, the researchers, including those from the Air Force Research Laboratory in the US, said less work has been done to understand the role of microwaves in inactivating viral pathogens in aerosols.In the current research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the scientists developed experimental tools capable of presenting electromagnetic waves to an aerosol mixture containing viruses.Also read| Can a fake commute help you reclaim your day?They said the apparatus offers the ability to vary power, energy, and frequency of the electromagnetic exposure.With further research, the scientists hope to better characterise the threshold levels of microwave energy needed to inactivate aerosolised viral particles and reduce their ability to spread infection.They believe the new experimental design can provide the means to identify a wide variety of virus inactivation mechanisms.According to the researchers, the systems are designed to prevent the release of microwaves into the work environment since at high levels the radiation could potentially interfere with diagnostic equipment and other electronics.They plan to expose coronavirus surrogate -- bovine coronavirus -- to microwaves at frequencies ranging from 2.8 gigahertz to 7.5 gigahertz (GHz).In comparison, commercial microwave ovens operate at around 2.45 GHz.Explaining, the need for the surrogate virus, Brad Hoff, a co-author of the study from the Air Force Research Laboratory, said the bovine coronavirus is "similar in size and configuration to human coronavirus, but is safe to humans.""If shown to be effective, the use of microwaves may enable the potential for rapid decontamination not currently addressed by ultraviolet light or chemical cleaning for highly cluttered areas, while potentially operating at levels safely compatible with human occupancy," Hoff added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-develop-new-tool-that-may-help-reduce-spread-of-covid19-101611986852861.html

The City of Davis had however voted to go ahead with the installation. Since then OFMI had launched a campaign to remove the Gandhi statue.Indian-Americans have expressed deep anguish and shock at the incident.“An atmosphere of hatred was being created by many anti-India and hinduphobic radical organisations like OFMI and other Khalistani separatists for many years now,” said Guarang Desai of Friends of India Society International (FISI).“They have not only run hate campaigns against Indian icons but have been at the forefront of attempts to push hinduphobia and erase India from California school textbooks,” Desai said.In 2016, the OFMI was part of a campaign to remove the mentions of 'India' from the sixth and seventh grade California school textbooks and replace them with ‘South Asia’. After massive protests from parents and students, the California Department of Education had dropped the controversial changes.Appalled at the desecration, the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) has demanded that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigate the incident as a hate crime.“We condemn this cowardly desecration and call upon the Department of Homeland Security and FBI to investigate this hate crime, as it was likely done with the intention of intimidating the Indian American community,” said HAF California Advocacy Director Easan Katir, a former member of the Davis Business and Finance Commission.“We urge local police to apprehend the perpetrators and call upon the city council to resurrect the statue as a statement that such destructive acts are not in harmony with our community standards,” Katir said.“Make no mistake” HAF said in a tweet “this is not about legacy of Gandhi as a person, but about intimating India and Indian Americans.”.The vandalism was praised on Twitter by a pro-Khalistan group in California, who shared photos of the destroyed statue, and others who stated “Today is a good day.”This is not the first time a statue of Gandhi has been desecrated. In December 2020, Khalistani-supporters had desecrated a Mahatma Gandhi statue in Washington, DC in front of the Indian Embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mahatma-gandhi-statue-vandalised-in-us-101611984557291.html
30-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that treated early Covid-19 patients||Members of a World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of the coronavirus pandemic visited another Wuhan hospital that had treated early Covid-19 patients on their second full day of work on Saturday.Jinyantan Hospital was one of the city’s first to deal with patients in early 2020 suffering from a then-unknown virus and is a key part of the epidemiological history of the disease.The team’s first face-to-face meetings with Chinese scientists took place on Friday, before the experts who specialize in animal health, virology, food safety, and epidemiology visited another early site of the outbreak, the Hubei Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital.The Geneva-based WHO said late Thursday on Twitter that its team plans to visit hospitals, markets like the Huanan Seafood Market that was linked to many of the first cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities including the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.“All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the Covid-19 virus,” WHO tweeted. It said the team had already requested “detailed underlying data” and planned to speak with early responders and some of the first patients.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavour that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis, and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.A possible focus for investigators is the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One of China’s top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-wuhan-hospital-that-treated-first-covid-19-patients-101611983511693.html

He was kidnapped in Karachi, the capital of Sindh, and beheaded days later.Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed appeals against the acquittal of British-born al-Qaeda terrorist Ahmed Omar Sheikh in the kidnapping and murder case of Pearl and ordered his release, a judgement denounced by the American journalist's family as "a complete travesty of justice."Also Read| US State Secy speaks with Pak counterpart, discusses Daniel Pearl murder caseThe apex court cleared Sheikh and his three Pakistani accomplices in the case of all the charges, ordering that Sheikh and others be immediately freed from jail.Responding to a question on Sheikh’s acquittal, Spokesman for the UN chief Stephane Dujarric said on Friday: "What is important that there be accountability for those crimes committed”.Pearl's murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.In April 2020, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case - almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.The Sindh government and family of Pearl filed petitions in the apex court, challenging the high court verdict.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Last month, the US said it was ready to take custody of Sheikh, asserting that Washington will not allow him to evade justice.Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson said the US was deeply concerned by the ruling affirming the acquittal of individuals convicted by a Pakistani trial court.Also Read| US must take a call on terror-haven Pakistan"The release of those involved would be an affront to Daniel Pearl’s family, to other terrorism victims around the world, and to the cause of justice,” Wilkinson said.In a tweet, Congressman Brad Sherman said: “The killers of Daniel Pearl go free. And Dr. Afridi, who helped the US get Osama Bin Laden, rots in jail.”"We are deeply disappointed that Pakistan’s Supreme Court has acquitted and ordered the release of Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh, despite overwhelming evidence of Sheikh’s involvement in the kidnapping of Daniel Pearl, which led directly to his murder," said Steven Butler, Committee to Protect Journalist’s Asia programme coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-should-be-accountability-for-crimes-like-daniel-pearl-s-murder-says-un-101611983946432.html

Terrorists-you will never live in peace- you will be pursued to the ends of the earth," said Col Wayne Marotto, Spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR)."We promised and fulfilled. I gave my word to pursue Daesh terrorists; we gave them a thundering response. Our heroic armed forces have eliminated Daesh commander Abu Yaser Al-Issawi as part of an intelligence-led operation," added Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi.ISIS or Daesh, a self-appointed Caliphate as defenders of Muslims everywhere, once controlled about a third of Iraqi territory at its height and had declared the city of Mosul to be the capital of its "Caliphate", reported The Hill.The terror group's self-declared Caliphate was defeated by a US-led coalition at Baghuz in March 2019. However, it remains a potent force in the region.Coalition forces are still fighting against ISIS soldiers in Iraq, though the whereabouts of the group's top leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, are still unknown. Al-Qurayshi was named ISIS's caliph following the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US-led raid in Baghuz in Syria in 2019, reported The Hill.The US still has about 2,500 troops left on three Iraqi military bases, though questions regarding how strong of a force is needed to keep ISIS at bay has complicated plans for a full withdrawal, reported The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airstrike-in-iraq-kills-top-islamic-state-leader-says-report-101611983663150.html

Something that he is personally committed to, his wife Dr Biden is personally committed to and invested in," said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.The task force will be under the command of Alejandro Mayorkas, who is due to be confirmed by the Senate as head of the Department for Homeland Security on Monday, she added.Jill Biden, 69, has a doctorate in education and plans to keep teaching at a university close to Washington while her husband serves as president.In December, she visited a migrant camp in Mexico, close to the border with Texas. "We are a welcoming nation, but that's not the message that we're sending at the border," she said at the time.Her tone was in marked contrast with her predecessor Melania Trump, who in 2018 visited children who had been locked up by her husband's policy of "zero tolerance" at the border and who wore a jacket with the logo, "I really don't care, do u?"Trump's government separated hundreds of migrant families, with very young children being taken away from their parents, some of whom were then deported.The plight of the children, taken from their parents and locked in detention centers, provoked such an outcry, even from some in the ranks of Trump's own Republican party, that he was forced to backpedal. A judge later ordered that the families be reunited.Authorities identified more than 2,700 children who needed to be reunited with their parents.But the parents of 611 children have yet to be located, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).Most of the parents who were deported remain stuck in their country of origin, the ACLU has said, calling on the US government to allow them to legally return to the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-lady-jill-biden-to-help-reunite-migrant-kids-with-parents-101611979771586.html

Mexico was expecting about 1.5 million doses from Pfizer, he noted.Mexico is trying to secure as much vaccine supply as possible amid delivery delays and a surge in cases. Mexico's death toll from COVID-19 was 156,579 on Friday.Lopez Obrador, speaking publicly for the first time since revealing on Sunday he had COVID-19, said Mexico would also receive 870,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in February.Additionally, Lopez Obrador said 1.8 million vaccine doses would arrive next month through a U.N.-backed mechanism, an apparent reference to the global COVAX facility.Mexico has secured enough vaccines to cover 20% of its 126 million people through COVAX, led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization to promote equitable access.Six million doses of the CanSino Biologics vaccine, which is due to share its clinical trial results soon, should arrive in Mexico in February, Lopez Obrador said.It would also be "no problem" for Mexico to have 12 million doses of the Chinese vaccine in March, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-to-import-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-from-india-says-president-101611977490040.html

"How to prioritize the people who were enrolled not only months but years ago, and above all, people who are the most vulnerable."Jacobson said all of those waiting in Mexico under the program will have an opportunity to present claims.The protocols, in place since 2019, pushed more than 65,000 asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be in Mexico.The Biden administration stopped adding people to MPP last week, but has not outlined how it will process the claims of those already enrolled.Advocates have documented the dangers they face while waiting, including rape and murder.Jacobson said the administration would process people "in a much more rapid manner than in the past."She asked asylum seekers not to rush to the U.S. border, however, as it would not speed up the process."Please, wait," she said.The population of a makeshift camp in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, across the river from Brownsville, Texas, has been slowly swelling, migrants and aid workers say, despite attempts by Mexican authorities to control it."It's been growing because people think that if you're in the camp, you'll be able to enter (the United States) first," said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, who estimated up to 800 people, including women and children, live in the camp.He and other residents welcomed Jacobson's comments."Everything is changing for the better," said Dairon Elisondo, an asylum seeker and doctor from Cuba, who provides medical care to fellow migrants.But asylum seekers also urged the U.S. administration to act soon."If they don't do something soon, people are going to start trying to cross (illegally). People are desperate," said Yuri Gonzalez, from Cuba, who is waiting in Ciudad Juarez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-asylum-camp-swells-at-us-mexico-border-biden-aide-calls-for-patience-101611977184442.html

30-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan hospital that had early coronavirus patients||A World Health Organization team visited a hospital on Friday where China says the first COVID-19 patients were treated more than a year ago as part of the experts' long-awaited fact-finding mission on the origins of the coronavirus.The WHO team members and Chinese officials earlier had their first in-person meetings at a hotel ahead of field visits in and around the central city of Wuhan in the coming days.“First face to face meeting with our colleagues. Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions," Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans tweeted in the morning.She said they were discussing their program of visits and Chinese team leader “prof. Wannian" was joking about some technical glitches, an apparent reference to top Chinese epidemiologist Liang Wannian, who has been a leader of China’s response team.“Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy Zoom meetings,” Koopman tweeted. The visiting researchers held video meetings during 14 days of quarantine after their arrival in China. They came out of quarantine on Thursday.Members of the team left the hotel by car, and a short time later entered the gates of the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine. According to China's official account of its response to the initial outbreak, Dr. Zhang Jixian first reported cases of what was then known as “pneumonia of unknown origin" at the hospital on Dec. 27, 2019.WHO said earlier on Twitter that the team requested “detailed underlying data” and planned to speak with early responders and some of the first COVID-19 patients. It also planned to visit markets such as the Huanan Seafood Market linked to many of the first cases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and laboratories at facilities such as the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.The team's mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.“All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the COVID19 virus,” WHO tweeted.Confirmation of the origins of the virus is likely to take years. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal source typically requires exhaustive research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.A possible focus for investigators is the virology institute in the city. One of China’s top virus research labs, it built an archive of genetic information about bat coronaviruses after the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.The first clusters of COVID-19 were detected in Wuhan in late 2019. China has since reported more than 89,000 cases and 4,600 deaths, with new cases largely concentrated in its frigid northeast, where local lockdowns and travel restrictions were being imposed to contain the outbreaks.New cases of local transmission continue to fall, with just 36 announced on Friday, as far fewer Chinese than usual appear willing to travel for Lunar New Year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-visits-wuhan-hospital-that-had-early-coronavirus-patients-101611970880565.html
30-01-2021||World||Canadian Judge rejects Huawei CFO's bid to loosen bail restrictions||A Canadian judge has rejected Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's bid to loosen her bail conditions, state broadcaster CBC reported on Friday.The Huawei executive, who is under house arrest in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings, has sought the right to move around the area unescorted. The 48-year old, who is fitted with an ankle bracelet, is currently free to travel in the region if accompanied by security guards.British Columbia Supreme Court Justice William Ehrcke said the conditions imposed on Meng after her arrest in 2018 are necessary to ensure she remains in Canada throughout the legal proceedings, the report said.Meng's lawyers argued that she has been cooperative during her two years of detention and noted that the guards pose a threat of transmitting COVID-19 to Meng. However, Ehrcke ruled that the Huawei executive's few ties to Canada and access to significant resources makes her a flight risk, according to the report.Meng is wanted by the US authorities for her alleged role in violating sanctions against Iran. The US Justice Department alleges that Meng committed financial transgressions by misleading multinational financial conglomerate, HSBC, into approving more than USD 100 million in transactions that contravened US sanctions on Iran from 2010 to 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-judge-rejects-huawei-cfo-s-bid-to-loosen-bail-restrictions-101611970513779.html
30-01-2021||World||Appeals court allows US to expel children alone at border||A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that the US government could resume expelling immigrant children who cross the southern border unaccompanied by a parent.The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's stay of a lower court ruling allows President Joe Biden's administration to resume expulsions begun by former President Donald Trump under a public health policy citing the COVID-19 pandemic.The appeals court issued a stay that had been requested by the Trump administration in November shortly after a federal judge barred the practice.All three judges on the panel that issued Friday's order were nominated by Trump, who enacted newly restrictive measures on immigration throughout his presidency. The judges are Gregory Katsas, Neomi Rao and Justin Walker.Trump's Republican administration instituted expulsions early in the pandemic, saying it had to restrict border crossings to prevent the spread of the virus, though public health officials later said they were told to issue an order allowing the expulsions by former Vice President Mike Pence.Border agents conducted more than 180,000 expulsions in just the last three months of 2020.Immigration agencies have continued expelling most border crossers — adults as well as parents and children together — in Biden's first days.The Democrat has signaled he will roll back other Trump administration policies restricting immigration, but his advisers have also said they are concerned about allowing all migrants to cross the border immediately.It's unclear whether Biden will implement expulsions of unaccompanied children now.At least 8,800 children were known to have been expelled prior to the federal court order.They included children as young as 9 who were denied the chance to request asylum or other protections under US law.Many children, including some babies with their parents, were detained in hotels in border states before being placed on deportation flights before another judge barred that practice.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment, nor did the U.S. Department of Justice.American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt called the appeals court's ruling a “temporary setback.”"We will continue to litigate this case on behalf of these vulnerable unaccompanied children, who are in need of protection and legally entitled to apply for asylum,” Gelernt said in a statement.“But we hope the Biden administration will not make ongoing litigation necessary by rescinding this illegal policy created by the Trump administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/appeals-court-allows-us-to-expel-children-alone-at-border-101611969436381.html
30-01-2021||World||Fauci sees Covid-19 vaccination for kids by late spring or the summer||The government's top infectious disease expert said Friday he hopes to see some kids starting to get vaccinated for COVID-19 in the next few months. It's a needed step to securing widespread immunity to the virus.Vaccines are not yet approved for children, but testing already is underway for those as young as 12.If those trials are successful, Dr. Anthony Fauci said they would be followed by another round of testing down to those 9 years old.“Hopefully by the time we get to the late spring and early summer we will have children being able to be vaccinated,” Fauci said at a White House coronavirus briefing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageFauci was looking ahead to a time vaccines will be plentiful. Even older adults are having difficulty getting shots at the moment. As of Thursday, only about 1.3% of Americans had been fully vaccinated with the required two doses of the currently available vaccines.Children represent about one-fourth of the population, and for the U.S. to reach “herd immunity," or widespread resistance, about 70% to 85% of the population must be vaccinated.“Children tend to not become as severely ill as adults but they can still become ill and some have tragically died,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency room physician, who supports Fauci's goal. “Children can also be vectors of transmission, and getting children vaccinated is important as we strive for herd immunity.”The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has emergency approval for use in people 16 and older. Moderna's vaccine is for those 18 and older.Pfizer's clinical trial for children 12 to 15 is fully enrolled, and the drugmaker could seek emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for children 12 and up sometime in the first half of this year. Moderna’s trial for ages 12-17 is still recruiting.Since the initial tests to validate the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involved tens of thousands of people, the age-related testing on children can be done using smaller groups.“You don’t want to have to ... go through an efficacy trial, where you’re involving tens of thousands of children," Fauci explained. “What you can do, is in a much smaller trial, measured in hundreds to a couple of thousands ... what we call safety and ... immunogenicity.” That's a term for whether the vaccine successfully triggers an immune system response.After a frustratingly slow start, the U.S. is now administering about 1 million shots a day to adults, although that pace is still seen as insufficient. President Joe Biden has talked about 1.5 million shots a day, if it can be done. His administration has set a goal of 100 million shots in its first 100 days.Two more vaccines from American companies are nearing the stage where the FDA can evaluate them for approval. One from Johnson & Johnson requires only a single shot.Biden has also set a goal of reopening most schools by the summer, and directed government agencies to work with communities to advance it.His American Rescue Plan legislation in Congress calls for $50 billion to finance a major expansion of testing, which is seen as necessary for the safe reopening of schools and businesses. That's because robust testing can detect early outbreaks before they spread through a community and trigger shutdowns. Testing in the U.S. had a chaotic start, and experts say in many parts of the country it's still subpar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-sees-covid-19-vaccination-for-kids-by-late-spring-or-the-summer-101611967209226.html

Demers of the National Security Division. "What China cannot develop itself, it acquires illegally through others. This is yet another example of a proxy acting to further China's malign interests."Alan E. Kohler, Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division said, "The People's Republic of China is relentless in its pursuit of U.S. technology, much of which can be used for military purposes.""The FBI is just as relentless in identifying and stopping those who violate export controls while doing business with China. Let us be clear, this is not business as usual.

Blinken spoke today with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Qureshi discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement.During the phone call, Secretary Blinken reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners."In addition, the Secretary and the Foreign Minister discussed the importance of continued US-Pakistan cooperation on the Afghan peace process, support for regional stability, and the potential to expand our trade and commercial ties," Ned Price added.This statement comes a day after Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered the release of the Omar Sheikh convicted in 2002 of orchestrating the abduction and killing of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.Interestingly, the State Department readout on the talks between Blinken and Qureshi differed with that of the release put out by the Pakistan Foreign Office (PFO). While Washington focused on Daniel Pearl's murder case, Islamabad focused on the comprehensive partnership with the US."The Foreign Minister congratulated Secretary Blinken on assuming his office. He underscored Pakistan's commitment to forge a comprehensive partnership with the United States based on the convergence of interests on a whole range of issues," the PFO said in a statement."In the context of recent developments in the Daniel Pearl case, the Foreign Minister underscored that it was important and in the mutual interest that justice is served through legal means. The Foreign Minister highlighted the steps being taken in this regard," the statement added.The Pakistani foreign office further said Foreign Minister Qureshi and Secretary Blinken agreed to remain engaged and work together on advancing the two countries' bilateral agenda and promoting common interests in the region and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-secy-speaks-with-pak-counterpart-discusses-daniel-pearl-murder-case-101611966686649.html
