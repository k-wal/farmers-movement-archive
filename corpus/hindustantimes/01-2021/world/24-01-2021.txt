As on January 24, the latest rate was roughly 3.21 million doses per day, on average.In the US, the country that has been on top of the Covid chart for quite some time now, the inoculation drive began on December 14 last year and as many as 21.1 million shots of vaccines have been given. An average of 1.06 million doses per day were administered last week, the agency data states.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMeanwhile, according to data from John Hopkins, the country crossed 25 million Covid-19 cases on Sunday. The milestone was reached only five days after the US recorded 400,000 deaths from the disease.India, on the other hand, has immunised over 16 lakh people since the nationwide vaccination drive began on January 16. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the world’s biggest vaccination drive and said that 30 million health care and frontline workers would be immunized in the first phase. On the ninth day of the country's vaccination programme, 31,466 healthcare workers were inoculated till 7.30pm.As per an official release, 907 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Haryana, 2,472 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Karnataka, 1,007 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Punjab, 24,586 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Rajasthan and 2,494 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Tamil Nadu."The cumulative number of healthcare workers vaccinated against Covid-19 has crossed 16 lakh (16,13,667) (till 7.30 pm on Sunday) through 28,613 sessions, as per the provisional report. Final reports would be completed for the day by late tonight," the Union health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-tracker-how-many-are-inoculated-in-india-and-the-world-101611510452388.html
24-01-2021||World||Egypt says it has launched vaccination against coronavirus||Egypt on Sunday launched a vaccination campaign against the coronavirus, with the first shots of Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm’s vaccine given to healthcare workers in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.Health Minister Hala Zayed told a televised news conference that they would prioritize vaccinating healthcare workers in 40 hospitals that are designated to isolate and treat Covid-19 patients across the country.Next, they would vaccinate elders and those suffer from chronic diseases, Zayed said. She did not offer a timeframe for vaccinating the whole population.Zayed said people would receive two doses of the vaccine over 21 days. The Chinese-made vaccine is 86% effective, she added.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a dead virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to polio immunizations.The vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration.Egypt has also negotiated for two other vaccines — one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and another from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said last month that the government has contracted to purchase 20 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, has reported more than 161,140 confirmed cases, including 8,902 deaths. However, the actual numbers of Covid-19 cases, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be far higher, in part due to limited testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-says-it-has-launched-vaccination-against-coronavirus-101611499639465.html

24-01-2021||World||EU will vow to work against fossil-fuel investments globally||The European Union plans to use its diplomatic and economic muscle to accelerate global energy transition away from fossil fuels, as the bloc aligns its foreign and security policy with its ambitious climate objectives.“EU energy diplomacy will discourage all further investments into fossil fuel based energy infrastructure projects in third countries, unless they are fully consistent with an ambitious, clearly defined pathway towards climate neutrality,” foreign ministers are poised to say in a joint communique on Monday. “The EU will ensure that its trade policy and its trade agreements are consistent with its climate ambition,” ministers will declare, according to a draft of their statement obtained by Bloomberg.EU leaders committed last month to cut the bloc’s 2030 greenhouse emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, and affirmed their pledge to turn Europe into the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Alarmed that the bloc’s ever stricter environmental regulations will simply force polluting activities to relocate elsewhere in the world, they are eager to eliminate “carbon leakage” by forcing the rest of the globe to fall in line with the Paris Agreement against climate change.Taxing PollutionThe EU’s executive arm is drafting a law, to be unveiled by June, that would start penalizing imports of certain goods from countries with weak pollution rules, thereby helping to protect the competitiveness of local producers abiding by stricter standards. This push to export climate standards got a boost last week when President Joe Biden moved to restore the U.S. as a member of the Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius through steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.The Biden administration is planning to host world leaders in a climate summit on Earth Day in April, a sign of the new president’s commitment to strengthen the Paris agreements. Biden, who has signaled he wants the U.S. to encourage stronger climate action globally, will likely find the EU as a major ally in his initiatives.“EU and member states’ foreign and security policy will systematically consider climate and environmental factors and risks,” the bloc’s foreign ministers will promise, according to the draft of their statement, which is still subject to changes when they meet in Brussels to discuss the wording on Monday. The transition to clean energy is highlighted as a security consideration, as it will reduce the EU’s “strategic dependencies” on imports from other countries.The pledges are the latest in a series of policy initiatives comprising the so-called European Green Deal, a comprehensive package of measures that will push every sector of the region’s economy toward low and eventually zero greenhouse emissions. Officials in Brussels hope the sweeping overhauls will also help the bloc assert its “strategic autonomy,” which is constrained by the dollar’s dominance in international finance.The European Commission is already on course to become the world’s largest issuer of green and social debt, which will be jointly backed by all EU member states. Brussels expects the issuance will turn the EU into a “global ‘green finance’ hub, bolstering the euro as the default currency for the denomination of sustainable financial products,” according to a policy document unveiled last week.Adding to signs that weaning off dollar dependence has turned into a central policy objective, ministers on Monday will pledge to promote “the use of the euro in energy trading,” according to the draft of their statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-will-vow-to-work-against-fossil-fuel-investments-globally-101611508204887.html

We are fully supporting the authorities," an Airbus spokesman said.On Saturday, health authorities put Berlin's Humboldt hospital under quarantine after 20 patients and staff tested positive for the more infectious variant.The quarantine covered about 1,500 doctors, nurses and technicians working at the hospital as well as more than 400 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-500-airbus-staff-under-quarantine-after-hamburg-covid-19-outbreak-101611507754507.html
24-01-2021||World||US to boost surveillance of Covid-19 virus variant: CDC chief Rochelle Walensky||The US government, including the Pentagon, is stepping up surveillance of coronavirus variants to monitor their impact on Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, the new head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.“We are now scaling up both our surveillance of these and our study of these,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on “Fox News Sunday.” The agency is working with others, including the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration, to monitor the variants, she said.Vivek Murthy, President Joe Biden’s nominee for surgeon general, said achieving broad immunity against the coronavirus by the start of the school year in September is “an ambitious goal,” and that new strains of the disease will require continued masking, social distancing and better government tracking.“It is going to take a lot of work,” Murthy said on ABC’s “This Week.” Many schools don’t have resources to reopen just now, he said. “I do think we can get on a path toward opening schools more safely.”In Chicago, teachers due to return to the classroom were voting this weekend on a resolution to work only remotely, setting the stage for a possible strike in the third-largest U.S. school district.Murthy said reopening schools will also require that the numbers of Covid cases fall, which in turn depends on focusing on the Biden’s administration’s goal of 100 million vaccines delivered in the first 100 days in the office.“That is a floor, it is not a ceiling,” he said. “It is also a goal that reflects the realities of what we face.”Murthy said variant strains of the virus that are starting to show up “are likely to be more transmissible.”“We still need more data” on deaths, he said, adding the larger lesson is that “the virus is basically telling us it is going to continue to change and we got to be ready for it.”That plan requires better genomic surveillance, he said, and doubling down on masking and social distancing.“We’ve got to invest a lot more in testing and in contact tracing,” he said. “We are in a race against these variants, the virus is going to change, and it is up to us to adapt and make sure that we are staying ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-boost-surveillance-of-covid-19-virus-variant-cdc-chief-rochelle-walensky-101611507412206.html
24-01-2021||World||US passes 25 million Covid-19 cases: Johns Hopkins University||More than 25 million Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the United States since the pandemic began, Johns Hopkins University said Sunday, just days after President Joe Biden's inauguration.The milestone was reached only five days after the US, the world's wealthiest and hardest-hit nation, recorded 400,000 deaths from the disease.Biden has made fighting the coronavirus a priority and is pushing for Congress to approve a $1.9-trillion relief package that would include billions of dollars to boost vaccination rates.Biden has said he wants 100 million people vaccinated within his first 100 days in office, and he has called for Americans to wear masks for 100 days.Countries around the world are in a race against time to get their populations inoculated before the coronavirus mutates into a strain that could resist newly approved vaccinations.Vivek Murthy, Biden's nominee for surgeon-general, told ABC News on Sunday that 100 million doses in 100 days was "a floor, not a ceiling" and cautioned about new strains."The variants are very concerning," Murthy told the network."It's up to us to adapt and stay ahead," he added.White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said Biden's administration would "take responsibility" for the trajectory. Former president Donald Trump came under frequent criticism for perceived federal inaction in combating the virus."We're going to set up these federal vaccination centers to make sure that in states that don't have enough ... we fill those gaps," Klain told the NBC News show "Meet the Press.""We need more vaccine, we need more vaccinators and we need more vaccine sites."The US caseload remains by far the world's highest in absolute terms.India, where the population is about four times larger than in the US, has the second-highest caseload with about 10.6 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins.After the first Covid-19 case was reported in the US in January 2020 it took until late April for the figure to pass one million. The overall number of cases has followed an almost exponential curve upwards since then.Xavier Becerra, Biden's secretary of health and human services nominee, likened the Covid-19 trajectory under Trump to a plane about to crash."We've got to pull it up and you aren't going to do that overnight, but we'll pull it up -- we have to pull it up," he told CNN."Failure is not an option here."Last week, Johns Hopkins announced more than 400,000 people in the US had died from Covid-19, a grim marker that came one day before Biden's inauguration.The US has now recorded 25,003,695 million cases, according to the Baltimore-based university's coronavirus tracking website -- though with testing shaky at the start of the pandemic, the real toll is believed to be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-25-million-covid-19-cases-johns-hopkins-university-101611506508275.html

The EU should therefore cut financial transactions from Putin's inner circle, he added.In addition, a threat to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is meant to double natural gas deliveries from Russia to Germany, must remain on the table, Weber added.A German government spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether Berlin was willing to support new sanctions against Russia following Navalny's arrest.EU lawmakers passed a resolution on Thursday calling for the bloc to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a response to Navalny's arrest.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has continued to back the project despite criticism elsewhere in the EU, said on Thursday her view of the project had not changed despite the Navalny case.The United States, EU and Britain have all condemned the Russian security forces' handling of Saturday's protests, and the foreign ministers of France and Italy on Sunday both expressed support for sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-should-punish-putin-for-navalny-arrest-by-cutting-money-flows-german-leader-101611503560234.html

In an interview aired on CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’, Dr Deborah Birx told moderator Margaret Brennan that someone was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the former president.“I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made...I know that someone out there or someone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president,” she said.Birx admitted that she could have been more outspoken publicly, adding that she didn’t know “all the consequences of all of these issues.” The American physician said that every time a political leader made a statement that wasn’t consistent with the needs of public health, it impacted the Covid-19 response. She opined that communication is “absolute key” in containing a pandemic, especially when the administration is relying on Americans to change their behaviour.“When you are put into a new situation, you only know one person in the White House and you don't understand the culture of the White House...I didn't know how far I could push the envelope," said Birx, adding that she wished she had pushed harder on testing.Read | Trump virus coordinator Deborah Birx seeks role in Biden governmentAccording to a recently updated US department of state website, Birx retired last Wednesday. Notably, Birx was present during a press conference in April 2020 when Trump had wondered whether injecting disinfectant inside people could be a treatment against Covid-19. “I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it (the virus) out in a minute, and is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. It gets in the lungs,” Trump had suggested.The news briefing was followed by a surge in hotline calls in the state of Maryland, seeking guidance on Trump’s comments. Trump later asserted that it was a sarcastic comment and should not have been taken seriously by anyone. “It was asking a sarcastic and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parallel-set-of-data-dr-birx-says-trump-presented-graphs-that-she-never-made-101611502564137.html

Kaja Kallas took the reins at the Reform Party in 2018 as its first female chair.The government formation marks the second such attempt for Kallas in less than two years as she failed to bring about a Reform Party-led government after the 2019 election. That paved the way for the archrival Center Party and its leader, Juri Ratas, to form a three-party coalition without the Reform Party.Ratas and his Cabinet resigned on Jan. 13 over a scandal involving a key official at his Center Party suspected of accepting a private donation for the party in exchange for a political favor on a real estate development at the harbor district of the capital, Tallinn.Estonia’s prime minister since November 2016, Ratas won't be part of the new Cabinet. Local media reported earlier that he could become the parliamentary speaker in March.Estonia has been a member of the European Union and NATO since 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kaja-kallas-to-become-first-woman-prime-minister-of-estonia-101611503008108.html
24-01-2021||World||Russia says US comments supporting pro-Navalny protests encourages law-breaking||The spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin says the US Embassy's statements about the nationwide protests, in which more than 3,500 people reportedly were arrested, interfere in the country's domestic affairs and encourage Russians to break the law.Dmitry Peskov made the criticism on Sunday, a day after protests took place across the country demanding the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist who is Putin's most well-known critic.During the protests, embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said on Twitter that “the US supports the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression.Steps being taken by Russian authorities are suppressing those rights.” The embassy also tweeted a State Department statement calling for Navalny's release.Peskov said the statements “indirectly constitute absolute interference in our internal affairs” and are “direct support for the violation of the law of the Russian Federation, support for unauthorised actions.”The protests attracted thousands of people in Russia's major cities, including an estimated 15,000 in Moscow, and demonstrations occurred in scores of other cities. Peskov, however, dismissed the turnout as insignificant.“Now many will say that many people came out for the illegal actions. No, few people came out; many people vote for Putin,” he said.The 44-year-old Navalny, Putin's most prominent and persistent foe, was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where had been recovering from severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and that Russian authorities deny.Authorities said his five-month stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence that was imposed in a 2014 fraud and money-laundering conviction, which he says is fraudulent and politically motivated.He is to appear in court on February 2 for a hearing on whether the suspended sentence will be converted to 3 1/2 years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-us-comments-supporting-pro-navalny-protests-encourages-lawbreaking-101611502722021.html

Neither Perry nor Clark, who served as head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division before becoming the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division in September, could immediately be reached for comment.In a statement to the New York Times, Clark declined comment on his relationship with Perry, and denied trying to oust Rosen, saying he had participated in "a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president."On Saturday, the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson saying it was launching a congressional probe into Trump and Clark's actions, and asked for the department to turn over documents and communications to help assist their inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-congressman-played-a-role-in-trump-s-campaign-to-fight-election-loss-101611498859662.html

24-01-2021||World||US reaffirms Taiwan support after China sends warplanes||The US has reaffirmed its support for Taiwan following China’s dispatch of warplanes near the island in an apparent attempt to intimidate its democratic government and test the resolve of the new American presidential administration.The US State Department on Saturday said it was concerned by China's "pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbors, including Taiwan.”“We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives," Ned Price, a spokesman for the department, said in the statement.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said China on Saturday sent eight bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons and four fighter jets into its air defense identification zone just southwest of the island. The ministry said China on Sunday sent another 16 military aircraft of various types into the same area.The ministry said Taiwan responded by scrambling fighters, broadcasting warnings by radio and “deploying air defense missile systems to monitor the activity.”There was no immediate Chinese comment on Sunday.The overflights were part of a long-standing pattern of incursions aimed at pressuring the government of President Tsai Ing-wen into caving to Beijing’s demand that she recognize Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory.They come on the heels of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, emphasizing the island's enduring position in the panoply of divisive issues between the sides that also include human rights, trade disputes and, most recently, questions about China's initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.Biden's administration has shown little sign of reducing pressure on China over such issues, although it is seen as favoring a return to more civil dialogue.The State Department statement on Saturday said Washington will continue to deepen ties with Taiwan and ensure its defense from Chinese threats, while supporting a peaceful resolution of issues between the sides.In another sign of support for Taiwan, the island's de-facto ambassador to Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, was an invited guest at Biden's inauguration.And in a final swipe at China, the Trump administration’s outgoing UN ambassador tweeted that it’s time for the world to oppose China’s efforts to exclude and isolate Taiwan, drawing sharp criticism from Beijing.Ambassador Kelly Craft accompanied the tweet with a photo of herself in the UN General Assembly Hall where the island is banned. She carried a handbag with a stuffed Taiwan bear sticking out of the top, a gift from Taiwan’s representative in New York, Ambassador James Lee.Taiwan and China separated amid civil war in 1949 and China says it is determined to bring the island under its control by force if necessary. The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, but is legally required to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and the self-governing democratic island enjoys strong bipartisan support in Washington.Tsai has sought to bolster the island’s defenses with the purchase of billions of dollars in US weapons, including upgraded F-16 fighter jets, armed drones, rocket systems and Harpoon missiles capable of hitting both ships and land targets. She has also boosted support for Taiwan's indigenous arms industry, including launching a program to build new submarines to counter China’s ever-growing naval capabilities.China’s increased threats come as economic and political enticements bear little fruit, leading it to stage war games and dispatch fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on an almost daily basis toward the island of 24 million people, which lies 160 kilometers (100 miles) off China’s southeast coast across the Taiwan Strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reaffirms-taiwan-support-after-china-sends-warplanes-101611497505182.html

"We ousted Oli from the post of Chairman of the ruling NCP. Now, we will take disciplinary actions against him as he is not fit to remain a member of the Communist Party and we have ordered him to provide clarifications.

During the struggle, one crew member aboard died. It identified the victim as engineer Farman Ismayilov of Azerbaijan, the only non-Turkish crew member.After kidnapping most of the crew, the pirates left the ship in the Gulf of Guinea with three sailors aboard, state-run Anadolu news agency said. According to reports, the pirates disabled most of the ship’s systems, leaving only the navigation system for the remaining crew to find their way to Gabon's Port-Gentil.The Gulf of Guinea, off the coasts of Nigeria, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Cameroon, is the most dangerous sea in the world for piracy, according to the International Maritime Bureau.Maritime security consultancy Dryad Global described the attack as “an exceptional incident for both its severity and distance from shore.” Last year, boardings in the waters off West Africa rose to 18 from 13 in 2019, the London-based firm added.Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said he had spoken to the senior officer remaining on the Mozart, Furkan Yaren, and that the morale and physical condition of the sailors aboard was good.“We are continuing coordinated negotiations for the release” of the abducted sailors, he said. “The pirates have yet to make any response.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has twice spoken to Yaren, his office said in a tweet. It added that Erdogan issued orders for the recovery of the kidnapped crew.“The owners and operators of the M/V Mozart, which was hijacked at gunpoint in the Gulf of Guinea, have regretfully confirmed that one of its crew has been killed and others abducted,” Istanbul-based Boden Maritime said.Among the captives is the ship’s captain, Mustafa Kaya, 41. His brother Seyit, of Istanbul, said the sailors’ families had been called by Erdogan.“We hope we see them free, unharmed soon,” he said. “Everybody is trying. We pray for our brothers.”In July 2019, 10 Turkish seamen were kidnapped off the coast of Nigeria. They were released less than a month later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-pirates-attack-turkish-ship-off-west-africa-kill-1-kidnap-15-101611495329234.html

But he appeared in the Apostolic Palace library to give his blessing and offer remarks about the Gospel and about the plight of those with no home.Edwin's case “gets added to those of so many other homeless people, recently deceased in Rome in the same dramatic circumstances,” Francis said. “Let's pray for Edwin.”Francis often uses his papacy to try to draw attention to the problems of those living on life's margins, including newly arrived migrants and homeless persons. His official alms-giver at times has distributed sleeping bags to those living in the streets near Vatican City.It is the second time in recent weeks that Francis has been hobbled by what the Vatican has said is sciatica pain, forcing him to skip events. The latest bout is causing him to postpone his annual start-of-the year speech to diplomats accredited to the Holy See, which had been set for Monday. Later that same day, Francis was to be driven to a Rome basilica to pray with other Christian leaders, but the event will go forward without him.The same painful condition saw him skip New Year's Day Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.So far, still on tap is a six-day pilgrimage to Iraq in early March, travel that Francis is hoping to carry out despite the pandemic and violence plaguing that country, including a suicide attack last week that killed 32 people in Baghdad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ailing-pope-reducing-appearances-prays-for-homeless-dead-101611496097696.html

It is one of the largest covered green areas in Pakistan.Citing reports, Dawn highlighted that this decision has been taken due to the financial issues being faced by the government.This comes amid declining relations of Pakistan with its two biggest sources of foreign remittances and foreign exchange -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Last August, Saudi Arabia asked Pakistan to repay early a USD 3 billion soft loan, Islamabad tried to defuse the tensions by quickly dispatching its current army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.However, Saudi Arabia did not budge from its demand.The UAE, which is Pakistan's second-largest source of foreign remittances, has recently banned issuing work visas for Pakistani workers.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's recent visit to the UAE failed to lift the ban, to Islamabad's severe disappointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-ailing-economy-imran-khan-to-mortgage-islamabad-s-biggest-park-to-get-loan-101611494190729.html
24-01-2021||World||US police weigh officer discipline after rally, Capitol riot||For two Virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the deadly US Capitol insurrection, the reckoning has been swift and public: They were identified, charged with crimes and arrested.But for five Seattle officers the outcome is less clear. Their identities still secret, two are on leave and three continue to work while a police watchdog investigates whether their actions in the nation's capital on Jan. 6 crossed the line from protected political speech to lawbreaking.cOfficials and experts agree that officers who were involved in the melee should be fired and charged for their role.But what about those officers who attended only the Trump rally before the riot? How does a department balance an officer's free speech rights with the blow to public trust that comes from the attendance of law enforcement at an event with far-right militants and white nationalists who went on to assault the seat of American democracy?An Associated Press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the District of Columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot. Officials are looking into whether the officers violated any laws or policies or participated in the violence while in Washington. A Capitol Police officer died after he was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher as rioters descended on the building and many other officers were injured. A woman was shot to death by Capitol Police and three other people died after medical emergencies during the chaos.Most of the officers have not been publicly identified; only a few have been charged. Some were identified by online sleuths. Others were reported by their colleagues or turned themselves in.They come from some of the country’s largest cities — three Los Angeles officers and a sheriff’s deputy, for instance — as well as state agencies and a Pennsylvania police department with nine officers. Among them are an Oklahoma sheriff and New Hampshire police chief who have acknowledged being at the rally, but denied entering the Capitol or breaking the law.“If they were off-duty, it’s totally free speech,” said Will Aitchison, a lawyer in Portland, Oregon, who represents law enforcement officers. “People have the right to express their political views regardless of who’s standing next to them. You just don’t get guilt by association.”But Ayesha Bell Hardaway, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, said an officer’s presence at the rally creates a credibility issue as law enforcement agencies work to repair community trust, especially after last summer's of protests against police brutality sparked by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.Communities will question the integrity of officers who attended the rally along with “individuals who proudly profess racist and divisive viewpoints,” she said. “It calls into question whether those officers are interested in engaging in policing in a way that builds trust and legitimacy in all communities, including communities of color.”In Rocky Mount, a Virginia town of about 1,000, Sgt. Thomas Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker were suspended without pay and face criminal charges after posting a photo of themselves inside the Capitol during the riot. According to court records, Robertson wrote on social media that the “Left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem … The right IN ONE DAY took the f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.”Attempts to contact the pair were unsuccessful and court records do not list lawyers. Leaders in Rocky Mount declined to be interviewed. In a statement, they said the events at the Capitol were tragic.“We stand with and add our support to those who have denounced the violence and illegal activity that took place that day,” said Police Chief Ken Criner, Capt. Mark Lovern and Town Manager James Ervin. “Our town and our police department absolutely does not condone illegal or unethical behavior by anyone, including our officers and staff.”On the other side of the county, five Seattle officers are under investigation by the city’s Office of Police Accountability. Two officers posted photos of themselves on social media while in the district and officials are investigating to determine where they were and what they were doing. Three others told supervisors that they went to Washington for the events and are being investigated for what they did while there.Seattle Police Chief Adrian Diaz said his department supports officers’ freedom of speech and that those who were in the nation's capital will be fired if they “were directly involved in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”But police leaders need to evaluate more than just clear criminal behavior, according to Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing research and policy group. They must also consider how their actions affect the department credibility, he said.Officers' First Amendment rights “don’t extend to expressing words that may be violent or maybe express some prejudice,” Wexler said, “because that’s going to reflect on what they do when they’re working, when they’re testifying in court.”Through the summer and fall, Seattle police — along with officers elsewhere — came under criticism for their handling of mass protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd. The city received more than 19,000 complaints against officers, most for excessive use of force and improper use of pepper spray.Andrew Myerberg, director of the Seattle Office of Police Accountability, said none of the officers now under investigation were involved in those cases.But Sakara Remmu, cofounder of Black Lives Matter Seattle/King County, said the officers should be fired regardless. Their public declarations of solidarity with Trump fosters not just community distrust, but terror of the entire department, she said.“It absolutely does matter when the decorum of racial peace cracks and racial hatred comes through, because we already have a documented history and legacy of what that means in this country,” Remmu said.In Houston, the police chief decried an officer who resigned and was later charged in the riot. A lawyer for Officer Tam Pham said the 18-year veteran of the force "very much regrets” being at the rally and was “deeply remorseful.”But many chiefs have said their officers committed no crimes.“The Arkansas State Police respects the rights and freedom of an employee to use their leave time as the employee may choose,” department spokesman Bill Sadler said of two officers who attended the Trump rally.Malik Aziz, the former chair and executive director of the National Black Police Association, compared condemning all officers who were in Washington to tarring all the protesters who took to streets after the killing of George Floyd with the violent and destructive acts of some.A major with the Dallas Police Department, Aziz said police acting privately have the same rights as other Americans, but that knowingly going to a bigoted event should be disqualifying for an officer.“There’s no place in law enforcement for that individual,” Aziz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-weigh-officer-discipline-after-rally-capitol-riot-101611494465920.html
24-01-2021||World||Why Joe Biden's immigration plan may be risky for Democrats||President Joe Biden is confronting the political risk that comes with grand ambition.As one of his first acts, Biden offered a sweeping immigration overhaul last week that would provide a path to US citizenship for the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. It would also codify provisions wiping out some of President Donald Trump's signature hard-line policies, including trying to end existing, protected legal status for many immigrants brought to the US as children and crackdowns on asylum rules.It's precisely the type of measure that many Latino activists have longed for, particularly after the tough approach of the Trump era. But it must compete with Biden's other marquee legislative goals, including a $1.9 trillion plan to combat the coronavirus, an infrastructure package that promotes green energy initiatives and a “public option” to expand health insurance.In the best of circumstances, enacting such a broad range of legislation would be difficult. But in a narrowly divided Congress, it could be impossible. And that has Latinos, the nation's fastest growing voting bloc, worried that Biden and congressional leaders could cut deals that weaken the finished product too much — or fail to pass anything at all.“This cannot be a situation where simply a visionary bill — a message bill — gets sent to Congress and nothing happens with it,” said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for low-income immigrants. “There’s an expectation that they will deliver and that there is a mandate now for Biden to be unapologetically pro-immigrant and have a political imperative to do so, and the Democrats do as well.”If Latinos ultimately feel betrayed, the political consequences for Democrats could be long-lasting. The 2020 election provided several warning signs that, despite Democratic efforts to build a multiracial coalition, Latino support could be at risk.Biden already was viewed skeptically by some Latino activists for his association with former President Barack Obama, who was called the “deporter in chief” for the record number of immigrants who were removed from the country during his administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Biden in last year's Nevada caucuses and California primary, which served as early barometers of the Latino vote.In his race against Trump, Biden won the support of 63% of Latino voters compared with Trump's 35%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. But Trump narrowed the margin somewhat in some swing states such as Nevada and also got a bump from Latino men, 39% of whom backed him compared with 33% of Latino women.Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1996 to carry Arizona, in part because of strong grassroots backing from Mexican American groups opposed to strict GOP immigration policies going back decades. But he lost Florida by underperforming in its largest Hispanic county, Miami-Dade, where the Trump campaign's anti-socialism message resonated with Cuban- and some Venezuelan Americans.Biden also fell short in Texas even though running mate Kamala Harris devoted valuable, late campaign time there. The ticket lost some sparsely populated but heavily Mexican American counties along the Mexican border, where law enforcement agencies are major employers and the GOP's zero-tolerance immigration policy resonated.There were more warning signs for House Democrats, who lost four California seats and two in South Florida while failing to pick up any in Texas. Booming Hispanic populations reflected in new US census figures may see Texas and Florida gain congressional districts before 2022's midterm elections, which could make correcting the problem all the more pressing for Democrats.The urgency isn't lost on Biden. He privately spent months telling immigration advocates that major overhauls would be at the top of his to-do list. As vice president, he watched while the Obama administration used larger congressional majorities to speed passage of a financial crisis stimulus bill and its signature health care law while letting an immigration overhaul languish.“It means so much to us to have a new president propose bold, visionary immigration reform on Day 1. Not Day 2. Not Day 3. Not a year later,” said New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, his chamber's lead sponsor of the Biden package.Menendez was part of a bipartisan immigration plan championed by the “Gang of Eight” senators that collapsed in 2013. Obama then resorted to executive action to offer legal status to millions of young immigrants. President George W. Bush also pushed an immigration package — with an eye toward boosting Latino support for Republicans before the 2008 election — only to see it fail in Congress.Menendez acknowledged that the latest bill will have to find at least 10 Republican senators' support to clear the 60-vote hurdle to reach the floor, and that he's “under no illusions" how difficult that will be.Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida, said Biden may find some GOP support but probably will have to settle for far less than what’s in his original proposal.“Many Republicans are worried about primary challenges,” Curbelo said, adding that Trump and his supporters’ championing of immigration crackdowns means there's “political peril there for Republicans.”But he also said Democrats could alienate some of their own base by appearing to prioritize the needs of people in the country illegally over those of struggling US citizens and thus “appearing to overreach from the perspective of swing and independent voters.”Indeed, Democrats haven't always universally lined up behind an immigration overhaul, arguing that it could lead to an influx of cheap labor that hurts US workers. Some of the party's senators joined Republicans in sinking Bush's bill.Still, Latinos haven't forgotten past immigration failures and have often to blamed Democrats more than Republicans.Chuck Roca, head of Nuestro PAC, which spent $4 million on ads boosting Biden ads in Arizona, said that while Hispanics have traditionally tended to support Democrats, he has begun to see trends in the past decade where more are registering as independent or without party affiliation. Those voters can still be won back, he said, but only if Latinos see real change on major issues such as immigration “even if it's piecemeal.”“They have to get something done if they want to start to turn around the loss of Latino voters,” said Rocha, who headed Latino voter outreach for Sanders’ presidential campaign. “They have to do everything in their power now to get Latinos back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-joe-biden-s-immigration-plan-may-be-risky-for-democrats-101611492419271.html

But at the same time, a dialogue is a possibility to find some rational kernels, the little parts where our relations are getting closer," he said."And if the current US administration is ready for such an approach, I have no doubts that our president will respond in kind."Putin was one of the last global leaders to congratulate Joe Biden on his victory in the US presidential election after the Nov. 3 vote.One of the burning issues to be resolved by the two nuclear powers is the arms control treaty, known as New START, which is due to expire on Feb. 5.The White House said last week that Biden would seek a five-year extension to the deal, while the Kremlin requested concrete proposals from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ready-for-talks-with-new-joe-biden-administration-if-us-is-willing-101611492788030.html

The United Kingdom has been witnessing a surge in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after different imported variants of coronavirus were detected in the country. Hancock said that Britain has detected 77 cases of the South African variant and nine cases of a Brazilian variant.“There is early evidence that the lockdown is starting to bring cases down. But we're a long, long, long way from that from being low enough because the case rate was incredibly high and you can see the pressure on the NHS. You can see it every day,” the health minister told Sky News.The virus variants have triggered concerns among the health experts and scientific community at a time when the government is trying to contain the pandemic through vaccination. The UK has been reporting over 1,000 Covid-19 related deaths for the last five days. The country has recorded the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe with more than 97,000 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center.Watch | 'New UK variant of coronavirus may be more deadly': Boris JohnsonOxford professor Anthony Harnden, who serves as deputy chair of a scientific committee on vaccination, told Sky News that the new variants are a “real worry” because Covid-19 vaccines may not be effective against them. “The South African and the Brazilian Amazonian ones, there are hints that there will be vaccine escape," he warned.Though there have been speculations around a possible blanket ban on inbound travellers amid fears of new virus variants, Hancock said that the government will stick to a “precautionary principle”. The health secretary stressed that pre-departure testing has been strictly implemented to prevent the spread of a new variant."But it is absolutely vital that we protect this country from a new variant that may not be as well dealt with by the vaccine. We cannot risk the progress that we have made,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-long-way-from-easing-virus-lockdown-as-vaccine-escape-concerns-grow-101611492375679.html
24-01-2021||World||Explained: Asia's 'most-wanted' drug boss Tse Chi Lop||Dutch authorities have arrested 57-year old Canadian national Tse Chi Lop at the request of the Australia Federal Police after a long probe into drug trafficking in the Asia-Pacific.Tse had been on a global most-wanted list and was of "significant interest" to law enforcement agencies in multiple countries, said Dutch and Australian police.Who is Tse Chi Lop?Tse - known by his nickname "Sam Gor", Brother Number Three in Cantonese - is the alleged senior leader of a sprawling transnational drug trafficking syndicate known as "The Company" to its members or, to some police, the "Sam Gor syndicate."Born in China's southern Guangdong province, he became a member of the Big Circle Gang, a Triad-like organisation founded by disillusioned Red Guards at the end of the Cultural Revolution, police sources have told Reuters.He moved to Hong Kong, then Canada, and was arraigned by United States authorities for heroin trafficking in 1998. After release from an Ohio prison in 2006, he found his way back to Asia, where police allege he led the transformation of the region's $70 billion annual drug trade. Described as immensely wealthy and a prodigious gambler, Tse lost $66 million in one night at a casino and travelled with a guard of Thai kickboxers, investigators told Reuters.Read | Drug Kingpin El Chapo’s daughter, Mexican cartels hand out coronavirus aidWhat is 'The Company"?The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that Tse's drug syndicate earned as much as $17 billion from trafficking drugs in 2018.Police and analysts said the syndicate drove a rapid expansion of crystal-methamphetamine trafficking in the region, which increased fourfold in the five years to 2019. The syndicate also manufactured heroin and has been a major player in the global market for MDMA, a euphoric party drug also known as ecstasy, police say.The UNODC's Jeremy Douglas has said Tse was "in the league of" the Latin American narco-bosses Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and Pablo Escobar.Police allege Tse's crime syndicate was formed after a peace pact among five Asian criminal groups - the Big Circle Gang (also called the Big Circle Boys); the 14k, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On triads from Hong Kong and Macau; and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan.The collaboration ended the blood-soaked rivalries of some of the crime groups and paved the way for gargantuan profits.As well as pioneering industrial-scale meth production in super-labs in Myanmar, Tse's syndicate built its customer base among smaller, nation-based crime groups by offering to replace any drugs that were seized by law enforcement at no extra cost, police say.What next?Tse bunkered down in Taiwan in 2019 after he became aware of a major multinational investigation into him and the syndicate, four police sources say. China and Australia issued arrest warrants for Tse, but neither has extradition agreements with the self-governing territory that is claimed by Beijing.Following his arrest at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Saturday, Australian police said they can seek Tse's extradition to Australia to face court. No charges have been revealed. But the Australian police believe Tse has been involved in at least 13 drug importations to Australia, according to a document viewed by Reuters.Whether Tse's arrest dents the Asia-Pacific drug trade remains unclear. While he has kept a low profile in the past year, the syndicate's activities have been largely unaffected, two police sources told Reuters. The UNODC and police sources have told Reuters that, with the exception of a few countries, the trafficking of illicit substances has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asia-Pacific, unlike other regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-arrest-of-asia-s-most-wanted-drug-boss-tse-chi-lop-101611490757090.html
24-01-2021||World||Scottish leader says Boris Johnson fears democracy over independence issue||Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday of fearing democracy when it comes to letting the Scottish people express their will on independence from the United Kingdom.Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a 2014 referendum. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the European Union in the subsequent 2016 Brexit vote, stoking demands by Scottish nationalists for a new independence vote after the UK as a whole voted to leave.Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP), which runs the semi-autonomous Edinburgh executive, laid out plans on Saturday for a new referendum if, as expected, it wins Scottish elections in May.Johnson said earlier this month he thought there should be a gap of about 40 years before any new referendum."He's frightened of democracy," Sturgeon said during a BBC television interview on Sunday."If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months' time on a proposition of giving the people that choice, what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?" she said.Johnson says the SNP presented the 2014 referendum as a "once in a generation" event and cannot now insist on another.The SNP counters that the situation has changed because of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. Scots' votes against Brexit in 2016 were outweighed by a majority voting in favour in more populous England.Sturgeon's party says EU membership was presented in 2014 as a key argument for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom, only for Scots to be dragged out of the bloc against their will.NORTHERN IRELANDBrexit has led to similar discussions in Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in the EU. Republicans there want a so-called "border poll" on unification with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, while Unionists want to remain part of the United Kingdom."There is an unstoppable conversation underway on our constitutional future," Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein, a Republican party, said on Twitter on Sunday."It is time for the Irish government to step up preparations. We can overcome the barriers of partition and build a new Ireland."First Minister Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party criticised O'Neill for raising constitutional issues in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic."We all know how divisive a border poll would be, and for us in Northern Ireland what we have to do at the moment is all come together to fight against COVID," she said on Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-leader-says-boris-johnson-fears-democracy-over-independence-issue-101611491270991.html
24-01-2021||World||Dutch police arrest alleged Asian drug syndicate kingpin Tse Chi Lop||Dutch police have arrested the alleged leader of a large Asian drug syndicate who is listed as one of the world's most-wanted fugitives and has been compared to Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.Tse Chi Lop, a Chinese-born Canadian national, was detained on Friday at the request of Australian police, who led an investigation that found his organisation dominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade, Dutch police spokesman Thomas Aling said on Saturday.Tse is expected to be extradited after appearing before a judge, Aling said, adding that his arrest by national police took place without incident at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport."He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received," Aling said.Dutch police were unable to provide details about the legal proceedings and it was not clear if Tse had a lawyer.Tse's crime syndicate allegedly dominates the Asia-Pacific crystal methamphetamine trade, which increased fourfold in the five years to 2019, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Regional law enforcers say the syndicate has imported highly potent meth into more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as trafficking heroin and MDMA.Tse, 57, an ex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto, has moved between Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according to counter-narcotics officers from four countries and documents reviewed by Reuters.The group has "been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases" of drug trafficking since January 2015, the documents showed.Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the UNODC, told Reuters in 2019 that "Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar," referring to Latin America's most notorious drug lords.The UNODC estimated that Tse's drug syndicate earned as much as $17 billion in 2018.The syndicate he is suspected of running is known to its members as "The Company". Law enforcers also refer to it as "Sam Gor" - or Brother Number Three in Cantonese - after one of Tse's nicknames, Reuters reported at the time. Reuters was unable to contact Tse for comment on the report at that time.'They got their man'The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said on Sunday it issued an arrest warrant for Tse in 2019, "in connection with AFP-led Operation Volante, which dismantled a global crime syndicate operating in five countries."The AFP also led an international investigation, dubbed Operation Kungur, into Tse and his syndicate that included about 20 agencies from more than a dozen countries."The syndicate targeted Australia over a number of years, importing and distributing large amounts of illicit narcotics, laundering the profits overseas and living off the wealth obtained from crime," the AFP added.Documents reviewed by Reuters allege the syndicate's money laundering operation spans the globe, with casino junkets and property investments both used as vehicles to launder earnings.The UNODC's Douglas hailed the arrest as a "great result" but cautioned that it may not have a big impact on drug trafficking in the region."They got their man. Kudos to the Australian Federal Police. But the organisation remains, the demand for synthetic drugs has been built, and someone will step in to replace Tse," said Douglas."It is hard to see his arrest having much of an impact on drug trafficking beyond the near-term if the poor governance, corruption and easily available drug precursors in the region remain unaddressed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-police-arrest-alleged-asian-drug-syndicate-kingpin-tse-chi-lop-101611490698422.html
24-01-2021||World||Israel includes teens in vaccination drive, eyeing exams||Israel expanded its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday to include 16- to 18-year-olds in what the government described as an effort to enable their attendance at school exams.Israel, which has the world's fastest vaccine distribution rate, is hoping to begin reopening its economy next month.With regular imports of Pfizer Inc. vaccines, Israel has administered at least one dose to more than 25% of its 9 million population since Dec. 19, the Health Ministry says.The vaccines were initially limited to the elderly and other high-risk categories, but are now available to anyone over 40 or - with parental permission - those between 16 and 18.The inclusion of late-teens is meant "to enable their return (to school) and the orderly holding of exams," the Education Ministry spokeswoman said.Israel awards a matriculation certificate to high school students in grades 10-12 who pass exams, administered by the Education Ministry, that play a major role in acceptance to universities. They can also affect placement in the military, where many Israelis do compulsory service after high school.The country has been under a third national lockdown since Dec. 27, which it plans to lift at the end of January.Education Minister Yoav Galant said it was too early to know if schools would reopen next month. Among factors deciding this was how much Israel, which is struggling against a surge of infections, was affected by the contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain, he told Ynet TV.Hezi Levy, director-general of Israel's Health Ministry, was asked in an Army Radio interview whether vaccinating teens might pose unforeseen risks - perhaps to their own yet-unborn children."I don't know," Levy said. "This vaccine is no different to vaccines against other viral diseases ... and was successfully tested for side effects." He added that he had no doubt that - weighing the relative risks from the coronavirus - it was preferable to get the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-includes-teens-in-vaccination-drive-eyeing-exams-101611484455852.html
24-01-2021||World||US President Joe Biden, UK PM Boris Johnson discuss transatlantic ties, Covid-19, climate change in phone call||Joe Biden conveyed his intention to strengthen the "special relationship" with the UK in his first call as the US President with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, during which the two leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and agreed to cooperate on combating climate change and containing the Covid-19 pandemic.The conversation with Johnson over phone on Saturday was Biden’s third involving a foreign leader since his inauguration on Wednesday, after he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday."Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening. I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid-19," Johnson said in a tweet.It seem that a new trade agreement was not on the list of priorities for both sides. While the Downing Street readout of the phone call referred to Johnson reiterating his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible, the White House communique of the call only referred to "strengthening the special relationship"."The president conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship between our countries and revitalise transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to our collective defense and shared values," the White House said."Building on the UK and US’ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible," a Downing Street spokesperson said.The UK is keen to conclude a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the US, but the new American administration has been less vocal over this amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic crisis.The global health crisis and vaccination programme in both countries and around the world as well as climate change were areas of more mutual agreement, with security and defence through strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) also high on the agenda – in contrast with former President Donald Trump’s hard ball with the alliance.During the call, President Biden noted the importance of cooperation, including through multilateral organisations, on shared challenges such as combatting climate change, containing Covid-19, and ensuring global health security, the White House said.The leaders also discussed the need for coordination on shared foreign policy priorities, including China, Iran, and Russia, it said."The Prime Minister warmly welcomed the President’s decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organisation and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,” the Downing Street spokesperson said.On climate change, Johnson is said to have also praised President Biden’s early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050."The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and COP26 this year,” the spokesperson added.The UK will be hosting the G7 summit in Cornwall in June, which is expected to be Biden’s first visit to the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also due to join the summit for its guest country sessions.The new White House incumbent is famously anti-Brexit but all early indications are that his views on the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) are unlikely to overshadow US-UK relations in future.In his call with Mexico’s President, Biden and Obrador agreed to work closely to stem the flow of irregular migration to Mexico and the US, as well as to promote development in the Northern Triangle of Central America."The president outlined his plan to reduce migration by addressing its root causes, increasing resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways, improving processing at the border to adjudicate requests for asylum, and reversing the previous administration’s draconian immigration policies,” the White House said.They also recognised the importance of coordination to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-talks-transatlantic-ties-covid-19-climate-change-with-boris-johnson-101611484560593.html
24-01-2021||World||Arab Spring exiles look back 10 years after Egypt uprising||The Egyptians who took to the streets on January 25, 2011, knew what they were doing. They knew they risked arrest and worse. But as their numbers swelled in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, they tasted success.Police forces backed off, and within days, former President Hosni Mubarak agreed to demands to step down.But events didn't turn out the way many of the protesters envisioned. A decade later, thousands are estimated to have fled abroad to escape the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi that is considered even more oppressive. The significant loss of academics, artists, journalists and other intellectuals has, along with a climate of fear, hobbled any political opposition.Dr. Mohamed Aboelgheit was among those jailed in the southern city of Assiut in 2011 after joining calls for revolt against police brutality and Mubarak. He spent part of the uprising in a cramped cell.Released amid the chaos, he reveled in the atmosphere of political freedom in the Arab world’s most populous country — protesting, working as a journalist and joining a campaign for a moderate presidential candidate. But it did not last.Interim military rulers followed Mubarak. In 2012, Mohamed Morsi, a member of Egypt’s most powerful Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was elected as the first civilian president in the country’s history. But his tenure proved divisive. Amid massive protests, the military — led by then-Defense Minister el-Sissi — removed Morsi in 2013, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a “terrorist group.” A crackdown on dissent ensued, and el-Sissi won two terms in elections that human rights groups criticized as undemocratic.“I began to feel, by degree, more fear and threats,” Aboelgheit said. Friends were jailed, his writings critical of the government drew attention, and “I wasn’t going to wait until it happened to me,” he added.After el-Sissi came to power, Aboelgheit left for London, where he's published investigative reports on other parts of the Arab world.At his former home in Egypt, national security agents asked about him. When Aboelgheit’s wife last returned to visit relatives, she was summoned for questioning about his activities. The message was clear.No one knows exactly how many Egyptians like Aboelgheit have fled political persecution.Data from the World Bank shows an increase in emigres from Egypt since 2011. A total of 3,444,832 left in 2017 — nearly 60,000 more than in 2013, the years for which figures are available. But it’s impossible to tell economic migrants from political exiles.They relocated to Berlin, Paris and London. Egyptians also have settled in Turkey, Qatar, Sudan and even Asian countries like Malaysia and South Korea.Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that there were 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt third, behind China and Turkey, in detaining journalists.El-Sissi maintains Egypt has no political prisoners. The arrest of a journalist or a rights worker makes news roughly every month. Many people have been imprisoned on terrorism charges, for breaking a ban on protests or for disseminating false news. Others remain in indefinite pretrial detentions.El-Sissi maintains Egypt is holding back Islamic extremism so it doesn't descend into chaos like its neighbors.“Sissi wants not only to abrogate the rights of the opposition and to prevent any critical voice from being uttered, Sissi doesn’t actually believe, not only in the opposition, but he doesn’t believe in politics," said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian professor of modern Middle Eastern History at Cambridge UniversityFahmy believes this is the worst period in Egypt’s modern history for personal rights.“It’s much more serious, it’s much deeper and much darker, what Sissi has in mind,” he said.Those abroad who could challenge el-Sissi have chosen to not return.Taqadum al-Khatib, an academic who also worked in the nascent political scene after 2011, was researching Egypt’s former Jewish community in Germany when he learned that returning to his homeland was no longer an option.The Egyptian cultural attaché in Berlin summoned al-Khatib for a meeting, and an official questioned him about his articles, social media posts and research. He was asked to hand over his passport but refused. Shortly thereafter, he was fired from his job at an Egyptian university. He feels lucky to be able to work toward his doctorate in Germany but misses Cairo’s bustle.“It’s a very difficult situation. I couldn’t go back to my home,” al-Khatib said.Fahmy said he’s seen outspoken expatriates have their Egyptian citizenship revoked.A government press officer did not respond to a request for comment on targeting and intimidating Egyptians — either abroad or at home — based on their work as journalists, activists or academics, or for expressing political opinions.Journalist Asma Khatib, 29, remembers the heady days of 2011, when young people thought they could bring change.A reporter for a pro-Muslim Brotherhood news agency, Khatib covered Morsi’s short presidency amid criticism the group was using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power to make Egypt an Islamic state. After Morsi's ouster, his supporters held sit-ins for his reinstatement at a square in Cairo. A month later, the new military leaders forcibly cleared them out, and more than 600 people were killed.Khatib documented the violence. Soon, colleagues started being arrested, and she fled Egypt — first to Malaysia, then to Indonesia and Turkey.She was tried in absentia on espionage charges in 2015, convicted and sentenced to death. Now, she and her husband Ahmed Saad, also a journalist, and their two children are seeking asylum in South Korea.They expect they’ll never return, but also realize they’re lucky to be free. On the day the ruling was announced, the journalist remembers telling herself: “You don’t have a country anymore.”“I know that there are lots of others like me. I’m not any different from those who are in prison,” she said.The exiles have had ample time to think about where Egypt's uprising failed. The broad alliance of protesters — from Islamists to secular activists — fractured without a common enemy like Mubarak, and the most extreme voices became the loudest. The role of religion in society remained largely unanswered, and liberal secular initiatives never gained traction. No one accounted for how many people would embrace former regime figures, especially in a crisis.Most Egyptians abroad have not been politically active, fearing for family and friends back home. But some have continued on the path begun on Jan. 25, 2011.Tamim Heikal, working in the corporate world when the protests erupted, had doubted the government could ever reform. But he soon became a communications manager for an emerging political party. Later, he watched others being locked up, and knew his turn had come when he got an invitation from intelligence officers in 2017 to “come have coffee.”He booked a ticket to Paris and hasn’t gone back.Now, at age 42, he wants to educate himself and others for when a popular movement re-emerges in Egypt. He makes ends meet by editing, translating and doing consulting work for rights groups, and tries to network among the diaspora.“It’s as if I was infected with a virus, after the revolution,” he said. “I don’t know how to go back. I won’t be able to relax until change happens.”Others try to cope in strange lands. Asma Khatib and her husband aren’t sure what to say to their young children when they ask where they’re from.Abouelgheit, the doctor-turned-journalist, worries his son won’t speak Arabic after so much time in the United Kingdom.He hopes to go home one day, but in the meantime, he’s considering returning to the medical profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arab-spring-exiles-look-back-10-years-after-egypt-uprising-101611483585994.html
24-01-2021||World||'No WhatsApp, FB messenger': Terror groups in Pak switch to new messaging apps||Amid a raging debate over privacy offered by messaging platforms like WhatsApp, terrorist groups and their handlers from Pakistan are switching to new applications which include one developed by a Turkish company, officials here said.The three new applications came to light after evidence was collected following encounters with terrorists or those who surrendered before the Army gave details about their mode of radicalisation by Pakistan-based terrorist groups, they said.The names of the messaging apps have been withheld for security reasons.While one of the applications is owned by a company based in the United States, the second is from Europe. The latest is an application developed by a Turkish company that has been frequently used by terrorist group handlers and their prospective recruits in the Kashmir valley.The new applications have the ability to work with the slowest internet connections where Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE), used in the late 2000s, or 2G is in operation.The government had suspended the internet across Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state in August 2019. Early last year, 2G internet services were restored.Terror groups had virtually stopped using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Later, it was found that they have switched over to new applications available free of cost on the world wide web, a security official said.All encryption and decryption happen directly on the devices, therefore, reducing third party intervention at any point and these apps use the encryption algorithm RSA-2048 which was adopted as the most secure encrypted platform.RSA is an American Network Security and Authentication company that was founded in 1982 by US-born Ron Rivest, Israeli-born Adi Shamir, and US-born Leonard Adleman. The acronym RSA is used worldwide as the foundation key in the cryptosystem.One of the new messaging apps used by terrorists to radicalise the youth in the Valley does not even ask for phone numbers or emails for enabling complete user anonymity, the officials said.Efforts are on to block such applications in Jammu and Kashmir, they said.This comes at a time when the security agencies in the Valley are fighting the menace of virtual SIM cards. Terror groups have been increasingly using these to connect with their handlers in Pakistan.The penetration of this technology came to light in 2019 when a request was sent to the United States to seek details from a service provider of virtual SIMs used by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber in the attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that left 40 personnel dead.However, a detailed investigation done by the National Investigation Agency and other security agencies indicated that over 40 virtual SIM cards were used in the Pulwama attack alone, and there are probably more of them floating in the Valley's cyberspace, the officials said.It is a fairly new modus operandi wherein terrorists from across the border are using virtual SIM cards generated by a service provider based in a foreign country. In this technology, the computer generates a telephone number and the user needs to download an application of the service provider on his or her smartphone to use it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-groups-in-pakistan-switch-to-new-messaging-apps-101611483886148.html
24-01-2021||World||Explained: How Trump’s 2nd impeachment trial could be different from 1st||Former US President Donald Trump is set to face a historic second impeachment trial in Senate next month after Democrats and Republicans agreed to delay the schedule by two weeks. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced on Friday that the article of impeachment will be delivered and read out to the Upper chamber on January 25. The 100 members of Senate will be sworn in as jurors the next day and impeachment managers, as well as Trump’s defence team, will be given time to draft their legal briefs.How the second impeachment trial could be different from the first?When the Senate trial for Trump’s impeachment was held for the first time, the Republican leader was still in the White House. However, he now holds the dubious record of getting impeached twice and being the first president in the history of the United States to face trial after leaving the office. This also means that the Senate will enter into uncharted constitutional territory when the trial begins on February 9.In December 2019, the House impeached Trump after several weeks of hearings on charges of "Abuse of Power" and "Obstruction of Congress" but the votes were almost entirely along partisan lines. In the aftermath of Capitol riots, however, the proceedings panned out a little bit differently as 10 Republicans joined Democrats to impeach Trump on the charge of “Incitement of Insurrection” within a week of the violence that left five dead.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that this impeachment trial will be different from last time since the whole world witnessed “president's incitement and the violence that was used”. In the previous case, Trump administration was accused of withholding $400 million in military aid, approved by Congress and the Pentagon, to Ukraine and pressurising President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump had defended the call to Zelensky as “perfect”."I do see a big difference between something that we all witnessed versus what information you might need to substantiate an Article of Impeachment based on, large part, on a call that the president made and described as 'perfect’," said Pelosi.On February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted from the charges and Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican member who voted to convict the president on one charge. Though the Democrats now control the Senate with 50 seats, at least two-thirds of the Senate have to vote in favour of removal.It is highly unlikely that Democrats could muster support from 17 Republicans to convict Trump, especially when he no longer holds the office. Republican senator Ron Johnson from the state of Wisconsin has termed the trial unconstitutional and warned that it would set a very dangerous precedent.“I believe an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional and would set a very dangerous precedent. There is no provision in the Constitution for holding such a trial over a former president who is now a private citizen. Where would we get the authority to do so?” he tweeted.I believe an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional and would set a very dangerous precedent. There is no provision in the Constitution for holding such a trial over a former president who is now a private citizen. Where would we get the authority to do so?Vermont senator Bernie Sanders of the progressive caucus had argued in the favour of Trump’s removal, saying a precedent should be set for future presidents. The septuagenarian leader had said that it must be made clear that no president can lead an insurrection against the US government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-trump-s-2nd-impeachment-trial-could-be-different-from-1st-101611483400229.html

Hancock said the government is conducting a vaccine trial on the South African variant to study its response to the inoculation. Hancock also said he’s worried about new variants developing elsewhere in the world.“The new variant I really worry about is the one that’s out there but hasn’t been spotted,” he said, adding that the UK is offering its genome-sequencing capability to other countries to help them identify new strains.In the UK’s vaccination effort, the supply of vaccines is the rate-limiting factor and not distribution by the National Health Service, Hancock said. He also couldn’t confirm that schools would be open again by Easter, saying that the government would have to look at the data around the pandemic at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-may-work-less-well-on-covid-19-variants-uk-s-heath-minister-warns-101611481835380.html
24-01-2021||World||Vaccinated people may still transmit Covid-19, warns England’s chief medic||One of England’s leading medical officers on Sunday urged the public to continue to follow the strict lockdown rules because any vaccine-related immunity from Covid-19 takes at least three weeks to kick in.Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, also warned that there is no clear evidence yet to show that vaccinated people cannot transmit the deadly virus on to others.“Regardless of whether someone has had their vaccination or not, it is vital that everyone follows the national restrictions and public health advice, as protection takes up to three weeks to kick in and we don’t yet know the impact of vaccines on transmission,” said Van-Tam.His warning comes as the UK registered another high daily death toll from the virus of 1,348 this weekend, taking the country’s total to 97,329.However, he pointed to an additional 32 vaccination sites coming on stream to add to the thousands of venues where the National Health Service (NHS) has been delivering 140 jabs a minute, taking the vaccinated total to over 5.8 million.“The vaccine is rightly something to celebrate – let’s stay patient, stay at home and support the NHS as it continues to roll out the vaccine,” he said.A Living Museum where the BBC filmed a hit drama series ‘Peaky Blinders’ based on the notorious Birmingham gang in the 1920s is among the new vaccine sites.A former IKEA store at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, London, the Francis Crick Institute, which is also in the UK capital, the Nightingale Hospital in Sunderland and the Blackpool Winter Gardens will also be new vaccination centres.The latest openings mean there will be a network of almost 50 across the country, adding to options alongside hospitals, pharmacies and general practice (GP) surgeries.“Through the vaccines delivery plan, we have made outstanding progress in vaccinating our NHS and care staff and the most vulnerable people in society,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“We must not drop our guard. While the vaccine can prevent severe disease, we do not know if it stops you from passing on the virus to others, and it takes time to develop immunity after a jab, so for now everyone must continue to stay at home to help bring down infections and protect the NHS,” he said.The NHS said the new vaccine centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of jabs each week, scaling up and down according to vaccine supplies and demand.People eligible in the priority criteria of over-80s, followed by over-70s, care home workers and staff as well as frontline workers, are being invited when it is their turn and people are being urged not to just turn up.“These new centres provide another option for people invited for their jabs, alongside the fantastic work of local GPs,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director.Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi added: “As of next week there will be almost 50 vaccination centres, more than 250 hospitals hubs and over 1,000 local vaccination service sites, run by GPs and pharmacies right across the country.“This will enable us to vaccinate as many people as possible in the weeks and months to come and I encourage anyone who has been invited for a free vaccine to come forward and get a jab.”The NHS said its new Vaccination Centres will kick off by jabbing mainly health and social care staff from Monday before opening their doors to more patients on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-may-still-transmit-covid-19-warns-england-s-chief-medic-101611483167250.html

24-01-2021||World||11 Chinese miners saved as rescuers race to find remaining 10||Rescuers in east China on Sunday pulled 11 miners from hundreds of metres underground where they had been trapped for two weeks, state media reported, as the race to locate the remaining 10 intensified.The miners were brought to the surface starting from around 11 am Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported -- a major breakthrough for a rescue operation that has captivated the nation.One miner was in "extremely weak physical condition" and rushed to hospital, CCTV said.The 11 miners were rescued after the air ventilator shaft was cleared, the official state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the operation's command centre.A further ten remain unaccounted for.Specialist teams have been battling difficult conditions since an explosion at the Hushan mine in Shandong province trapped the miners underground amid rising waters on January 10.The explosion occurred in a ventilator shaft, causing a blockage that damaged the cable car.On Sunday morning the huge obstacles suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft, allowing the operation to take a big step forward, rescue expert Du Bingjian said."After the obstacles fell to the bottom of the shaft, the rescue team started to bring up the miners and suspended the drilling work," Du told the Global Times."It is currently unclear when the rescuers will reach the Sixth Central Section where the missing miners are believed to be."Lifeline shafts State broadcaster footage on Sunday showed a small elevator carriage lifted to the surface, accompanied by rescue workers. A masked man, who appeared unable to stand, was carried out.Later footage showed emergency workers lifting out other miners, who wore black shades to protect their eyes from the light. One appeared to be holding his hands as if praying.Contact was first established a week ago with a group of 11 miners trapped in a section of the mine around 580 metres (1,900 feet) below the surface.One of them was seriously injured in the initial explosion and died after falling into a coma.Another miner was found alive by rescuers as they attempted to reach the group.Rescue teams have been lowering food, medicine and other supplies to the group through several lifeline shafts drilled into the rock.State media reported Friday that the health of the miners had been gradually returning to a "normal state" after regular deliveries of food.Life detectors and nutrient solutions have been lowered to other parts of the mine in the hope of reaching those still missing.In December, 23 workers died after becoming stuck underground in the southwestern city of Chongqing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-chinese-miners-saved-as-rescuers-race-to-find-remaining-10-101611482099118.html
24-01-2021||World||Taiwan reports large incursion by Chinese air force||Eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Saturday, and Taiwan's air force deployed missiles to "monitor" the incursion, the island's defence ministry said.China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has conducted almost daily flights over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months.However, they have generally consisted of just one or two reconnaissance aircraft.The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on this mission - Taiwan said it was made up of eight nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and four J-16 fighter jets - was unusual.A map provided by Taiwan's defence ministry showed that the Chinese aircraft, including a Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, flew over the same waters where the most recent Chinese missions have been taking place near the Pratas Islands, though still well away from mainland Taiwan.Taiwan's air force warned away the Chinese aircraft and deployed missiles to monitor them, the ministry said, using standard wording for how it responds to such activities."Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity," it said in a brief statement.The US State Department urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan and reaffirmed its commitment to the island and desire to deepen ties."We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives," State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement."We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability."There was no immediate comment from China. In the past, China has said it has been carrying out exercises to defend its sovereignty and security.Taiwan's foreign ministry expressed its thanks for the show of US support, adding they would work closely with the Biden administration to strengthen their close partnership.Lo Chih-Cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party who sits on parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, told Reuters China was trying to deter the new US government from backing the island."It's sending a message to the Biden administration," he said.Beijing has watched with growing concern increasing US support for democratic Taiwan, especially during Donald Trump's administration, which left office on Wednesday.Last year, during visits by senior US officials to Taipei, Chinese aircraft briefly crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.The flight by the Chinese bombers and fighters on Saturday came just days after Joe Biden assumed the US presidency.Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the US commitment to Taiwan was "rock-solid" after the island's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's swearing-in on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-large-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-101611480291412.html

No casualties or damage were immediately reported.The quake in the South Shetland Islands had a magnitude of 6.9 with a depth of 9.6 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, while the earthquake in Chile had a magnitude of 5.8.Chile’s Interior Ministry said on Twitter the South Shetland Islands quake was 216 kilometers northeast of the country's O’Higgins scientific base, and called for coastal regions in the Antarctica to be evacuated because of a tsunami risk.Almost simultaneously a 5.8 magnitude quake swayed buildings in central Chile, including in the capital of Santiago. The quake had a depth of 110 kilometers.“As of this moment, there are no reports of damages to people or infrastructure or of alterations to basic services because of this earthquake," said Chile's national emergency center Onemi.Some people in Chile received the evacuation message on their cellphones by mistake, which authorities attributed to a technical error. The mistake led to confusion and local media showed hundreds of people starting to evacuate in the coastal region of La Serena in the country's north. They were later told it was a false alarm.More than 160 people evacuated the four Chilean bases in Antarctica, Onemi reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quakes-of-6-9-5-8-magnitude-hit-south-shetland-islands-chile-no-major-damage-101611480935652.html

24-01-2021||World||South African Hindu priests accused of overcharging for Covid victims' funerals||Some Hindu priests in South Africa have come under fire for allegedly charging high rates to conduct funerals of Covid-19 victims.Pradeep Ramlall, Manager of the Clare Estate Crematorium in Durban, slammed priests who are doing this.Ramlall, who is also a member of the Hindu Dharma Association of South Africa, said the organisation had received a number of complaints about this from families of people who had succumbed to the virus.In recent weeks, amid a second wave and a new variant of the Covid-19 virus, the crematorium has had to introduce double shifts amid daily deaths in the city which is home to more than a third of South Africa’s Indian-origin population of about 1.4 million.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Priests are charging between R1,200 and R2,000 to conduct a funeral. This is not right. As per our scriptures, this is our seva (service) to the community. If a family wants to give a priest a donation, then that is acceptable but priests should not be charging people,” Ramlall told the Weekly Post.“I was in my vehicle. The priest had conducted a Covid-19 victim's funeral. While he was in the parking lot, he removed R100 notes from his pocket and counted it before sanitising each note and putting the money back into his pocket,” he said recounting an incident that he had personally witnessed.Ramlall called on the community to avoid being exploited under the current trying circumstances which was bringing grief to so many families and asked them to conduct the cremation themselves.“We have pre-recorded videos that they can use. If they insist on having a priest, then the priest can conduct the funeral through Zoom or through a WhatsApp video call. We need to embrace technology,” Ramlall said.South African Hindu Maha Sabha President Ashwin Trikamjee said they had a list of accredited priests on the Sabha's Facebook page that families could contact to conduct the last rites at no charge.Citing the massive increase in the number of Covid-19-related deaths, Trikamjee said there were funerals being done at odd hours by priests who use their own transport and personal protective equipment (PPE) which they might expect reimbursement for, although families would not be obliged to pay.Earlier, Lucy Sigaban, a Hindu priestess in the sprawling Indian suburb of Lenasia near Johannesburg, had urged the government to assist priests who are conducting funerals of Covid-19 victims free of charge by providing them with PPE at no cost, but this has not happened yet.For the last two months, Covid-19 infections and deaths have been rising exponentially in South Africa.On Thursday alone, there were 647 deaths and over 11,000 more infections reported, bringing the total deaths to 39,501 and infections to 1.38 million since the first case was reported in March last year.The government is awaiting a shipment of over 15 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from India within the next month to prioritise health care workers and other essential services staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-hindu-priests-accused-of-overcharging-for-covid-victims-funerals-101611480137339.html
24-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Germany to begin experimental antibodies treatment used in treating former US President Donald Trump||Germany will become the first European Union country to start using the same experimental antibodies treatment credited with helping Donald Trump recover from Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn said Sunday."The government has bought 200,000 doses for 400 million euros ($486 million)," Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, working out at 2,000 euros per dose.The so-called monoclonal antibody cocktails will be deployed to university hospitals in the coming week, he said, adding that Germany was "the first country in the EU" to use them in the fight against the pandemic.Spahn did not name the manufacturer that will be supplying the drugs but confirmed it was the same medicine given to then-US president Trump when he fell ill with Covid last October."They work like a passive vaccination. Administering these antibodies in the early stages can help high-risk patients avoid a more serious progression," Spahn said.Trump, who was briefly hospitalised with the coronavirus, was given the antibody therapy developed by US firm Regeneron, known as REGN-COV2, even before the treatment had won regulatory approval.He later said the medicine did "a fantastic job".US company Eli Lilly has developed a similar therapy.The novel treatment is a combination or "cocktail" of two lab-made antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the part of the new coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells.The antibodies attach themselves to different parts of the virus's spike protein, distorting its structure -- similar in a way to knocking a key out of shape so it no longer fits its lock.Germany's order comes at a time of growing frustration in the EU over a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines.Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca have both said they would be delivering fewer doses to Europe than anticipated in the short term because of production problems.The German government has said it nonetheless expects to be able to offer all Germans a jab by the end of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-begin-using-covid-19-medications-that-helped-donald-trump-s-recovery-101611480378687.html

Reuters could not independently confirm its authenticity.A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.On Friday, the Saudi-led coalition had said it foiled two Houthi attacks using an armed drone launched towards Saudi Arabia and an explosive-laden boat in the southern Red Sea.The alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.The movement was designated by the Trump administration this month as a foreign terrorist organisation. New US President Joe Biden has initiated a review of the designation, which UN officials have warned could push Yemen into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudiled-forces-thwart-air-attack-on-riyadh-saudi-state-television-101611479069800.html
24-01-2021||World||US pushes China to cease pressure on Taiwan||The US State Department urged China to engage in dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives and cease putting military, diplomatic and economic pressure on the island.The US statement on Saturday came as Taiwan said a fleet of 13 Chinese military planes, including eight H-6K bombers, entered its air defence identification zone, in an apparent stepping up of Beijing’s almost constant military incursions around the Taiwan Strait.“We will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region -- and that includes deepening our ties with democratic Taiwan,” the Department of State said in the statement.The wording appears to indicate some continuity with former US President Donald Trump’s willingness to engage with Taiwan, at the risk of provoking the Chinese government, which sees the island as part of its territory. Trump’s government sold arms to Taiwan and his Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled to Taipei in August, becoming the highest-level US visitor in decades.“The United States will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan,” the State Department said, adding that the commitment to Taiwan is “rock solid” and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability in Asia.At the same time, the US pledged to stand by communiques agreed with China, and its use of the phrase “people on Taiwan” could indicate that the Biden administration is keen to avoid any direct confrontation with China by elevating the status of Taiwan.US allies around the world have been eagerly awaiting indications of Joe Biden’s approach to China. Concerns about how to handle ties with Asia’s largest economy came second only to the coronavirus in a list of problems Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed with his UK counterpart Ben Wallace in a call Saturday, according to an email from the US Department of Defence.US, Japan Defence chiefs agree to strengthen alliance in callAustin also agreed with Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi in a call early on Sunday to oppose any attempts to change the status quo in the East or South China Seas with force in the background, according to a Japanese Defence Ministry statement.China is using its growing military muscle to aggressively assert its territorial claims in neighboring seas, and its military aircraft frequently enter Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, while Japanese and Chinese government ships frequently chase one another around disputed islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pushes-china-to-cease-pressure-on-taiwan-101611479195704.html

That's what we are focusing on. Some buildings have no management at all. We have to improve this urban redevelopment. Urban renewal is needed," Cheung said, SCMP quoted.He further said that officials have been visiting households in the restricted zone to send the occupants to mobile screening stations.Amid the rising number of cases in Hong Kong, more than 700 people are currently hospitalised and 38 are in critical condition.

24-01-2021||World||Leaders of Covid019 vaccine rollout deliver some of world’s top gains||The race to deliver the jab to the world’s populations has so far been led by a handful of smaller nations, and now they’re outpacing some of the wealthiest countries in the eyes of traders too.The fastest Covid-19 vaccination rollouts globally, in Israel and the United Arab Emirates, are propelling their stocks to some of the world’s top gains. Israel’s benchmark index has advanced 7.6% this year, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Euro Stoxx Index. It ranks 12th among major equity gauges. Meantime, the Dubai Financial Market General Index has climbed 9%, all but reversing its 10% slump in 2020 and handing investors the sixth-best returns year to date. The Abu Dhabi Securities Market General Index is the world’s third-best performer.Traders are rushing to price the global vaccine rollout and betting nations at the forefront will be the fastest to recover from the crisis, lifting their stocks, currencies and bond yields. The share of a country’s population that has been inoculated might be “the most important statistic to track over the next year,” according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.So far, Israel has vaccinated about 30% of its population and the UAE about 20%. If sustained, they could reach the threshold for herd immunity by mid-year, JPMorgan says.“Will enough divergence open up with respect to herd immunity across countries to render this issue tradeable across markets? Probably,” strategists led by John Normand wrote in a Jan. 8 note. “Those countries that return to pre-crisis levels of activity most quickly due to some combination of stimulus and vaccine distribution should witness the most upward pressure on their interest rates and currencies.”While Israel and Dubai are tantalizing examples, the case for growth fueled by vaccinations in larger economies is murky, according to Michael Herzum, who runs macro strategies at Union Investment in Frankfurt.“It is difficult to isolate these effects from other market drivers and therefore makes it difficult to play it on a country-by-country level,” Herzum said. Even so, he’s building vaccination rates into his cross-asset allocation decisions.In Britain, where the first citizen outside of a trial received the coronavirus vaccination on Dec. 8, the FTSE 100 benchmark has outperformed peers in Europe even as its population suffers through a third national lockdown to quell a resurgence of the virus and a new fast-spreading variant. Vaccinations could pave the economy’s path to recovery and further lift the nation’s stocks, according to Herzum.“U.K. equities could be in a good position very soon as the U.K. probably reaches herd immunity much faster than the continent due to much better progress on vaccinations,” he said. “This could result in a big swing in economic activity once Covid-19 related restrictions are lifted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-covid019-vaccine-rollout-deliver-some-of-world-s-top-gains-101611478572288.html
24-01-2021||World||Portugal votes to elect president amid severe Covid-19 pandemic surge||Portugal held a presidential election Sunday, with the moderate incumbent candidate strongly favored to earn a second five-year term as a devastating Covid-19 surge grips the European Union nation.The head of state in Portugal has no legislative powers, which lie with parliament and the government, but is an influential voice in the running of the country.Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, 72, is regarded as the clear front-runner among seven candidates. He is an affable, approachable law professor and former television personality who as president has consistently had an approval rating of 60% or more.To win, a candidate must capture more than 50% of the vote. But a severe surge in coronavirus infections in recent days could keep turnout low and perhaps lead to a runoff between the two top candidates, which would take place on Feb. 14. Portugal has increased polling stations and allowed for early voting to reduce crowding on election day.Portugal has the world’s highest rates of new daily infections and deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and the public health system is under huge strain.With the country in lockdown, the election campaign featured none of the usual flag-waving rallies or other large public events, though restrictions on movement were lifted for polling day. Voters were asked to take their own pen and disinfectant to polling stations.Among the incumbent’s six challengers, right-wing populist André Ventura has attracted curiosity as the first extremist to break into Portuguese mainstream politics. Ventura, 37, could conceivably place second, likely far behind Rebelo de Sousa but drawing a level of support that until recently was unthinkable. That development has unsettled national politics.Rebelo de Sousa, a former leader of the center-right Social Democratic Party, has worked closely with the center-left minority Socialist government, supporting its pandemic efforts. He also has endeared himself to the Portuguese with his easygoing style. Photographs taken by passers-by of him in public places, such as one last year of him standing in line at a supermarket wearing sneakers and shorts, routinely go viral.Portugal has 10.8 million registered voters, some 1.5 million of them living abroad. Exit polls were to be published Sunday night, with most results expected by midnight.Every Portuguese president since 1976, when universal suffrage was introduced following the departure of a dictatorship, has been returned for a second term. No woman or member of an ethnic minority has ever held the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-votes-to-elect-president-amid-severe-covid-19-pandemic-surge-101611477900095.html

NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal amply proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targetting the corrupt, it was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.Hussain said that foreign governments don't believe in the "lies" told on Pakistani media about Nawaz and his family.Moreover, he claimed Prime Minister Imran Khan's ministers and friends were involved in corruption for which proof is available, adding that there was no accountability for them. Hussain gave the example of Faisal Vawda owning 19 undeclared properties in London, reported Geo News."Mark Bezant and Yasir Dajani of the FTI Consulting were appointed by the anti-graft watchdog (NAB) to comment on the Stroz Friedberg (SF) forensic report on the Sharif family and matters arising out of the report of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)," explained Hussain.Mark Bezant of the FTI consulting and Yasir Dajani of the same firm was appointed by the NAB to comment on the SF forensic report which is essentially related to the Sharif family and matters arising out of the report of the JIT."Bezant's evidence was confined to the identification and valuation of relevant assets owned by the Sharif family," he added.Bezant was instructed by the NAB to consider and comment on the SF report, so his evidence was confined to matters relating to the Sharif family, specifically the identification and valuation of the relevant assets. The SF report resulted in identifying 76 items from the JIT report that was considered potentially recoverable assets of the Sharif family.Hussain said the report led to the identification of 76 items from the JIT report that were considered potentially recoverable assets and NAB representative contended that there were four items of double-counting totalling USD 41 million had not taken into account, further contending that liabilities of property-owning companies including mortgages were not taken into account, reported Geo News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-s-son-challenges-imran-khan-govt-to-show-proof-of-corruption-101611478169617.html

A short time later the UAE also announced the same decision making it 12th country outside of Russia which have authorised its use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-approves-emergency-use-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-101611475488258.html

The vast majority of them fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators said was executed with "genocidal intent" - assertions that Myanmar denies.Bangladesh will import white rice in a government-to-government deal at $485 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF) liner out basis, said Mosammat Nazmanara Khanum, the secretary at the country's food ministry."Our main priority is to bring down the prices of rice," Khanum told Reuters on Sunday, adding the government could buy as much as 10 million tonnes while private traders are allowed to buy another 10 million tonnes in the year to June.The deal will be signed soon and the rice will be delivered by April in phases, she said.Bangladesh is also buying 150,000 tonnes of rice from India's state-run firm NAFED in a government-to-government deal while it has issued a series of tender to buy the grain."We could buy more rice from India in state-to-state deals," Khanum said, adding that the Food Ministry was holding talks with several other Indian state agencies.Bangladesh, traditionally the world's third-biggest rice producer with around 35 million tonnes annually, uses almost all its production to feed its people. It still often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by floods or droughts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-buy-myanmar-rice-putting-aside-rohingya-crisis-101611470299921.html

Doug Verissimo, commander of the strike group, was quoted as saying."With two-thirds of the world's trade travelling through this very important region, it is vital that we maintain our presence and continue to promote the rules-based order which has allowed us all to prosper," Verissimo said in the statement.The announcement comes just days after Joe Biden was sworn in as US president.Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday there was "no doubt" China posed the most significant challenge to the United States of any nation.China has repeatedly complained about US Navy ships getting close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims.The Theodore Roosevelt is being accompanied by the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill, and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Russell and USS John Finn, the US statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aircraft-carrier-group-enters-south-china-sea-amid-taiwan-tensions-101611475141332.html
24-01-2021||World||Spain's virus surge hits mental health of front-line workers: Study||The unrelenting increase in Covid-19 infections in Spain following the holiday season is again straining hospitals, threatening the mental health of doctors and nurses who have been at the forefront of the pandemic for nearly a year.In Barcelona’s Hospital del Mar, the critical care capacity has more than doubled and is nearly full, with 80% of ICU beds occupied by coronavirus patients.“There are young people of 20-something-years-old and older people of 80-years-old, all the age groups,” said Dr. Joan Ramon Masclans, who heads the ICU. “This is very difficult, and it is one patient after another.”Even though authorities allowed gatherings of up to 10 people for Christmas and New Year celebrations, Masclans chose not to join his family and spent the holidays at home with his partner.“We did it to preserve our health and the health of others. And when you see that this isn’t being done (by others) it causes significant anger, added to the fatigue,” he said.A study released this month by Hospital del Mar looking at the impact of the spring's Covid-19 surge on more than 9,000 health workers across Spain found that at least 28% suffered major depression. That is six times higher than the rate in the general population before the pandemic, said Dr. Jordi Alonso, one of the chief researchers.In addition, the study found that nearly half of participants had a high risk of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks or substance- and alcohol-abuse problems.Spanish health care workers are far from the only ones to have suffered psychologically from the pandemic. In China, the levels of mental disorders among doctors and nurses were even higher, with 50% reporting depression, 45% reporting anxiety and 34% reporting insomnia, according to the World Health Organization.In the UK, a survey released last week by the Royal College of Physicians found that 64% of doctors reported feeling tired or exhausted. One in four sought out mental health support.“It is pretty awful at the moment in the world of medicine," Dr. Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said in a statement accompanying the study. “Hospital admissions are at the highest-ever level, staff are exhausted, and although there is light at the end of the tunnel, that light seems a long way away.”Dr. Aleix Carmona, a third-year anesthesiology resident in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia, didn’t have much ICU experience before the pandemic hit. But as surgeries were cancelled, Carmona was summoned to the ICU at the Moisès Broggi hospital outside Barcelona to fight a virus the world knew very little about.“In the beginning, we had a lot of adrenaline. We were very frightened but we had a lot of energy,” Carmona recalled. He plowed through the first weeks of the pandemic without having much time to process the unprecedented battle that was unfolding.It wasn’t until after the second month that he began feeling the toll of seeing first-hand how people were slowly dying as they ran out of breath. He pondered what to tell patients before intubating them. His initial reaction had always been to reassure them, tell them it would be alright. But in some cases he knew that wasn’t true.“I started having difficulty sleeping and a feeling of anxiety before each shift,” Carmona said, adding that he would return home after 12 hours feeling like he had been beaten up.For a while he could only sleep with the help of medication. Some colleagues started taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. What really helped Carmona, though, was a support group at his hospital, where his co-workers unloaded the experiences they had bottled up inside.But not everyone joined the group. For many, asking for help would make them seem unfit for the job.“In our profession, we can handle a lot,” said David Oliver, a spokesman for the Catalonia chapter of the SATSE union of nurses. “We don’t want to take time off because we know we will add to the workload of our colleagues.”The most affected group of health care workers, according to the study, were nurse's aides and nurses, who are overwhelmingly women and often immigrants. They spent more time with dying Covid-19 patients, faced poor working conditions and salaries and feared infecting family members.Desirée Ruiz is the nurse supervisor at Hospital del Mar’s critical care unit. Some nurses on her team have asked to take time off work, unable to cope with the constant stress and all the deaths.To prevent infections, patients are rarely allowed family visits, adding to their dependency on nurses. Delivering a patient’s last wishes or words to relatives on the phone is especially challenging, Ruiz said.“This is very hard for ... people who are holding the hand of these patients, even though they know they will end up dying,” she said.Ruiz, who organizes the nurses’ shifts and makes sure the ICU is always staffed adequately, is finding it harder and harder to do so.Unlike in the summer, when the number of cases fell and health workers were encouraged to take holidays, doctors and nurses have been working incessantly since the fall, when virus cases picked up again.The latest resurgence has nearly doubled the number of daily cases seen in November, and Spain now has the third-highest Covid-19 infection rate in Europe and the fourth-highest death toll, with more than 55,400 confirmed fatalities.But unlike many European countries, including neighboring Portugal, the Spanish health minister has for now ruled out the possibility of a new lockdown, relying instead on less drastic restrictions that aren’t as damaging to the economy but take longer to decrease the rate of infections.Alonso fears the latest surge of virus patients could be as detrimental to the mental health of medical staff as the shock of the pandemic's first months.“If we want to be cared for adequately, we also need to take care of the health care workers, who have suffered and are still suffering," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spains-virus-surge-hits-mental-health-of-front-line-workers-study-101611474354079.html
24-01-2021||World||Imran Khan delays notification on formation of Broadsheet inquiry committee||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has delayed the issuance of notification regarding the formation of the inquiry committee on the Broadsheet issue, said a senior cabinet member to The Express Tribune on Sunday.Earlier this week, the federal cabinet had ordered the inquiry, headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court or a high court, to examine the circumstances relating to the Broadsheet agreement and subsequent arbitration proceedings and present its report and recommendation in 45 days, reported The Express Tribune.The cabinet had decided that the inquiry committee would include a senior officer from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), a senior lawyer appointed by Prime Minister Imran Khan and an official of the office of the Advocate General for Pakistan, reported The Express Tribune.Later the government announced that the inquiry would be led by former Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed Sheikh. However, it has yet to issue the notification, which is creating doubts in people's minds.The Broadsheet LLC, based in the Isle of Man, was hired by the NAB during Musharraf's regime to trace out hidden assets of Pakistanis in foreign countries. The NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal amply proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targetting the corrupt, the Broadsheet was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.In March 2019, the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) gave a $20 million final award in the Broadsheet case. However, the NAB/Imran-led government did not pay that amount and due to interest, the award amount rose to $28.7 million by December 2020.The opposition as well as some lawyers have said that the government should give an explanation on $8 to $10 million interest which had been added to the award payment. The country faced $5,000 interest daily in the Broadsheet case, reported The Express Tribune.Moreover, the appointment of former Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed created widespread criticism from the opposition parties as well as some sections of the media.Saeed was employed as the deputy prosecutor general of NAB in the year 2000 for a period of one year. He was appointed as special prosecutor of NAB in 2001 to pursue cases before the accountability courts at Attock Fort and Rawalpindi.Legal experts have indicated that the appointment of Justice (retd) Sheikh could be challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the basis of conflict of interest because the former judge had worked as deputy/special prosecutor general of the NAB.They suggested that government must review its decision on his nomination. Similarly, they also suggest that Term of References (ToRs) - also approved by the cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday - should be reviewed, reported The Express Tribune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-delays-notification-on-formation-of-broadsheet-inquiry-committee-101611473932608.html
24-01-2021||World||Australia says ‘inevitable’ Google, others have to pay for news||Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it’s “inevitable” that Google and other tech behemoths will have to eventually pay for using media content, responding to the internet giant’s threat to disable its search engine in the country if it’s forced to pay local publishers for news.Google said Friday that a proposed law, intended to compensate publishers for the value their stories generate for the company, is “unworkable,” opposing the requirement it pay media companies for displaying snippets of articles in search results.As Google escalates a months-long standoff with the government, Frydenberg said Australia could either be a “world leader” in pushing for the code or wait to follow others in passing similar legislation.“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if the legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said.The threat is Google’s most potent yet as the digital giant tries to stem a flow of regulatory action worldwide, but such a radical step would hand an entire developed market to rivals. At least 94% of online searches in Australia go through the Alphabet Inc. unit, according to the local competition regulator.Facebook Inc., the only other company targeted by the legislation, also opposes the law in Australia. The social media platform reiterated at Friday’s hearing it’s considering blocking Australians from sharing news on Facebook if the law is pushed through.Frydenberg also accused the tech giants of shifting the goalposts when it came to expressing their resistance to the code, after they first rejected a final arbitration model, to now opposing the idea of paying for any clicks displayed under the search results.“If the clicks for media content is such a small proportion of their overall clicks on their search, then ultimately, the independent arbiters will find that it should reflect that payment for content -- reflecting the benefit to Google, to Facebook from having that media content on their sites,” he said.The legislation is designed to support a local media industry, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., that has struggled to adapt to the digital economy. Google’s tougher stance drew rebukes from lawmakers at the hearing, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying Friday that “we don’t respond to threats.”“It’s about control and power,” said Johan Lidberg, an associate professor at Melbourne’s Monash University who specializes in media and journalism. “They’re signaling to other regulators they’ll have a fight on their hands if they do this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-says-inevitable-google-others-have-to-pay-for-news-101611474098898.html
24-01-2021||World||Pakistan to launch 5G internet network in 2022-23: Report||Pakistan is planning to roll out the most advanced 5G internet in 2022-23 which will accelerate the download speed 10 times to one gigabit per second (Gbps) and widen economic activities in the country, a media report said on Sunday.Pakistan is developing a comprehensive roadmap for 5G technology readiness in the country. It is aimed at auctioning “spectrum for…5G services in the fiscal year 2023,” the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in its annual report 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic proved a blessing in disguise as the digital economy widened multi-fold during these testing times in Pakistan. The crisis has prompted regulators and stakeholders to improve digital infrastructure.Pakistan has kick-started its journey to make the most advanced 5G internet commercially available to consumers in 2022-23, The Express Tribune reported.The tested speed stands 10 times higher compared to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) on 4G internet in the world, it said.Earlier, mobile phone service providing firms successfully conducted a test trial of 5G services under a limited environment and on non-commercial basis in 2019 and 2020.Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Aminul Haque said the government had planned to launch 5G technology by December 2022, but experts are still sceptical, believing the country will take a much longer time (5-7 years) to roll out the next-generation technology.Haque made a test video call through 5G to China and said it was a wonderful experience. The voice was loud and clear, and the video quality was also wonderful, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-launch-5g-internet-network-in-2022-23-report-101611473841931.html

Rescue workers wrapped the barely responsive man in a blanket before taking him to hospital by ambulance.Later, the broadcaster said another three miners were brought out from a different section of the mine, including one who was injured. No further details were given.Twenty-two workers were trapped in the Hushan mine by the Jan. 10 blast in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in coastal Shandong province.One miner has died and 11 have not been in contact with rescue teams, according to a Xinhua report from last week.Officials said on Thursday it could take another two weeks to clear "severe blockages" before they could drill shafts to reach a group of 10 men who had been receiving supplies of food from the rescue team.State media said earlier however that rescuers were hoping to reach the 10 men in the mine's 5th section on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rescues-four-miners-after-14-days-trapped-underground-101611468709961.html
24-01-2021||World||Covid shot scarcity weighs on hopes for Biden’s global push||With a new president in the White House, the U.S. is re-engaging with the rest of the world to combat Covid-19. But for now, the Biden administration may hold back the one thing poorer countries desperately need: vaccines.One day after Joe Biden’s inauguration last week, his chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, pledged support for the World Health Organization, including participation in the Covax program to deploy vaccines globally. Even with the U.S. playing an active role, tough challenges remain in the effort to aid low- and middle-income nations.The U.S. has long been the WHO’s leading partner in battling diseases, including smallpox, polio and Ebola. And the superpower could still have a big impact in the bid to slow Covid-19 and tackle other threats after former President Donald Trump’s pullback. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, said he believes it’s imperative for wealthy countries to start sharing vaccines before it’s too late. But doing so, he said, presents a challenge as the virus continues to spread in the U.S.“When the U.S. is in an emergency, we start looking inward,” Gostin said in an interview. “Even if the rest of the world is on fire, we start looking inward.”The administration plans to fulfill U.S. financial obligations to the WHO and looks forward to working with Covax and its partners to maximize the program’s efforts, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. support may “not necessarily” include vaccines, Fauci told reporters Thursday at the White House.Helping others isn’t just a moral imperative. Containing the spread of the virus in other countries could help limit mutations that might make vaccines less effective. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals for global influence, China and Russia, are busy offering their own vaccines in the developing world, winning friends and influence with traditional American allies.As the pandemic extends into a second year and more contagious variants of the virus emerge, governments worldwide -- though mainly wealthy ones -- are rolling out vaccines to protect their populations. That’s triggered concern that by prioritizing their own interests, they’re ignoring the needs of less-fortunate countries while allowing the pathogen to advance.Vaccine advocates have urged wealthy nations to share some of the supplies they’ve snapped up in recent months and to follow the lead of Norway, which pledged to donate extra doses through Covax.While that may be a tough call, major economies could move in that direction when vaccines begin to curb severe illnesses and deaths at home, said David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and former WHO official.“It’s going to be very difficult for all countries with money and pre-purchased supplies to provide that to Covax and to countries that need it at this time,” Heymann said. “Once the political leaders who have made these promises to their countries do see an impact from the vaccines, they may be able to reconsider national allocations and contribute more to Covax.”49 CountriesAs of Jan. 18, vaccines had been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries, compared with just one of the world’s lowest-income countries, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general.But as Western countries have corralled supplies to protect their own populations, others are seeking to fill the void. Russia, for instance, has signed deals with a number of low- and middle-income countries for the Sputnik V vaccine that was approved last year. China too has extended vaccine financing and supplies to a number of countries.Meanwhile, the U.S. spent billions of dollars to develop and secure for its own use more than 1 billion doses from manufacturers, including Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca Plc, and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership. Yet only 20 million doses have been administered, according to Bloomberg’s tracker, covering about 6% of the population.That leaves a huge part of the U.S. still vulnerable to Covid-19, and increases the chance that the next three months of the pandemic, and the start of Biden’s term, could be the worst, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.Diplomatic ReasonsEven so, he said, the U.S. should also be more involved in the global program for both diplomatic and public-health reasons.“We want to reduce the burden on the entire world because it will help ourselves,” said Osterholm, who has been advising Biden on Covid. “Assisting the world is a diplomatic activity and a strategic activity.”The question is how. Biden is already restoring channels of funding and personnel that the previous administration withdrew, or threatened to withdraw. At the same time, the U.S. has earmarked more than $4 billion in additional funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a Covax partner that distributes immunizations to children in low-income nations.Many countries are now counting on Covax.The program, led by the WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said it is on track to deliver at least 2 billion doses -- about two-thirds of which will go to lower-income economies -- and to vaccinate at least a fifth of each participating country’s population by year’s end.Yet several leaders have questioned whether the program will get the vaccines it needs as governments prioritize their own supply deals through direct talks with manufacturers, the head of the WHO said last week. This is driving up prices and may lead to hoarding, chaos and social and economic disruption, he warned.Fully FundedEven if the U.S. can’t donate doses immediately, it could help ensure that Covax is fully funded, Gostin said. To achieve that goal, Covax estimates it needs to raise an added $2.8 billion this year.Perhaps one of the most important contributions the U.S. could make would be in the form of high-level diplomacy, said Stephen Morrison, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Global Health Policy Center. The country was absent from a virtual global fund-raising event supported by the European Union in May that secured pledges of about $8 billion.The U.S., which will soon hold the presidency of the United Nations Security Council, could facilitate a meeting of global leaders to coordinate efforts against a threat to the entire world, Morrison said. Key issues to discuss could include more financing of vaccine purchases, use of vaccine surpluses, debt relief and emergency humanitarian relief.“I think it’s inevitable that there will be some kind of summitry dedicated to these issues,” he said. “U.S. leadership has been the missing element and now it’s essential.”Affordable CostsThe Biden administration could be a help roll out immunizations worldwide by pushing manufacturers to provide vaccines at affordable costs, said Robert Yates, executive director of the Centre for Universal Health at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. Just days after Biden took office, Pfizer and BioNTech agreed to provide as many as 40 million vaccine doses to Covax after months of talks.Whatever form U.S. involvement takes, its re-emergence as partners and its highly regarded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will strengthen the global effort and is a “good sign” for everyone, according to Heymann, a former CDC staffer.“It’s what America really wants,” Heymann said. “It’s been a terrible time to see the U.S. ignore the CDC and, in general, the global health community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-shot-scarcity-weighs-on-hopes-for-biden-s-global-push-101611467209626.html
24-01-2021||World||Year after lockdown, Wuhan dissident more isolated than ever||One year after lockdown, Wuhan has long since sprung back to life — but Zhu Tao remains bunkered in his 14th-floor apartment, spending his days doomscrolling through news, playing virtual soccer on his PlayStation and feeling China is teetering on the brink of collapse.He has blown thousands of dollars, his life savings, stockpiling beef jerky and chocolate bars, bottles of water and sacks of rice, masks, alcohol and disinfecting wipes, and a $900 solar panel.Haunting Zhu is the fear that the virus might return — that once again, the government will conceal the truth, and once again, Wuhan will fall under lockdown.“I’m in a state of eating and waiting for death, eating and waiting for death,” Zhu said, with a buzzcut he trimmed himself, since he does not dare to venture out to the barber. “People like me might be the minority, but I take it very seriously.”Zhu, a 44-year-old smelter at the city’s state-run iron and steel works, is well outside the mainstream in China. He is a hardboiled government critic, an on-and-off demonstrator, a supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement.He and others willing to publicly air such views are ridiculed, dismissed or silenced. They are a minority in an increasingly authoritarian and prosperous China, where there is less tolerance for protest and less appetite to do so.Early in the Wuhan outbreak, which would later spread around the globe and kill over 2 million people, Zhu ignored state media reports that downplayed the virus and stayed home, a move that may have saved him, his wife and his son from infection.For a few fleeting months, as public anger erupted at authorities who hid critical information on the coronavirus, Zhu felt his early caution warranted, his deep suspicion of officials vindicated.But as winter mellowed into spring and Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted, the mood shifted. Now, the rich kids of Wuhan down pricey bottles of whiskey and bop to crashing electronica at the city’s swank nightclubs. Thousands throng Jianghan road, the city’s premier shopping street.Once seen as prophetic, Zhu has now become a pariah, his anti-state sentiment more and more at odds with government orthodoxy. He has alienated his in-laws and neighbors and has been detained, subjected to surveillance and censored.Bracing for another wave of infection, he wonders how it’s possible that everyone around him is carrying on with life as usual.“This is the biggest historical event in the past century,” Zhu said. “But everyone has gone back to their lives, just like before the epidemic. ... How can they be so numb, so indifferent, as though they barely experienced anything at all?”Zhu grew up in the 1980s, a politically open era in China, when teachers at times touched on concepts like democracy and freedom of speech after the disastrous tumult of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution.It suited Zhu, given his self-described “very naughty, very rebellious” nature and his intellectual instincts, reflected in the way he peppers his language with literary references despite never having gone to college.He was just a kid during the 1989 Tiananmen protests, when hundreds of thousands took to Beijing’s central square to demand democratic rights. But in the years after the bloody military crackdown on the protesters, he read more about it, growing sympathetic even as others grew cynical, indifferent or even supportive of Communist Party rule, won over by China’s growing prosperity.When Zhu first went online over a decade ago, he discovered others shared his way of thinking. China hadn’t yet developed the sophisticated internet police force that patrols the web today, and uncensored news about the government constantly exploded online.The first controversy to catch Zhu’s eye was a scandal over tainted milk powder that killed six babies and sickened tens of thousands more. He joined chat groups and get-togethers and slowly slipped into dissident circles.After President Xi Jinping — China’s most authoritarian leader in decades — came to power, Zhu’s views brought him more and more trouble. In 2014, he was detained for a month after donning a black shirt and a white flower at a Wuhan plaza in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, estranging him from his teenage son.But when a mysterious respiratory illness began spreading through Wuhan early last year, Zhu's deep-seated skepticism toward the government suddenly proved prescient. After seeing rumors of the disease in late December 2019, Zhu began warning friends and family. Many brushed him off as an obstinate gadfly, but his wife and son stayed home, saving them from outings that would soon sicken relatives.The first to fall ill was his wife’s aunt, who started coughing after an appointment with an eye doctor at a hospital where the virus was spreading. Next was his wife’s cousin, who had accompanied her to the same hospital. Then it was his neighbor’s mother.Then came the lockdown, proclaimed with no warning on Jan. 23 at 2 in the morning. Wuhan stumbled into the history books, the epicenter of the biggest quarantine in history. The virus ravaged the city of 11 million, flooding hospitals and killing thousands, including his wife's aunt on Jan. 24.Zhu took grim satisfaction in being proved correct. He watched on social media as public anger exploded, reaching a fever pitch in February with the death of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who was punished for warning others of the very disease that would claim his life.That night, Zhu was glued to his phone, scrolling through hundreds of posts decrying censorship. There were hashtags demanding freedom of speech. There was a quote from Li to a Chinese magazine shortly before his death: “A healthy society shouldn’t just have one voice”.By early next morning, many of the posts had been purged by censors. On his wife's cousin death certificate, doctors wrote she died of an ordinary lung infection, though she had tested positive for the coronavirus. That deepened Zhu’s suspicions that cases were being grossly undercounted.“I was so angry it hurt,” he said. “I had nowhere to vent my emotions. You want to kill someone, you’re so angry, you know?"The outbreak strained Zhu’s relationships. His neighbor, a childhood friend, quarreled with Zhu after doctors told the neighbor’s mother that she had just a regular lung infection.“I questioned him. `How can you be sure that what the hospital told you was the truth?'” Zhu recalled. “I said you should still be careful.”A week later, his friend’s mother passed away. On her death certificate, coronavirus was given as the cause. They argued the day she died, with Zhu’s friend accusing him of cursing his mother. The two haven’t spoken since.In April, the lockdown was lifted after 76 days. But as others crept back to work, Zhu asked for a year’s medical leave and shut himself in. His quarantine has lasted nearly 400 days and counting.He refused to go to his cousin's and aunt’s funerals that summer, even though there were no longer any new cases in Wuhan. His angry in-laws cut off contact.Pockets of like-minded people still dot China, from renegade intellectuals in Beijing to a punk cafe in Inner Mongolia where posters and stickers read “preventable and controllable” –- quietly jeering the boilerplate phrase officials used to downplay the virus.In Wuhan, circles of dissidents gather on encrypted chats to swap intelligence. At small gatherings over tea, they grouse about inconsistencies in the party line with a hint of pride, saying they saved themselves from the virus by not trusting the government.But under the watchful gaze of state cameras and censors, there is little room to organize or connect. Ahead of the lockdown anniversary this year, police spirited at least one dissenter out of Wuhan. He was bei luyou, or “touristed,” the playful phrase used by activists to describe how police take troublemakers on involuntary vacations at sensitive moments.In his self-quarantine, Zhu has found solace in literature. He is drawn to Soviet writers who poked fun at Moscow’s vast propaganda apparatus.

24-01-2021||World||Citizenship data is latest rollback of Trump census efforts||The US Census Bureau is suspending efforts to create neighborhood-level statistics on the citizenship and age of residents, using 2020 census data, in the latest rollback of Trump administration census-related initiatives that critics feared would be used to favor Republicans and whites during the drawing of state and local districts.As part of an order President Joe Biden signed Wednesday on the 2020 census, the Census Bureau said Friday that it would discontinue efforts to create citizenship tabulations at the city-block level using 2020 census data combined with administrative records.Among his first acts as president, Biden's order revoked two Trump directives related to the 2020 census. The first attempted to discern the citizenship status of every US resident through administrative records, and the second sought to exclude people in the US illegally from the numbers used for apportioning congressional seats among the states.Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, had ordered the production of the block-level citizenship data in 2018.After Wednesday's order by Biden, the Census Bureau said none of the data from the 2020 census would include information on citizenship or immigration status, at any geographic level.Citizen Voting Age by Race and Ethnicity (CVAP) data were created almost two decades ago to help assess whether minority communities were getting equal opportunities to elect candidates of their choice. The data currently comes from American Community Survey estimates.But in the mid-2010s, an influential GOP adviser noted in a report that using adult-age citizen figures as the basis for redrawing state and local districts, instead of the total population, would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.The Trump administration made several attempts to gather citizenship data through the 2020 census, including adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, which was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2019.The efforts at gathering the citizenship data were challenged by civil rights groups in federal court in Maryland. A spokeswoman for one of the plaintiffs, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the group needed to assess where the Census Bureau was in the process before dismissing the Maryland lawsuit.Jeffrey Wice, a Democratic redistricting expert, hailed the revocations of the Trump administration's census directives.“This is a major step towards an honest and fair redistricting process, helping ensure that everyone is represented in new districts,” Wice said.But Adam Kincaid, a leader of Republican redistricting efforts, said in a statement that the Biden administration was merely “concealing critical information” about the citizen population in the U.S.“For an administration that claims to be guided by facts, it is concerning that they are so selective of which facts they release," Kincaid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizenship-data-is-latest-rollback-of-trump-census-efforts-101611455002011.html
24-01-2021||World||Indonesia sees risks to growth on virus curbs, natural disasters||Indonesia sees downside risks for economic growth in the first quarter as the government imposed more restrictions to curb a worsening coronavirus outbreak, said the finance minister.The first quarter is “very tough,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on Saturday. “We hope in February and March we can still catch up despite the January which is going to be very tough because of Covid and natural disasters.”She expects the full-year 5% growth target to still be achievable as the mass vaccination program gives “hope and optimism.”President Joko Widodo expected the economy to rebound as soon as the start of this year, calling 2021 as the year when the country can see a turnaround after last year plunging into its first recession in two decades. But surging numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths prompted the government to limit people’s movement in key economic centers of Java and Bali.The government also had to contend with a string of natural disasters, including recent floods in Kalimantan, earthquakes in Sulawesi and erupting volcanoes in Java, though the impact on the budget so far is still manageable, Indrawati said.The country is grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak in Southeast Asia and is still reporting record-high numbers every few days. It’s banking on a mass inoculation program that’s been slow to pick up. Since Jokowi kicked off the campaign on Jan. 13, more than 132,000 people have received their first doses as of Friday, about 22% of the government’s target for January. Indonesia aims to vaccinate more than 180 million people by the end of the year.Government’s HomeworkIndonesia had to boost its budget deficit to 6.09% of gross domestic product last year, double the regulated ceiling of 3%, to afford stimulus packages including cash handouts, free electricity and credit guarantees to buffer the impact of the pandemic. This year, the government expects to be able to narrow the gap to 5.7% as it can draw on unspent money from last year to buy vaccines and reallocate spending toward more urgent needs, Indrawati said.After approving a massive overhaul of investment rules through the so-called omnibus law in 2020, the government now seeks to reform the financial sector. Many existing rules for banks and capital markets are outdated as they were set up in the early 2000s, after the Asian financial crisis, the finance minister said.She is also focused on raising tax ratios, while improving the way capital flows toward actual investments in the country, such as through the new wealth fund.Indonesia has a lot of potential to offer, “at the same time we also recognize we have a lot of homework to do to improve our investment climate,” Indrawati said. “In this very extraordinary situation we also communicate very clearly in the most credible way how we respond to that extraordinary situation with extraordinary policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-sees-risks-to-growth-on-virus-curbs-natural-disasters-101611452350849.html

On January 14, India had called for an immediate stop to the targeted attacks in Afghanistan and sought a comprehensive ceasefire to take forward efforts to usher in peace.Sullivan “underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort”, said a readout from the US national security council.

Among those detained were Navalny’s wife Yulia Navalnaya, who was later released, and his prominent aide Lyubov Sobol.“What a joy that you are here!” Navalnaya wrote before being detained and posting a picture of herself from inside a police van. The protests in Moscow were estimated to be the largest demonstrators since 2019 when Navalny supporters rallied to demand free local elections.Navalny had called on Russians to protest this week after surviving a near-fatal suspected poisoning with Novichok and returning to Moscow following months of treatment in Germany, only to be arrested immediately on arrival.Some protesters marched towards the Kremlin, while others blocked Tverskaya Street, the Russian capital’s main thoroughfare. Police clashed with the demonstrators in the city centre and hit them with truncheons.Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund said on Twitter said that “an incredible number” of people had gathered in the capital. Moscow police, which are accused of downplaying turnout at rallies, said 4,000 turned up.Thousands took to the streets in the Far East, Siberia and the Urals including Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg.Russia says US diplomats published rally routesRussia on Saturday accused the US embassy in Moscow of publishing routes of planned demonstrations in support of Navalny and demanded an explanation from US diplomats.“Yesterday, the US embassy in Moscow published ‘protest routes’ in Russian cities and tossed around information about a ‘march on the Kremlin,’” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-2-000-held-at-anti-putin-rallies-101611450307712.html

He denies wrongdoing, but the protesters say he cannot run the country properly while under indictment.The protests have taken place each week since last summer, primarily at a Jerusalem square near Netanyahu’s official residence, and continued despite lower turnout in the cold winter nights.In March, Israel will hold its fourth national election in less than two years, and Netanyahu is facing further challenges from defectors within his Likud party.The government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis has also fueled the protests. With the country's third lockdown still in place, Israel's economy has been hit hard by virus restrictions amid surging infection rates.By Saturday, more than 2.5 million of Israel’s 9 million population had received at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine amid Israel’s world-leading inoculation drive, which Netanyahu has placed at the center of his reelection campaign.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.Garret Miller, who is from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was arrested Friday after being named in a five-count federal complaint.Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. They also say he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to the liberal Ocasio-Cortez.In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns," an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope," the affidavit states.After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol," according to an FBI affidavit.Ocasio-Cortez on Friday posted Miller's charging documents on Twitter and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed."Miller's attorney, Clint Broden, said in an email to The Associated Press that Miller regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump."“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future," Broden said. “He looks forward to putting all of this behind him."Miller is scheduled for a detention hearing on Monday.“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion," Broden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texan-man-charged-in-capitol-riot-tweeted-assassinate-aoc-fbi-101611449058175.html

Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.Prosecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.Rittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.According to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse's conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse “shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender."He is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.Prosecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.According to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy's Pub with two men as they made the “OK” sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shooter-can-t-associate-with-supremacists-judge-101611448066287.html

First, the PIA pilots were humiliated around the world and now the airline has fallen to such a point. Pakistan never saw such days ever," Maryam said.Senior PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday said that it was a decision that destroyed Pakistan's reputation just because of the "incompetence and ego worship" of the prime minister and aviation minister.The News International reported that an advisory has been issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS) which states: "Due to an ongoing investigation of the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] Pakistan...due to dubious licences, caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators."According to the Pakistan daily, the UN advisory has been recommended to agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN High Commission for Refugees, UN Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and many others.In the light of this development, that UN officials working in the country can not travel by any Pakistan-registered airline, even within Pakistan.According to The News International, UN advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a new automated system, which is linked with the revised global air travel safety policy.Back in December last year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had extended a ban on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for three months, despite the Pakistani officials' expectations that the ban would be lifted.The EASA had informed that the PIA that the ban would only be lifted after a safety audit of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dawn reported. The EASA had in July 2019 suspended the authorisation for PIA to operate flights in the EU member states due to safety concerns.The suspension had come after it was revealed that the credentials of hundreds of Pakistani pilots were "dubious". Meanwhile, PIA has suffered a loss of billions of rupees since the suspension of flight operations to and from the European Union and the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-lambasts-pm-imran-khan-after-un-restricts-staff-from-flying-by-pakistani-airlines-101611447707976.html

Both of those moves reversed former President Donald Trump's climate policies.John Kerry, a former US secretary of state who is Biden's special climate envoy, told the mayors' meeting that tackling climate change did not mean a diminishment of lifestyle, such as driving less or not being able to eat meat.But the Biden administration and mayors and other local leaders will have to persuade Americans that curbing climate change "can be the greatest economic transformation in global history," Kerry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-to-unveil-climate-change-policies-adviser-says-101611446551115.html

24-01-2021||World||11 Iraqi fighters killed in IS attack: Report||At least 11 fighters from Iraq's state-sponsored Hashed al-Shaabi force were killed in an ambush by the Islamic State group north of the capital on Saturday, Hashed security sources said.The jihadists used light weapons and the cover of darkness to target the Hashed east of Tikrit, the capital of Iraq's Salahaddin province, two days after a twin suicide attack claimed by the group killed 32 people in Baghdad."IS launched an attack on the Hashed's Brigade 22," said one of the unit's officers Abu Ali al-Maliki.Maliki told AFP the brigade commander was among those killed before reinforcements from the federal police came to the unit's aid.Hashed security sources said the total toll was 11 dead and 10 wounded.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but security sources interviewed by AFP blamed IS.Iraq declared the group territorially defeated in late 2017, but has continued to battle extremist sleeper cells, mostly in the country's mountainous and desert areas.Local troops have been aided by a US-led coalition, which first intervened to help fight IS in 2014 and continues to provide training, surveillance and air strikes in support of anti-jihadist operations.The coalition has significantly drawn down its troop numbers over the past year, with the US shrinking its force from 5,200 to 2,500.A worn-down militaryLocal and Western sources have expressed concern over the readiness of Iraq's security forces, who have been worn down by the spread of Covid-19, political infighting and corruption.This week's attacks may be more illustrative of those accumulated shortfalls than any significant IS comeback, experts have said.Following the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraq's security forces had to be effectively rebuilt from the ground up, relying heavily on training by foreign armies.But with Covid-19 spreading fast through Iraq's bases, coalition troops put a halt to all training operations.Military sources and observers also cited political divisions within local security forces between units trained by the US and those -- like the Hashed -- who have received support from Iraq's powerful neighbour Iran.Navigating those tensions has been a major challenge for Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, seen as being friendly with the US.Kadhemi has relied heavily on the US-trained Counter-Terrorism Service for a range of missions, from hunting down IS cells to reigning in groups launching rockets at the US embassy in Baghdad.In an effort to bring in more names and faces he trusts, Kadhemi ordered an overhaul of Iraq's security leadership late Thursday, including a new federal police commander and chief of the elite Falcons Unit.But he had to walk back some of those decisions within a day following political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-iraqi-fighters-killed-in-is-attack-report-101611434448936.html
