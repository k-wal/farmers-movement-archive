Pelosi must win support from 50% of members voting -- during a global pandemic -- to claim another term leading the chamber.“I’m fine,” Pelosi said last week when asked whether she has the support to continue as speaker, after the Democratic majority shrunk to 11 votes from 37 after Republican gains in the November election.For the past two years, Pelosi has been the Democrats’ main foil for President Donald Trump, and that’s helped keep her caucus unified despite the ideological spread from progressives like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to centrists like Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. For the next term, Pelosi’s challenge is to keep the party marching behind President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda.Pelosi, 80, the only woman to hold the speaker’s gavel, faced a mini-revolt in 2019 after Democrats regained the House majority in the midterm elections. Fifteen members of her party cast their ballots for someone else as speaker or voted present, and at least 10 of them will be part of the Democratic delegation again this year.Republicans have tried to stoke dissent among Democrats, particularly those from closely divided districts. Dan Conston, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super-PAC for House Republicans, tweeted that, “We view any weak-kneed Democrats voting present or *conveniently* skipping the vote as a move to enable Pelosi and the left’s radical agenda -- we’ll be sure voters know exactly what they did.”Republican members will nominate their leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, for speaker. But the nominee of the majority party typically sails to victory, and there’s been no late entry by another Democrat seeking to try to topple Pelosi.Roll CallThere still may be some tense moments during the roll call vote, which will take longer than usual and extend into the evening due to procedures in place because of the pandemic. The winner must gain an actual majority of votes cast by both parties. Democrats hold a 222-211 advantage in the new Congress -- with two House seats currently still open -- leaving Pelosi little room for party defections.“It is clear that we’re going to need to unite around a Democratic speaker and not Kevin McCarthy,” said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, chair of the 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus.“I have no doubt in my mind we are going to elect Nancy,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.Each lawmaker who shows up on Sunday can nominate and vote for people who aren’t even members of Congress, or even vote “present,” rather than for their party’s nominee, a move that lowers the threshold for achieving a majority.If no candidate emerges with a simple majority of all the votes cast for a named person, the balloting would continue until someone passes the 50% threshold. The last multiple-ballot speaker election was in 1923, when the winner wasn’t decided until the ninth ballot.‘Bad Optics’Ross Baker, a professor of American politics at Rutgers University, said Pelosi will benefit from “consensus across ideological lines in the House caucus that a public battle right now is bad optics.” Democrats need to show they’re ready and able to work with the incoming Biden administration to get things accomplished, he said.The 10 returning Democrats who didn’t vote for Pelosi in 2019 are representatives Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Abigail Spanberger of Virginia; Mikie Sherill of New Jersey; Jared Golden of Maine; Jason Crow of Colorado; Ron Kind of Wisconsin; Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania; Kurt Schrader of Oregon; Kathleen Rice of New York; and Jim Cooper of Tennessee.Among those who’ve publicly stated their intentions, Slotkin, who represents a Republican-leaning district, has already said she would vote “present,” as she did in 2019. Golden, also from a swing district, has said he will not vote for Pelosi.Schrader’s office confirmed he’ll back Pelosi this time around, as will Cooper. “I will vote for Pelosi for Speaker because she has led a contentious Democratic caucus well during the pandemic and the Trump presidency,” Cooper said.Two newly elected progressives who won their seats after ousting long-time Democrats, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, haven’t committed.“You’ll find out when my vote is tallied,” Bowman said in a recent interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” On the same program, Bush said that, “What I’m going to do is make sure that the voices of the people of St. Louis are heard, and that we have what we need, and so you’ll find out then.”Next GenerationOcasio-Cortez has been among the most vocal Democratic House members calling for current leadership to give way to a younger generation. But in an interview with the Intercept published in December, she said, “the left isn’t really making a plan” for how to accomplish that in the near future. Her office didn’t return emails seeking comment on Pelosi’s election.Pelosi committed in 2018 to not seeking the speakership beyond 2022 in response to demands from younger Democrats seeking generational change. Talking with reporters last month, Pelosi declined to directly respond to a question about that commitment stands.“We never expected to have another term now,” she said. “I consider this a gift.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-seeks-speakership-with-slim-margin-in-new-congress/story-GfGTJuy2Uc30MqWowarwaK.html
03-01-2021||World||‘The deaths are real deaths’: Anthony Fauci rejects Donald Trump’s claim of coronavirus death toll being ‘exaggerated’||Two top US health officials on Sunday disputed a claim by President Donald Trump that federal data on Covid-19 cases and deaths in the United States is overblown, and both expressed optimism that the pace of vaccinations is picking up.“The deaths are real deaths,” Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on ABC News’ This Week, adding that jam-packed hospitals and stressed-out healthcare workers are “not fake. That’s real.”Fauci and US Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who appeared on CNN’s State of the Union, defended the accuracy of coronavirus data published by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after Trump attacked the agency’s tabulation methods.“The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of the @CDCgov’s ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries, many of whom report, purposely, very inaccurately and low,” Trump wrote on Twitter.Trump, a Republican who leaves office on January 20 after losing a bid for a second term to Democrat Joe Biden, has frequently has downplayed the severity of the pandemic. He has also scorned and ignored federal recommendations for containing the spread.More than 20 million people have been infected in the United States and nearly 347,000 have died – or one out of every 950 US residents - since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the CDC.“From a public health perspective, I have no reason to doubt those numbers and I think people need to be very aware that it’s not just about the deaths,” Adams said. “It’s about the hospitalizations, the capacity.”Fauci and Adams expressed optimism that the pace of vaccinating Americans against the virus is accelerating after a slow start. More than 4.2 million people have been inoculated since December 14 with one of two vaccines, far short of the Trump administration’s goal of 20 million by the end of 2020.“We wanted to get to 20 million, but some glimmer of hope is that in the last 72 hours, they’ve gotten 1.2 million doses into peoples’ arms, which is an average of about 500,000 a day,” Fauci said. “We are not where we want to be. There’s no doubt about that. But I think we can get there.”He said he believed that the number of daily vaccinations could be expanded to 1 million and called for “a real partnership” between the federal and state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-deaths-are-real-deaths-anthony-fauci-rejects-donald-trump-s-claim-of-coronavirus-death-toll-being-exaggerated/story-6lbVD2bL3hMAs1o5Wg7mkK.html
03-01-2021||World||Islamic State claims responsibility for attack on Pakistan’s Shi’ite minority that killed 11||Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Sunday that killed 11 miners from Pakistan’s minority Shi’ite Hazaras in Baluchistan province.The attack took place early on Sunday morning in the Mach area of Bolan district around 100 kms southeast of Baluchistan’s capital Quetta, killing the miners who were in a shared residential room near the coal mine where they worked, officials said.“The throats of all coal miners have been slit, after their hands were tied behind their backs and (they were) blind folded,” a security official told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to media.A video clip making the rounds on WhatsApp groups, apparently shot by a first responder, showed three bodies lying outside the room and the rest inside in pools of blood.“The condemnable killing of 11 innocent coal miners in Mach Baluchistan is yet another cowardly inhuman act of terrorism,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a tweet.“Have asked Frontier Constabulary to use all resources to apprehend these killers and bring them to justice,” he said.Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, through its Amaq news agency via its Telegram communications channel.The attack came after a relative lull in nearly a year of violence against the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority in the province.In April, a market suicide bombing killed 18 people, half of whom were Hazaras.Following Sunday’s attack, members of the Hazara minority in Quetta blocked the western bypass and set fire to tyres to protest against the killings.Baluchistan is the focus of the $60-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned between western China and Pakistan’s southern deepwater port of Gwadar.Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.The attacks in Afghanistan have been claimed by an affiliate of Islamic State.In 2013, three bombings killed more than 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods in Quetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-attack-on-pakistan-s-shi-ite-minority-that-killed-11/story-QAzDiWSifwvcGZSwuYFLLL.html
03-01-2021||World||Anthony Fauci says US Covid-19 vaccine pace picking up after slow start||The US government’s top infectious-disease doctor said the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is picking up speed and could be fully on track within a week or so.“It’s just trying to get a massive vaccine program started and getting off on the right foot. The important thing is to see what’s happening in the next week, to week and a half,” Anthony Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week.”On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams said the initial vaccination program had been superimposed upon a surge of coronavirus cases, which has stressed health care resources in many areas, and on the holiday season.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that in the past 72 hours, about 1.5 million vaccine doses have been administered, or about 500,000 per day, a substantial pickup in pace.“We are not where we want to be, no doubt about that, but I think we can get there if we really accelerate,” he said on ABC.Operation Warp Speed, the federal effort to develop and distribute a vaccine against the coronavirus, has so far failed to meet projections for how quickly people will be inoculated. Two vaccines have been approved for use in the US.Health Agencies StrainedOfficials have blamed the inoculation delays on a delicate vaccine with complex storage requirements, uncertainty over the supply of doses and strain on local health agencies already facing historic challenges.On NBC Fauci noted the “multiple stages” involved, from allocation to staging and distribution, and finally getting shots into people’s arms.While the goal to have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of 2020 wasn’t achieved, that many doses should at least be shipped by the end of the first week in January, Fauci said.About 4.28 million doses had been administrated by Jan. 2, according to the Bloomberg News vaccine tracker.The number of US cases has exceeded 20 million, with more than 1 million in New York state alone. U.S. deaths attributed to the coronavirus passed 350,000 on Saturday.President Donald Trump on Sunday called cases and deaths in the U.S. “far exaggerated” in a tweet criticizing the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The numbers are real,” Fauci said. “Those are real numbers, real people, and real deaths.” On CNN, Adams said he had “no reason to doubt those numbers.”New York state on Saturday passed 1 million Covid-19 cases, after a somber year in which more than 30,000 of its residents died from the virus.More than a third of the state’s total cases were reported in December as cold weather nudged people indoors, holidays increased social gatherings and residents tired of restrictions.“We need to double down on the things we talk about all the time,” notably wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding “congregate” settings, especially indoors, Fauci said on NBC.The current jump in cases “was predictable” given travel and socializing over the holidays, he said.Asked about the newer, more infectious Covid-19 strain that’s reached the US and elsewhere in the world from the UK, Fauci repeated his advice from the start of the pandemic: “The best way to counter this is to do the public health measures that prevent spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-us-covid-19-vaccine-pace-picking-up-after-slow-start/story-2vc8TUaszBFiL24ByDkqkL.html
03-01-2021||World||Britons flying home to Spain caught in post-Brexit red tape||Blame Covid-19 travel restrictions or Brexit but whatever the cause, some British citizens trying to return to their homes in Spain this weekend have been barred from boarding flights.Airlines are refusing documents that before Brexit had been valid proof of the Britons’ status as residents in Spain.Their ordeal comes amid heightened travel restrictions due to a coronavirus variant that has been blamed for faster contagion in the UK and highlights the bureaucratic complexities resulting from Britain’s departure from the 27-nation European Union (EU).Both Spanish and British authorities said Sunday that the green-colored certificate of EU citizenship with a foreign national identification number issued by Spain is still valid for British citizens residing in Spain under the bilateral provisions that followed the UK’s withdrawal from the bloc on December 31.But the travelers say British Airways and Iberia have been refusing to let them board for the past two days. The airlines, part of the IAG group, didn’t immediately respond to requests Sunday for comment from The Associated Press.Around 300,000 British citizens are registered as permanent residents in Spain, although before Brexit, many more had been living full or part-time in the country without officially registering.Patricia Moody, a 69-year-old retiree who has called the southern Spanish town of Zurgena home for nearly four years, was among a group of at least nine people unable to board a Madrid-bound BA/Iberia flight from London’s Heathrow Airport on Saturday.Moody said she and her husband, who she says needs to see his doctor back in Spain, have spent 1,900 pounds ($2,600) on getting tested for the virus, travelling to the airport and booking new tickets after they were refused boarding. Their second attempt was also futile.“Throughout all the months of negotiating Brexit, we were always assured that nothing would change for us,” she said. Referring to the airlines and authorities in both countries, she added: “It’s horrendous and we are suffering because of their incompetence.”Following the discovery of the coronavirus variant in the UK, Spain, like many other European nations, has banned all travel from the British isles except for Spanish citizens and UK citizens with residency rights.Spain has been rolling out a new system to register permanent foreign residents called TIE but it’s suffering a backlog due to the high number of requests.Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AP that under the circumstances both proofs of application for the TIE and the “green certificate” for EU citizens is still valid to travel for British residents under the new health restrictions in place until Jan. 19.“This should not be happening,” said the UK embassy in Spain said in a Facebook post. “The Spanish authorities have today re-confirmed that the green residency document will be accepted for travel to return to Spain, as stated in our travel advice.”But Sam Dakin, a 32-year-old English-language teacher based in Barcelona for the last four years, and his partner, who has been in the Spanish city for 8 years, said they needed more assurances before they could rebook flights.The couple had been blocked from flying Saturday morning despite carrying their certificate and then were refused boarding on another flight Saturday evening that British Airways had initially said they could take.“Just because the government adviser said that we could travel, we don’t know whether that will happen when we turn up at the counters,” Dakin said. “We just don’t know where we’re going to get answers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britons-flying-home-to-spain-caught-in-post-brexit-red-tape/story-y36lkZ3lAGsVJRZtXEVsrO.html
03-01-2021||World||Video of Egypt virus patients’ ICU death stirs controversy||The deaths of at least four coronavirus patients early Sunday at a public Egyptian hospital have stirred controversy after a video of nurses struggling to keep the patients alive was shared widely on social media.The governor of Sharqia province denied allegations by a relative of one of the patients that the deaths were caused by a lack of oxygen at the government-run intensive care unit treating Covid-19 patients. Gov. Mamdouh Ghorab said the patients died because they suffered chronic diseases in addition to the virus.Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with a population of more than 100 million people, is facing a surge in confirmed virus cases and renewed calls for the government to impose a lockdown to contain a second wave of the pandemic.The four dead were two women in their 60s and two men, 76 and 44 years old, according to a local news outlet. Prosecutors in Sharqia said the deaths were being investigated.The deaths follow similar allegations by a relative last week that two patients died because of a lack of oxygen at a government-run hospital elsewhere in the Nile Delta. Prosecutors in Menoufia province have launched an investigation into the cause of the deaths Friday.Egypt’s top health authority has announced that a Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm has been approved for emergency use, and inoculations would begin within two weeks. In televised comments Saturday, Health Minister Hala Zayed said negotiations were also underway to procure two other vaccines — one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, as well as one from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said last month that the government has contracted to purchase 20 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to the state-run Al-Ahram daily.Egypt has seen a spike in daily reported Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. The Health Ministry announced over 1,400 new cases and 54 deaths on Saturday, one of the highest official daily tallies since the start of the pandemic last year.Overall, Egypt has reported 140,878 confirmed cases, including 7,741 deaths. However, the actual number of Covid-19 cases in Egypt are thought to be far higher, in part due to limited testing and uncounted patients who are being treated at home or in private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/video-of-egypt-virus-patients-icu-death-stirs-controversy/story-MmSawX8bw0Vu2gKNZU7v6N.html
03-01-2021||World||Pope criticises people going on holiday to flee coronavirus lockdowns||Pope Francis condemned on Sunday people who had gone abroad on holiday to escape coronavirus lockdowns, saying they needed to show greater awareness of the suffering of others.Speaking after his weekly noon blessing, Francis said he had read newspaper reports of people catching flights to flee government curbs and seek fun elsewhere.“They didn’t think about those who were staying at home, of the economic problems of many people who have been hit hard by the lockdown, of the sick people. (They thought) only about going on holiday and having fun,” the pope said.“This really saddened me,” he said in a video address from the library of the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace.The traditional Angelus blessing is normally given from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square, but it was moved indoors to prevent any crowds gathering and limit the spread of Covid-19.“We don’t know what 2021 will reserve for us, but what all of us can do together is make a bit more of an effort to take care of each other. There is the temptation to take care only of our own interests,” he added.Many countries have imposed strict restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which has killed more than 84 million people worldwide, according to the latest Reuters tally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-criticises-people-going-on-holiday-to-flee-coronavirus-lockdowns/story-I0lkBQgnHcsMiigrF2obWI.html

Brazil has yet to approve any vaccine.Fiocruz will apply for emergency use of the vaccine by Wednesday, its president, Nísia Trindade, said last week.Brazil has recorded the second-deadliest outbreak of Covid-19 after only the United States.

03-01-2021||World||Airport in Yemen receives first flight since deadly attack||A plane landed Sunday at the airport in Yemen’s southern port city of Aden, officials said, the first commercial flight to arrive since the deadly missile attack last week on the facility that killed at least 25 people and wounded 110 others.The attack Wednesday took place just moments after a plane carrying members of Yemen’s Cabinet landed on a flight from the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.Three precision-guided missiles that struck the airport targeted the plane carrying the Cabinet members, the arrival hall and the airport’s VIP lounge, according to Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.On Sunday, the airport received a Yemenia airline flight arriving from Sudan’s capital Khartoum, according to Yemen’s state-run SABA news agency. Yemeni Interior Minister Ibrahim Haidan and Aden Gov. Ahmed Lamlas were at the airport to receive the flight, the report said.Haidan said the speedy reopening of the airport has underscored “the determination of the government to overcome obstacles and face the difficulties” caused by Wednesday’s attack.The attack killed at least 25 people, including three workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross, and wounded 110 others.The war in Yemen started in 2014 when Iran-backed Houthi rebels overran the north and the capital, Sanaa. The following year, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to wage war on the Houthis and to restore President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s government to power. Hadi has been living in Riyadh.Yemen’s internationally recognized government has accused the Houthis of carrying out the airport attack as well as a drone assault on the Mashiq Palace in Aden shortly after the prime minister and his Cabinet were transferred there Wednesday.Houthi officials have denied being behind the attack and have sought to blame unspecified groups in the Saudi-led coalition. The rebel leaders have not offered any evidence or answered requests for comment.The Yemeni ministers were returning to Aden from Riyadh after being sworn in last week as part of a Cabinet reshuffle. The changes were part of a deal with the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council. The STC is an umbrella group of militias seeking to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.Yemen’s internationally recognized government has worked mostly from self-imposed exile in Riyadh during the country’s years-long civil war.Meanwhile, in the strategic port city of Hodeida, three people including two women and a man, were killed when a shell landed Friday at a wedding hall in al-Hawk district while a wedding celebration was taking place, local officials and the U.N. said.The officials said the shelling also wounded at least eight others, and that both warring sides, the Houthis and internationally recognized government traded accusations of responsibility for the attack.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.The head of the U.N. mission to Hodeida, retired Gen. Abhijit Guha, condemned the shelling.Yemen’s war has killed more than 112,000 people and created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airport-in-yemen-receives-first-flight-since-deadly-attack/story-sco0julwVShGWkbd9VZKLL.html

The United States blames Iran-backed militias for regular rocket attacks on US facilities in Iraq, including near the US embassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.The US military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran last week, but the bombers have since left the region.On Saturday evening thousands of mourners gathered on the highway that leads to Baghdad airport, where Soleimani and Muhandis were killed, in a simulated funeral procession staged in tribute to the two men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraqis-chanting-anti-us-slogans-mark-year-since-soleimani-killing/story-4Q8O4Gq5z4CfnZbbFX2wqO.html
03-01-2021||World||Germany poised to extend coronavirus lockdown||Germany is likely to extend a national lockdown beyond January 10 to curb coronavirus infection rates that are still running high and putting huge strains on hospitals and health workers, politicians said at the weekend.Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional leaders are expected to agree to extend the restrictions when they convene on Tuesday. It is not yet clear how long the extension would last.“The numbers are still too high, so we will have to prolong the restrictions,” Health Minister Jens Spahn told RTL television in an interview on Saturday evening.Infection rates had to be sustainably reduced, Spahn said, adding: “That is better than loosening too early and then, perhaps in as little as a few weeks, facing new and difficult questions.”Germany imposed tougher social restrictions before Christmas, including closing restaurants and most shops. Even so, infections continued to rise and the death toll has hit more than 1,000 on some days.Seven-day infection rates are currently at 140 per 100,000 people - well over the target of 50 that politicians have agreed would be safe enough to ease the curbs.With a new, more infectious coronavirus variant circulating, some politicians and health leaders are calling for the restrictions to be lifted only when the seven-day rate falls to 25.“We will only see next week in the hospitals how strongly Christmas contributed to the spread of Covid-19 - the New Year effect will come only later,” Uwe Janssens, head of a group representing intensive-care doctors, told the Rheinische Post.Officials from Germany’s 16 states agreed on a conference call on Saturday to extend restrictions, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported.But there was disagreement over how much longer to keep the measures in force. Some harder hit states called for a three-week extension, and for schools to be kept closed, while others favoured a two-week extension.The Robert Koch Institute, the agency coordinating Germany’s pandemic response, reported 10,315 new confirmed cases on Sunday and 312 fatalities, bringing the total death toll to 34,272.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-poised-to-extend-coronavirus-lockdown/story-AFEgyumPWdsekOCfIae9sL.html
03-01-2021||World||Explained: What may happen on Jan 6 as Trump’s allies prepare to overturn electoral college results||Apart from at least 140 House Republicans reportedly preparing to overturn US election results, a coalition of 11 Republican senators, led by Ted Cruz, has announced its plan to reject electors from some states when Congress meets on January 6 to formally certify the Electoral College and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. In a joint statement, the senators claimed that the 2020 presidential elections featured “unprecedented allegations of voter fraud” and other voting irregularities.“We intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified’ (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed,” the statement read.US Vice-President Mike Pence has also welcomed the plan of the Republican senators to refuse to certify Biden’s victory. The vice-president’s chief of staff Marc Short said that Pence shares the “concerns of millions of Americans”, adding that he has welcomed that efforts of lawmakers to use their authority “to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress”.Also Read | Homes of top Republican Mitch McConnell, Democrat Nancy Pelosi vandalised: ReportWhat may happen on January 6?The House of Representatives and the Senate will debate for two hours over the objections, if any, raised by the lawmakers, which will be followed by a vote. However, US President Donald Trump’s allies need a majority of lawmakers in both chambers voting in their favour to uphold the objections. Such attempts have virtually no chance to succeed since Democrats control the House and top Senate Republicans have already recognised Biden as the next president of the United States.Several Republican leaders, including senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, have been warning their GOP colleagues to not disrupt the certification process. Utah Senator Mitt Romney said in a statement that the “egregious ploy” to reject electors “dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic”. Romney highlighted the fact that the Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election.“I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?” he asked rhetorically.Earlier, Republican senator Ben Sasse had written in a Facebook post that he has been urging his colleagues to reject the “dangerous ploy” to overturn the election. Sasse explained that there are a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there’s a quick way to “tap into the president’s populist base without doing any real, long-term damage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-may-happen-on-jan-6-as-trump-s-allies-prepare-to-overturn-electoral-college-results/story-ytg2bmiColYMcS0NYg32gN.html
03-01-2021||World||China oil majors may face US delisting after NYSE drops telcos||Chinese oil majors may be next in line for delisting in the US after the New York Stock Exchange said last week it would remove the Asian nation’s three biggest telecom companies.China’s largest offshore oil producer CNOOC Ltd. could be most at risk as it’s on the Pentagon’s list of companies it says are owned or controlled by Chinese military, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Henik Fung. PetroChina Co. Ltd. and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp., also known as Sinopec, may also be under threat as the energy sector is crucial to China’s military, he said.“More Chinese companies could get delisted in the U.S. and the oil majors could come as the next wave,” said Steven Leung, executive director at UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. At the same time, the impact of removing the telecom firms is probably minimal as they were thinly-traded in the U.S. and they haven’t raised much funds there, he said.The NYSE said it would delist the telecom operators to comply with a U.S. executive order imposing restrictions on companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military. China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. would all be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and proceedings to delist them have started, the exchange said.China’s Ministry of Commerce responded on Saturday, saying the country would take necessary action to protect the rights of Chinese companies and it hoped the two countries could work together to create a fair and predictable environment for businesses and investors.U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices. The order prohibited U.S. investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.China’s Foreign Ministry later accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. Chinese officials have also threatened to respond to previous Trump administration actions with their own blacklist of U.S. companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-oil-majors-may-face-us-delisting-after-nyse-drops-telcos/story-sWX7G2wIluf2bTQ1Uov8HL.html
03-01-2021||World||South Africa says, Africa left with few options for Covid-19 vaccines||Africa has few options to procure Covid-19 vaccines as the outbreak of the disease worsens across many parts of the continent, South Africa’s presidency said.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have offered to supply Africa with 50 million Covid-19 vaccines for health workers between March and the end of this year, the presidency said in a response to Bloomberg queries on Sunday. Moderna Inc. has no supplies for Africa, while AstraZeneca Plc has no shots for the continent in 2021 and has directed the African Union to negotiate with the Serum Institute of India Ltd., which is making the vaccine on behalf of AstraZeneca. South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa is the African Union’s chairman.Ramaphosa’s response comes after days of withering criticism in South Africa over the country’s vaccine strategy from health leaders, labor unions and opposition parties. Even though four vaccine trials are underway in the country, South Africa has only arranged to purchase enough shots for 10% of its population of 60 million people through the Covax initiative, which is designed to ensure equitable access to the vaccines. These are likely to begin arriving in the second quarter. Some African countries have their own plans for vaccine procurement. Most do not.“We are working hard in South Africa and on the continent to protect our people against Covid-19,” the presidency said.The furore comes as South Africa posts record numbers of infections and deaths and neighboring Zimbabwe enters a strict 30-day lockdown. The South African economy likely contracted the most in nine decades last year, according to official estimates.‘Prohibitive’ CostThe cost of Pfizer’s vaccines are “prohibitive,” the presidency said. Discussions are taking place with Johnson & Johnson, which is conducting a trial in South Africa and plans to make 300 million doses a year at a factory in the country owned by Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. when the shot is approved.J&J “has not clarified whether Africa will benefit from vaccines manufactured in South Africa,” the presidency said. “We still have to negotiate the price that is affordable to Africa.”South Africa is holding direct talks with vaccine suppliers including J&J, AstraZeneca and Pfizer over vaccine supplies for the country, the presidency said. South Africa’s health products regulator is using a so-called rolling review, which allows it to assess vaccine data as it becomes available during the trials to assess J&J’s shot. It will do the same with AstraZeneca and Pfizer when they apply.While at least 29 countries, from Mexico to Germany, have begun inoculating their populations against the virus, South Africa has yet to conclude any supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies.Yesterday an opinion piece published in local media and signed by senior members of the Progressive Health Forum, which includes the heads of medical associations and academics, called for Ramaphosa to fire health department officials for their failure to secure vaccine supplies.“As a health care worker with friends and colleagues in the frontline and knowing health care workers who have contracted Covid-19 and died doing their duty, we are obliged to try hasten access to the vaccine so they can do their job,” said Glenda Gray, president of the South African Medical Research Council and a member of the forum, in a response to queries.South Africa, with over 1.09 million confirmed Covid-19 infections and 29,175 deaths, is the worst hit country on the African continent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-says-africa-left-with-few-options-for-covid-19-vaccines/story-YOWCSolvlrzkhpMLr4fSxN.html
03-01-2021||World||Gunmen kill 11 Hazara coal miners in Pakistan||At least 11 coal miners - all members of the minority Hazara Shia community - were kidnapped and reportedly killed in Machh town in Pakistan’s Balochistan province on Sunday by unidentified gunmen. The men were abducted at gunpoint and then taken to a secluded area in the nearby hills where they were attacked, according to various accounts. It is believed they were kidnapped from their hostel located near a mine where they worked.Conflicting reports suggest that the miners were tied up and either shot or had their throats slit after they were taken to the nearby hills. However, a video clip that has gone viral on social media shows three bodies outside a room, suggesting that some of the miners may have been killed outside their hostel.Police said that the survivors were taken to a hospital in Machh, and that initial reports said 10 coal miners had been brought dead or were in critical condition. The death toll was later reported to have reached 11.This is the first major attack on members of the Hazara community since April last year when a suicide bomb attack at a market killed 18 people; most of them were Hazaras. There have been constant attacks on members of the community by terror groups. While no one immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday’s episode, Hazaras have historically been targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, apart from other Sunni extremist groups. In 2013, three bombings killed more than 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods in Quetta.Following Sunday’s attack, members of the Hazara minority in Quetta blocked the western bypass in protest and set tyres on fire. Heavy contingents of police, local administration and frontier constabulary (FC) personnel cordoned off the area.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the killings and termed the incident “yet another cowardly (and) inhumane act of terrorism”. He tweeted, “The families of the victims will not be left abandoned by the (government). Have asked the FC to use all resources to apprehend these killers and bring them to justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-11-hazara-coal-miners-in-pakistan/story-ke6Dct0uNaonQMMYqDCflN.html
03-01-2021||World||Tougher Covid curbs likely, warns British PM Boris Johnson||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday indicated that tougher measures are likely to be imposed to curb the continuing rise in Covid-19 infections as the first of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines are due to be administered across the UK from Monday.Latest figures show there were 54,990 new Covid-19 cases as of Sunday – 11 times the peak in April-May – and 454 deaths in the last 24 hours, with 23,823 patients stricken by the virus in hospital, 1,847 of them on ventilators.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Johnson defended his government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, but added that region-wise restrictions in England are “probably about to get tougher”. The government, he said, had a “range of measures” to consider.“It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country; I’m fully, fully reconciled to that,” he said, insisting that he remained confident that things would be better later in the year.“The government has taken every possible step that we reasonably could. What we couldn’t have foreseen I think reasonably was the arrival of a new variant of the (coronavirus) spreading between 50% and 70% faster... Once we did understand that, we took... decisive action.”England currently has a four-tier alert system in which cities and regions are placed according to the prevalence of the virus. As of Saturday, there are none in the lowest Tiers 1 and 2 with the least restrictions, but millions in the top Tier 3 and 4. A new Tier 5 may be put in place to deal with the challenge of the variant.Nearly 1 million people have so far received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. Johnson couldn’t give details of the mass vaccination programme, but said, “We do hope that we’ll be able to do tens of millions in the course of the next three months.”Former UK PM Tony Blair called for the introduction of “vaccination stations” modelled on polling stations and adoption of a single platform for a “Covid pass” that would allow individuals to show their status on testing and whether they have been vaccinated.He said, “Though it is true that the National Health Service (NHS) is doing a herculean effort in vaccinating as many as they have, it is simply not sufficient. We have to treble at least the number of vaccinations by the end of January when enough supplies of the vaccine should be available to allow us to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tougher-covid-curbs-likely-warns-british-pm-boris-johnson/story-wKkTpCnyeaAPP3V4tuOZ9M.html
03-01-2021||World||Tougher lockdown restriction likely on the way, says UK PM Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that tougher lockdown restrictions were probably on the way as Covid-19 cases keep rising, but that schools were safe and children should continue to attend.Cases of Covid-19 in Britain are at record levels and increasing, fuelled by a new and more transmissible variant of the virus. That has already forced the government to cancel the planned reopening of schools in and around London, with calls from teaching unions for wider closures. Much of England is already under the toughest level of restriction set out in a four-tier system of regional regulations designed to stop the spread of the virus and protect the national healthcare system.But Johnson, asked in a BBC interview about concerns that the system may not be enough to bring the virus back under control, said that restrictions “alas, might be about to get tougher”.“There are obviously a range of tougher measures that we would have to consider ... I’m not going to speculate now about what they would be.”Johnson also said schools were safe, and advised parents to send their children in, in areas where rules allow it.“There is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe, and that education is a priority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tougher-lockdown-restriction-likely-on-the-way-says-uk-pm-johnson/story-8RhDQBAoCMQpVp6814j6wJ.html

03-01-2021||World||Mixing of Covid-19 vaccines: Where do health agencies stand?||In a departure from other strategies globally, the UK government said in guidelines published on New Year’s Eve that people could be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots, if the same vaccine dose was out of stock. The UK became the first country to give emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccines last month.“This option is preferred if the individual is likely to be at immediate high risk or is considered unlikely to attend again,” the guidelines said.This contradicts the norms published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for two Covid-19 vaccines authorised by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The US health agency said that the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna “are not interchangeable with each other or with other Covid-19 vaccine products,” adding that the safety and efficacy after mixing the doses have not been evaluated.“Both doses of the series should be completed with the same product,” it stressed. The CDC further stated that no additional doses of Pfizer or Moderna vaccines are recommended if two doses of different products are “inadvertently” administered. Notably, both Covid-19 vaccines approved by the US FDA use the same messenger RNA technology, while AstraZeneca’s vaccine uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus).Also Read | Britain will allow mixing of Covid-19 vaccines on rare occasionsThe contradiction raised concerns over the UK government’s updated guidance, prompting a clarification from Public Health England (PHE) over the mixing the vaccines. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisations at PHE, said in a statement that mixing of vaccines is not recommended, adding that every effort should be made to administer the same vaccine. However, Dr Ramsay stressed that it is better to give a “second dose of another vaccine than not at all.”“We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines - if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa,” Dr Ramsay said.“There may be extremely rare occasions where the same vaccine is not available, or where it is not known what vaccine the patient received. Every effort should be made to give them the same vaccine, but where this is not possible it is better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-of-covid-19-vaccines-where-do-health-agencies-stand/story-MWuyn9a9tdmbPt02jxwndP.html

Personnel who came in close contact with the goods have been quarantined and all have tested negative. Related goods have been sealed.Three other positive samples taken from auto part packaging were found in the city of Cangzhou in Hebei Province, and Yantai and Linyi in Shandong Province, according to local authorities.Nucleic acid tests were carried out on related auto parts and personnel in different cities of China after an employee from a Beijing company engaged in auto part sales was diagnosed with Covid-19 and some auto part packages tested positive for the virus in late December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-found-on-multiple-auto-part-packaging-samples-in-china/story-g1idtcjOf9Yg33JwNKDodO.html
03-01-2021||World||Israel dismisses Iran’s charge of tricking US into war as ‘nonsense’||An Israeli official on Sunday dismissed as “nonsense” an allegation by the Iranian foreign minister that Israel was trying to trick the United States into waging war on Iran.It was Israel that needed to be on alert for possible Iranian strikes on the one-year anniversary on Sunday of the assassination of Tehran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani, in a US drone strike in Iraq, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Kan public radio.Washington blames Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on US facilities in Iraq, including near the US embassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter: “New intelligence from Iraq indicate that Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans — putting an outgoing (President Donald) Trump in a bind with a fake casus belli.”“Be careful of a trap, @realDonaldTrump. Any fireworks will backfire badly, particularly against your same BFFs,” Zarif wrote, in what appeared to be a veiled threat against Israel.Steinitz said the remarks showed that Iran, after mounting US sanctions billed as curbing its nuclear programme and involvement in regional conflict-zones, was “under pressure - economic pressure, and pressure in terms of national security”.“We hear this nonsense by Zarif, that Israel would set off terrorist attacks against the United States - this really is total nonsense,” Steinitz told Kan public radio.“But on the other hand it is a warning sign - a warning sign that Iran is taking aim at Israel, is looking for excuses to lash out at Israel, and therefore we need to have our finger on the pulse and be at the highest state of alert.”The US military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran on Wednesday, but the bombers have since left the region.Interviewed separately on Kan, Israeli Culture Minister Chili Tropper, who like Steinitz sits in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, confirmed media reports that Israel was on heightened alert for the Soleimani anniversary.Asked what possible Iranian reprisals Israel was anticipating, Tropper said: “I cannot comment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-dismisses-iran-s-charge-of-tricking-us-into-war-as-nonsense/story-szA0scsZvq4QNee1xZXjDM.html
03-01-2021||World||Experts, politicians slam Germany for not buying adequate vaccine doses||Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases, experts and politicians slammed Germany for not buying enough doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer coronavirus vaccine to quickly roll out its immunisation programme.“I consider the current situation a gross failure,” said Frauke Zipp on Saturday, a neurologist and member of the advisory Leopoldina Academy of Sciences told Die Welt (DW) newspaper. “Why didn’t they order much more of the vaccine during the summer just to be safe?” she added.As a member of the EU vaccine procurement scheme, Germany is reliant on regulators at the European level granting authorisation of the vaccine to prevent Covid-19 infection. But the EU has taken longer than countries like the UK, the US and Canada to give the go-ahead, reported DW newspaper.So far, only the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine is permitted in EU member states, but the block as a whole only made an order for 300 million doses during the summer, in the belief that more vaccine alternatives would be available.Meanwhile, German Health Minister Jens Spahn has shrugged off any suggestion the government has been lackadaisical in its approach towards vaccinating the country. “Things are going exactly as it was planned,” reported broadcaster RTL.Spahn said he anticipated a shortfall at the beginning and that the government would have to “prioritise” who would be vaccinated but that all nursing home residents would receive the inoculation by the end of January, reported DW newspaper.Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg’s foreign minister also defended the EU’s vaccine strategy saying that the Commission had secured almost two billion doses with six different manufacturers, reported German radio broadcaster RBB.The BioNTech founders said on Friday that they were scrambling to boost production after being pressured to fill the gaps caused by the EU’s blunder, reported DW newspaper.However, Karl Lauterbach, health expert for the centre-left Social Democrats, criticized the EU for not having ordered more BioNTech-Pfizer vaccines early on.Citing Rheinische Post newspaper, “It was clear early on that the Moderna vaccine had a strong efficacy and could be used by GPs,” said Lauterbach.Meanwhile, Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to meet with state premiers on Tuesday to discuss a probable extension of the current lockdown -- which is set to end on January 10.The current infection rate in Germany is 141.2 according to the Robert Koch Institute. However, this number varies hugely across the country, with some regions of Saxony recording rates of over 500, reported DW newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-politicians-slam-germany-for-not-buying-adequate-vaccine-doses/story-oYzwo7HVylJCsfq88ciqxK.html
03-01-2021||World||In Somalia, Covid-19 vaccines are distant as virus spreads||As richer countries race to distribute Covid-19 vaccines, Somalia remains the rare place where much of the population hasn’t taken the coronavirus seriously. Some fear that’s proven to be deadlier than anyone knows.“Certainly our people don’t use any form of protective measures, neither masks nor social distancing,” Abdirizak Yusuf Hirabeh, the government’s Covid-19 incident manager, said in an interview. “If you move around the city (of Mogadishu) or countrywide, nobody even talks about it.” And yet infections are rising, he said.It is places like Somalia, the Horn of Africa nation torn apart by three decades of conflict, that will be last to see Covid-19 vaccines in any significant quantity. With part of the country still held by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, the risk of the virus becoming endemic in some hard-to-reach areas is strong — a fear for parts of Africa amid the slow arrival of vaccines.“There is no real or practical investigation into the matter,” said Hirabeh, who is also the director of the Martini hospital in Mogadishu, the largest treating Covid-19 patients, which saw seven new patients the day he spoke. He acknowledged that neither facilities nor equipment are adequate in Somalia to tackle the virus.Fewer than 27,000 tests for the virus have been conducted in Somalia, a country of more than 15 million people, one of the lowest rates in the world. Fewer than 4,800 cases have been confirmed, including at least 130 deaths.Some worry the virus will sink into the population as yet another poorly diagnosed but deadly fever.For 45-year-old street beggar Hassan Mohamed Yusuf, that fear has turned into near certainty. “In the beginning we saw this virus as just another form of the flu,” he said.Then three of his young children died after having a cough and high fever. As residents of a makeshift camp for people displaced by conflict or drought, they had no access to coronavirus testing or proper care.At the same time, Yusuf said, the virus hurt his efforts to find money to treat his family as “we can’t get close enough” to people to beg.Early in the pandemic, Somalia’s government did attempt some measures to limit the spread of the virus, closing all schools and shutting down all domestic and international flights. Mobile phones rang with messages about the virus.But social distancing has long disappeared in the country’s streets, markets or restaurants. On Thursday, some 30,000 people crammed into a stadium in Mogadishu for a regional football match with no face masks or other anti-virus measures in sight.Mosques in the Muslim nation never faced restrictions, for fear of the reactions.“Our religion taught us hundreds of years ago that we should wash our hands, faces and even legs five times every day and our women should take face veils as they’re often weaker. So that’s the whole prevention of the disease, if it really exists,” said Abdulkadir Sheikh Mohamud, an imam in Mogadishu.“I left the matter to Allah to protect us,” said Ahmed Abdulle Ali, a shop owner in the capital. He attributed the rise in coughing during prayers to the changing of seasons.A more important protective factor is the relative youth of Somalia’s people, said Dr. Abdurahman Abdullahi Abdi Bilaal, who works in a clinic in the capital. More than 80% of the country’s population is under age 30.“The virus is here, absolutely, but the resilience of people is owing to age,” he said.It’s the lack of post-mortem investigations in the country that are allowing the true extent of the virus to go undetected, he said.The next challenge in Somalia is not simply obtaining Covid-19 vaccines but also persuading the population to accept them.That will take time, “just the same as what it took for our people to believe in the polio or measles vaccines,” a concerned Bilaal said.Hirabeh, in charge of Somalia’s virus response, agreed that “our people have little confidence in the vaccines,” saying that many Somalis hate the needles. He called for serious awareness campaigns to change minds.The logistics of any Covid-19 vaccine rol lout are another major concern. Hirabeh said Somalia is expecting the first vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, but he worries that the country has no way to handle a vaccine like the Pfizer one that requires being kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius.“One that could be kept between minus 10 and minus 20 might suit the Third World like our country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-somalia-covid-19-vaccines-are-distant-as-virus-spreads/story-IdG0aCvwfax91FqKqew3OL.html
03-01-2021||World||Thailand’s economic conditions tipped to worsen as virus spreads||Thailand’s economic conditions are expected to deteriorate further this year as the nation battles a resurgence in the coronavirus, according to a national survey.About 52.2% of the respondents in the study undertaken by Bangkok-based National Institute of Development Administration predict the economy will be even worse in 2021 than it was last year, while 14.6% anticipate an improvement.At the same time, the impact of Covid-19 may be even more deadly than in 2020, according to 48.1% of the respondents. Just 28.8% expect it to be less severe, the institute said in a statement released Sunday.Thailand is set to impose a new set of restrictions on businesses and gatherings in 28 of its worst-affected provinces from Monday to stem the latest flareup in an outbreak that’s infected more than 3,000 people since the middle of December. Bangkok, a city of more than 10 million people, has already closed businesses including pubs, bars, gyms and other entertainment venues besides shuttering schools until the end of the month.The central bank at its December policy meeting said gross domestic product probably shrank by 6.6% in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic. At the same gathering, it cut its forecast for this year to growth of 3.2%, from an earlier estimate of 3.6%.Thailand reported 315 new virus cases on Sunday with 294 of them locally transmitted, according to the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. The nation’s total caseload climbed to 7,694 with the capital Bangkok and the provinces of Samut Sakhon and Rayong the major hotspots.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha has refrained from re-imposing a national lockdown, saying the nation can contain the recent outbreak. Still, the surge in infections is likely to delay plans to reopen the country to tourism with a nationwide state of emergency remaining in place to allow authorities impose restrictions quickly if deemed necessary.The authorities aren’t pushing for a nationwide uniform restrictions as they are seeking to minimize the impact on the community, Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration spokesman Taweesilp Witsanuyotin said at a briefing on Sunday. Provincial authorities will be allowed to impose “tailor-made measures” to contain the outbreak, he said.“Even though we know that we need strong medicine today, strong medicine has many side effects,” Taweesilp said. “We have learned our lessons from using strong doses across the board earlier. Those who suffer the most are normal people who try to live their lives.”Thailand may face additional hurdles to reviving its economy from a recurrence of anti-government protests, according to the institute’s survey. While almost 77% of respondents said they expected the political situation to remain chaotic or get worse, 43.2% participants predicted pro-democracy protests will take place again this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-s-economic-conditions-tipped-to-worsen-as-virus-spreads/story-ezjQKgwlZaiGGJ5JHXDDXO.html

It was unclear if anyone was home at the time.McConnell called the graffiti a “radical tantrum,” and added: “Vandalism and the politics of fear have no place in our society.”In San Francisco, Pelosi’s garage door was sprayed with a crossed-out “$2K”, followed by “Cancel rent!” and “We want everything!”The city’s police Special Investigations Division was looking into the incident, NBC News reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/homes-of-top-republican-mitch-mcconnell-democrat-nancy-pelosi-vandalised-report/story-6LDd3xGJYBfohHpt3LZCBL.html
03-01-2021||World||Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?||India on Friday became the fourth country to approve a coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, authorising the vaccine’s rollout in coming weeks in the country with the second highest number of infections.The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide:WHO IS FURTHEST ALONG?U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and German partner BioNTech have been the Covid-19 vaccine trailblazers.On Nov. 18, they became the first in the world to release full late-stage trial data. Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9 and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 11. Several other countries, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico, have also approved it.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the shot on Dec. 21 and India is accelerating its review.The World Health Organization on Thursday listed the vaccine for emergency use, in a move seeking to speed access to it in the developing world.WHAT ABOUT MODERNA?Moderna Inc was a close second to Pfizer in many countries after it released a full data analysis for a late-stage trial on Nov. 30 showing a 94.1% efficacy rate for its vaccine. The United States authorised Moderna’s vaccine on Dec. 19, while Canada approved the shot on Dec. 23 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will do so on Jan. 6.ASTRAZENECAIndia approval of a two-dose version of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, COVISHIELD, which has also been given the green light by Britain, Argentina and El Salvador, is a major win for a shot seen as crucial for mass immunisations. Questions about the robustness of its trial data have complicated the approval process.The British company announced interim late-stage trial data in November showing two full doses were 62% effective while a half-dose followed by a full dose had a 90% success rate - but UK regulators the more successful outcome had not stood up to analysis.AstraZeneca is also in discussions with the European Union’s European Medicines Agency, which is conducting a rolling review of the vaccine.WHO ELSE IS IN THE RUNNING?U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson plans to deliver trial data in January, teeing it up for U.S. authorisation in February if its shot is effective. It reduced the enrolment target for its clinical trial to 40,000 volunteers from 60,000 on Dec. 9, potentially speeding results that are tied to how quickly participants become infected. U.S. firm Novavax is running a late-stage trial in Britain with data due in the first quarter of 2021. It expects to start a large-scale trial in the United States this month.France’s Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, however, announced a setback on Dec. 11 in their attempts to develop a vaccine. The drugmakers said that it showed an insufficient immune response in older people in mid-stage trials and that they would start a new study in February.WHAT HAPPENS IN THE TRIALS?The companies usually test their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see whether the rate of Covid-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.HOW ARE VOLUNTEERS INFECTED?The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with Covid-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.HOW WELL ARE THE VACCINES SUPPOSED TO WORK?The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy. The FDA wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The EMA has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA?Although Pfizer’s shot was the first to be rolled out following the publication of full Phase III trial data, Russia and China have been inoculating their citizens for months with several different vaccines still undergoing late-stage trials. China on Dec. 31. approved its first Covid-19 vaccine for general public use, a shot developed by an affiliate of state-backed pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm. The company said it is 79% effective against the virus.Russia said on Nov. 24 its Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Institute, was 91.4% effective based on interim late-stage trial results. It started vaccinations in August and has inoculated more than 100,000 people so far.India plans to make 300 million doses of Sputnik V next year and Argentina has given the green light for emergency use of the shot, with some 300,000 doses arriving in the country on Dec 24.China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection. It has vaccinated about one million people as of mid-November using at least three shots - 1 developed by the state-backed China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and one by Sinovac Biotech.Trial data on a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech has varied: interim data from a late-stage trial in Turkey showed its CoronaVac shot is 91.25% effective, while researchers in Brazil say the shot was more than 50% effective. The United Arab Emirates, meanwhile, said on Dec. 9 that one of the CNBG vaccines was 86% effective based on interim results from a late-stage trial in the Gulf Arab state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-are-we-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/story-sMKzkkFwLHALEAG9PN1IKO.html

However, the service was restored later following a public backlash. The closure of the project was affecting a large number of students as well as many other common citizens of the province, The Express Tribune reported.The project was scrapped last year and now the board, in collaboration with the Punjab government, was considering various proposals to provide sustainable WiFi facility to the citizens, PITB officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-govt-shuts-down-free-wifi-project-in-pakistan-s-punjab/story-OdOZqYaGY7FCE1BEAxsPyH.html

Travellers from Britain and the United States will still have to go through New Zealand’s 14-day quarantine regime,” said Hipkins.New Zealand is currently at Covid-19 Alert Level one with no restrictions on gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-new-covid-19-cases-detected-in-new-zealand-as-border-restrictions-tightened/story-0ve9CBUDVoObrtcwnnNcIN.html
03-01-2021||World||Iraq agrees $2 billion prepayment oil supply deal with Chinese company||Iraq has agreed a multibillion-dollar oil-supply deal with a Chinese company, according to the Arab nation’s official news agency.SOMO, which oversees Iraq’s petroleum exports, picked a Chinese firm after receiving bids from several traders, INA reported, citing an interview with SOMO General Manager Alaa Al-Yasiri. While INA didn’t name the company or specify if Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had signed off on the deal, Bloomberg reported last month that ZhenHua Oil Co., a subsidiary of China’s largest state-owned defense contractor, was the winner.SOMO offered to supply roughly 130,000 barrels a day of crude for five years, according to a letter it sent traders in November. It sought upfront payment for one year of supply, which at current prices would bring in more than $2 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations.“Iraq got $2 billion at zero interest with a premium over the price,” INA quoted Al-Yasiri as saying. “There was intense competition between two European and Chinese companies, and the Chinese company won.”The pre-payment deal, a first for Baghdad, is the latest example of China lending to struggling oil producers via state-controlled trading companies and banks.While all major oil exporters have taken a hit from the coronavirus-triggered plunge in prices since March, Iraq is in one of the weakest positions. OPEC’s biggest producer after Saudi Arabia, its economy was forecast by the International Monetary Fund to contract 11% last year. The government weakened the dinar by almost 20% against the dollar in December -- the first devaluation since the US-led invasion in 2003 -- as its foreign-exchange reserves shrunk.The oil-supply deal attracted widespread interest among major traders, according to people familiar with the matter. The contract will be one of the largest of its kind in recent history and it allows the winner to ship crude to wherever it wishes for a year. Normally, Middle Eastern crude is sold with strict clauses preventing traders and refiners from re-selling the barrels to different regions.“The flexibility that Iraq has granted to companies is the freedom to determine the day of loading the shipments, the export destination, the possibility of resale and a set of marketing benefits in return,” Al-Yasiri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-agrees-2-billion-prepayment-oil-supply-deal-with-chinese-company/story-MS9fMAU93DehJdR44FNTML.html
03-01-2021||World||China amends defence law to strengthen military powers over state council||In a move to expand the power of its Central Military Commission (CMC), China has amended its National Defence Law from January 1 to mobilise military and civilian resources in defence of the ‘national interest’ at home and abroad.These revisions weaken the role of the State Council in formulating military policy and hands decision making power to the CMC. For the first time, ‘disruption’ and protection of ‘development interests’ have been added to the legislation as grounds for mobilisation and deployment of armed forces, according to South China Morning Post.The amendments were passed by the National People’s Congress on December 26, after two years of deliberation. Three articles were removed, more than 50 were amended, while there were six additions.The legislation also specifically focuses on the need for building a nationwide coordination mechanism for the mobilisation of state-owned and private enterprises to take part in research into new defence technologies covering conventional weapons, as well as the domains of cybersecurity, space and electromagnetics.Several analysts have opined that the amendments are aimed to strengthen the military leadership under Chinese President Xi Jinping, and providing it with the means to respond to the accelerating confrontations between China and the US, according to South China Morning Post.Deng Yuwen, a former deputy editor of the Communist Party publication Study Times, said the amendments aimed to legalise and formally apply the “special” nature of China’s political and defence system when dealing with situations that could harm the regime at home and abroad.The changes show that regime had gained the confidence to legitimise its long-standing principle that the party ‘commands the gun’ and strengthen its ‘absolute leadership’ over-armed and reserved forces, said Chen Daoyin, an independent political commentator.“The move to include ‘development interests’ as a reason for armed mobilisation and war in the law would provide legal grounds for the country to launch war in the legitimate name of defending national development interests,” Chen said.Zeng Zhiping, a military law expert at Soochow University, said that the State Council has become a mere implementing agency to provide support to the military, adding that this change was a big contrast with developed countries like Germany, Israel and France, where armed forces come under civilian leadership.Taipei-based military expert Chi Le-yi said the amendments highlighting the use of armed forces to suppress national disruption would be used to target independence-leaning forces in Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of its territory, reported South China Morning Post.For decades, the Chinese government has claimed authority over Taiwan. Though Taiwan is not recognised by the UN, its government maintains a relationship with the US and does not accept the Chinese authority.“The law revision is also a symbolic battle call by the party to warn all Chinese people to be combat-ready for a nationwide defence mobilisation, which the party has never done since [it came to power] in 1949,” said Chi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-amends-defence-law-to-strengthen-military-powers-over-state-council/story-QaecDGPNQGAOtLQXHP0bDL.html
03-01-2021||World||Chinese economy is recovering. But there are gaps | Analysis||China’s factory and services activity, according to Chinese official statistics released this week, continued to expand in December supported by pent-up demand and hot export demand, fueling Beijing’s recovery from the coronavirus shock. Its economy is expected to expand around 2% for the year, reflecting a recovery that beats other major economies still struggling to contain infections.But a business survey released two days before the new official statistics were put out, appeared to take the sheen off official statistics pointing to a more subdued picture of economic recovery. It pointed to weak consumer spending and headwinds to Beijing’s efforts to encourage more lending to smaller, private sector businesses.More significantly, data from the China Beige Book International, a provider of independent economic data, underlines that consumer-facing industries continue to lag. The growth in the services sector, for instance, was being driven by businesses in telecommunications, shipping, and financial services. Consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants and travel, however, continue to lag behind.People haven’t started stepping out to eat at chain restaurants. The travel and hospitality sector recorded weak revenues too.There has also been a sharp drop in sales growth for luxury goods, food and apparel in the fourth quarter, squeezing margins and hiring as well.The China Beige Book survey, based on 3,300 interviews of business leaders between November and December, said China hadn’t fully recovered from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic yet. Roughly two-thirds of executives polled by the consultancy said they don’t expect sales, profitability and hiring to return to 2019 levels until at least three months of 2021..Economists have already underscored that most of the spending is coming from the public sector, much of it based on a large stimulus plan, rather than private firms.Keyu Jin, Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, identified three reasons for concern around the Chinese economy. First, she underlined in the Japan Times, Chinese exports exceeded expectations because its industries, which reopened when the world was shutting down, acted as a global supplier of last resort. This, Prof Keyu argued, would reverse when global production sites reopen. Second, he said, the recovery had triggered a broader structural deterioration, following years of economic reorientation away from exports and investment and toward consumption. Third, she cautioned about the looming financial risks arising from the real economy, predicting an increase in the risk of bad debts that will present significant threats to financial institutions.Already, the China Beige Book pointed to an increase in loan rejection rates for retail businesses from 14% to 38% in the final quarter of 2020 from the previous quarter. Rejection rates for small and medium-sized businesses rose to 24% in the final quarter, double the rate posted by large companies during the period.Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared to recognise some of the challenges that lie ahead; the Central Economic Work Conference didn’t go as far as to warn of a “downward economic pressure” at its meeting in mid-December. But the statement from the three-day summit did assert at the end of the key annual policy meeting that there were many uncertainties, “the foundation for our country’s economic recovery is not yet solid” and the recovery would be “unstable and uneven”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-economy-is-recovering-but-there-are-gaps-analysis/story-wFajhNGubZSPuDDqp0mLYP.html
03-01-2021||World||Climate deal, US election: EU ‘climate leader’ on why 2020 left him upbeat||The author of one of the most ambitious climate plans in the European Union says 2020 was a turning point that’s left him optimistic about the future of the planet.Although the year showed the scale of the effort needed -- with temperatures rising despite lockdowns across the world that brought most economies to a virtual standstill -- Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen says there’s cause to be more upbeat. He points to the EU’s latest climate deal and the US election, which will bring the world’s biggest economy back into the Paris agreement.“It is remarkable that closing down our societies has not led us anywhere near the level of reductions we need, so behavioral changes alone won’t do it,” Jorgensen said in an interview in Copenhagen. But while the analysis is often negative, “there are reasons for optimism and to celebrate as well,” he said.Jorgensen ended the year with a pledge to cease oil exploration in the EU’s biggest crude producer. The move prompted Greenpeace to say, “this is what climate leadership looks like,” and is part of a plan to slash 70% off Denmark’s carbon emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. More ambitious than the 55% targeted by the EU, it puts the Danes at the absolute forefront of the bloc’s efforts to protect the environment.The pandemic triggered a wave of fiscal relief that’s opened the door to some of the boldest climate initiatives yet. Eight of the world’s 10 largest economies, including China and Japan, have set goals to reach net-zero emission within decades. US President-elect Joe Biden wants the US to be carbon neutral by 2050.“We are going to spend billions of euros on economic recovery in Europe and if we are smart and invest in green infrastructure and energy efficiency, something good can actually come of this,” Jorgensen said.Denmark’s path toward a carbon-neutral economy suggests there are financial rewards to be reaped. The country started investing heavily in wind energy in the 1970s. It now gets more than 40% of its electricity from wind power.Denmark is home to the world’s biggest wind-turbine maker, Vestas Wind Systems A/S, and the world’s top developer of offshore wind parks, Orsted A/S. The latter, which is half owned by the government, started off as a state oil and gas producer, but reinvented itself half a decade ago. Since then, its value has soared about 430%.Aside from Denmark’s decision to phase out its North Sea oil production, and end it totally by 2050, the country made several other commitments in 2020. These include plans to build two islands to house the infrastructure for new offshore wind farms, helping Denmark move closer to its ultimate goal of generating all its electricity from renewable energy sources.The Social Democrat government Jorgensen is part of has also had its critics when it comes to the climate. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has been accused of shying away from using taxes to steer consumers and businesses toward environmentally friendly behavior. And efforts to promote electric vehicles were slammed for lacking ambition.But the government has argued that investing in new technologies will ultimately prove the best way to bring about change.Jorgensen says policy makers need to keep the public on their side. He points to France, where protesters in 2018 donned yellow vests and took to the streets for months after being angered by hikes in fuel prices.The high cost of achieving climate goals means “we need to think hard about how to approach it,” Jorgensen said. The hope is that Denmark can become a model for others to follow, he said.“If our plan would result in a decline in production or closing down some industries, no other countries would think our plan was a good idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-deal-us-election-eu-climate-leader-on-why-2020-left-him-upbeat/story-keXYeAnctZbYDbsmVt7AZO.html
03-01-2021||World||Amid vaccine hopes, UK variant of coronavirus continues to spread in 2021||Even as people hoped for a positive start to the New Year on the vaccine front, the UK reported a new coronavirus variant at the end of 2020 which plunged England into a hard lockdown yet again and dampened hopes on the vaccine front. The variant has reportedly spread to more than 30 countries across the world with Vietnam being the latest to report a case on Saturday. The country has banned almost all international travel but is running flights to bring back nationals stranded in the United Kingdom.The United States is, by far, the worst-affected country in the world with the highest number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and India follows with the second-highest number of infections. At least three US states have reported the new virus variant and the country’s limited genetic sequencing might be causing the strain to spread undetected in certain parts.Scientists, however, do not believe that the new variant is more deadly or resistant to the vaccine. This is because mutations in viruses are natural, but the strain is 70% more transmissible than the original ones, hence experts have advised people to be more careful. The winter season saw a massive surge in coronavirus infections in European nations. Ireland went from having the EU’s lowest per capita rate of coronavirus infections to the fastest-growing, according to the Guardian.“Right now, we believe the UK variant is here at a relatively low level, even with that small sample,” Philip Nolan, head of Ireland’s Covid-19 modelling group, was quoted by the Washington Post. “We saw an even more intense level of socialization and viral transmission over Christmas than we might have expected, and that’s what’s leading us to the really precarious position we’re in now,” Nolan added.On the vaccination front, Israel has had the most impressive showing as the country has already administered the first of the two shots to over a million of its citizens, the highest rate in the world. In comparison, the US’ efforts to vaccinate its population pales as 2.8 million people were given the jab by December 30, far behind President Donald Trump’s promised 20 million by the end of the year.In the UK, British health officials said that their priority was giving the first shot to as many people as possible to ensure partial safety as the country tries to grapple with the new variant.India on Sunday authorised two Covid-19 vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and another developed by Bharat Biotech, paving the way for a huge inoculation program to stem the coronavirus pandemic in the world’s second-most populous country. Drugs Controller General Dr VG Somani said that both vaccines will be administered in two dosages.It would take weeks before the effects of the initial vaccine shots kick in and months before most of the people in the world have access to them. Poorer countries might have to wait even longer to get their citizens inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-vaccine-hopes-uk-variant-of-coronavirus-continues-to-spread-in-2021/story-KTcCOO85gGSfCn8OnyzYYJ.html
03-01-2021||World||Congress opens new session as Covid-19, Biden’s win dominate||Congress is preparing to convene for the start of a new session, swearing in lawmakers during a tumultuous period as a relative handful of Republicans work to overturn Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump and the coronavirus surge imposes limits at the Capitol.Democrat Nancy Pelosi is set Sunday to be reelected as House speaker by her party, which retains the majority in the House but with the slimmest margin in 20 years after a November election wipeout.Opening the Senate could be among Mitch McConnell’s final acts at majority leader. Republican control is in question until Tuesday’s runoff elections for two Senate seats in Georgia. The outcome will determine which party holds the chamber.It’s often said that divided government can be a time for legislative compromises, but lawmakers are charging into the 117th Congress with the nation more torn than ever, disputing even basic facts including that Biden won the presidential election.Fraud did not spoil the 2020 presidential election, a fact confirmed by election officials across the country. Before stepping down last month, Attorney General William Barr, a Republican appointed by Trump, said fraud did not affect the election’s outcome. Arizona’s and Georgia’s Republican governors, whose states were crucial to Biden’s victory, have also stated that their election results were accurate.Nevertheless, a dozen Republicans bound for the new Senate, led by Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, and even more in the House have vowed to become a resistance force to Biden’s White House, starting with efforts to subvert the will of American voters. These GOP lawmakers plan to object to the election results when the Electoral College meets Wednesday to tally his 306-232 victory over Trump.Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing ahead, eager to partner with Biden on shared priorities, starting with efforts to stem the pandemic and economic crisis. They plan to revisit the failed effort to boost pandemic aid to $2,000 for most people.“This has been a moment of great challenge in the United States of America filled with trials and tribulations, but help is on the way,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said in an interview.“America is a resilient nation, filled with resilient people,” he said. “We will continue to rise to the occasion emerged from this pandemic and continue to march toward our more perfect union.” Among the House Republican newcomers are Trump-aligned Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who has given nod to conspiracy Q-Anon theories, and gun rights advocate Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who circulated a letter of support to retain the right of lawmakers to carry firearms in the Capitol.Taylor Greene was among a group of House Republicans led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama who visited with Trump at the White House during the holiday season about their effort to undo the election.The “Jan. 6 challenge is on,” Taylor Greene said in a tweet pinned to the top of her social media account. Boebert also tweeted support for those challenging Biden’s victory.House Republicans boosted their ranks in the November election, electing a handful of women and minorities, more than ever. Some of the new GOP lawmakers are being called the “Freedom Force,” and a counter to the “squad” — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other liberal Democratic women who swept to office in the last session.Progressive Democrats bolstered their ranks with newcomers aligned with more liberal priorities.The Capitol itself is a changed place under coronavirus restrictions. Lawmakers are arriving in Washington from all parts of the country potentially exposed to the virus during their travel.Several lawmakers have been sickened by the virus. A memorial was held Saturday for newly elected Republican lawmaker Luke Letlow, 41, of Louisiana, who died of complications from Covid-19 days before the swearing in.The Office of the Attending Physician has issued several lengthy memos warning lawmakers off meeting in groups or holding traditional receptions to prevent the spread of the virus. Masks have been ordered worn at all times and Pelosi has required them to be used in the House chamber. Members are required to have coronavirus tests and have access to vaccines.“Do not engage any in-person social events, receptions, celebrations, or appointments, outside your family unit, and always wear a face covering outside your home,” the physician’s office warned in one memo. “You should strictly avoid any type of office-based reception or celebration during the days ahead.” Even the traditional swearing in ceremonies will be limited in the House. No more big family portraits with new lawmakers taking the oath of office. Instead, each representative-elect can bring one guest in line with social distancing protocols.The vice president typically swears in the senators.Pelosi, who is returning as speaker, faces a tight race, with the House split 222-211, with one race still undecided and one vacancy after Letlow’s death.The California Democrat can endure some defections from her ranks, but only a few, barring absences. Some lawmakers are on quarantine after coronavirus infections or exposure. She needs to win a majority of those present and voting to retain the speaker’s gavel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-opens-new-session-as-covid-19-biden-s-win-dominate/story-mSlwzxWTq3a3qQsipwn8QM.html

The second phase of polling will take place on April 11.Nearly 80,000 voters are participating in the first phase of polling amid strict protocols imposed by authorities in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Majority of the candidates campaigned for the elections through social media and posters were circulated around Dharamshala. Earlier chief election commissioner Wangdu Tsering had said that the registration deadline was extended from December 23 to December 28 last year as per the request from several regional commissions. “Several people from remote areas were facing problems. So, keeping it in mind, we have allowed the additional time period for registration,” he said.Here is all you need to know about the 2021 elections to the Tibetian parliament in exile: 1. As many as 79,697 Tibetians have registered for the election, according to the CTA’s election commission in Dharamshala.2.

03-01-2021||World||A dozen Republican senators to oppose certification of Joe Biden’s win||A total of 12 US Republican senators, sitting and incoming, have made it known that they will oppose the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s election at a joint sitting of congress on January 6. Vice-president Mike Pence, who will preside, welcomed the move to overturn the presidential election.Eleven senators, including former presidential candidate Ted Cruz, made the announcement on Saturday. They joined Josh Hawley, who had already become the first senator to announce that he would oppose the certification, reportedly alongside more than 100 Republican members of the House.Slamming the move in a tweet on Saturday, President Donald Trump said, “An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can’t let it happen!” The House and Senate will certify Biden’s victory, a final step in the presidential election process that is usually a formality, in a joint session on January 6. Trump is pushing the Republicans through appeals and threats to oppose the certification. But the move is widely expected to fail, as did the 60 lawsuits filed by him and his allies and the vote recounts.The joint session is the final attempt by Trump to overturn his defeat to Biden in the presidential election, alleging that he lost because of voter fraud and irregularities in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada - the swing states - and also in Georgia, an otherwise Republican stronghold.In a joint statement, the 11 senators and senators-elect who joined Hawley called for an audit of the election results - in unidentified states - in 10 days’ time and said they will vote against the certification otherwise. Congress is unlikely to agree to their demand.Pence’s chief of staff Marc Short released a statement shortly after, saying the vice-president “shares the concerns” about voter fraud and irregularities and “welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the congress and the American people on January 6”.Many Republicans have already accepted the election outcome and recognised Biden as president-elect. Senator Mitt Romney, who is one of them, lashed out at some senators from his party, calling their opposition to the certification an “egregious ploy” that “dangerously threatens our Democratic republic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-dozen-republican-senators-to-oppose-certification-of-joe-biden-s-win/story-wq8BwBimkPmQyD5BTlX4UI.html

On Monday, the kingdom extended the measures for another week.According to the SPA news agency, the country will resume international flights and reopen borders from 11:00 a.m. (8:00 GMT) on Sunday.Non-citizens coming from the UK, South Africa, and other countries that have detected the new variant of the novel coronavirus will be required to spend no less than 14 days outside the affected countries before entering the kingdom, the agency said. Such travellers will also need to provide negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the coronavirus.Travellers from other countries will have to spend three to seven days in self-isolation and also provide PCR test results.A new strain of SARS-CoV-2, which could be up to 70 per cent more transmissible, was discovered in southeast England in mid-December. Despite many countries having suspended air service with the UK, the new strain is said to have spread across Europe and further afield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-lift-entry-ban-linked-to-new-coronavirus-strain-on-sunday/story-yf0a3UAIegO49e8VmDpwkK.html

Why would he resign on the Opposition’s demand?” Qureshi, who is also the PTI’s senior vice-chairperson, said while speaking to Geo News, after the 11-party-opposition alliance announced its goal to intensify its anti-government campaign by asking Imran Khan to resign by January 31.He said that the PDM had earlier announced to resign from the assemblies on December 31, but the date passed, Geo News reported.“The public has realised the Opposition’s true agenda and their jalsas do not have that strength,” Qureshi said and further claimed that the PDM will contest the Senate elections and by-polls.However, Pakistan Muslim Leauge--Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz said that the PDM will not contest the upper-house elections without consensus. PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Friday that the opposition’s movement would no longer be directed only at the Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government but also “his backers”.Rehman said it was decided after detailed discussions that the opposition will participate in the upcoming by-elections but there had been no decision on contesting in the Senate elections.“PDM has come out stronger than before and is more determined than before to rid the nation of this illegitimate government,” said the PDM chief and added that all PDM constituent parties had reported to the meeting today that the resignations of “all” opposition lawmakers had reached their party leaderships, in accordance with the December 31 date given for this purpose by the alliance, as reported by Dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-foreign-minister-slams-opposition-says-imran-khan-govt-will-not-resign/story-C5LBPEDZycMKIES6ogdKQL.html
03-01-2021||World||Senate Democrats slam Republicans for opposing Electoral College results||US Senate Democrats on Saturday criticised 11 Republican Senators, who announced that they would oppose the Electoral College results of the presidential elections on Wednesday, when the Congress convenes in a joint session to formally count the vote.According to The Hill, a group of Republican Senators consisting of Ted Cruz, Ron Johnson, James Lankford, Steve Daines, John Kennedy, Marsha Blackburn and Mike Braun and Senators-elect Cynthia Lummis, Roger Marshall, Bill Hagerty and Tommy Tuberville said in a joint statement that they will vote against accepting the election results until there is a 10-day audit.In response, a number of Democrats said that the group was undermining the electoral process by voting against the results, which confirmed the victory of President-elect Joe Biden over incumbent President Donald Trump.“It is a sad and tragic day for our country that 140 members of the House of Representatives, 13 senators and a defeated president are attempting to undermine American democracy and our Constitution. They will not succeed,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders.“Joe Biden will be inaugurated on January 20, and no publicity stunt will change that.... For a group of my Republican colleagues to claim that they want an additional federal ‘commission’ to supersede state certifications when the votes have already been counted, recounted, litigated, and state-certified, amounts to nothing more than an attempt to subvert the will of the voters,” The Hill quoted Senator Amy Klobuchar in a statement issued on Saturday.“This pathetic, opportunistic stunt is an attack on our democracy. It’s un-American & unconscionable. Votes have been counted, recounted, certified, & all challenges totally discredited. Time to govern & get things done,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal in a tweet.On Saturday, the GOP senators called on the US Congress in a joint statement, to appoint an Electoral Commission to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in disputed states.The Republican senators also said that a “fair and credible” audit-conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20” would dramatically improve Americans’ faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next President.”“Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states,” they said.Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission’s findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed, the joint statement read further.“Accordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified’ (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed,” they added.Meanwhile, Members of Republican leadership such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Whip John Thune have urged their colleagues to refrain from challenging the Electoral College results, reported The Hill.Biden was confirmed the winner of the November presidential election by the Electoral College on December 14 after all 50 states officially certified the voting results. According to official results, Biden collected 306 electoral votes as opposed to 232 votes cast for Trump.The US Congress will meet in the joint session on January 6 to confirm the Electoral College votes, with Vice President Mike Pence presiding over the session to count the votes from each state.Biden’s inauguration is scheduled for January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-democrats-slam-republicans-for-opposing-electoral-college-results/story-CLOAMwejhhCKJVp7hnroCK.html

Officials have not released a motive.Pack did not release additional details about what the packages from Warner contained but he urged anyone who may have received material from Warner to contact the FBI at 800-CALL-FBI.The bombing occurred Christmas morning well before downtown streets were bustling with activity. Police were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Then, inexplicably, the audio switched to a recording of Petula Clark’s 1964 hit “Downtown” shortly before the blast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nashville-bomber-sent-material-to-acquaintances-says-fbi/story-4FEltEk4HzbqBq3TKCPsgP.html

This will apply to more than 20,000 workers, the statement said.Routine testing will also be made more frequent, with workers now to be tested every seven days instead of every 14. Those who don’t follow these rules won’t be allowed to board ships for work.“Individuals and companies which are found to have violated these measures will be taken to task,” according to the statement. “Agencies will also review the need to enhance PPE and infection control measures in the sector.”A marine surveyor and a harbor pilot tested positive for coronavirus on Dec. 30 and 31, respectively, prompting the authorities to take steps to introduce the additional tightening measures. This followed a marine service engineer testing positive on Nov. 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tightens-rules-for-maritime-sector-after-detection-of-new-covid-cases/story-olsXlKg3E4LMvAPgrXdn8I.html
03-01-2021||World||California funeral homes run out of space as Covid-19 rages||As communities across the country feel the pain of a surge in coronavirus cases, funeral homes in the hot spot of Southern California say they must turn away grieving families as they run out of space for the bodies piling up.The head of the state funeral directors association says mortuaries are being inundated as the United States nears a grim tally of 350,000 Covid-19 deaths. More than 20 million people in the country have been infected, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.“Ive been in the funeral industry for 40 years and never in my life did I think that this could happen, that Id have to tell a family, No, we cant take your family member,” said Magda Maldonado, owner of Continental Funeral Home in Los Angeles.Continental is averaging about 30 body removals a day — six times its normal rate. Mortuary owners are calling one another to see whether anyone can handle overflow, and the answer is always the same: Theyre full, too.In order to keep up with the flood of bodies, Maldonado has rented extra 50-foot (15-meter) refrigerators for two of the four facilities she runs in LA and surrounding counties. Continental has also been delaying pickups at hospitals for a day or two while they deal with residential clients. Bob Achermann, executive director of the California Funeral Directors Association, said that the whole process of burying and cremating bodies has slowed down, including embalming bodies and obtaining death certificates. During normal times, cremation might happen within a day or two; now it takes at least a week or longer. Achermann said that in the southern part of the state, “every funeral home I talk to says, Were paddling as fast as we can.” “The volume is just incredible and they fear that they wont be able to keep up,” he said. “And the worst of the surge could still be ahead of us.” Los Angeles County, the epicenter of the crisis in California, has surpassed 10,000 Covid-19 deaths alone. Hospitals in the area are overwhelmed, and are struggling to keep up with basics such as oxygen as they treat an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. On Saturday, US Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update some hospital’s oxygen delivery systems.Nationally, an average of just over 2,500 people have died of Covid-19 over the past seven days, according to Johns Hopkins data. The number of daily newly reported cases in that period has averaged close to 195,000, a decline from two weeks earlier. It’s feared that holiday gatherings could fuel yet another rise in cases. Arkansas officials reported a record of more than 4,300 new Covid-19 cases Friday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted that the state is “certainly in the surge after Christmas travel and gatherings” and added, “As we enter this new year, our first resolution should be to follow guidelines.” North Carolina officials also reported a record 9,527 confirmed cases New Years Day. Thats more than 1,000 cases above the previous daily high. In Louisiana, a funeral was being held Saturday for a congressman-elect who died of Covid-19 complications. Republican Luke Letlow died Tuesday at age 41. His swearing-in had been scheduled Sunday. He leaves behind his wife, Julia Letlow, and two children, ages 1 and 3.In Texas, state officials say they have only 580 intensive care beds available as staff treat more than 12,480 hospitalized coronavirus patients, a number that has risen steadily since September and has set record highs this past week.In Window Rock, Arizona, the Navajo Nation remained in the midst of a weekend lockdown to try to slow the rate of infection. The tribe late Friday reported another seven deaths, bringing its totals since the pandemic began to 23,429 cases and 813 deaths. The reservation includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. Arizona on Saturday reported 18,943 new cases Friday and Saturday, a record for the state in any two-day period. It also reported 46 new deaths Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-funeral-homes-run-out-of-space-as-covid-19-rages/story-6Mlyal6GYqVrNIWSCubeCP.html

The driver then overcorrected and swerved into the southbound lane, where it struck the Ford driven by a woman.The Ford burst into flames on the dirt shoulder, while the Dodge came to a stop straddling both lanes of the highway, the CHP said. All eight people inside the Ford were killed, including the seven children.The driver of the Dodge was identified as Daniel Luna of Avenal. The coroner’s office was working on identifying the victims in the Ford.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/head-on-crash-kills-7-kids-2-adults-in-central-california/story-w52aQp7C4qMlh1Ja2EBs5J.html

He continued to do interviews on his own website and then, in 2012, he began hosting “Larry King Now” on Ora TV, an on-demand digital network that he co-founded.In 2013, he also began hosting a show called “Politicking with Larry King” on Ora TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news-star-larry-king-hospitalized-with-covid-19-says-report/story-gzr0mi0wi9KbuaNelouBHJ.html
03-01-2021||World||A dozen US senators plan to oppose Joe Biden’s certification||A group of Republican senators led by veteran lawmaker Ted Cruz said Saturday they would not vote next week to certify Joe Biden’s election win -- the latest last-ditch move to support Donald Trump’s efforts to undermine the vote.The initiative, which appears certain to fail, flies in the face of rulings in dozens of courts and the findings by officials in several key states, that there were no widespread voting problems. The Republicans’ statement, signed by Cruz and six other current senators along with four senators-elect, asserts that “allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.”The group said that when Congress convenes in a joint session on Wednesday -- for what normally would be a pro-forma certification of Biden’s victory -- they will demand the creation of a special commission to conduct an “emergency 10-day audit” of the election results. The statement says individual states could then convene special legislative sessions and potentially revise their vote totals.“An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can’t let it happen!” Trump tweeted Saturday.Posting a list of the 11 senators, Trump added: “And after they see the facts, plenty more to come...Our Country will love them for it!” They join Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who said earlier that he planned to raise objections on Wednesday. A Republican member of the House of Representatives, Louie Gohmert, has also announced his plan to oppose certification, and more than 100 House Republicans reportedly will back his challenge.Gohmert sought to further raise the stakes with a lawsuit that would have given Vice President Mike Pence -- traditionally in a ceremonial role in Wednesday’s session -- the power to overturn the election result.Pence opposed that effort, and a federal judge in Texas on Friday rejected the suit.The Hawley and Gohmert challenges will ensure that Congress must meet to hear the complaints. ‘The Electoral College has spoken’ The Congress sessions, sure to be contentious, will play out against a backdrop of pro-Trump rallies in Washington next week encouraged by the president himself. As with Trump’s other attempts to reverse his election defeat, the latest political maneuvering appears doomed. Democrats control the House, and many Republicans are expected to vote Wednesday for certification.The 11 senators conceded that most Democrats and “more than a few Republicans” would likely oppose their initiative.Among them is Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose state was a battleground that helped tip Biden into the win column. Its result is expected to be among those contested on Wednesday.“A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders,” Toomey said on Twitter. “The effort by Sens. Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines this right.”He added: “I voted for President Trump and endorsed him for re-election. But, on Wednesday, I intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.”Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has urged fellow Republicans to vote to certify and avoid a divisive political brawl, saying, “The Electoral College has spoken.”Biden won in the all-important Electoral College by a vote of 306 to 232.“This is cynical, anti-democratic posturing,” presidential historian Tim Naftali told CNN. Cruz is considered a likely 2024 presidential candidate. Hawley is also said to be positioning himself for a 2024 run -- and so is Pence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-dozen-us-senators-plan-to-oppose-joe-biden-s-certification/story-IHdt8N11WTd3XPhpJvO14J.html

03-01-2021||World||Authorities warn Australians of complacency against Covid-19||Health authorities are warning Australians to remain vigilant even as signs point to coronavirus clusters in the nation’s two most-populous states being brought under control.New South Wales on Sunday said it detected eight locally transmitted cases in the past 24 hours, compared with seven the day before. The outbreak in the state originated from a cluster originally from the Northern Beaches region of Sydney that spread to other areas of the city, and has now infected more than 150 people.Neighboring Victoria state detected three new cases in the past 24 hours, its health authorities said on Sunday. The tally is down from 10 new cases recorded the day before.Australian health authorities have been racing to get on top of the clusters which have disrupted the peak summer holiday period. The nation has managed to largely suppress community transmissions through rigorous testing and contact tracing, by placing restrictions on international arrivals, and through isolating all travelers returning from overseas in quarantine hotels for 14 days.The Sydney outbreak had spurred the New South Wales government into tightening social-distancing restrictions. From Monday, individuals in Australia’s largest city found not wearing masks in indoor venues such as shops, churches and on public transport will be fined A$200 ($154).More than 18,900 people in New South Wales were tested on Saturday. Acting Premier John Barilaro on Sunday urged for an increase to maintain the state’s record of success in restricting outbreaks.Victoria’s virus response commander Jeroen Weimar also urged residents in his state to maintain testing levels, particularly if they had returned from New South Wales after their shared border was closed on Saturday in a bid to contain clusters.“People need to continue to be alert and aware that this is not over yet,” Weimar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authorities-warn-australians-of-complacency-against-covid-19/story-Cu293HwytX1phXRVy9IRkK.html
03-01-2021||World||Memorial held for congressman-elect who contracted Covid-19||Louisiana Congressman-elect Luke Letlow, who recently died from Covid-19 complications, was remembered Saturday as a man who loved people and felt called to serve others.“This is a gentleman who cared about nothing but others,” said former Republican US Rep. Ralph Abraham, who hired Letlow as chief of staff during his tenure in Washington and later backed Letlow’s bid for Congress. “He was a true servant’s servant. We never want to forget what he’s done for our state, what he’s done for me and my family.”Letlow, an incoming Republican member of the US House, died Tuesday at 41. Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered flags flown at half-staff on Saturday for Letlow, who is survived by his wife, Julia Letlow, and their children, Jeremiah, 3, and Jacqueline, 1.More than 200 people gathered at North Monroe Baptist Church for the memorial. Abraham acknowledged the presence of other members of the state’s congressional delegation in attendance, including US Reps. Clay Higgins and Garret Graves.Abraham noted that Letlow was known for the relationships he forged.“Luke loved Louisiana. He loved traveling down country roads with potholes, going to Lea’s in Lecompte for pie and milk and talking to the locals,” he said.Abraham urged friends and family to plant a tree in Letlow’s memory.“Plant a tree that you have to water and nurture and watch grow. And every time you pass that tree, you’ll remember Luke and smile and embrace that warm feeling that comes to your heart as you go about your day. He wants us to be happy, courageous and strong. The way we honor and remember Luke Letlow is to build that type of life.”Letlow, from the small town of Start in Richland Parish, was elected in a December runoff election for the sprawling 5th District US House seat representing central and northeastern regions of the state, including the cities of Monroe and Alexandria. He was to fill the seat being vacated by Abraham.Jonathan S. Wagner, pastor at Covenant Presbyterian Church, said the number of people present and watching the service via livestream was a “testament to Luke’s impact during his 41 ears on this earth.”“The tributes speak to his genuineness, his work ethic, his playful spirit, his love for Louisiana and his love for people. He was a great man and it was a great privilege to have known him,” Wagner said.Wagner said Letlow cared deeply about public service.“People knew he was not just trying to get his name out there,” during his campaign travels, Wagner said. “He was genuinely interested in meeting people and hearing their stories. He wanted to know what shaped them and made them who they were. Those stories shaped him and changed the way he lived. He went into politics to be a public servant in the purest sense. He wanted to help others because he loved them deeply and sincerely and was driven by his faith.”Jeffrey Thomas, a friend of Letlow’s and lead pastor at Start Baptist Church, described Letlow as “God’s special possession.”“The love of God flowed through Luke,” Thomas said. “Julia, he loved you and he loved those babies. ... Whatever memories you have of him, words spoke by him or whatever service he gave you, he did it out of love. God gave us a special gift in Luke. He made the most of every opportunity and wanted to make sure that you and I had the absolute best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memorial-held-for-congressman-elect-who-contracted-covid-19/story-yeW9ccyoaWNKLNgditoErO.html

03-01-2021||World||UK abolishes ‘tampon tax’ on menstrual products||The UK has abolished the 5 per cent rate of value-added tax (VAT) on menstrual products, known as the tampon tax -- meaning that there will no longer be VAT on period products from January 1 onwards.“(The) tampon tax abolished - from today (1 Jan 2021) VAT no longer applies to women’s sanitary products. (This is a) part of wider government action to End Period Poverty which includes the roll-out of free sanitary products in schools, colleges and hospitals. The move made possible by end of the transition period and freedom from EU law mandating VAT on sanitary products,” the UK Government said in a statement.The statement further said that the move honours a government commitment to scrap the tax and is part of a wider strategy to make sanitary products affordable and available for all women.Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “I’m proud that we are today delivering on our promise to scrap the tampon tax. Sanitary products are essential so it’s right that we do not charge VAT.”He added, “We have already rolled out free sanitary products in schools, colleges and hospitals and this commitment takes us another step closer to making them available and affordable for all women.”The Chancellor announced that the tampon tax was to be abolished from 1 January 2021 at March 2020 Budget. As the transition period ended on December 31st, the UK is no longer bound by the EU VAT Directive which mandates a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products.According to CNN, Campaigners had been calling for the end of the tax, labeled “sexist” and “outdated,” for years.“It’s been a long road to reach this point, but at last the sexist tax that saw sanitary products classed as non-essential, luxury items can be consigned to the history books,” Felicia Willow Chief Executive of the Fawcett Society, the UK’s oldest charity campaigning for women’s rights and gender equality.Scotland became the first country in the world to allow free and universal access to menstrual products, including tampons and pads, in public facilities, in November 2020.Globally, just a handful of countries have zero tax added to sanitary products, including Canada, India, Australia, Kenya and several US states.Germany also voted to reduce its tax rate on feminine hygiene products after deeming them to be a daily necessity, not a luxury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-abolishes-tampon-tax-on-menstrual-products/story-iXxyRXps0hDEnGbw89MqaJ.html

03-01-2021||World||Pandemic hiatus at Sydney Opera House set to end with glitzy show||The finishing touches were being put on a glitzy show at the Sydney Opera House Saturday, as the venue prepared to host an opera crowd for the first time since March.“The Merry Widow” will open on Tuesday to masked audiences up to 75 percent capacity, in a sign of hope for a performing arts industry crippled by the pandemic, artistic director Lyndon Terracini told AFP. “Walking back into the theatre was a very emotional time for everyone involved,” he said. “I think throughout this year, other opera houses will be opening very soon and people will be coming back to the theatre with a sense of hope.”Thanks to Australia’s success in suppressing the virus, crowds inside venues -- including the Sydney Opera House -- have been permitted in the country’s most populous city for months.But even as the performers readied for their opening night, an outbreak in the city forced officials to tighten restrictions -- including a new mandate on mask-wearing on public transport and in many indoor settings from midnight Saturday.The outbreak of over 180 cases first emerged in December in Sydney’s northeast but has since sparked other clusters, including in Melbourne.Areas of Sydney remain under lockdown and officials have suggested further restrictions may be needed to curb the spread -- which could include a change to audiences at indoor performances.Julie Lea Goodwin, who leads the show along with Alexander Lewis, said she was thrilled to be back performing but after a nine-month hiatus the uncertainty of the pandemic still loomed. “I have no idea what’s ahead,” Goodwin said. “I think that Australia is doing an unbelievable job... but it’s just going to be a process for the next year, I’d say, or longer.”Australia has recorded over 28,400 cases of the virus and 909 deaths linked to Covid-19 in a population of about 25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-hiatus-at-sydney-opera-house-set-to-end-with-glitzy-show/story-QUcOvWDH8XIoVi6dC6iKDJ.html
03-01-2021||World||UK PM Johnson could lose his seat and majority at next election, says poll||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is on course to lose his own seat and neither of the two main political parties is likely to win an outright majority at the next general election, not due until 2024, according to a new poll.This is the first detailed survey of the public’s perception of Johnson’s handling of the recently concluded Brexit talks and the Covid-19 pandemic after he reversed plans to allow families to meet up at Christmas in parts of southern England to combat the spread of the virus.More than 22,000 people were surveyed in a closely watched poll constituency-by-constituency poll over a four-week period in December, which was conducted by the research data company Focaldata and published by the Sunday Times.The so-called multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) poll found the ruling Conservatives would lose 81 seats, wiping out the 80-seat majority. This would leave the Conservatives with 284 seats, while the opposition Labour Party would win 282 seats, the poll showed.The Scottish National Party, which wants to break away from the rest of the United Kingdom, is predicted to win 57 of the 59 seats in Scotland, meaning the party could potentially play a kingmaker role in forming the next government.The prime minister is at risk to lose his own seat of Uxbridge, west of London, the poll found.Johnson won a resounding election victory last year that allowed him to take Britain out of the European Union’s orbit on New Year’s Eve after almost half a century of close ties.But Johnson’s premiership may increasingly be defined by the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has already killed more than 74,000 people and crushed the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-could-lose-his-seat-and-majority-at-next-election-says-poll/story-Sh0Ba56BE9YugBUYKAnILJ.html
03-01-2021||World||Israeli protesters press on against PM Netanyahu||Thousands of Israelis protested again on Saturday against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding that the long-serving leader resign over corruption charges against him and for allegedly mishandling the coronavirus crisis.Holding signs reading “Go” and “Everyone is equal before the law,” the demonstrators crowded a Jerusalem square near Netanyahu’s official residence, where they have gathered for months to call for his resignation.Netanyahu is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three cases involving billionaire associates and media moguls. He denies wrongdoing.But the protesters say Netanyahu cannot properly lead the country while under indictment for corruption. His trial is set to begin evidentiary hearings in the coming weeks.Israel is set to hold its fourth national election in two years in March, what will likely be another referendum against Netanyahu as he faces a challenge from defectors within his Likud Party.The protesters also say Netanyahu and his government have bungled the coronavirus response. The country has seen its economy hit hard by virus restrictions throughout the year and is again under a nationwide if partial lockdown amid surging infection rates.Netanyahu and his allies have used Israel’s widespread vaccination drive, in which more than a tenth of its population has been immunized, to try to undercut the protesters and their cause. They claim Netanyahu is working to end Israel’s coronavirus outbreak while they just hold demonstrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-protesters-press-on-against-pm-netanyahu/story-qB6BHtNs4G3zdSYxlIz6YI.html

A profanity directed at the Republican senator was painted under the mailbox.At House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home in San Francisco, someone spray-painted graffiti and left a pig’s head and fake blood on New Year’s Day, police said. The vandalism was reported around 2 a.m. Friday, a police statement said, and a special investigations unit is trying to determine who did it.KGO-TV reported that graffiti found on the garage door of the Democratic leader’s home included the phrases “$2K,” “Cancel rent!” and “We want everything,” apparently referencing Democratic lawmakers’ failed efforts to increase the coronavirus relief checks from $600 to $2000.The news station says security cameras surround the three-story brick home in the tony Pacific Heights neighborhood.McConnell released a statement on Saturday condemning the vandalism at his home in Louisville.“I’ve spent my career fighting for the First Amendment and defending peaceful protest,” he stated. “I appreciate every Kentuckian who has engaged in the democratic process whether they agree with me or not. This is different. Vandalism and the politics of fear have no place in our society.”McConnell said he and his wife are not intimidated by the vandalism. “We just hope our neighbors in Louisville aren’t too inconvenienced by this radical tantrum.”Louisville police are investigating the incident at McConnell’s home, which occurred around 5 a.m. Saturday. There currently are no suspects, police spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said in an email.On New Year’s Day, Senate Republicans refused to allow debate over a bill to increase the amount of Covid-19 relief. The increase, supported by President Donald Trump, passed the Democratic-led House but was blocked by McConnell.The government has begun sending out the smaller payments to millions of Americans. The $600 payment is going to individuals with incomes up to $75,000. Congress approved the payment in late December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcconnell-pelosi-homes-vandalized-after-2-000-relief-fails/story-yz1Zatx7nF0I5yCdYs21OJ.html
03-01-2021||World||Ted Cruz leads 11 GOP senators to challenge Biden’s win||A coalition of 11 Republican senators announced Saturday it will challenge the outcome of the presidential election by voting to reject electors from some states when Congress meets next week to certify the Electoral College results that confirmed President-elect Joe Biden won.President Donald Trump’s extraordinary refusal to accept his election defeat and the effort to subvert the will of the voters has become a defining moment for Republicans and is tearing the party apart. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has urged Republican not to try to overturn the election.The 11 senators, led by Ted Cruz of Texas, said they will vote against certain state electors unless Congress appoints an electoral commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. They acknowledged they are unlikely to change the results of the election.“We intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not ‘regularly given’ and ‘lawfully certified’ (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed,” they wrote in the statement.“We do not take this action lightly,” they said.In response to Trump’s unfounded claims of voter fraud, bipartisan election officials and Trump’s then-Attorney General William Barr have said there was no evidence of widespread fraud and the election ran smoothly.The days ahead are expected to do little to change the outcome. Biden is set to be inaugurated Jan. 20 after winning the Electoral College vote 306-232.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ted-cruz-leads-11-gop-senators-to-challenge-biden-s-win/story-yJK47PHKb7SoYWJOPSV1AK.html
