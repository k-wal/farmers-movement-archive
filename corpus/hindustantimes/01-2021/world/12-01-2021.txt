Authorities also confiscated more than 20 servers in Moldova and Ukraine.DarkMarket facilitated at least 320,000 transactions -- including 4,650 for Bitcoin and 12,800 for Monero, another crypto currency -- valued at more than 140 million euros ($170 million), prosecutors said. The platform was used mainly to sell drugs, but vendors also offered counterfeit money, stolen and fraudulent credit card information, anonymous SIM cards and malware.Authorities from around the world, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the US Drug Enforcement Administration and police from countries including the UK, Denmark and Ukraine contributed to the investigation, with the EU’s Europol coordinating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-police-shuts-down-darknet-marketplace-that-traded-drugs-bitcoin-101610473724273.html
12-01-2021||World||EU regulator ponders Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approval by January end||The European Medicines Agency said Tuesday that AstraZeneca and Oxford University have submitted an application for their Covid-19 vaccine to be licensed across the European Union.The EU regulator said it received a request for the vaccine to be green-lighted under an expedited process and that it could be approved by January 29 “provided that the data submitted on the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine are sufficiently robust and complete.”The EMA, the drugs agency for the 27-nation EU, has already approved two other coronavirus vaccines, one made by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech and another made by US biotechnology company Moderna. Switzerland approved the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday and plans to immunize about 4% of its population using that and the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.Britain gave its approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last month and has been using it. India approved it this month.As part of its strategy to obtain as many different Covid-19 vaccines as possible for Europeans, the EU said it had concluded early talks with French biotech company Valneva to secure up to 60 million doses of vaccine.Valneva previously signed a deal with Britain to provide tens of millions of doses of its shot, which is developed using similar technology to that used to make flu vaccines. The EU has sealed six vaccine contracts for up to 2 billion doses, many more than are necessary to cover its population of approximately 450 million.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be a key vaccine for many countries because of its low cost, availability and ease of use. It can be kept in refrigerators rather than the ultra-cold storage that the Pfizer vaccine requires. The company has said it will sell it for $2.50 a dose and plans to make up to 3 billion doses by the end of 2021.Researchers claim the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine protected against disease in 62% of those given two full doses and in 90% of those initially given a half dose because of a manufacturing error. However, the second group included only 2,741 people — too few to be conclusive.Questions also remain about how well the vaccine protects older people. Only 12% of study participants were over 55 and they were enrolled later, so there hasn’t been enough time to see whether they develop infections at a lower rate than those not given the vaccine.The US Food and Drug Administration says it won't consider approving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine until data are available from late state research testing the shot in about 30,000 people.The World Health Organization is also examining a request from AstraZeneca and Oxford for an emergency use listing for its vaccine.The UN health agency does not license or regulate vaccines itself, but typically evaluates vaccines once they have been approved by an agency such as the UK regulator or the European Medicines Agency. WHO experts conduct their own evaluation of whether or not the risks of a vaccine outweigh its benefits and then make a recommendation for the shots to be “pre-qualified” so they can be bought by donors for developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-regulator-ponders-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-approval-by-january-end-101610473826945.html
12-01-2021||World||F-35 flies with 871 flaws, only two fewer than year earlier||Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35, the fighter jet already being flown by the U.S. and eight allies, remains marred by 871 software and hardware deficiencies that could undercut readiness, missions or maintenance, according to the Pentagon’s testing office.The Defense Department’s costliest weapons system “continues to carry a large number of deficiencies, many of which were identified prior to” the development and demonstration phase, which ended in April 2018 with 941 flaws, Robert Behler, the director of operational testing, said in a new assessment obtained by Bloomberg News in advance of its publication.Lockheed has delivered or is under contract for 970 aircraft of a potential 3,200 or more planes for the US and other nations. The assessment outlining the seemingly intractable roster of flaws -- it’s down only two from the 873 that Behler reported last year -- provides the incoming Biden administration with a primer on the $398 billion F-35 program that retains strong backing in Congress and from overseas purchasers despite its problems.Those include a stalled one-month simulation exercise required to certify the plane is combat-ready against the toughest Russian or Chinese threats and thus ready for a decision on full-rate production.Ellen Lord, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, has directed a review no later than May 31 on progress toward conducting the oft-delayed simulation that most recently had been scheduled to occur last month. In a previously undisclosed Dec. 15 memo to Navy and Air Force officials, Lord also ordered an update to the Pentagon’s F-35 acquisition strategy. Behler predicted the simulation will occur by mid or late-year.In October, the F-35 program will mark 20 years since Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed beat rival Boeing Co. in the contest to build the next-generation US fighter.Laura Seal, a spokesperson for the Defense Department’s F-35 program office, declined to comment until Behler’s report is released officially.Aside from the technical flaws, the F-35 program faces a $10 billion shortfall in the Pentagon’s planned budget for 2021 through 2025. The Trump administration’s final budget blueprint calls for requesting $78 billion for research and development, jet procurement, operations and maintenance and military construction. But the Pentagon’s independent cost analysis unit estimates $88 billion will be needed, according to a June 2020 analysis.Upgrade ScheduleThe F-35 program is undergoing a “Block 4” upgrade costing at least $12.1 billion that’s intended to correct past deficiencies and introduce new capabilities in six-month increments through 2026 to keep up with current threats. The plan includes retrofitting some planes already built and in use by militaries from the US and the UK to Japan.Even with this focused effort, “the overall number of open deficiencies has not changed significantly since” early 2018, Behler wrote, “due to ongoing problems with initial software quality” in Block 4 and “limited lab and flight test capability, resulting in a high rate of problem discoveries” in testing and in the field.The Block 4 process “is not working,” Behler wrote. “It is causing significant delays to planned schedules and results in poor software quality, containing deficiencies.” Software changes “intended to introduce new capabilities or fix deficiencies often introduced stability problems.”Only 10 of the 871 unresolved deficiencies cited by Boehler involve potentially serious “Category 1” issues, defined as critical deficiencies that could jeopardize pilot or aircraft safety or degrade mission effectiveness. That’s compared with 102 such problems among the 941 cases cited in 2018.Lockheed said in a statement that none of the 10 current deficiencies are “1A” problems that could affect pilot or aircraft safety but instead are in “Category 1B,” which the program office defines as representing “a critical impact on mission readiness,” training or maintenance.“Though we have not seen the report, we track all F-35 deficiency reports,” Lockheed spokesman Brett Ashworth said in a statement. He said about 70% of the 871 pending items “are categorized as low priority or are with the F-35 Joint Program Office for resolution.”Of the 10 pending “mission impacts” deficiency reports, nine have “closure resolution plans, with seven already delivered to the government awaiting action,” and the others currently being reviewed.A defense official who’s seen the Behler assessment said many of the deficiencies will be resolved with production line changes and software updates. Although deficiencies must be documented for contractual and reporting purposes, the official said, depending on their severity they might not be rapidly resolved. The size, scope and resolution status are being evaluated as part of the ongoing negotiations for a 15th production contract, the official said.Among other findings, the testing office’s report said that although the F-35 is showing increased reliability, it’s still taking maintenance personnel too much time to repair aircraft and that cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified during earlier testing “have not been resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/f35-flies-with-871-flaws-only-two-fewer-than-year-earlier-101610469415939.html
12-01-2021||World||Donald Trump may be shielded from riot charges by a previous Supreme Court ruling on a Ku Klux Klan speech case||A 1969 Supreme Court ruling that tossed the conviction of a Ku Klux Klan leader may also shield President Donald Trump from prosecution for inciting last week’s Capitol riot, leaving few alternatives to hold him accountable if impeachment efforts fail.At the rally preceding the riot, Trump gave an inflammatory speech, urging the crowd to go to the Capitol and demand legislators address his baseless claims of election fraud. He asked his supporters to “show strength” and “fight much harder.” Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and US Representative Mo Brooks also spoke ahead of the riot, which led to five deaths.Several Democrats and some Republicans have raised the possibility that Trump might be prosecuted for inciting the riot, and Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington, fed such speculation when he suggested on Thursday that his office would probe the president’s role. But many legal experts are skeptical charges will be filed against Trump.“A prosecution is possible but unlikely,” said John Banzhaf, a law professor at George Washington University. “A conviction would be even less likely.”‘Imminent Lawless Action’That’s because the Supreme Court said in its landmark decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio that the constitutional right to free speech protects inflammatory rhetoric unless it’s intended to incite “imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.” The ruling overturned the conviction of Clarence Brandenburg, an Ohio Klan leader who had been prosecuted under a state law for making a speech in which he advocated violence against African Americans and Jews.The case, in which the American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) represented Brandenburg, set a high bar for criminal prosecutions of inflammatory speech. To make the case that Trump incited the riot, prosecutors would have to show that he intended to provoke violence, but his words are vague enough that it’s possible to argue that he was simply urging his supporters to peacefully protest outside the Capitol.“Intention to incite is always difficult to show,” said Shirin Sinnar, a law professor at Stanford who studies the legal treatment of political violence. “A lot of the evidence here can be interpreted in different ways.”Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump called his remarks at the rally “totally appropriate,” rejecting any blame for the attack. He instead cast efforts to impeach him as a “terrible thing” that was causing “tremendous anger.”To prove intent, prosecutors could parse the language Trump used in his speech, highlighting particular words or phrases that seem to urge violence. They could also point to Trump’s comments in a video released only after police had started regaining control of the Capitol: “We love you, you’re very special.”‘Trial by Combat’Still, those comments are “a far cry from inciting violence,” said Ediberto Roman, a professor at Florida International University College of Law. Giuliani, who called for “trial by combat” to settle the president’s election-fraud claims,” was “far closer to promoting violence,” Roman said, though the former New York mayor would also be hard to successfully prosecute.The “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard to impeach the President under the Constitution is more flexible, and several Trump allies like former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have said he clearly committed an impeachable offence by encouraging the rioters. House Democrats on Monday introduced a resolution to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, setting up a vote this week unless Vice President Mike Pence and a majority of Trump’s cabinet invoke the Constitution’s 25th Amendment to remove Trump.But it’s unclear how many Republicans will want to take a politically difficult vote to remove a president of their own party. Speaking to CNN on Sunday, US Senator Pat Toomey suggested criminal prosecution might be an alternative to impeachment in terms of holding Trump accountable.Federal prosecutors have so far sent mixed signals. Though Sherwin emphasized that the Justice Department was scrutinizing “all actors,” his top deputy, Ken Kohl, said the following day that he did not expect charges against people who gave speeches at the rally. Ultimately, however, the decision whether or not to prosecute Trump will be up to the leaders of the Justice Department under President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he will nominate federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland to be attorney general.White House SubpoenasSome former prosecutors say Trump’s actions offer enough evidence of intent to justify at least an investigation. A grand jury could subpoena internal White House communications to help US prosecutors determine whether Trump or his associates knew that some of the rioters had come to Washington intent on committing violence.“I wouldn’t say it’s a slam dunk, but if I’m a prosecutor, I feel pretty good about my proof of intent,” said Randall Eliason, a former assistant US attorney in Washington. “This crowd did exactly what Trump wanted.”It’s the same kind of evidence that prosecutors are currently scouring concerning people that directly participated in the riot. If they can find rioters conspired with one another, they’ll use social media posts, email and phone communications, police observations of rioters’ behavior and communications to try to prove their cases, said Mike Shepard, a former Justice Department official.Federal prosecutors have already charged more than 50 participants in the Capitol siege, accusing them of a range of offenses from trespassing to assault, and are also investigating as a murder the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick.​Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor, said a number of the rioters could ultimately face charges of participating in a seditious conspiracy, which involves two or more people agreeing to use force to hinder the execution of U.S. law or seize U.S. government property, according to statute. Many rioters seemed to have in mind the goal of stopping Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.“There is evidence of coordination on social media by the rioters with each other,” said Sandick. “There are also statements by the rioters that they understood their actions to be at Trump’s request.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-may-be-shielded-from-riot-charges-by-a-previous-supreme-court-ruling-on-a-ku-klux-klan-speech-case-101610468381868.html
12-01-2021||World||Trump slams impeachment move as Democrats press ahead||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his January 6 speech that has been blamed for storming of the US Capitol as “totally appropriate” and said a move underway to impeach him had caused “tremendous anger”. He sought to characterise it as part of the “witch hunt” that had led to his first impeachment.Democrats in the House of Representatives are planning a vote to impeach Trump on Wednesday for “incitement of insurrection”, amid tightening security countrywide following FBI’s warning of “armed protests” at the US Capitol and all 50 state capitols in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on January 20.“If you read my speech, and many people have done it and I’ve seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television, it’s been analysed and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate,” he told reporters.In another interaction with reporters earlier in the day, the first since the January 6 riots, he had said, “The impeachment is really a continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics. It’s ridiculous. It’s absolutely ridiculous.”He added: “This impeachment is causing tremendous anger … I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger. I want no violence.” He repeated several times he did not want any violence; unlike the vague appeals he had issued during the attacks.The FBI warning of more attacks came in an internal memo that was widely reported in US media. “Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from January 16 through at least January 20, and at the US Capitol from January 17 through January 20,” it said.US Secret Service’s special security arrangements for the inauguration have been ordered to be initiated a week before January 19, as a result, and National Guard forces, SWAT teams and special police squads have been deployed to secure state capitols.“In light of events of the past week and the evolving security landscape leading up to the inauguration and at the recommendation of (the) Secret Service,” Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security said in a statement, “I have instructed the US Secret Service to begin the National Special Security Event operations for the 2021 Inauguration effective Wednesday, January 13th instead of January 19th”.Wolf himself resigned later in the day, becoming the third member of President Trump’s cabinet to quit following the storming of the US Capitol on January 6 by rioters incited and instigated by the president’s lies about stolen elections and fraud. Six people died in the attack including two police officers.US House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday to call upon Vice-President Mike Pence to oust President Donald Trump invoking the 25th Amendment. If he doesn’t do so in the next 24 hours, the chamber will vote to impeach Trump on Wednesday, making him the first president impeached twice. He was last impeached in December 2019, but the Senate acquitted him, letting him stay in office.Democrats then plan to send the article of impeachment to the Senate for a trial to convict the president, either before he leaves office at the end of his term on January 20 or after.Efforts to remove President Trump from office gathered momentum as did the investigation into the stunning breach of the US Capitol by rioters instigated by him to stop a joint of session of Congress, presided by Vice-President Mike Pence, from certifying Biden’s election victory.More than 20 people have been arrested in the countrywide sweep by FBI and local law enforcement agencies — that include the rioters seen the most in pictures. Two officers of the US Capitol police have been suspended and 17 others are under investigation for allegedly helping the rioters.Also supportive of the rioters were more than a dozen lawmakers from at least nine states, according to reports. They had joined the crowds, and participated in the storming of Congress. One of them, from solidly conservative West Virginia, has since resigned his seat and has been arrested.The social media sweep of right-wing rhetoric continued. Twitter suspended more than 70,000 accounts linked to right-wing QAnon conspiracy theories and peddlers. It said the action was a fallout of the January 6 events.Democrats had on Monday introduced a resolution urging Pence to lead the cabinet to declare Trump unfit to govern under the 25th Amendment which empowers the vie-president to sideline the president for being unfit to govern. Democrats will give him 24 hours to respond, and then will call the impeachment vote.The article of impeachment, accusing Trump of “incitement of resurrection,” laid out the case against Trump very clearly. “Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced members of Congress and the vice-president, interfered with the joint sessions’ solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.” The article further said that by such conduct, he has demonstrated that “he will remain a threat to national security, democracy and the constitution if allowed to remain in office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-slams-impeachment-move-as-democrats-press-ahead-101610470578281.html
12-01-2021||World||Explained: How black boxes of crashed Indonesian jet will be handled||Indonesian authorities have retrieved one of two black boxes, the Flight Data Recorder, from a Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday.This is how the black box readout process works.What are black boxes?They are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They are mandatory.The aim is not to establish legal liability, but to identify causes and help prevent future accidents.How they have evolved?The earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Models like those typically found on the 1980s-designed Boeing 737-50 use magnetic tape. Modern ones use computer chips.The recordings are housed inside crash-survivable containers able to withstand 3,400 times the force of gravity on impact.The disappearance in 2014 of Malaysian Airlines MH370 triggered debate about whether data should be streamed instead.Airbus and France's BEA are testing an alternative design in a floatable panel embedded in the aircraft's fuselage. Bolts would retract and the device would fall away when the plane is about to crash on water, avoiding a deep-sea search.How big are they?They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) and contain four main parts:* a chassis or interface designed to fix the device and facilitate recording and playback* an underwater locator beacon* the core housing or 'Crash-Survivable Memory Unit' made of stainless steel or titanium* inside there, the recordings on chips or older formats.There are two recorders: a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for pilot voices or cockpit sounds, and a Flight Data Recorder (FDR).How will the recorders be handled?After a crash over the sea, the recorder is placed back in water to prevent damage from contact with air while being transported.Once dry, technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean and retrieve the recordings, which are copied.Lab experts sometimes use "spectral analysis," a way of examining sounds that can pick out barely audible alarms or the first fleeting crack of an explosion. Indonesian investigators say the Sriwijaya jet appeared to be intact when it hit water.How much information is available?The FDR contains about 25 hours of data on eight tracks and the CVR has 30 minutes of conversation, according to the final report on a similar model of Boeing 737 which crashed in 2008.Later models have two hours of cockpit recordings.In many countries, only the main investigator and a handful of people are allowed to hear the raw cockpit tapes.Where will the data be read?Indonesian officials leading the probe have said they plan to perform the readout at their facilities. If recorders are badly damaged, the operation is occasionally delegated to an overseas agency like France's BEA or the device's manufacturer.Photographs of the Sriwijaya data recorder arriving at a port on Tuesday appeared to show its crash-resistant container intact.How long will the results take?Indonesia has said it will take 2-5 days to inspect and download recordings. Their analysis can take much longer.Interim reports are published after a month but are often sparse. Deeper investigations take a year or more to complete.Experts say air accidents are usually caused by a cocktail of factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-black-boxes-of-crashed-indonesian-jet-will-be-handled-101610469393953.html
12-01-2021||World||Chinese city of Langfang goes into lockdown amid new Covid-19 threat||The Chinese city of Langfang near Beijing went into lockdown on Tuesday as new coronavirus infections raised worries about a second wave in a country that has mostly contained Covid-19.The number of new cases in mainland China reported on Tuesday remained a small fraction of those seen at the height of the outbreak in early 2020. However, authorities are implementing strict curbs whenever new cases emerge.The National Health Commission reported 55 new cases on Tuesday, down from 103 on Monday. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, accounted for 40 of the 42 locally transmitted infections.In a village in the south of Beijing that shares a border with Hebei, residents were stopping vehicles and asking to see health-tracking codes on mobile phones."We have to be careful as we're near Guan, where Covid cases were reported today," said a volunteer security officer surnamed Wang.At a highway checkpoint, police in protective gowns ordered a car entering Beijing to return to Hebei after the driver was unable to show proof of a negative coronavirus test.China's state planning agency said it expected travel during next month's Lunar New Year period to be markedly down on normal years, with a bigger share of people choosing cars over other transport. Many provinces have urged migrant workers to stay put for the festival.Home QuarantineLangfang, southeast of Beijing, said its 4.9 million residents would be put under home quarantine for seven days and tested for the virus.The government in Beijing said a World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origin of the coronavirus would arrive on Thursday in the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in late 2019, after a delay that Beijing has called a "misunderstanding".Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, has been hardest hit in the latest surge and has already placed its 11 million people under lockdown. The province has shut sections of highway and is ordering vehicles to turn back.A new guideline from the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control recommended that taxi and ride-hailing operators suspend car-pooling services, and that drivers should get weekly DNA tests and be vaccinated in order to work, the ruling Communist Party-backed Beijing Daily reported.As of Jan. 9, China had administered more than 9 million vaccine doses.Across the country, the number of new asymptomatic cases rose to 81 from 76 the previous day. China does not classify asymptomatic cases as confirmed coronavirus infections.The total number of confirmed cases reported in mainland China stands at 87,591, with an official death toll of 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-city-of-langfang-goes-into-lockdown-amid-new-covid-19-threat-101610464773053.html
12-01-2021||World||What is the 25th Amendment and why is Pence under pressure to invoke it?||The US House of Representatives is set to issue an ultimatum to vice president Mike Pence to remove President Donald Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment of the Constitution. On Monday, House Republicans blocked the resolution that called on Pence to invoke 25th Amendment in order to convene the cabinet and declare Trump unfit for the office after he incited a mob that stormed the US Capitol. The House with Democratic majority will now vote on the resolution to put pressure on the vice president.What is the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution?The amendment was proposed by Congress in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and was ratified by the states on February 10, 1967. The amendment contains four sections that lay out the provisions for presidential succession, owing to different reasons.The first section states that if the president dies, or undergoes medical treatment, or is incapacitated, the vice president takes over as the president. The second section addresses the vacancies in the office of the vice president. The third section enables the president to declare himself or herself unable to discharge the duties and resign from the office.“The Watergate scandal of the 1970s saw the application of these procedures, first when Gerald Ford replaced Spiro Agnew as Vice President, then when he replaced Richard Nixon as President, and then when Nelson Rockefeller filled the resulting vacancy to become the Vice President,” according to Cornell Law School.Also Read | House set to give Mike Pence ultimatum before moving to impeach Donald TrumpIn the ongoing scenario, Congressional Democrats want Pence to invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4, a president can be removed from the office if he/she is deemed incapable to “discharge the powers and duties” of the office, empowering the vice president to discharge those power and duties as acting president. The fourth section of the 25th amendment has never been invoked in the history of the United States.Is it likely to get invoked?Though the resolution to call on the vice president to invoke the 25th Amendment is likely to pass in a Democrats-controlled House, Pence has not shown any intention to act on it. The resolution is mostly a symbolic gesture by Democrats to show that they have exhausted all options before moving to the impeachment proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-the-25th-amendment-and-why-is-pence-under-pressure-to-invoke-it-101610467530076.html
12-01-2021||World||Donald Trump rejects blame for Capitol riot, calls rally ‘totally appropriate’||President Donald Trump rejected any responsibility for the deadly storming of the US Capitol by his supporters last week, calling remarks he delivered during a rally outside the White House before the attack “totally appropriate” and warning lawmakers not to impeach him a second time.Trump on Tuesday said it’s “absolutely ridiculous” that the House is moving rapidly to impeach him for inciting an insurrection, saying the effort is causing “tremendous anger.”The president defended remarks he made at a rally at the Ellipse that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.“People thought that what I said was totally appropriate, and if you look at what other people have said, politicians at a high level, about the riots during the summer, the horrible riots in Portland and Seattle and various other places, that was a real problem, what they said,” Trump said at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington.The president has been largely silent after social media companies banned him last week from their platforms over concern his posts would incite further violence. He spoke to reporters for the first time since the riot as he departed the White House for Alamo, Texas.“It’s really a terrible thing they’re doing,” Trump told reporters at the White House, before boarding the presidential helicopter to the airbase. He also said that “Big Tech has made a terrible mistake” in banning him from social media.Democrats and several Republicans have decried Trump’s role in inciting a mob that went on to force its way into the Capitol in a chaotic scene that left five people dead.The House is set to issue a largely futile ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday, demanding he invoke constitutional authority to remove Trump from office. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to go through with a vote on a single article of impeachment as soon as Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-rejects-blame-for-capitol-riot-calls-rally-totally-appropriate-101610466988621.html
12-01-2021||World||Move to impeach continuation of greatest witch hunt in political history: Trump||Donald Trump emerged from isolation at the White House on Tuesday to brand the likely second impeachment of his presidency "absolutely ridiculous" and warn that it has triggered "tremendous anger."Speaking as he boarded Marine One at the White House for a trip to Texas, Trump called his scheduled impeachment in the House of Representatives on Wednesday a "continuation of the greatest witch hunt in the history of politics."With only eight days left in his one-term administration, Trump finds himself alone, shunned by former supporters, barred by social media, and now facing a second impeachment over his instigation of a riot against Congress on January 6.His trip to Alamo, Texas, where he will tout claims of success in building a US-Mexican border wall, is his first live public appearance since he rallied thousands of followers on the National Mall to march on Congress.Although this is not the same Alamo as the famous fortress in another part of Texas, the trip marks something of a last stand for the Republican.Ever since the November 3 election, the real estate tycoon has been obsessively pushing a lie that he, not Democrat Joe Biden, was the real winner and last week, in a speech he described Tuesday as "totally appropriate," he called on the huge crowd to "show strength."Amped up on Trump's rhetoric, the mob burst into Congress, fighting with police, trashing offices and forcing frightened lawmakers to suspend briefly a ceremony legally formalizing Biden's victory.The crisis galvanized many of Trump's former boosters in the corporate and sporting world to turn their backs.In Congress, where the Republican party has been in thrall to the populist leader for four years, even ultra-loyal senior figures like Senator Lindsey Graham have finally told Trump that he must accept his election defeat.Trump, however, remains in denial.He has yet to congratulate Biden or urge his supporters to stand behind the incoming president after he is inaugurated on January 20 -- a gesture of political unity considered all but routine after US elections.And according to Axios, Trump and the top Republican in the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, had a stormy phone conversation Tuesday in which Trump claimed that left wing Antifa activists, not his supporters, attacked Congress."It's not Antifa," McCarthy reportedly responded. "I know. I was there."When Trump continued to push his conspiracy theory that he was the true election winner, McCarthy reportedly interrupted, telling him: "Stop it. It's over. The election is over."Impeachment 2.0 The House of Representatives will vote Tuesday on a longshot bid to get Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to invoke the US Constitution's 25th Amendment, which would declare Trump unfit to perform his duties and install Pence as acting president.This is unlikely to happen.Although Pence is reportedly furious about Trump's behavior last week, the two met at the White House on Monday for the first time since the Congress attack and had "a good conversation," according to a senior administration official.That signaled that whatever Pence and the dwindling number of White House officials feel, they are committed to keeping the presidency limping along until January 20.Still, with a string of cabinet officials quitting the government -- most recently the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf on Monday -- it's also clear that Trump's grip on power is tenuous.In an interview Tuesday on ABC News, Health Secretary Alex Azar did not dismiss outright the option of removing Trump, saying: "I'm not going to get into or discuss the 25th Amendment here."Democrats will follow up the 25th Amendment vote with impeachment proceedings in the House on Wednesday. The single charge of "incitement of insurrection" is all but sure to get majority support.The Republican-controlled Senate, however, is in recess until January 19 and its leadership says there is no way to rush through an impeachment trial before Biden takes over the following day.This means that Trump, who was acquitted in the Senate last year after his first impeachment, would not be forced out of office early.Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has reportedly floated the idea of using a rare parliamentary maneuver to force the chamber back into session under emergency circumstances, giving time for the start of an impeachment trial.But not even all Democrats are gunning for a trial, worried that this would overshadow Biden's first days in office.The new president will already face the challenges of an out-of-control Covid-19 pandemic, the stumbling vaccination program, a shaky economy, and now the aftermath of violent political opposition from parts of Trump's huge voter base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-calls-move-to-impeach-continuation-of-greatest-witch-hunt-in-history-of-politics-101610465497631.html
12-01-2021||World||Canada to ban import of goods from China that use forced labour||Canada has announced that it will prohibit import of goods made wholly or partly using forced labour, in the wake of reports of forced labour and human rights violations targeting the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang region of China. This was part of a package of seven measures announced by Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the country’s foreign ministry, in coordination with the United Kingdom and other international partners.A release from GAC said Canada was “advancing measures to address the risk of forced labour from any country from entering Canadian and global supply chains and to protect Canadian businesses from becoming unknowingly complicit.”The announcement came jointly from François-Philippe Champagne, minister of foreign affairs (minutes before he was transferred to the innovation, science and industry portfolio), and Mary Ng, minister of small business, export promotion, and international trade.The statement also asserted that Canada is “gravely concerned with evidence and reports of human rights violations” involving the Uighur ethnic minority in Xinjiang, “ including repressive surveillance, mass arbitrary detention, torture and mistreatment, forced labour and mass transfers of forced labourers from Xinjiang to provinces across China. These activities strongly run counter to China’s international human rights obligations.”The measures taken by the Canadian government also include a Xinjiang Integrity Declaration for Canadian companies, a business advisory on Xinjiang-related entities, enhanced advise to Canadian companies, export controls, increasing awareness for Responsible Business Conduct linked to Xinjiang; and a study on forced labour and supply chain risks.The statement quoted Champagne as saying that Canada was “deeply concerned regarding the mass arbitrary detention and mistreatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities by Chinese authorities. Nobody should face mistreatment on the basis of their religion or ethnicity. Together with the UK, we are taking action to ensure we are not complicit in the abuse of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.”Ng said, “Our government is committed to ensuring that Canadian businesses at home and abroad are not unknowingly involved in any supply chains involving forced labour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-ban-import-of-goods-from-china-that-use-forced-labour-101610465657308.html
12-01-2021||World||Trudeau reshuffles cabinet after Indian-origin minister quits||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday conducted an unexpected cabinet reshuffle following the sudden resignation of Indo-Canadian minister Navdeep Bains.In a video statement released on Tuesday, the 43-year-old minister of innovation, science and industry said he was retiring from politics to spend more time with his family. Bains was among the prominent Sikhs in Trudeau’s cabinet along with minister for national defence Harjit Sajjan.Bains has also decided against running in the next federal elections. Bains has been a cabinet minister since 2015 after he was elected from the riding (constituency) of Mississauga-Malton.Bains’s resignation precipitated a larger reshuffle in what was the first-ever virtual swearing-in ceremony for ministers in the history of Canada. Foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne was placed in charge of Bains’s portfolios as minister for innovation, science and industry while transport minister Marc Garneau assumed charge of foreign affairs. Omar Alghabra was promoted from parliamentary secretary to the cabinet and given charge of the transport department. Jim Carr was sworn in as a minister without portfolio and will be the government’s special representative for the Prairies.In his statement, Bains said, “It’s time for me to put my family first and I couldn’t be happier about it.” He said the last year had been hard on his two young daughters and it was time “to focus on the most important job I have in life — being a dad.”Bains’s exit could have a significant impact on the calculus for the next federal elections since he is credited with crafting the strategy for the Liberal Party in the 905 region, referring to the telephone area code for the seat-rich suburbs of Toronto like Brampton and Mississauga.Bains is a veteran within the Sikh community in Canadian electoral politics. He was also an MP between 2004 and 2011.This is the second reshuffle that Trudeau has undertaken since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted last spring. He gave charge of the finance portfolio to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland after the resignation of Bill Morneau last year.The reshuffle came just before a cabinet retreat already announced by the Prime Minister’s Office.Bains was famously among the four Sikh cabinet ministers appointed by Trudeau in 2015, along with Sajjan. Of the other two, Bardish Chagger remains as the minister for diversity, inclusion and youth, while the fourth, Amarjeet Sohi, was defeated in the 2019 federal polls. Now the cabinet is left with two Sikh ministers – Sajjan and Chagger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-reshuffles-cabinet-after-indian-origin-minister-quits-101610464877074.html
12-01-2021||World||Most hospitalised COVID-19 patients have at least one symptom 6 months after falling ill: Study||More than three quarters of Covid-19 patients hospitalised for treatment have at least one ongoing symptom six months after initially becoming unwell, according to a study published in The Lancet journal.The research looked at the long-term effects of the novel coronavirus infection in 1,733 patients first diagnosed in Wuhan, China between January and May followed to June and September.In the study, scientists, including those from Jin Yin-tan Hospital in China, interviewed the patients face-to-face using questionnaires to evaluate their symptoms and health-related quality of life.The discharged patients also underwent physical examinations, lab tests, and a six-minute walking test to gauge their endurance levels.Nearly 400 patients also underwent further tests, including an assessment of their lung function, and 94 patients whose blood antibody levels were recorded at the height of the infection received a follow-up test.According to the scientists, the most common symptom to persist was muscle weakness (63 per cent of cases), with patients also frequently experiencing sleep difficulties (26 per cent).They said anxiety or depression was reported among 23 per cent of patients.The study noted that hospitalised patients who were severely ill more often had impaired lung function and abnormalities detected in chest imaging -- which the scientists believe could indicate organ damage six months after symptom onset.Since very few follow-up studies have been conducted in recovered patients so far, the scientists said little is known about the long-term health effects of Covid-19.Those that have been conducted looked only at a small number of cases over a short follow-up period, they added."Our analysis indicates that most patients continue to live with at least some of the effects of the virus after leaving hospital, and highlights a need for post-discharge care, particularly for those who experience severe infections," said study co-author Bin Cao, from National Center for Respiratory Medicine, China-Japan Friendship Hospital in China."Our work also underscores the importance of conducting longer follow-up studies in larger populations in order to understand the full spectrum of effects that Covid-19 can have on people," Cao said.The scientists found that 76 per cent of patients reported at least one ongoing symptom during the follow up tests.Patients with more severe illness commonly had reduced lung function, with 56 per cent of those who required ventilation support experiencing reduced flow of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream.For patients who required supplemental oxygen therapy and those who did not require oxygen therapy, the researchers said the figures were 29 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively.According to the study, patients with more severe disease performed worse in the six-minute walking test.The scientists said 13 per cent of patients whose kidney function was normal while in hospital had reduced kidney function in follow-up.However, due to the way the data was analysed, the researchers said it was not possible to determine if symptoms reported during follow-up were persistent following the infection, worsened after recovery, or occurred post-discharge.The scientists believe further work is needed to compare differences in outcomes between inpatients and outpatients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-have-at-least-one-symptom-6-months-after-falling-ill-study-101610462898165.html

The Black Vault, privately run archive of declassified documents, has published a downloadable archive of a collection of CIA related UFO records.John Greenewald Jr., who runs The Black Vault, said in a blog post that the CIA made a CD-ROM collection of UFO documents over a period of time. In mid-2020, Greenewald purchased this CD-ROM to ensure the Black Vault has as complete a record of CIA documents on “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP), a term preferred by the US government, as possible available.“The Black Vault spent years fighting for them, and many were released in the late 1990s. However, over time, the CIA made a CD-ROM collection of UFO documents, which encompassed the original records, along with the ones that took years to fight for,” he stated.Also Read | US intelligence agencies have less than 6 months to reveal details on UFOsThe Black Vault has, so far, filed around 10,000 Freedom Of Information Acts (FOIA) requests to amass approximately 2.2 million pages in its entire archive. Greenewald told Motherboard, via email, that he had fought for years to get additional UFO records released from the CIA and it was like “pulling teeth”. He reportedly said that he had to scan a “couple thousand pages” one at a time. All the files are available online at The Black Vault's website.The CIA’s CD-ROM contents on UFOs are available to download in two formats - original and searchable .pdf conversions. The original form of CD-ROM content is the entire collection, zipped up, with zero processing. The searchable .pdf conversions also contain all files, however, they have been converted to searchable .pdf documents.In April 2020, the department of defense released three declassified videos that showed US Navy pilots encountering what appeared to be UFOs. Following the declassification of videos, the US Navy released seven incident reports on the series of encounters between Navy pilots and UAP.The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, part of a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government spending bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last month, has directed the intelligence agencies to submit a report on UAP within 180 days. According to the Senate intelligence committee's directive, the report must contain detailed analyses of UFO data as well as intel inputs from the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-documents-on-ufos-unexpectedly-made-available-to-download-101610461504381.html

Two cabinet secretaries resigned, citing the violence at the Capitol. But Pompeo and other top national security officials intend to remain in their jobs for the final week of Trump’s term.“Look, what happened Wednesday was terrible. And I have said repeatedly that those folks who engaged in this activity need to be identified, prosecuted and they are criminals and ought to be treated as such,” Pompeo said.Pompeo did not criticize Trump for his role in encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-says-donald-trump-s-legacy-stronger-than-riots-101610460434017.html
12-01-2021||World||Uganda bans social media ahead of presidential election||Uganda banned social media and messaging apps on Tuesday, two days ahead of a presidential election pitting Yoweri Museveni, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, against opposition frontrunner Bobi Wine, a popular singer.Users complained on Tuesday that they were unable to access Facebook and WhatsApp, social media platforms being widely used for campaigning by all sides ahead of Thursday's election in the East African country.In a letter seen by Reuters to internet service providers dated Jan. 12, Uganda's communications regulator ordered them to block all social media platforms and messaging apps until further notice.Campaigning ahead of the vote has been marred by brutal crackdowns on opposition rallies, which the authorities say break Covid-19 curbs on large gatherings. Rights groups say the restrictions are a pretext for muzzling the opposition.At 38, Wine is half the age of President Yoweri Museveni and has attracted a large following among young people in a nation where 80% of the population are under 30, rattling the ruling National Resistance Movement party.Wine is considered the frontrunner among 10 candidates challenging Museveni, the former guerrilla leader who seized power in 1986 and brought stability to a country after the murderous reigns of dictators Milton Obote and Idi Amin.While security forces have intimidated the opposition at previous elections, the run up to this year's vote has been especially violent. In November, 54 people were killed as soldiers and police quelled protests after Wine was detained.On Tuesday, Wine said soldiers raided his home in Kampala and arrested his guards while he was giving an interview to a Kenyan radio station. He also said a team member who works mainly as a mechanic was shot dead by the military overnight.Reuters was not immediately able to verify the claims and a military spokesmen did not respond to a call seeking comment.Patrick Onyango, police spokesman for the capital Kampala, denied Wine's home had been raided or that anyone was arrested, saying: "We were just rearranging our security posture in the area near his home, specifically removing some checkpoints."'UNACCEPTABLE BREACHES'A source in Uganda's telecom sector said the government had made clear to executives at telecoms companies that the social media ban was in retaliation for Facebook blocking some pro-government accounts.Neither Ibrahim Bbossa, Uganda Communications Commission spokesman nor government spokesman Ofwono Opondo answered calls requesting comment. An aide to Minister of Information Judith Nabakooba said she was unable to comment at the moment.The U.S. social media giant said on Monday it had taken down a network in Uganda linked to the country's ministry of information for using fake and duplicate accounts to post ahead of this week's election.A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had no comment on reports users were facing difficulties accessing the platform."Any efforts to block online access to journalists or members of the public are unacceptable breaches of the right to information," the International Press Institute, a global media watchdog, said in a statement.Wine has been using Facebook to relay live coverage of his campaigns and news conferences after he said many media outlets had declined to host him. Most radio and TV stations are owned by government allies and Uganda's leading daily is state-run.Museveni, 76, has won every election since the first under his presidency in 1996, though they have been tarnished by intimidation of the opposition and accusations of vote rigging.Uganda is a Western ally, a prospective oil producer and is considered a stabilising force in a region where war has plagued some neighbours. It also contributes the biggest contingent of an African Union force fighting Islamist insurgents in Somalia.Museveni said on Twitter that he would address the nation at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday.The European Union is not deploying election observers as advice from previous observers about how to make the polls fair went unheeded, the bloc's ambassador to Uganda has said. The African Union will deploy observers.At a news conference on Tuesday, Wine and two other opposition candidates - Patrick Amuriat and Mugisha Muntu - urged Ugandans to turn out and "protect their vote" by staying at polling stations to observe counting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uganda-bans-social-media-ahead-of-presidential-election-101610459677383.html
12-01-2021||World||Twitter blocks 70,000 QAnon accounts after US Capitol riot||LONDON (AP) — Twitter says it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts associated with the far right QAnon conspiracy theory following last week's U.S. Capitol riot. The social media company said Tuesday that given the events last week in Washington, D.C., where a mob of pro-Trump loyalists tried to violently storm the Capitol building, it was taking action against online behavior “that has the potential to lead to offline harm."In many cases, a single individual operated numerous accounts, driving up the total number of affected accounts, the company said in a blog post. “These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service,” the company said. Twitter's sweeping purge of QAnon accounts, which began Friday, is part of a wider crackdown that also includes its decision to ban President Donald Trump from the service over worries about further incitement to violence. The suspensions mean some Twitter users will lose followers, in some cases by the thousands, the company said. The QAnon conspiracy theory is centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against “deep state” enemies and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals. Twitter has previously tried to crack down on QAnon, removing more than 7,000 accounts in July. Twitter said it's also stepping up enforcement measures and starting Tuesday it will limit the spread of posts that violate its civic integrity policy by preventing anyone from replying to, liking or retweeting them. The policy prohibits attempts to manipulate elections and spread misleading info about their results, with repeated violations resulting in permanent suspension.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-blocks-70-000-qanon-accounts-after-us-capitol-riot-101610458229981.html

I strongly doubt it, and I believe we need a more offensive and aggressive strategy," European Commissioner Thierry Breton, whose brief include the space sector, told a conference."I will therefore gather in the next months all the actors to initiate a European Launcher alliance to be able to jointly define...a common roadmap for the next generation of launchers and technologies relevant to ensure an autonomous access to space," Breton said.Breton said the alliance would be made up of industry, EU governments, EU lawmakers and the European Space Agency, among others.The recent emergence of US competitor SpaceX and its reusable rockets as well as China's rapid advances, including the first ever landing on the far side of the Moon, is giving new urgency to Europe's ambitions.After investing 12 billion euros in space activities between 2014 to 2020, the bloc aims to spend almost 15 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period, although the plans still need final approval by EU governments and the European Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-space-alliance-to-defend-against-us-and-chinese-ambitions-101610456077621.html

That's according to a Trump administration official familiar with the decision, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an announcement.States determine who should get the vaccine based on CDC guidelines.The Trump administration also is pushing to expand the number of places where people can be vaccinated by adding community health centers and additional drug stores.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to give a speech Thursday outlining his plan to speed vaccines to more people in the first part of his administration. His transition team has vowed to release as many vaccine doses as possible, rather than continuing the Trump administration policy of holding back millions of doses to ensure there would be enough supply to allow those getting the first shot to get a second one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asking-states-to-speed-covid-vaccine-not-hold-back-second-dose-101610455877345.html

It would depend how it’s done as with all these things. Anything that brings greater clarity for officers and the public in general will be a good thing,” she said.Writing in ‘The Times’ newspaper on Tuesday, she appealed to the public to follow the strict stay-at-home guidelines as the UK faces a “new and urgent phase in our struggle against this terrible virus”.“It is preposterous to me that anyone could be unaware of our duty to do all we can to stop the spread of the virus. We have been clear that those who breach Covid-19 legislation are increasingly likely to face fines,” she writes.“We will still be engaging, explaining and encouraging but those who break the rules or refuse to comply where they should without good reason will find officers moving much more quickly to enforcement action,” she said.The Policing Minister, Kit Malthouse, also echoed her views and urged people to follow the government guidance and leave their homes only for the limited purposes of essential needs or one form of outdoor exercise within their local areas."Now local is, obviously, open to interpretation, but people broadly know what local means. If you can get there under your own steam and you are not interacting with somebody... then that seems perfectly reasonable to me," he said.The issue of travelling for exercise was highlighted at the weekend after police in Derbyshire fined two women 200 pounds after they drove five miles from home to take a walk – a penalty that was later dropped after widespread social media coverage over whether the two women had really broken the law.Each devolved region of the United Kingdom sets its own precise levels of lockdown rules and under the government advice for England, people can leave home to exercise as long as it is “limited to once per day, and you should not travel outside your local area."It adds: "Stay local means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live."In Scotland, the advice is that exercise can be taken if it "starts and finishes at the same place, which can be up to five miles from the boundary of your local authority area".In Wales, exercise must start from and finish at home and there no limits on distance travelled, although the advice is that "the nearer you stay to your home, the better".And, people in Northern Ireland are advised not to go more than 10 miles from home when exercising.The debate around tougher action against lockdown breaches, which are punishable by fines ranging between 200 pounds and 10,000 pounds, has been intensifying as a further 529 people died from coronavirus on Monday, taking the country’s death toll to 81,960.According to official data, there are more than 32,200 people in hospital in the UK with coronavirus as health experts warned that the country was currently in the worst phase of the pandemic.It comes as the government tabled a major vaccination programme to immunise tens of millions of people by March-April at over 2,700 vaccination sites across the UK.The National Health Service (NHS) says while over 2 million people have already received the first of two jabs, it is also mobilising a workforce of over 80,000 health professionals to help in the delivery of the programme across the different vaccination sites where the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs will be administered to the most vulnerable categories.The government has committed to offer the first vaccine dose to all those in the top priority groups recommended by the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) by February 15.With these groups accounting for 88 per cent of Covid-19 fatalities, the move is aimed at preventing thousands of deaths once their immunity develops within 14 days of the first jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-s-7-mile-bike-ride-defended-as-action-on-lockdown-breaches-toughens-101610456619670.html

It is not an arrest warrant and does not require authorities to arrest a wanted suspect.Lebanon’s state prosecutor, Ghassan Khoury, had asked Interpol to issue the notices, NNA said. The agency did not give the names of the three but local media posted the notices identifying them as the vessel's former captain Boris Prokoshev and Igor Grechushkin, a Russian businessman residing in Cyprus who had bought the cargo ship in 2012. The Portuguese man was identified as Jorge Manuel Mirra Neto Moreira.The ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive material used in fertilizers, was not even supposed to be in Lebanon. When the Rhosus set sail from the Georgian Black Sea port of Batumi, it was bound for the Mozambican port of Beira.Prokoshev, the former captain, told The Associated Press days after the blast that he joined the ship in Turkey in 2013, after the previous crew quit over unpaid wages. Grechushkin, who resides in Cyprus, was paid $1 million to transport the dangerous cargo from Georgia to Mozambique, the former captain said.Nearly 30 people, most of them port and customs officials, have been arrested since the blast. Last month, the prosecutor investigating the blast, Fadi Sawwan, filed charges against Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers, accusing them of negligence leading to the deaths of those who perished in the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/interpol-issues-notices-over-beirut-s-massive-port-blast-101610456089099.html

Separately, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, also voted to stay the execution, pushing any new execution date into Joe Biden's administration unless the Supreme Court intervenes.Montgomery, who was due to be killed by lethal injection on Jan. 12, was convicted in 2007 in Missouri for kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, then eight months pregnant. Montgomery then cut Stinnett's fetus from the womb. The child survived.US judge James Patrick Hanlon granted a stay of execution to allow the court to conduct a hearing to determine whether Montgomery is competent to be executed on mental health grounds, according to a court filing made in the US district court of Southern District of Indiana.Montgomery's lawyer, Kelley Henry, welcomed the judge's ruling and said the court was right to put a stop to her execution."Mrs Montgomery is mentally deteriorating and we are seeking an opportunity to prove her incompetence," Henry said in a statement.Montgomery's lawyers have asked for US President Donald Trump's clemency, saying she committed her crime after a lifetime of being abused and raped. In a nearly 7,000-page clemency petition filed last week, they asked Trump to commute Montgomery's sentence to life in prison.The lawyers have said Montgomery admits her guilt but deserves clemency because she has long suffered severe mental illness, exacerbated by being gang raped by her stepfather and his friends during an abusive childhood.Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before Trump ordered them to resume last year.In 2020, the US government executed 10 people. It was the first time the federal government conducted more executions than all US states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-blocks-execution-of-only-woman-on-federal-death-row-101610455015103.html
12-01-2021||World||Turkey, Greece to break five-year negotiations impasse||Turkey and Greece will sit down to try to tackle differences over maritime boundaries and offshore energy resources for the first time since 2016.Diplomats from the two countries will meet in Istanbul on Jan. 25 to begin “exploratory talks,” the Turkish and Greek foreign ministries said late Monday. Greek officials have ruled out expanding the scope of the negotiations to other long-running disputes with Turkey.The announcement comes just weeks after the European Union pledged to expand the number of Turkish officials sanctioned over the country’s energy exploration in the disputed waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Cyprus, Greece and France this week proposed a list of potential new targets.“I believe exploratory talks with Greece will be harbinger of a new era,” in relations, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told ambassadors from European Union member countries in Ankara on Tuesday. At the same time, Erdogan urged Greece “to avoid fueling tensions” in the eastern Mediterranean.Ankara and Athens are locked in a showdown over conflicting interpretations of maritime borders. Competing claims to sovereignty over waters rich in hydrocarbon reserves led to a naval standoff between Greece and Turkey in 2020.Another thorn in the relationship is Turkey’s continued control of northern Cyprus, which it seized following a coup attempt in which a military junta in Athens sought to unite the island with Greece.Cyprus and Greece say Turkey’s maritime claims infringe on their sovereignty and have repeatedly demanded that the EU impose sweeping economic sanctions. Such demands have so far failed to win the required unanimous backing of EU member states, many of which fear an escalation that would break the bloc’s ties with Ankara.Erdogan has in recent months toned down his mostly confrontational rhetoric toward the 27-nation bloc, saying his country wants a new chapter in its relations with the EU. His government also ordered an energy exploration ship to limit its work to an area far from Greek islands through June 15, after the vessel’s operations angered Greece.On Tuesday, Erdogan urged the EU to honor its promises to Turkey, including updating their customs union and waiving visa requirements for Turkish citizens. He also called on the bloc to update a 2016 deal by which Turkey stemmed the flow of migrants toward Europe in exchange for financial assistance.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, addressing EU ambassadors earlier on Tuesday, said he and Greek Foreign Minister Nikolaos Dendias have agreed to meet following the exploratory talks in Istanbul.The weeks leading up to the negotiations will see some heightened tensions. A senior diplomat in Brussels said Cyprus, Greece and France this week jointly presented a list of other Turkish officials they’d like to see sanctioned over their country’s drilling operations off the coast of Cyprus.The blacklist so far includes only two people and has no material consequences for Turkey’s economy. EU officials will start debating the proposed additional listings next week, though it’s unclear whether the latest push will fare any better than previous attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-greece-to-break-five-year-negotiations-impasse-101610453614477.html

How the letters were written was not immediately clear. It was also not clear if the act was meant to bring attention to President Donald Trump, a Florida resident.Here is the video of the poor manatee that had "TRUMP" carved into its body. Minding it's own business and some monster(s) came along and did this.

12-01-2021||World||Indonesia recovers first black box from crashed plane||A black box from the crashed Indonesian passenger jet has been recovered, officials said Tuesday, a discovery that could offer critical clues to explaining why the plane with 62 people aboard slammed into the sea.Divers just off the coast of the capital Jakarta hauled the jet's flight data recorder to the surface, as the hunt continues for its cockpit voice recorder.Indonesian transport minister Budi Karya Sumadi told a live television briefing that the box had been found -- after the Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) in less than a minute before slamming into the Java Sea Saturday.An AFP reporter on a navy ship said investigators started picking up strong signals from an area where they were searching, with divers able to retrieve the box in about an hour from the wreckage-littered seabed.So far authorities have been unable to explain why the 26-year-old plane crashed just four minutes after takeoff.Black box data -- which record information about the speed, altitude and direction of the plane as well as flight crew conversations -- helps explain nearly 90 percent of all crashes, according to aviation experts.Sumadi added officials believe the cockpit voice recorder is nearby that of flight data recorder."We strongly believe it'll be found soon," he said.Some 3,600 personnel are taking part in the recovery effort, assisted by dozens of boats and helicopters flying over small islands off the capital's coast.The agency deployed a remotely operated vehicle to assist the divers.- 'Hoping for a miracle' -Scores of body bags filled with human remains were being taken to a police morgue where forensic investigators hope to identify victims by matching fingerprints or DNA with distraught relatives -- some held out hope of survivors."We haven't accepted it yet," Inda Gunawan said of his brother Didik Gunardi who was on the doomed Saturday flight."Our family is still hoping for a miracle that he is still alive."Authorities have identified flight attendant Okky Bisma, 29, as the first confirmed victim after matching fingerprints from a retrieved hand to those in a government identity database."Rest in peace up there darling and wait for me... in heaven," Okky Bisma's wife Aldha Refa wrote on Instagram.There were 10 children among the passengers on the half-full plane, which had experienced pilots at the controls as it left Jakarta bound for Pontianak city on Borneo island on a 90-minute flight.A transport safety agency investigator has said the crew did not declare an emergency or report technical problems with the plane before its dive, and that the 737 was likely intact when it hit the water.Search-and-rescue agency chief Soerjanto Tjahjono echoed that view earlier Tuesday, pointing to the relatively small area where debris was scattered in about 23 metres (75 feet) of water."The size is consistent with the assumption that the plane didn't explode before hitting the water," he added."The damage seen on the retrieved fan blade also shows that the engine was still working" at the time of the crash.The crash probe was likely to take months, but a preliminary report was expected in 30 days.Aviation analysts said flight-tracking data showed the plane sharply deviated from its intended course before it went into a steep dive.- Plagued by safety concerns -Sriwijaya Air, which flies to destinations in Indonesia and across Southeast Asia, has had safety incidents including runway overruns.But it has not had a fatal crash since starting operations in 2003.Its CEO has said the jet, which was previously flown by US-based Continental Airlines and United Airlines, was in fit condition.Indonesia's fast-growing aviation sector has long been plagued by safety concerns, and its airlines were once banned from US and European airspace.In October 2018, 189 people were killed when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX jet crashed near Jakarta.That accident -- and another in Ethiopia -- led to the grounding of the 737 MAX worldwide.The 737 that went down Saturday was first produced decades ago and was not a MAX variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-recovers-first-black-box-from-crashed-plane-101610451967872.html
12-01-2021||World||Trudeau to shuffle cabinet after Indo-Canadian minister quits||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has scheduled an unexpected cabinet reshuffle following the sudden resignation of Indo-Canadian minister Navdeep Bains.No reason has been attributed for the departure of the 43-year-old minister of innovation, science and industry. Bains is among the prominent Sikhs in Trudeau’s cabinet along with minister for national defence Harjit Sajjan.While no official announcement has been made in this regard, the outlet CBC News reported that Bains has also decided against running in the next federal elections. He has been a cabinet minister since 2015 after being elected from the riding (constituency) of Mississauga-Malton.Multiple Canadian media reports also said this will precipitate a larger reshuffle, with foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne being placed in charge of Bains’ portfolios while transport minister Marc Garneau will take over foreign affairs. Omar Alghabra, currently a parliamentary secretary, is expected to be promoted to the cabinet and given charge of the transport department. The change is expected to be formalised on Tuesday morning.Bains’ exit could have a significant impact on the calculus for the next federal elections since he is credited with crafting the strategy for the Liberal Party in the 905 region, referring to the telephone area code for the seat-rich suburbs of Toronto, like Brampton and Mississauga. Bains is a veteran within the Sikh community in Canadian electoral politics. He was also an MP between 2004 and 2011.This is the second reshuffle that Trudeau has undertaken since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted last spring. He gave charge of the finance portfolio to deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland after the resignation of Bill Morneau last year.The reshuffle is expected to be conducted virtually and comes just before a Cabinet retreat already announced by the Prime Minister’s Office.Bains was famously among the four Sikh cabinet ministers appointed by Trudeau in 2015, along with Sajjan. Of the other two, Bardish Chagger remains as the minister for diversity, inclusion and youth, while the fourth, Amarjeet Sohi was defeated in the 2019 federal polls. When Bains is replaced, the cabinet will be left with two Sikh ministers – Sajjan and Chagger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-to-shuffle-cabinet-after-indo-canadian-minister-quits-101610448467437.html

The photo was seen as a sign of friendship and close ties between Israel and the Trump-led US administration.The removal came after the relations between the two leaders have deteriorated after Netanyahu officially congratulated US President-elect Joe Biden on the latter's victory in the November presidential election.The new picture on Netanyahu's Twitter profile says "Citizens of Israel, we are returning to life." No comment on the cover photo's replacement was given on his account.Meanwhile, Trump has been blocked on all major social platforms following the January 6 unrest in the US Capitol, when a group of his supporters stormed the building, clashing with police, damaging property, seizing the inauguration stage and occupying the rotunda.The violent rally, which killed five people, took place after Trump urged his supporters to protest what he claims is a stolen election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-removes-joint-photo-with-donald-trump-from-his-twitter-banner-101610447373612.html

He was placed in pre-trial detention.The American FBI, DEA narcotics law enforcement division and IRS tax authority took part in the probe along with police from Australia, Britain, Denmark, Switzerland, Ukraine and Moldova, with Europol playing a "coordinating role".The secret "darknet" network includes websites that can be accessed only with specific software or authorisations, ensuring anonymity for users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-police-take-down-world-s-largest-darknet-marketplace-101610446715064.html

The county reported the 1st #Covid19 case on Jan 2 during this round of flare-ups in Hebei," tweeted Global Times.Chinese health experts warned that the coronavirus spreading in China appears to be more infectious and transmissible, and asymptomatic infections, especially silent infections in villages, have become a new and big challenge for China, judging from the ongoing Shijiazhuang outbreak, reported Global Times.A weak and slow Covid-19 response at the grassroots level, which includes a failed surveillance and reporting system in villages, has spawned the recent domestic cluster infections, said experts.The Chinese mainland reported 103 confirmed cases on Monday, mostly from Hebei, the first time for a daily triple-digit rise in the number of confirmed cases in more than five months. The last time the Chinese mainland reported such a rise was at the end of July, when Urumqi, Xinjiang was hit by daily new cases of over 100, reported Global Times.Hebei, currently the hardest-hit Chinese province with the most local Covid-19 patients this winter, reported 40 new confirmed cases on Tuesday. Several infected clusters were recently found in the region, bringing risks of cross-regional spread of the coronavirus.Moreover, the silent spread of the virus amply shows that asymptomatic patients have increasingly become a great challenge for China's epidemic prevention and control efforts, said Zhang Yuexin, a member of the anti-epidemic group in Xinjiang.The epidemic will affect the Hebei region during the Spring Festival holiday, which falls in February, and will see tightened restrictions on the movement of local people in these regions, reported Global Times||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20k-people-in-china-s-shijiazhuang-quarantined-due-to-fresh-covid-19-outbreak-101610445501592.html

12-01-2021||World||Bodies pile up at crematorium in Germany's virus hot spot||The caskets are stacked three high in the Meissen crematorium's somber memorial hall, piled up in empty offices and stored in hallways. Many are sealed with plastic wrapping, others are labeled “infection risk,” “urgent” or simply “COVID.”A surge of coronavirus deaths in this corner of eastern Germany has boosted business for crematorium manager Joerg Schaldach and his staff, but nobody is celebrating.“The situation is a little bit tense for us at the moment,” Schaldach said as another undertaker's van pulled up outside.The crematorium would typically have 70 to 100 caskets on site at this time of year, when the flu season takes its toll on the elderly.“It’s normal for more people to die in winter than in summer," said Schaldach. "That’s always been the case.”Now he has 300 bodies waiting to be cremated and each day dozens more are delivered to the modernist building on a hill overlooking Meissen, an ancient town better known for its delicate porcelain and impressive Gothic castle.On Monday, Meissen county once again took the unwanted lead in Germany's Covid-19 tables, with an infection rate three times the national average. The state of Saxony, where Meissen is located, includes six of the 10 worst-hit counties in Germany.Schaldach says the crematorium is doing its best to keep up with demand, firing up the twin furnaces every 45 minutes and managing 60 cremations a day.“The ashes still end up in the right urn,” he said.But whereas staff would normally try to ensure the deceased look good for relatives to bid their final farewells, infection rules now mean the caskets of Covid victims have to remain shut throughout, making the entire process even harder for those involved.“It’s our business, we’ve seen death many, many times," said Schaldach. "The problem we see is that the grieving relatives need our help. And at the moment, there’s a greater need for words of consolation because they’ve given their deceased loved one to the ambulance and then they never see them again.”Some have linked Saxony's high infection rate to wider anti-government sentiment in a state where over a quarter voted for the far-right Alternative for Germany party at the last national election. Its lawmakers have objected to the need to wear masks, limits on people gathering and the closure of stores. A few have even denied the existence of a pandemic outright.Other commentators have noted the state's large number of elderly and its reliance on nursing home workers from the neighboring Czech Republic, where Covid-19 infections are even higher.Officials in Meissen, including the head of the county administration, the local doctors association and the lawmaker representing the region in parliament, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, all declined to be interviewed about the situation.Saxony’s governor, Michael Kretschmer, acknowledged in a recent interview with daily Freie Presse that he had underestimated the impact of the pandemic in his state and paid too much attention to those calling for businesses and schools to remain open.A video showing Kretschmer talking to anti-lockdown protesters outside his home Sunday ends with him walking away after one person dons a mask made to look like the German Imperial War Flag, a symbol favored by far-right extremists.Schaldach, the crematorium manager, says most people in Saxony accept the rules. But he, too, has read comments on social media branding reports about bodies piling up at his crematorium as fake news.“Those who believe in conspiracy theories can’t be helped. We don’t want to debate with them," he told The Associated Press. "They have their beliefs and we have our knowledge.”Down in Meissen, the streets are empty, devoid of the usual tourists or even the bustle of locals.Franziska Schlieter runs a gourmet food store in the historic city center that's among the few allowed to stay open amid the lockdown. Her store, which has been run by five generations of her family, is being sustained by a trickle of regulars buying lottery cards and gift baskets.“In the Bible, God sent people plagues when they didn’t behave,” said Schlieter, who feels easing the lockdown over Christmas was a mistake. “Sometimes I have to think of that.”On the cobblestone square, Matthias Huth tends a lone food truck outside his shuttered restaurant. He defends those who have questioned the government’s Covid-19 restrictions, but says skepticism shouldn’t justify denial.“Conversations are starting to change,” Huth said as he served up a dish of chopped blood sausage, sauerkraut and mash known locally as ‘Dead Grandma.’ “Everyone wants it to be over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bodies-pile-up-at-crematorium-in-germany-s-virus-hot-spot-101610442950802.html
12-01-2021||World||Pompeo to use declassified intelligence to accuse Iran of al Qaeda links: Report||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to use newly declassified US intelligence on Tuesday to publicly accuse Iran of ties to al Qaeda, two people familiar with the matter said, as part of his last-minute offensive against Tehran before handing over to the incoming Biden administration.With just eight days left in office for President Donald Trump, Pompeo is expected to offer details on allegations that Iran has given safe haven to al Qaeda leaders and support for the group, the sources said, despite some skepticism within the intelligence community and Congress.It was not immediately clear how much Pompeo intends to reveal in his speech to the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday. He could cite declassified information on the killing of al Qaeda's suspected second-in-command in Tehran in August, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.The New York Times reported in November that Abu Muhammad al-Masri, accused of helping to mastermind the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa, was gunned down by Israeli operatives in Iran. Iran denied the report, saying there were no al Qaeda "terrorists" on its soil.Iran has been a target throughout the Trump administration and Pompeo has sought to further ratchet up pressure on Iran in recent weeks with more sanctions and heated rhetoric.Advisers to President-elect Joe Biden believe the Trump administration is trying to make it harder for him to re-engage with Iran and seek to rejoin an international deal on Iran's nuclear program.More sanctionsPompeo has accused Iran of links to al Qaeda in the past but has not provided concrete evidence."There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside al Qaeda," then CIA director Pompeo said in October 2017.Earlier accusations by the George W. Bush administration of Iranian links to al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States have been discredited. But reports have surfaced over the years of al Qaeda operatives hiding out in Iran.A former senior US intelligence official with direct knowledge of the issue said the Iranians were never friendly with al Qaeda before or after the Sept. 11 attacks and any claims of current cooperation should be viewed warily.Shi'ite Iran and al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim militant organization, have long been sectarian foes.Relations between Tehran and Washington have deteriorated since 2018 when Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, which imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions.Since the beginning of his administration, Trump has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials, politicians and companies in an effort to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further limits its nuclear work.And more sanctions are expected before Trump leaves office, US officials say.While sanctions have sharply lowered Tehran's oil exports and increased the economic hardship of ordinary Iranians, it has failed to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.Biden has said the United States will rejoin the nuclear deal "if Iran resumes strict compliance."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-to-use-declassified-intelligence-to-accuse-iran-of-al-qaeda-links-report-101610442445862.html

While there, Pompeo plans to meet with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and Belgium's foreign minister. He will then return to Washington, capping foreign travel for his two-and-a-half years as President Donald Trump's secretary of state.Pompeo began the Trump administration as the head of the CIA but took the secretary of state job when the president fired Rex Tillerson in early 2018. Most recent secretaries of state have served for a full four-year presidential term. Pompeo and Tillerson are shortest-termed Senate-confirmed secretaries of state in decades.“Secretary Pompeo will highlight the enduring importance of the Transatlantic partnership, champion NATO's ongoing success in safeguarding the Transatlantic community and adapting to new security challenges, and reaffirm the strength of the bilateral relationship between the United States and Belgium,” the department said in a statement.Pompeo has had mixed results in his previous visits to Brussels, which is the home of NATO headquarters and the European Union — two institutions Trump has disparaged during his presidency.A former military officer and West Point graduate who served in West Germany in the closing days of the Cold War, Pompeo has extolled the virtues of NATO but also made clear Trump's demands that allies step up their defense spending. He has, however, received chilly receptions at EU headquarters, where Trump's decisions to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and numerous multilateral agencies and agreements have raised concerns.Pompeo is not expected to visit the EU headquarters during his brief stay in Brussels and instead will meet only with his Belgian counterpart, Sophie Wilmes. He will return to Washington on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-off-to-europe-on-final-trip-as-secretary-of-state-101610442722861.html

But Trump has awarded the medal to political allies, particularly in his final weeks in office.The White House in a statement said that in 2016, Jordan worked with then-Representative Mike Pompeo to investigate and publish a report on the deadly attack against our embassy in Benghazi, Libya."Moreover, he also worked to unmask the Russia hoax and take on Deep State corruption -- confronting senior Justice Department officials for obstructing Congress and exposing the fraudulent origins of the Russia collusion lie," it read."His work helped to unearth malfeasance at the highest levels of the United States Government.

The unrest took place after Trump urged his supporters to protest what he claims is a stolen election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-awards-medal-of-freedom-to-ally-jim-jordan-at-closed-door-ceremony-101610440623873.html

12-01-2021||World||20 million under Covid lockdown in China, infection spreads among farmers||China on Tuesday locked down a city of 4.9 million residents near Beijing as authorities continued to battle a surge in Covid-19 infections across the country, many of them linked to cases from the northern province of Hebei bordering the capital.The lockdown of Langfang city was announced on Tuesday, with authorities saying residents have been put under home quarantine for a week and will be subject to mass nucleic acid testing.Chinese experts fear the new wave of infection could be spreading undetected in villages with nearly 70% of the new 305 new Covid-19 infections in Hebei being farmers, a state media report said on Tuesday.Guan and Sanhe, two counties under Langfang’s jurisdiction that border Beijing, had already announced home quarantine measures.The new measures mean that three cities in Hebei including capital Shijiazhaung – with 11 million residents - and Xingtai with more than 7 mn population have now been locked down with no residents allowed to leave unless necessary.Stringent closure and control measures have been put in place in the three cities, state media reports said as highways from the cities have been shut down.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Tuesday reported 55 new Covid-19 cases for Monday, down from 103 a day earlier.The Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, accounted for 40 of the 42 locally transmitted infections, with the capital and northeastern Heilongjiang province reporting one local case each, the NHC said.Several provinces and cities across China have put restrictions on people travelling from Hebei and scrambling to trace those who had come into close contact with Covid-19 patients from the province.In Beijing, authorities traced as many as 95 people who came into close contact with a confirmed patient reported in Gu’an county of Hebei on Monday, whose workplace was found to be in the capital’s downtown Xicheng district.Chinese health experts have warned that silent infections in villages have become a new and big challenge for China, judging from the ongoing Shijiazhuang outbreak and previous outbreak in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), a report in the tabloid, Global Times said Tuesday.A weak and slow Covid-19 response at the grassroots level, which includes a failed surveillance and reporting system in villages, has spawned the recent domestic cluster infections, it quoted experts as saying.Experts also warned of the emergence of super spreaders of the disease, saying they need to be identified and managed in time before infecting countless others.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in mainland China stood at 87591 while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/20-million-under-covid-lockdown-in-china-infection-spreads-among-farmers-101610441506502.html
12-01-2021||World||Thailand aims to inoculate at least half the population in 2021||Thailand is set to begin inoculating its citizens against Covid-19 before the end of February, with the goal of vaccinating at least 33 million people, half the nation’s population, by the end of 2021.The Southeast Asian nation, battling its biggest wave of coronavirus infections since the pandemic began, will start with doses from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. once the Thai Food and Drug Administration approves it, according to the Health Ministry. By April, it plans to complete distribution of two million Sinovac shots to healthcare and front-line workers, people with underlying conditions and those over the age 60.Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha’s government has approved purchase of a total of 63 million doses and the National Vaccine Institute is in talks with several manufacturers for additional supplies for delivery as early as this quarter. The government expects the first batch of AstraZeneca Plc vaccines -- to be approved by the regulator this month -- will be ready for distribution in May.Thailand has closed schools and temporarily shut some businesses to contain a resurgence that’s seen Covid-19 cases more than double to 10,834 in less than a month. The government is betting on wider availability of vaccine to stamp out the virus and pave for the reopening of its tourism industry, a lifeline for the economy.“Once 50% of the population has been vaccinated, we’ll be able to control the infections and there won’t be any large outbreaks in the country,” Nakorn Premsri, director of the vaccine institute, said in an interview. “Once we’ve reached 70%, we can be certain that there will be no outbreaks here. We may have one or two isolated cases, but the country can move forward.”Thailand may reach the herd immunity threshold only in 2022, given its slow vaccine rollout compared to higher-income countries with a similar population, like the UK. The delay stemmed from the government’s inability to order vaccines in advance during the research when there’s no guarantee of viable shots at the end of the trials, Nakorn said.The agreement with AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, currently the nation’s biggest vaccine supplier, will also allow local production through technology transfer, Nakorn said.Thailand will administer vaccines from more than 10,000 locations across the country free of charge for citizens. It will also allow private firms to import and sell those vaccines approved by the country’s regulator to people who can afford to pay, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-aims-to-inoculate-at-least-half-the-population-in-2021-101610434301828.html
12-01-2021||World||Hillary Clinton says Trump impeachment 'essential', won't remove white supremacy||Democratic Party nominee for US President in 2016 Hillary Clinton on Monday expressed solidarity towards impeachment of President Donald Trump by saying it is essential to impeach him in wake of the Capitol riots but warned that impeachment alone "won't remove white supremacy from America".In an opinion piece for The Washington Post, Clinton wrote that Wednesday's attack on the Capitol was the "tragically predictable result" of white-supremacist grievances fueled by Trump adding that his departure from office -- whether immediately or on January 20 -- "will not solve the deeper problems exposed by this episode"."Removing Trump from office is essential, and I believe he should be impeached. Members of Congress who joined him in subverting our democracy should resign, and those who conspired with the domestic terrorists should be expelled immediately. But that alone won't remove white supremacy and extremism from America," Clinton stated."There are changes elected leaders should pursue immediately, including advocating new criminal laws at the state and federal levels that hold white supremacists accountable and tracking the activities of extremists such as those who breached the Capitol," she added.The former First Lady said what happened in Capitol on Wednesday is cause for grief and outrage and it "should not be cause for shock"."What were too often passed off as the rantings of an unfortunate but temporary figure in public life are, in reality, part of something much bigger. That is the challenge that confronts us all," the former New York senator wrote.Recalling the time of being a senator from New York during the September 11 attacks, she said, she thought about that day and the 9/11 commission report that followed."The report's authors explored the failures that opened the door for a devastating terrorist attack. 'The most important failure,' they wrote, 'was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders understood the gravity of the threat'," Clinton wrote."Almost 20 years later, we are living through another failure of imagination -- the failure to account for the damage that can be done to our nation by a president who incites violence, congressional leaders who fan the flames, and social media platforms that sear conspiracy theories into the minds of Trump's supporters. Unless we confront the threats we face, we risk ensuring that last week's events are only a prelude to an even greater tragedy," Clinto stated in Washington Post's opinion piece.Clinton stated that by the time Trump lost in 2020, he had whipped a dangerous element of "our country" into a frenzy adding that Trump's supporters began planning their insurrection, making plans to march on the Capitol and "stop the steal."The former secretary of state raised the question that how do Americans move forward as a country adding that what does the Capitol riots say about the US that so many were complicit, while those who sounded the alarm were dismissed as hysterical."It's sobering that many people were unsurprised by what occurred last week, particularly people of color, for whom a violent mob waving Confederate flags and hanging nooses is a familiar sight in American history," she said.The 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate lauded Twitter and other social media accounts to permanantly suspend Trump's accounts but added that they "will have to do more to stop the spread of violent speech and conspiracy theories."Clinton, in her Washington Post opinion piece wrote that the incoming Joe Biden-led administration will need to address this crisis "in all its complexity and breadth, including holding technology platforms accountable" prosecuting all who broke the laws, and making public more intelligent and analysis about domestic terrorism.On January 6, a group of Trump's loyalists stormed the US Capitol building, clashing with police, damaging property, seizing the inauguration stage and occupying the rotunda. The unrest took place after Trump urged his supporters to protest what he claims is a stolen presidential election.

12-01-2021||World||Facebook has no plans to lift Donald Trump ban, says operation chief Sandberg||worl Facebook Inc's operations chief Sheryl Sandberg said on Monday the world's largest social network had no plans to lift its block on the accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, as the company clamped down on a phrase that has become a rallying cry for the president's supporters.Sandberg, speaking during the Reuters Next conference, said she was glad that Facebook had frozen Trump's accounts, which came as tech giants scrambled to crack down on his baseless claims about fraud in the U.S. presidential election amid riots in Washington last week.Hours later, the company banned the phrase "stop the steal" altogether, citing use of the term to organize events contesting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election that have a propensity for violence.If Trump wanted to appeal the removal of his content, that could happen through the company's new Oversight Board, she added. Facebook said Trump could not appeal the actual suspension through the board."This shows the president is not above the policies we have," Sandberg said, speaking with Reuters Breakingviews columnist Gina Chon.Facebook executives have long taken a light touch to policing speech posted by politicians, maintaining that people have a right to see statements from their leaders.The company backed down somewhat on that position and started applying labels to the president's posts after facing a backlash this summer, including an advertiser boycott, when it declined to act against Trump's incendiary rhetoric around anti-racism protests throughout the United States.It reversed course and banned Trump indefinitely following last week's riots, which culminated in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.Facebook's stock closed down 4% on Monday, as social networks' moves against Trump spurred concern among investors over future regulation. Twitter, which permanently suspended Trump, tumbled over 6% while Alphabet lost 2%.Violent rhetoric on social media platforms including Facebook had ramped up in the weeks preceding the rallies as groups planned openly for the gatherings, according to researchers and public postings, prompting criticism of the companies for failing to take action in advance.Sandberg acknowledged that Facebook may have missed some of those posts but said she believed the events were largely organized on other platforms.She said the company was keeping an eye on further possible armed protests being planned for Washington, D.C. and at all 50 U.S. state capital cities in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, which has prompted an FBI warning.Asked why Facebook had not taken comparable action against other leaders like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, who likewise have been accused of inciting violence online, Sandberg said the company's policies would apply globally.'I'M STAYING'Sandberg has played a less prominent public role at Facebook in the past year, even as CEO Mark Zuckerberg has thrown himself into the public sphere with a series of livestreamed chats and multiple sessions testifying before Congress.The two have also faced questions about their future at Facebook following the mid-year return of Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, who had left the year prior citing vague differences over the company's direction.Asked about the future for herself and Zuckerberg at Facebook, Sandberg said both were staying put in their current roles."I'm staying," she said, adding that she and Zuckerberg "feel we have a real responsibility to fix the systems that didn't work before to protect our service and to make sure great things can happen," Sandberg added.Sandberg also denied reports that she had been sidelined as Zuckerberg took a more active role in content policy and government relations, her traditional areas of responsibility."People love headlines about corporate drama, and I think it's fair to say they particularly love headlines about sidelining women. But I just feel tremendously lucky to have this job because there is so much good," she said.Sandberg said regulatory pressure on U.S. tech companies around antitrust issues was "very real," cautioning similar scrutiny two decades ago was a "major distraction" for Microsoft Corp and caused it to miss the next phase of technology development."We know that history, and we have to both work on these serious issues, work with the government, work on reforming the rules that govern us - which need to be reformed - and keep innovating," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-has-no-plans-to-lift-donald-trump-ban-says-operation-chief-sandberg-101610438736478.html

12-01-2021||World||House set to give Mike Pence ultimatum before moving to impeach Donald Trump||The House is set to issue a largely futile ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday, demanding he invoke constitutional authority to remove President Donald Trump from office, as a prelude to an expected vote to impeach the president for the second time in little more than a year.Pence met with Trump Monday night and the two agreed to work together through the end of their term, according to an official, leaving little doubt that the vice president will spurn the House demand. That means House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will go through with a vote on a single article of impeachment as soon as Wednesday.The resolution being pushed through the House by the majority Democrats on Tuesday calls on Pence to invoke the Constitution’s 25th Amendment to convene the cabinet and declare that as a result of his encouraging a mob that stormed the Capitol that Trump is unable to perform as president.The vote serves mostly as a symbolic gesture by Democrats intended to show they exhausted all options before moving on a historic second impeachment of the president during his last days in office.Pence met with Trump Monday for the first time since the siege at the Capitol, where the vice president was presiding over a joint session of Congress. Pence has been described as initially furious at Trump over the violence. But on Monday, the official said the two men agreed that people who broke the law at the Capitol don’t represent Trump’s “America First” movement and pledged to continue their work on behalf of the country for the remainder of their term.The assault on the Capitol Jan. 6 as Congress was certifying the Electoral College votes that made Joe Biden president-elect has put Trump and Republicans under pressure from all sides. Trump stoked his supporters’ fury in a speech to them before the march to Capitol Hill and more than 100 Republicans in Congress signed on to object to counting the electoral votes from states the Biden won.Almost every Democrat in the House has expressed support for the impeachment resolution and one if its main sponsors, Rhode Island Representative David Cicilline, said he expected it also would draw Republican votes. Several GOP lawmakers, including Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, have denounced both the effort to object to the certification of electors -- one of the main motivators for the crowd of Trump supporters -- and the president fueling their anger.“I expect we will have Republican support,” Cicilline said Monday.Yet the number of Republicans is likely to be very small. Moderates like New York’s Tom Reed have come out against impeachment, favoring a censure resolution instead.The four-page impeachment resolution includes a single article accusing Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors for “Incitement of Insurrection,” and says he “willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged -- and foreseeably resulted in -- lawless action at the Capitol.” It also cites Trumps telephone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, urging that he “find” enough votes to overturn Biden’s win there.“In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government,” the resolution says.Many House Republicans, including those who voted to throw out electoral votes that Biden received, have warned that another impeachment vote would widen existing divisions in the country. House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who voted to object to Arizona and Pennsylvania electors, told colleagues Monday that he opposes impeaching Trump, but floated other potential responses, including censure.He told fellow Republicans in a conference call that Trump had acknowledged having some responsibility for the riot, according to a lawmaker on the call, and another person familiar with the matter.Democrats, meanwhile, are grappling with how to manage the impeachment and a trial in the Senate while Biden is getting his administration up and running.The Senate is currently in recess, and bringing senators back before Jan. 19 would require support from Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who remains majority leader at least until Inauguration Day. A trial that begins on that day, as it would under current rules, would delay confirmation of Biden’s cabinet nominees and early legislative initiatives, including a new stimulus.While many House Democrats are calling for an immediate Senate trial, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of Pelosi’s leadership team, has suggested delaying a Senate trial for at least the first 100 days of the Biden administration.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is exploring whether the chamber can be called into an emergency session for a trial before Inauguration Day. Yet that would at least require the cooperation of McConnell, who hasn’t said whether he would back impeaching the president or expediting a trial.It’s also likely that a Republican senator would object, killing the plan. Senator Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said in a statement Monday that “pushing partisan driven articles of impeachment through Congress days before the inauguration will further divide our country.”Some Democrats also were sending warnings about proceeding with an impeachment and trial. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin has said that while Trump deserves to be impeached, following through and starting a trial as Biden is trying to get his administration off the ground is impractical.It “basically stops us from putting a government together,” he said Sunday on CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-set-to-give-mike-pence-ultimatum-before-moving-to-impeach-donald-trump-101610438042114.html
12-01-2021||World||Indonesia's Sriwijaya flew old planes, neglected routes to become No.3 carrier||Starting with just one plane in 2003, Indonesia's Sriwijaya Air has become the country's No.3 airline group, aided by its strategy of acquiring old planes at cheap prices and serving routes neglected by competitors. The mid-market airline, which has few international flights, was thrust into the spotlight this week when a nearly 27-year old Boeing Co 737-500 crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday with 62 people on board.Brothers Chandra and Hendry Lie, whose family was involved in tin mining and the garment industry, and their business partners launched Sriwijaya 17 years ago with a single plane that flew from their hometown of Pangkal Pinang on Bangka Island to Indonesia's capital Jakarta.Its focus on second and third-tier routes gave it a loyal customer base and helped it snare nearly 10% market share behind Lion Air and national carrier Garuda Indonesia."They had a reasonable business approach," an industry source who was not authorised to speak publicly said of Sriwijaya's founders."They are not flamboyant people like many you see running airlines."They used a conservative business model of acquiring older planes on the cheap rather than taking advantage of low-cost financing to purchase large fleets of new aircraft like other fast-growing carriers such as Lion Air, Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd and Vietnam's VietJet Aviation JSC.The fleet of Sriwijaya and regional offshoot NAM Air is nearly 20 years old on average - nearly three times older than Lion Air group, according to website Planespotters.net.The plane involved in the crash, a 737-500, was one of only 77 remaining in service globally, aviation data provider Cirium said. Other current operators including the likes of Nigeria's Air Peace and Kazakhstan's SCAT Airlines.Two former Sriwijaya employees told Reuters there were strategic reasons for keeping such an old model in service beyond the cheaper acquisition cost.The smaller seating capacity of 120 was more appropriate for certain routes like Jakarta to Pontianak on Borneo flown by the plane that crashed on Saturday and the 737-500 could land at airports that were otherwise served by turboprops due to short runway lengths, they said on condition of anonymity.Sriwijaya did not respond immediately to a request for comment.STRATEGY TESTEDThe crashed jet's black boxes have not yet been recovered so the cause of the accident remains unclear.Older jets can be operated just as safely as newer ones if maintained properly, though the cost of doing so is higher, as are the operating costs because they are less fuel efficient. Indonesia's Transport Ministry said on Tuesday the Sriwijaya plane that crashed had passed an airworthiness inspection in December.Rising upkeep costs and low fare prices due to heated competition meant that by 2018 Sriwijaya had accrued large debts owed to Garuda's maintenance arm, GMF AeroAsia. As of Sept. 30, 2020, Sriwijaya and NAM owed around $63 million in unpaid bills to GMF AeroAsia and Garuda had warned of impairment losses on $37.5 million owed by Sriwijaya as part of a failed cooperation agreement, according to GMF AeroAsia and Garuda.The status of its financial position since the start of the pandemic is unclear, but a Sriwijaya pilot, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were salary cuts and a reduction in the number of planes operating during the pandemic in line with many other airlines globally.The pilot added the airline had been complying with all training and maintenance requirements throughout the pandemic.Sriwijaya and NAM together have 34 planes for operations and half of them are in service, according to Planespotters.net. "The question now is whether Sriwijaya, already in poor financial health, is able to overcome this accident as Covid-19 has crippled all airlines," said Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysian aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-sriwijaya-flew-old-planes-neglected-routes-to-become-no-3-carrier-101610437630626.html
12-01-2021||World||Xi says, time, momentum on China's side as world faces unprecedented turbulence||Time and momentum are on China's side as the world faces an unprecedented turbulent time, President Xi Jinping has said, outlining his vision for the ruling Communist Party for the next 30 years to achieve "great rejuvenation of Chinese nation".Xi, 67, who has become China's most powerful leader after Mao Zedong since he came to power in 2012 was addressing the leading cadre of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Monday. Founded in 1921 by Mao, the CPC took over power in 1949.In his morale-boosting speech, Xi said he believes "time and momentum are on China’s side", despite challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, deteriorating relations with the West and a slowing economy.The coronavirus pandemic, which first broke out in central China's Wuhan city one year ago, has so far killed over 1,944,750 people worldwide and crushed the global economy."The world is in a turbulent time that is unprecedented in the past century,” Xi was quoted as saying by Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post."But time and momentum are on our side. This is where we show our conviction and resilience, as well as our determination and confidence,” he said.Xi spoke of the importance of implementing the new development philosophy and advancing the new development paradigm of "dual circulation" in the country's new development phase to ensure a good start for the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period.Xi has consolidated his leadership as the head of the party, the military and the presidency and bestowed the “core leader” status of the CPC, a position only enjoyed by Mao. Thanks to a constitutional amendment doing away with the two-term provision for the president in 2018, Xi now has the privilege to continue in power for life.Given the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society as well as the change in the world power structure, Xi also underscored the importance of becoming more aware of potential dangers, keeping in mind worst-case scenarios and getting prepared to deal with a more complicated and difficult situation, the state-run China Daily reported.He called for ensuring a good start for fully building a modern socialist country, adding that the next three decades will be a new development phase during which the Chinese people achieve a tremendous transformation from standing up and growing rich to becoming strong under the CPC's leadership.Xi's remarks drew mixed reactions from analysts. While western analysts likened it to that of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's declaration that the conditions are right to make the most of a world that was in flux, Chinese observers said the address reflected Xi's confidence in China’s political system and development.Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said Xi’s remarks showed he intended to make the most of a world that was in flux and undergoing changes that could fundamentally reshape the global order.“Xi is now cautiously very optimistic. He sees the general environment and development as positive for China to assert a new historical role and sees challenges but feels confident that China under him will be able to make the most of it,” Tsang was quoted as saying by South China Morning Post.“It is a – to paraphrase Napoleon – declaration that the conditions are right for the previously slumbering lion to roar and he will see to it that it does,” he said.Though Xi has not specified the exact policies China will implement, “what he has declared is that the conditions are ripe, and if China will rally around the leadership and follow the leader it will get there. The world should take notice,” Tsang said.Zhuang Deshui, deputy director of the Research Centre for Government Integrity Building at Peking University, said Xi’s speech showed his confidence in China’s political system and development.“From his remarks, we can see that Beijing is very confident about China’s major policies and all kinds of responsive measures and Beijing is determined to walk its own path, unaffected by the outside world as it undergoes changes not seen in a century,” he said.Peng Peng, vice-president of Guangdong System Reform Research Society think-tank, said the speech indicated new momentum at a time when China had largely contained the pandemic, and as the US was in chaos amid a power transition.“In the future, China will seek to consolidate partnerships with Russia and Southeast Asian countries, try to mend its strained ties with the US, and it will stick to its own principles in dealing with the Hong Kong and Taiwan issues,” Peng said.Xi has been outlining sweeping changes to come in China’s governance after the Plenum, a key leadership meeting of the CPC in October last year which has approved the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.In November last year, he said China is set to change its development model from 2021, relying more on domestic consumption than export-reliant growth and begin a new phase to become a modern socialist country.Also, coinciding with Xi's assertion of a fully modern socialist society, the CPC in recent months focussed more on reviving studies in Marxism, theory and practice, besides strengthening regulations against top business houses like Alibaba and its billionaire founder Jack Ma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-says-time-momentum-on-china-s-side-as-world-faces-unprecedented-turbulence-101610436586171.html
12-01-2021||World||FBI warns 'armed protests' being planned at all 50 state capitols, Washington DC||The FBI has warned that it has received intelligence that "armed protests" were being planned at all 50 US state capitols and in Washington DC in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, leading to fears of more deadly violence by extremists supporting outgoing President Donald Trump.Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks have called for protest action on a number of dates, including armed demonstrations in cities across the country on January 17 and a march in Washington DC on inauguration day itself."Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols from January 16 through at least January 20, and at the US Capitol from January 17 through January 20," according to the internal Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) bulletin obtained by CNN and other media outlets.Biden is slated to be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, along with Indian-origin Kamala Harris as the Vice President.On Monday, Biden told reporters he was not afraid to take the oath of office outside of the US Capitol.Both he and Harris are still expected to be sworn in outside the building, only two weeks after it was the site of a deadly raid by radical supporters of Trump opposing the election result.Only after the Congressional certification of the November 3 presidential elections last week, the outgoing Republican President Trump has reluctantly accepted the election results and promised a smooth transition of power.But he still believes the presidential elections had massive voters’ fraud, an allegation which remains unsubstantiated and have been thrown out of courts dozens of times.However, Trump’s repeated assertion of massive voters' fraud has incited his base. This resulted in thousands of his supporters storming the Capitol Hill, the historic building, that houses the US Congress on January 6.Five people, including a woman and a police official died and several dozens injured in the incident that is now considered as a dark letter day in the history of American democracy.The Democratic Party, which has majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and would occupy the White House after January 20, on Monday moved second impeachment proceedings against Trump, blaming him for the unprecedented violence.The FBI and the American security and intelligence agencies, who were taken aback by the last week inglorious moment at the Capitol Hill, a major breach of security that put the lives of hundreds of American lawmakers at risk, are now leaving nothing to chance."On 8 January, the FBI received information on an identified group calling for others to join them in 'storming' state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event POTUS is removed as President prior to Inauguration Day."This identified group is also planning to 'storm' government offices including in the District of Columbia and in every state, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump, on 20 January," said the FBI bulletin, according to CNN.The FBI is also tracking reports of "various threats to harm President-Elect Biden ahead of the presidential inauguration," the bulletin. "Additional reports indicate threats against VP-Elect Harris and Speaker Pelosi," the bulletin said.Interestingly, Trump himself has issued an emergency declaration for the national capital here till January 24.In a statement on Monday, the White House said the President's action authorises the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population.Washington DC, meanwhile, is being converted into a garrison city to prevent any kind of untoward incident ahead of the inauguration. The Pentagon has approved to deploy more than 15,000 additional National Guard troops in the national capitol.Army Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, told reporters during a conference call that as of Monday 6,000 national guard troops have already been deployed in the city.Troops in riot gear and shield have already occupied strategic locations in Washington DC. A close look is being kept at all the hotels and incoming traffic.The Site Intelligence Group, which tracks extremist threats online, said in a report that a day of armed far-right protests is scheduled for January 17 and has been in the works for weeks, with Trump supporters and anti-government activists promoting marches in Washington and at state capitols around the nation, The Wall Street Journal said.Fliers promoting the event are circulating online, including one encouraging people to “come armed at your personal discretion,” it said.Other pro-Trump groups are planning Million Militia March on January 20, the daily said.According to The New York Times, State Capitols are bracing up for violence on and around January 20. State legislatures already becoming targets for protesters, the daily said.“Dozens of state capitals will be on alert in the coming days, following calls among a mix of antigovernment organizations for actions in all 50 states on January 17. Some of them come from far-right organisations that harbour a broad anti-government agenda and have already been protesting state Covid-19 lockdowns since last spring,” The New York Times reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-warns-armed-protests-being-planned-at-all-50-state-capitols-washington-dc-101610434109081.html
12-01-2021||World||US Congress moving swiftly to oust Trump||US House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday to call upon Vice-President Mike Pence to oust President Donald Trump invoking the 25th Amendment. If he doesn’t in the next 24 hours, the chamber will vote to impeach Trump on Wednesday, making him the first president impeached twice.Democrats plan to then send the article of impeachment to the Senate for a trial to convict the president, either before he leaves office at the end of his term on January 20 or after.Efforts to remove President Trump from office gathered momentum amid other major developments.Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, became the third Trump cabinet member to resign. Two Capitol police officers were suspended for supporting the rioters and 17 others came under scrutiny for doing the same. Warnings were issued by FBI of more attacks if Trump was removed from office before the end of his term. Bill Belichick, a celebrated American football coach, turned down Trump’s Presidential Medal of Freedom, an honour accorded to Americans for exceptional contribution to the country.Trump has remained out of public sight and sound after Twitter and Facebook shut down his accounts, depriving him of his loudest bullhorns, just hours after a mob of his supporters incited by his lies about election fraud stormed the Capitol, horrifying democracies around the world.Democrats on Monday introduced a resolution urging Pence to lead the cabinet to declare Trump unfit to govern under the 25th Amendment which empowers the vice-president to sideline the president for being unfit to govern. The resolution recalls the horrific events of the day when Pence was whisked away by security personnel shortly after he had started the joint session of Congress to certify Biden’s election victory. And it reminds him that as he took shelter in a secure location from the mob that was chanting “Hang Mike Pence”. Trump had egged them on, tweeting “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country’”.The article of impeachment laid out the case against Trump very clearly. “Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced members of congress and the vice-president, interfered with the joint sessions’ solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.”And, it concluded, “In all of this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States, and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He, thereby, betrayed his trust as president, to the manifest injury of the of the United States.The article further said that by such conduct, he has demonstrated that “he will remain a threat to national security, democracy and the constitution if allowed to remain in office.”The article of impeachment introduced Monday by Democrats charges the president with “incitement of insurrection” and bluntly blames him for the January 6 attack on US congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-moving-swiftly-to-oust-trump-101610431545504.html
12-01-2021||World||Malaysia declares state of emergency as pandemic worsens||Malaysia’s king declared a state of emergency in the Southeast Asian nation, in a move that could allow the embattled government to delay elections as it tackles the worsening coronavirus pandemic. The ringgit and the country’s main stocks index declined.“His Royal Majesty has given consent for the declaration of emergency to be carried out as a proactive measure to contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” the palace said in a statement on Tuesday. The decision comes a day after Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin imposed a two-week targeted lockdown in most of the country starting Wednesday to quell the surge in infections.Covid-19 cases have exploded in Malaysia after a local election in September, with new infections hitting a record-high last week. The government has forecast daily cases to reach 8,000 by late March or late May, based on a predictive modeling analysis. The tally stood at little over 2,000 on Monday. The emergency measure will end on Aug. 1, or sooner if the outbreak abates, according to the statement.The ringgit fell as much as 0.6% to 4.0760 per dollar, the weakest since Dec. 7, while government bonds extended losses. Malaysia’s main stock index fell as much as 1.3%, led by banks including CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. Muhyiddin is scheduled to deliver a television address on the emergency at 11 a.m. Kuala Lumpur time.An emergency “may serve as a ‘circuit breaker’ on the domestic political noises, but on the other hand, it could increase the perceived risk of foreign investors on Malaysia,” said Winson Phoon, head of fixed-income research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities.The measure comes amid infighting within Malaysia’s largest ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation, on whether or not to hold a snap election by March. UMNO is expected to make a final decision on the matter during its general assembly on Jan. 31.Muhyiddin has maintained that an election should only be held after the pandemic is under control. His attempt to place the entire country under emergency in October -- ahead of a major budget vote that doubled as a confidence test -- was rebuffed by the king.Malaysia went through political upheaval in 2020 as various factions jockeyed for power after former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad abruptly stepped down in February. Muhyiddin emerged as the head of an unwieldy bloc with a majority of only a few lawmakers, prompting repeated concerns about the strength and durability of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-declares-state-of-emergency-as-pandemic-worsens-101610420137110.html
12-01-2021||World||Freezing weather in Asia sends energy prices soaring, catching markets off guard||China’s coldest winter in decades meant state-owned energy giant Sinopec was desperate to unload heating fuel from a vessel headed to a northern port, yet freezing temperatures that have swept parts of Asia froze a thick sheet of ice and blocked access.With the help of an icebreaker ship and a cannon loaded with hot water, workers spent 20 hours clearing a pathway for the tanker to dock and discharge its cargo of liquefied natural gas in Tianjin.The effort underscores how frigid temperatures have upended energy markets across Asia, catching some companies flat-footed and sending prices for electricity, fuel and vessels to record highs. And with temperatures showing no signs of easing in key markets in Japan, China and South Korea, it could be weeks before any return to normality.“This winter has definitely caught the market off-guard,” said Henning Gloystein, a director at Eurasia Group. “My hunch is that this spike will end with springtime.”A La Nina weather phenomenon has sent a wave of cold air across North Asia this winter. Beijing last week recorded its lowest temperature since 1966, while Seoul had its coldest day since 1986, and record snowfall is sweeping across Japan’s west coast.The chill is creating a surge in heating demand across the region. Japan’s spot electricity prices have soared more than 10-fold to record levels, while South Korea and China’s main grid have set records for power demand.“Cold weather and electrification of heating create potential for massive spikes in power demand in winter,” said Alex Whitworth, a research director at Wood Mackenzie Ltd.Those three countries are the world’s biggest LNG importers, and the extra demand has helped send prices for spot cargoes and tankers carrying the fuel to record levels. Disruptions at some massive export plants and shipping delays caused by Panama Canal congestion are also contributing, said Jenny Yang, a senior director at IHS Markit Ltd. in Beijing.“The cold winter is not the only reason contributing to the recent dramatic spot price spikes,” she said. “The spikes were likely due to a combination of supply, demand, and shipping factors in a relatively thin and illiquid market.”Japan’s largest power suppliers, including Tokyo Electric Power Co., have implored customers to conserve electricity, while the nation’s grid manager has ordered power producers in a number of regions to boost generating capacity to maximum output to help avoid a supply crunch. Utilities are sharing electricity supplies with rivals.Snow accumulated in parts of Niigata prefecture is 10 times the level of a normal year, according to national broadcaster NHK.Read more: As Polar Vortex Stirs, a Deep Freeze Threatens U.S. and EuropeChina’s power generation is also spurring consumption of coal, which still provides the majority of the country’s energy. Futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange soared to records last month, while a spot deal was recently done at 900 yuan ($139) a ton, the highest in nine years, according to consulting firm Fengkuang Coal Logistics.At least one coal ship that’s been idling off northern China had to relocate to avoid ice forming near the coast, according to vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.In parts of China where coal supply is particularly tight, the government has curtailed electricity to businesses to make sure there’s enough supply for home heating. That’s led to a surge in orders for portable generators and extra demand for the diesel that fuels them.Still, that hasn’t underpinned more demand for crude oil, as refiners like SK Innovation Co. say they’ve adjusted yields to produce more heating oil, but aren’t boosting overall rates.The winter stress isn’t likely to end soon. Sub-freezing temperatures and disruptive winds are expected for the rest of the week in Northeast China, according to the country’s meteorological agency. That will keep pressure on inventories of coal at Chinese power plants until weather starts to warm up, said James Stevenson, senior director at IHS Markit.“This will likely linger as an issue through to the end of the winter, and it will create a bigger restocking need coming out of the winter,” Stevenson said in an emailed message. “All in all, I think it suggests strong pricing -- albeit likely off current highs -- into the second quarter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/freezing-weather-in-asia-sends-energy-prices-soaring-catching-markets-off-guard-101610409429861.html
12-01-2021||World||New Zealand further tightens border measures to combat virus||New Zealand will further tighten border measures to combat the global spread of more transmissible variants of the Covid-19 virus.From Jan 18, almost all people entering New Zealand will need to be tested for the virus within the first 24 hours of arrival, Covid Response Minister Chris Hipkins said in an emailed statement Tuesday in Wellington. Health officials are also putting in place requirements for almost all travelers to New Zealand to have a negative Covid-19 test withing 72 hours of their departure.“New Zealand already has some of the most stringent border protection measures in the world,” Hipkins said. “Today’s amendments further strengthen that position in line with the government’s overall elimination strategy.”New Zealand reported 60 cases among new arrivals in the first 10 days of January, following 106 cases in December. All were caught during the mandatory 14-day stay at isolation hotels that every returnee faces. Infected people must quarantine until tests return negative and they no longer have symptoms.Hipkins said travelers from Australia and some Pacific Island nations will be exempt the pre-departures and day one test. There will also be exemptions for young children and for those who can present a medical certificate as a past recovered case and are assessed as no longer infectious.The broader rules build on existing conditions on arrivals from the U.K. and the U.S., who have faced day one testing since the start of the year and are required to stay in their isolation hotel room until a negative result. Travelers from the U.K. and the U.S. arriving after Jan. 15 must also provide evidence of a negative test.The exact date when the pre-departure test requirement for other nations will be imposed is still being finalized. But those arriving in New Zealand from Jan. 29 without evidence of a negative test will incur a fine, Hipkins said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-further-tightens-border-measures-to-combat-virus-101610416211224.html
12-01-2021||World||Indonesia uses unmanned undersea vehicle in hunt for air crash victims||Indonesia has deployed a remotely operated underwater vehicle to help divers search for the remains of victims and recover the flight recorders from a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the sea three days ago soon after takeoff.The Boeing 737-500 plane with 62 people on board plunged into the Java Sea Saturday afternoon, four minutes after taking off from Jakarta's main airport.Indonesian police made the first identification of a victim from the crash on Monday. Flight attendant Okky Bisma was identified by his fingerprints, said a police official."My super kind husband... Heaven is your place... Until we meet again darling," Okky's wife, who is also a flight attendant, wrote on her Instagram account.The Boeing 737-500 jet was headed on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Borneo island, about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta, before it disappeared from radar screens.It was the second major air crash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX also plunged into the Java Sea soon after taking off. The jet that crashed on Saturday is a largely different design."Today we are focusing on finding the victims," Yusuf Latif, a spokesman for search and rescue agency Basarnas, said on Tuesday.Divers have narrowed down an area where they believe the flight recorders, known as black boxes, are believed to be but search efforts have been hindered by debris, officials said.A remotely operated underwater vehicle has been deployed to help scour the seabed, while navy vessels with sonar search from the surface.Once the flight data and cockpit voice recorders are found, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) expects to be able to read the information in three days.With few immediate clues on what caused a catastrophic loss of control after take-off, investigators will rely heavily on the flight recorders to determine what went wrong.The Sriwijaya Air plane was nearly 27 years old, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-uses-unmanned-undersea-vehicle-in-hunt-for-air-crash-victims-101610419899272.html
12-01-2021||World||Twitter suspends thousands of accounts dedicated to sharing QAnon content||Twitter Inc said it has suspended more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content after last week's violence in Washington when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol."Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon", Twitter said in a blog late on Monday."These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service", the company said.QAnon backers have pushed conspiracies on social media that include the baseless claim that Trump secretly is fighting a cabal of child-sex predators, among them prominent Democrats, figures in Hollywood and "deep state" allies.Twitter had said on Friday it would permanently suspend accounts pushing QAnon content, banning prominent right-wing boosters of its conspiracy theories.The storming of the Capitol building last week by Trump supporters delayed the certification of Biden's election victory.Lawmakers were forced to flee, as the building was mobbed by the president's supporters who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence including one Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-suspends-thousands-of-accounts-dedicated-to-sharing-qanon-content-101610419674318.html
12-01-2021||World||Trump administration misses deadline for providing Congress census data||The Trump administration missed a deadline for giving Congress numbers used for divvying up congressional seats among the states, and government attorneys said Monday that the figures would not be ready until early March, almost a month later than previously disclosed.President Donald Trump on Sunday let slip the target date for transmitting the apportionment numbers to Congress as the US Census Bureau continued to work toward fixing data irregularities from its number-crunching efforts.Under federal law, the president is required to hand over the numbers to Congress showing the number of people in each state within the first week of the start of Congress in the year following a once-a-decade head count of every US resident. There are no penalties for missing the deadline.The president's tardiness stemmed from the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, missing a year-end target date for giving the apportionment numbers to the president, due to the pandemic and irregularities that were discovered while crunching data from the 2020 census on a shortened schedule.“The Census Bureau is committed to fixing all anomalies and errors that it finds in order to produce complete and accurate results," said Deborah Stempowski, an assistant director at the Census Bureau, in a court filing last week.The census not only decides how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets based on population, but it also determines the distribution of $1.5 trillion in federal funding each year.The earliest date the apportionment numbers will be ready is March 6, nearly a month past the Feb. 9 date disclosed last week, as the Census Bureau fixes anomalies discovered during data processing, Department of Justice attorneys said Monday during a court hearing.Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Coghlan said during the hearing there were no new irregularities, but that the ones disclosed last week needed more time to correct.The Department of Justice is representing the Commerce Department and Census Bureau in a lawsuit filed by a coalition of municipalities and advocacy groups in federal court in San Jose, California.If the March date holds, the Census Bureau will not finish processing the numbers until weeks after Trump leaves office January 20, putting in jeopardy an unprecedented order by the president to exclude people in the country illegally from those figures. President-elect Joe Biden opposes the order, which was inspired by an influential GOP adviser who wrote that excluding them from the apportionment process would favor Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.Last week, Biden announced that Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo will be his nominee for Commerce Secretary, which would make her responsible for the final 2020 census numbers instead of current Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, if census data processing continues past January 20.The Constitution states that the apportionment process is based on “the whole number of persons in each state." Trump’s apportionment order was challenged in more than a half-dozen lawsuits across the US But the Supreme Court ruled last month that any challenge was premature.The San Jose lawsuit was originally brought by a coalition of municipalities and advocacy groups that had sued the Trump administration stop the census from ending early out of concerns that a shortened head count would cause minority communities to be undercounted. The coalition of municipalities and advocacy groups currently is seeking data and documents to help assess the accuracy of the 2020 census, saying a shortened timeline for processing the data will compromise its quality.The coalition says Department of Justice attorneys have repeatedly refused to turn over court-ordered documents, and the coalition is seeking sanctions of $5,000 a day until they do so.“They have done so precisely so that Defendants ‘best-Census-ever!' assertions ... can never be fully tested," coalition attorneys said in a court filing.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said at Monday's hearing that she was disappointed that the government attorneys hadn't produced more documents. Koh is presiding over the lawsuit, but a separate panel of magistrate judges is deciding whether to agree to the sanctions.“I see obstruction and I don’t see cooperation and I don’t think that’s a good look for the Department of Justice,” Koh said.The Department of Justice attorneys have said sanctions are inappropriate. Government attorneys said at Monday's hearing that they have been overwhelmed by the volume of requests from the plaintiffs' attorneys.“We are in a hole, and we are trying to get out of the hole as dirt is being poured on us, said Brad Rosenberg, a Department of Justice attorney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-misses-deadline-for-providing-congress-census-data-101610415980777.html

12-01-2021||World||Trump administration re-designates Cuba as 'state sponsor of terrorism'||The Trump administration has re-designated Cuba as a "state sponsor of terrorism", reversing an Obama-era decision days ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the US government had been focused from the start on denying the Castro regime the resources it uses to "oppress its people at home, and countering its malign interference in Venezuela and the rest of the Western Hemisphere"."The State Department has designated Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism for repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists," Pompeo said."With this action, we will once again hold Cuba's government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of US justice," he said.The previous Obama Administration had previously removed from this designation, which subjects Cuba to sanctions that penalise persons and countries engaging in certain trade with it, restricts US foreign assistance, bans defence exports and sales, and imposes certain controls on exports of dual-use items.Cuba returns to the list following its "broken commitment" to stop supporting terrorism as a condition of its removal by the previous administration in 2015. On May 13, 2020, the State Department notified Congress that it had certified Cuba under Section 40A(a) of the Arms Export Control Act as "not cooperating fully" with US counterterrorism efforts in 2019."The Cuban intelligence and security apparatus has infiltrated Venezuela's security and military forces, assisting Nicholas Maduro to maintain his stranglehold over his people while allowing terrorist organizations to operate."The Cuban government's support for FARC dissidents and the ELN continues beyond Cuba's borders as well, and the regime's support of Maduro has created a permissive environment for international terrorists to live and thrive within Venezuela," Pompeo said.According to Pompeo, members of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a US-designated foreign terrorist organisation, travelled to Havana to conduct peace talks with the Colombian government in 2017.Citing peace negotiation protocols, Cuba has refused Colombia's requests to extradite 10 ELN leaders living in Havana after the group claimed responsibility for the January 2019 bombing of a Bogota police academy that killed 22 people and injured more than 87 others, Pompeo said.Cuba also harbours several US fugitives from justice wanted on or convicted of charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades, he alleged.For example, the Cuban regime has refused to return Joanne Chesimard, on the FBI's 'most wanted terrorists' list for executing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster in 1973; Ishmael LaBeet, convicted of killing eight people in the US Virgin Islands in 1972; Charles Lee Hill, charged with killing New Mexico state policeman Robert Rosenbloom in 1971; and others.Pompeo said the US would continue to support the Cuban people in their desire for a democratic government and respect for human rights, including freedom of religion, expression, and association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-re-designates-cuba-as-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-101610411568141.html
12-01-2021||World||Republicans face growing corporate backlash after Capitol assault||Republicans in the US Congress faced growing blowback on Monday from businesses that said they would cut off campaign contributions to those who voted last week to challenge President-elect Joe Biden's victory.The announcements by Amazon.com Inc, General Electric Co, Dow Inc, AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, American Express Co, Airbnb Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Mastercard Inc, among others, threaten to throttle fundraising resources for Republicans who will soon be out of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress.AT&T and Comcast, for example, are among the biggest corporate donors in Washington.Greeting-card giant Hallmark Company Ltd said it had asked senators Josh Hawley and Roger Marshall to return its contributions. Representatives for the two Republicans, who both objected to Biden's certification, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The announcements are a sign that some corporate donors, which typically spread their money widely around Capitol Hill, are re-assessing their strategy after supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the Capitol last week in an effort to prevent Congress from formalizing Biden's victory.It is unclear whether their decisions will have a lasting impact. Fundraising activity is currently at a post-election lull in Washington, giving businesses and trade groups some time to figure out their approach.Few companies have gone as far as Dow, which said it would withhold donations for the Republican lawmakers' entire terms in office - up to six years for those in the Senate. Others said they would withhold donations temporarily, or suspend giving to Republicans and Democrats alike.GE's suspension will last through the end of 2022 and then the employee board that oversees its political action committee will consider requests for support for those lawmakers who opposed certification "on a case-by-case basis."At least five people died in last week's attack, which also forced lawmakers into hiding for several hours.When they reconvened, 147 Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate voted to challenge Biden's victory in Pennsylvania or Arizona, even though both states already formally certified the results and election officials say there were no significant problems with the vote.Those voting yes included the top two House Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, and Senator Rick Scott, who as incoming head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee will head up efforts to win back the Senate in the 2022 elections. All of their jobs require extensive fundraising. McCarthy and Scalise's offices did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Scott declined to comment.Amazon said it would discuss concerns "directly with those members we have previously supported" before deciding whether to resume contributions.CUT OFF FOR HOW LONG?The sheer extent of the Republican opposition will make it difficult for businesses to simply cut off those who voted against certifying Biden's victory, said a senior Republican business strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity. Roughly two-thirds of all House Republicans, including seasoned legislators and vocal Trump partisans, supported the challenge.Business groups will be watching closely over the coming weeks to see whether those Republicans make gestures to re-establish a sense of normalcy, such as attending Biden's inauguration, the strategist said."Each of those people are going to be scrutinized," the strategist said. "Are they all going into the bucket of 'no contributions'? I would be shocked if they all get put in."A growing list of companies, including Ford Motor Co, Microsoft Corp, American Airlines, Alphabet Inc's Google, Facebook Inc, Goldman Sachs, BP Plc, Smithfield Foods Inc and Union Pacific Corp said they would temporarily suspend donations to Democrats and Republicans alike.Trade associations, among the biggest donors in Washington, are moving more slowly.The National Association of Beer Wholesalers, the National Association of Auto Dealers, and the American Bankers Association said they would re-assess their contribution strategy. Other top donors, including the National Association of Homebuilders and the National Association of Realtors, said they have yet to make a decision.Several analysts said the boycott may not be permanent, as the need for access on Capitol Hill might ultimately outweigh the risk of being seen as an underwriter of those who weaken US democracy."It’s very easy to suspend campaign contributions two months after an election. The question is whether these policies will remain in effect," said Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-face-growing-corporate-backlash-after-capitol-assault-101610408658766.html

The park has been closed to the public since December 6 as part of the state of California's lockdown efforts to curb coronavirus cases.Veterinarians are closely monitoring the gorillas and they will remain in their habitat at the park, north of San Diego, Peterson said. For now, they are being given vitamins, fluid and food but no specific treatment for the virus."Aside from some congestion and coughing, the gorillas are doing well," Peterson said.While other wildlife has contracted the coronavirus from minks to tigers, this is the first known instance of transmission to great apes and it is unknown if they will have any serious reaction.Wildlife experts have expressed concern about the coronavirus infecting gorillas, an endangered species that share 98.4 percent of their DNA with humans and are inherently social animals.The gorillas infected at the San Diego safari park are western lowland gorillas, whose population has declined by more than 60% over the last two decades because of poaching and disease, according to the World Wildlife Fund.The safari park tested feces of the troop of gorillas after two apes began coughing January 6. Positive test results were confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Services Laboratories in three gorillas. Feces from all eight in the troop are being taken for testing.Zoo officials are talking to experts who have been treating the coronavirus in humans in case the animals' develop more severe symptoms. They will remain together since separating them could be harmful to the gorillas that live in tight-knit groups."This is wildlife, and they have their own resiliency and can heal differently than we do," Peterson said.The safari park on Monday added more safety measures for its staff, including requiring face shields and eye goggles when working in contact with the animals.The confirmation that gorillas are susceptible to the coronavirus contributes to information about how the pandemic may affect these species in their native habitats where they come into contact with humans and human materials, the park officials said.San Diego Zoo Safari Park plans to share what it learns with health officials, conservationists and scientists to develop steps to protect gorillas in the forests of Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gorillas-test-positive-for-coronavirus-at-san-diego-park-101610410008525.html

It was among groups that paid for supporters of President Donald Trump to travel to Washington, where mobs stormed the U.S. Capitol last week, breaking through police lines and forcing lawmakers into hiding.Some of PayPal’s rivals have also begun reassessing doing business with companies linked to Trump. Shopify Inc. shut down online stores affiliated with him.“PayPal has a longstanding, well-defined and consistently enforced acceptable use policy,” the company said in Monday’s statement. “Regardless of the individual or organization in question, we work to ensure that our services are not used to accept payments for activities that promote hate speech, violence or other forms of intolerance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/paypal-blocks-website-that-helped-raise-funds-for-capitol-protesters-101610409386210.html
12-01-2021||World||FBI warns of armed protests ahead of Joe Biden inauguration||The FBI has warned of armed protests being planned for Washington and all 50 US state capitals in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's January 20 inauguration, a federal law enforcement source said on Monday.Threatened with more violence from outgoing President Donald Trump's supporters following last Wednesday's storming of the US Capitol, the FBI issued warnings for next weekend that run at least until Inauguration Day, the source said.In other steps to safeguard the US capital, the National Guard was authorized to send up to 15,000 troops to Washington, and tourists were barred from visiting the Washington Monument until January 24.The chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Daniel Hokanson, told reporters he expected about 10,000 troops in Washington by Saturday to help provide security, logistics and communications.He said the number could rise to 15,000 if requested by local authorities.At least one lawmaker asked the Pentagon to do more.Senator Chris Murphy, who said he was sending a letter to the acting secretary of defense on Monday, said it was unclear if the National Guard would be sufficient to protect the nation's capital and that active-duty troops may be needed also."I'm not afraid of taking the oath outside," Biden told reporters in Newark, Delaware, referring to the traditional setting for the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds. But he said it was critically important that people "who engaged in sedition and threatened people's lives, defaced public property, caused great damage" be held accountable.Biden's inaugural committee said on Monday the theme of the Jan. 20 ceremony would be "America United." Trump, who has sought unsuccessfully to overturn the Nov. 3 election results with false claims of widespread fraud, said last week he would not attend the ceremony, a decision the president-elect supported.WASHINGTON MONUMENT CLOSED TO TOURSThe Park Service said it would suspend tours of the Washington Monument, an obelisk honoring the country's first president, due to safety concerns from threats to disrupt the inauguration.Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called for the US Interior Department to cancel public-gathering permits through January 24. "This inaugural planning period has to be very different than all the others," she told reporters on Monday.In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf made public on Sunday, Bowser called for a fresh approach to security after what she called last week's "unprecedented terrorist attack."Bowser asked Wolf to extend the National Special Security Event period from Monday through January 24. The Secret Service heads security operations for events, including presidential inaugurations, considered to be nationally significant.Wolf said in a statement he had instructed the Secret Service to begin National Special Security Event operations for the inauguration effective Wednesday, instead of January 19 as previously scheduled. The acting secretary told his staff he was stepping down on Monday.The assault on the Capitol, challenging the certification of Biden's election victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer. Dozens of people have been charged in the violence and hundreds of more cases are expected.The assault occurred shortly after Trump urged supporters to march on the Capitol during a rally where he repeated false claims his resounding defeat in November's election was illegitimate.Democrats in Congress began a push on Monday to force Trump from office, introducing an article of impeachment that accuses him of inciting insurrection.The presidential inaugural committee and Bowser have told Americans not to travel to the inauguration, and said Washington's National Mall would be covered with 191,500 flags of different sizes, to represent the missing crowds.A presidential inauguration traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to Washington, but the ceremonies have been scaled back dramatically because of the Covid-19 pandemic.In state capitols, governors are on high alert ahead of the inauguration.In Wisconsin, a swing state where Trump alleged election fraud, Governor Tony Evers authorized the Wisconsin National Guard to support the state's Capitol Police.In Michigan, another swing state where Biden's victory was contested by Trump, the state's Capitol Commission, which oversees the legislature, issued an order to ban the open carrying of weapons inside the Capitol building in Lansing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-warns-of-armed-protests-ahead-of-joe-biden-inauguration-101610409384429.html

Gardephe in Manhattan set the May 7 date for the once fast-rising lawyer known for combative online clashes with President Donald Trump while he represented Stormy Daniels. If it occurs then, it will be more than a year since Avenatti was first set to be sentenced.Avenatti was convicted early last year of threatening to damage Nike’s reputation if he wasn’t paid millions of dollars.Later this year, he faces two fraud trials in Los Angeles, where prosecutors say he cheated clients of millions of dollars. He also faces a trial in New York next year on charges he cheated the porn star Daniels of $300,000 in book proceeds.Free on bail, he has pleaded not guilty to all charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-sets-may-sentencing-for-michael-avenatti-in-nike-case-101610408663785.html
12-01-2021||World||UN chief Antonio Guterres declares he will seek second term||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres officially declared Monday he is seeking a second five-year term at the helm of the United Nations.Guterres, whose current term ends next Dec. 31, said in a letter to General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir that “It would be my honor to continue to serve the organization in pursuing its purposes and fulfilling its noble objectives.”The former Portuguese prime minister and UN refugee chief was elected by the 193-member assembly to succeed Ban Ki-moon after a hotly contested and transparent race in October 2016 that initially included 13 candidates -- seven women and six men. Guterres took office on Jan. 1, 2017.“I am available to serve a second term as secretary-general of the United Nations, if that will be the will of member states,” Guterres said in a letter to Bozkir obtained by the Associated Press.Several diplomats have said Guterres was waiting for the results of the U.S. presidential election and would not have sought a second term if Donald Trump won. But another diplomat familiar with his thinking said Guterres, after more than 40 years of public service, would have felt he couldn’t desert the U.N. if Trump had defeated President-elect Joe Biden who takes office on Jan. 20.Trump pulled the United States out of the World Health Organization, the UN-backed 2015 Paris climate agreement and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and stopped funding the UN population fund and the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. Biden has said the US will quickly rejoin the WHO and the climate agreement.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Guterres was responding to a letter from Bozkir on Friday asking his “intentions regarding a second mandate.”The secretary-general spent time over the holidays speaking to his family, Dujarric said, and “I don’t think any particular elections cycle in any particular country impacted his decision.”Dujarric said Guterres informed the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- on Friday. China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun hosted a lunch for the P5 ambassadors, as they are called, with the secretary-general on Friday, diplomats said.The General Assembly elects the secretary-general on the recommendation of the 15-member Security Council where the five permanent members have veto power, so their support is crucial.Guterres, 71, got his first key vote of support late Monday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson “warmly welcomed the secretary-general’s decision to run for a second term and congratulated him on a successful first term,” his office said following a virtual meeting between the two leaders.Guterres also spoke to leaders of the UN’s regional groups on Friday and sent a letter to the Security Council on Monday, the UN spokesman said.As for next steps, a General Assembly resolution adopted in September 2015 asks the presidents of the assembly and Security Council to “start the process of soliciting candidates for the position of secretary-general through a joint letter addressed to all member states.”Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma said president Bozkir spoke to Tunisia’s U.N. Ambassador Tarek Ladeb, this month's council president, on Monday and will meet with him Tuesday, among other things to discuss “the next steps in this process.”The 2015 resolution, which was adopted by consensus, made the previously largely secretive selection of the secretary-general more open and transparent. It allowed the world body’s member states for the first time to see basic information about all candidates, including their resumes, and to meet and question them at open sessions.Just before Christmas, a group of 25 nations from all regions called the Accountability Coherence and Transparency group wrote to the General Assembly and Security Council urging that the selection process meets “at a minimum" the 2015 standards of transparency and involvement of UN members.Guterres’ election was a disappointment to women, who have never held the U.N.’s top job, and to East Europeans who have never had a secretary-general from the region. It was supposed to be next in the informal geographical rotation for U.N. chief when Guterres, a West European was elected.Since this will be the first time an incumbent is seeking a second term following the resolution’s adoption, and it isn’t yet known whether there will be any other candidates, the next steps are unclear.Guterres said in his reply to Bozkir: “In line with the strong interest of the General Assembly regarding transparency and inclusivity, I am ready to fully meet the expectations referred in your letter, notably with regard to the submission of a vision statement and to the participation in an informal dialogue with member states.”The secretary-general said in the letter that he has worked to reform the United Nations “to meet the aspirations of member states, striving for the dignity and the well-being of people, while ensuring the sustainability of our planet for future generations.”On the day of his election, Guterres pledged to be “a bridge-builder” and to promote a new “diplomacy for peace.”But the last four years have seen the United Nations, the global bastion of multilateralism, and its leader trying to deal with an increasingly polarized world facing a pandemic, regional conflicts, a shrinking economy, growing inequality and escalating US-China tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-antonio-guterres-declares-he-will-seek-second-term-101610408680776.html
12-01-2021||World||How a British Covid-19 vaccine went from pole position to troubled start||On June 5, researchers at the University of Oxford quietly made a change to a late-stage clinical trial of their Covid-19 vaccine. In an amendment noted in a document marked CONFIDENTIAL, they said they were adding a new group of participants.The adjustment might seem minor in a large-scale study. But it masked a mistake that would have potentially far-reaching consequences: Many of the United Kingdom trial subjects had inadvertently been given only about a half dose of the vaccine.The new volunteers would now receive the correct dose. The trial continued.Much was riding on the Oxford vaccine, a British-led endeavour also involving UK drugs firm AstraZeneca. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government was desperate for a success story after its early mishandling of the pandemic contributed to one of the world's highest death tolls from Covid-19 - around 65,000 by mid-December. The government has secured 100 million doses.On Nov. 23, Oxford and AstraZeneca delivered positive news. They announced that the regimen of a half dose followed by a full dose booster appeared to be 90% effective in preventing Covid-19. Two full doses scored 62%. Oxford researchers have said they aren't certain why the half-dose regimen was much more effective.Johnson called the vaccine team and tweeted his thanks "for their brilliant work." He went on, "These results are incredibly encouraging and a major step forward in our fight against Covid-19."Oxford and AstraZeneca are now hoping for quick authorization by Britain's regulator. But questions about the trial and the results won't go away.Some experts say the dosing discrepancy raises doubts about the robustness of the study's findings. And they worry about another acknowledged peculiarity of the study: The half-dose regimen wasn't tested on anyone over 55 - the group considered at high risk from Covid-19. In contrast, a vaccine produced by Pfizer/BioNTech was tested on thousands of people over 65, with an efficacy of 94%.John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said there needed to be a better understanding of how the Oxford trial unfolded. "When you get corporate and academic scientists saying different things, it doesn't give you the impression of confidence in what they're doing," he told Reuters. "Was the dosing thing a mistake or not?"Now a Reuters review of hundreds of pages of clinical trial records, as well as interviews with scientists and industry figures, provides the most detailed account to date of what went wrong with the dosing in the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine study. The review found that Oxford researchers were responsible for what their own clinical trial documents called "a potency miscalculation."For Oxford and AstraZeneca, the stakes could not be higher. They hope to produce up to three billion doses of the low-cost vaccine by the end of next year, enough to inoculate much of the world, including many of its poorest inhabitants. For months, scientists at Oxford have been busily promoting the experimental vaccine's prospects in bullish terms - beginning even before the first human test subjects were injected with the experimental vaccine.In an interview that appeared on April 11 in Britain's The Times newspaper, Sarah Gilbert, one of the vaccine's chief researchers at Oxford, said she was 80% certain her team would be able to produce a successful vaccine, possibly as early as September. That was 12 days before a clinical trial to test its safety began.Oxford didn't answer detailed questions for this story, but provided a statement saying the trials have been "conducted under the strict national, ethical and regulatory requirements." It added that "all trial protocols and trial amendments have been subject to review and approval by the relevant authorities. All safety data have been reviewed regularly" by regulators.A spokesman for AstraZeneca referred questions about the UK clinical trial to Oxford, which sponsored it. A spokeswoman for Britain's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), declined to answer questions about the Oxford/AstraZeneca dosing issue. "Our rolling review is ongoing," she said, "so this information is currently commercially confidential."The UK's Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment.AN EXACT SCIENCEVaccines are the world's best hope of ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 1.7 million lives globally. More than 60 Covid-19 vaccine candidates are currently undergoing human trials, according to the World Health Organization.Vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have already been authorized for use in some countries, including the United States. They use a relatively new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA) that instructs human cells to produce antigens, a type of protein, that stimulate the immune system. Late-stage clinical trials showed both vaccines appeared to be at least 94% effective. Until the UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 2, no RNA vaccine had ever received authorization for general use.The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine employs a more established technique called viral vector. The vaccine uses a bioengineered version of a harmless common-cold virus found in chimpanzees to instruct human cells to make antigens.On December 8, Oxford published an interim analysis of its trial results and more than 1,100 pages of supplementary documents in the scientific journal The Lancet. These show that measuring the concentration of viral materials can be tricky, and they shed light on the chain of events leading up to the dosing discrepancy.Viral vectors are typically produced in bioreactors holding up to 2,000 liters, which are then filtered and purified into a concentrated batch of active substance of just a few liters."This is not about measuring pencils, pens, bricks, or fixed objects of a given size," said Lucio Rovati, chief executive of Rottapharm, an Italian biotech company that is trying to develop a different type of vaccine using a genetic fragment. "It's about live biological products."According to the Oxford documents, in May researchers received a vaccine delivery from Italy's IRBM/Advent — one of the contract manufacturers Oxford enlisted to complement its own vaccine production. The late-stage trial of the Oxford vaccine was about to begin.The shipment, batch K.0011, had undergone the Italian company's quality check using an established genetic test - quantitative PCR, or qPCR - to determine viral matter per milliliter.Oxford ran its own analysis for good measure. The university had been using a different method known as spectrophotometry, which measures viral material in liquids based on how much ultraviolet light the viral matter absorbs.Oxford's measurement showed that the batch was more potent than the Italian manufacturer had found, the documents show. Oxford trusted its own result and wanted to remain consistent with a measuring tool it had used throughout an earlier trial phase. So it asked Britain's drugs regulator for permission to reduce the volume of vaccine injected into trial participants from the K.0011 batch. Permission was granted."The decisions about dosing were all done in discussion with the regulator. So when we started the trial, we had some discrepancies in the measurement of the concentration of virus in the vaccine," Andrew Pollard, the Oxford trial's chief investigator, told Reuters.A spokeswoman for the regulator declined to discuss when it first became aware of the dosing issue."SERENDIPITY"Trial participants who received shots from the Italian batch displayed milder than normal expected side effects, such as fever and fatigue. AstraZeneca executive vice president Mene Pangalos said the dose was measured incorrectly. "It ended up being half the dose," he told Reuters. He called the mistake "serendipity," given that data analysis later indicated the half dose, followed by a full-dose booster shot, was much more effective than two full doses.He also recently told the BBC: "There is no doubt I think that we would have run the study a little bit differently if we had been doing it from scratch. But ultimately, it is what it is."IRBM/Advent told Reuters there was no manufacturing issue with the batch. The company said in a written statement that the measuring mishap was "the result of a change in the testing method" used to confirm the potency of the dose "once the material had been shipped."The documents published in The Lancet confirm that the error lay with the Oxford researchers. A common emulsifier, polysorbate 80, used in vaccines to facilitate mixing, had interfered with the ultraviolet-light meter that measures the quantity of viral material, according to the documents. As a result, the vaccine's viral concentration was overstated and Oxford ended up administering half doses of vaccine, believing they were full doses.The documents don't give a detailed timeline, nor do they show that Oxford informed AstraZeneca at the time. But they do show that Oxford contacted the British regulator again, this time seeking approval to change its measuring method to the one used by the Italians, and to figure out how to proceed with a late-stage trial that had begun with participants receiving the wrong dose. The documents don't provide full details of the communication between Oxford and the regulator.In early June, the regulator gave the green light to continue injecting people with the half-dose, in an effort to keep the trial as large as possible and to try to speed up the results, according to the analysis published in The Lancet. The regulator also ruled that Oxford must add another test group to receive the full dose, in accordance with its original plan to test the safety and efficacy of full doses."We went back and discussed it again with the regulators and agreed with them," said Pollard, the Oxford study's chief investigator.Ultimately, 1,367 trial participants - none of them over 55 - received the half-dose/full-dose regimen. Two full doses were given to 4,440 adult participants, from all age groups.The MHRA, Britain's regulator, is expected to decide soon whether to approve the vaccine. The agency is headed by June Raine, a doctor who trained in general medicine at Oxford. The university's website shows she has made donations, given talks and performed volunteer work for the university's Somerville College, which she attended.The MHRA said that before any decision on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is made, Raine "will ensure, for complete transparency" her interactions with Oxford as an alumnus are declared. It added that "none of these ties are of a nature that could give rise to a conflict requiring recusal."CONTRADICTIONSDeep within the more than 1,100 pages of supplemental appendices published in The Lancet appeared a description of the dosing discrepancy — "a potency miscalculation." That admission is contained in a "Statistical Analysis Plan" by Oxford and AstraZeneca dated November 17.Six days later, Oxford and AstraZeneca announced the interim results of their clinical trials in the UK and in Brazil. "Oxford University breakthrough on global Covid-19 vaccine," was the headline of an Oxford press release.AstraZeneca's news release was more muted. "Two different dosing regimens demonstrated efficacy with one showing a better profile," it stated.In interviews about the results with Reuters and the New York Times, AstraZeneca's Pangalos spoke of "serendipity," a "useful mistake" and a "dosing error."But the firm's chief executive officer, Pascal Soriot, told Bloomberg: "People call it a mistake — it was not a mistake." A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment on the statements.Meanwhile, the two scientists leading Oxford's development of the vaccine — Sarah Gilbert and Adrian Hill — suggested that the half-dose was not administered by mistake. They didn't provide evidence. Gilbert, an Oxford vaccinology professor, said it was normal for researchers to look at different dose levels during vaccine trials. "It wasn't a mix-up in dosing," she told the Financial Times in an article published on November 27.A few days later, Hill told Reuters it was a conscious decision by researchers to administer a lower dose. "There had been some confusion suggesting that we didn't know we were giving a half dose when we gave it — that is really not true," he said.Gilbert and Hill together have about a 10% stake in a private biotech firm called Vaccitech that was spun out of Oxford University, according to a filing with Companies House, the UK's companies registry, dated Oct. 29. According to a spokeswoman for Vaccitech, the company transferred its rights to the vaccine to Oxford University's research commercialization arm in exchange for a share of the revenue. "If the vaccine is successful then all shareholders and investors in the company could potentially indirectly benefit," she wrote in an email.Hill and Gilbert didn't respond to detailed questions for this article.The conflicting explanations of what went wrong have drawn criticism from some experts. "Personally, I can say that I think their vaccine is much better than their communication," said Guido Rasi, who until last month was executive director of the European Medicines Agency, the European Union's regulator. He said the agency eventually will evaluate the trial data.'AHEAD OF THE WORLD'For months, the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was described by officials and in the media as the front-runner in the global race to produce a Covid-19 vaccine.Britain's health minister, Matt Hancock, told a press conference in April that Britain was "at the forefront of the global effort" to find a vaccine.On June 26, the World Health Organization's chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, said at a press conference that Oxford's vaccine was probably the world's leading candidate.Five days later, the then head of Britain's vaccine procurement program, Kate Bingham, told a parliamentary committee: "Oxford is ahead of the world in that it is the most advanced vaccine anywhere."Some Oxford scientists did little to dampen the enthusiasm. Asked at the same science and technology parliamentary committee on July 1 whether the world would have to struggle through the coming winter without a vaccine, Gilbert said, "I hope we can improve on those timelines and come to your rescue."At the end of July, she alluded to competing vaccine efforts. In an interview on the Royal Society of Biology's website, she said of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine: "If this doesn't work, I don't think anything will work."Her main partner on the project, Hill, was equally bullish. On May 15, he told Reuters the Oxford/AstraZeneca candidate is "almost certainly the best single dose rapid-response vaccine." He dismissed as "total unknowns" and a "wild card" the vaccines using mRNA technology, such as Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which have since published results showing they were both at least 94% effective at preventing COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is already being distributed in the millions in the United States and the UK."Why would you take a vaccine technology that is new, unproven, maybe quick to manufacture, but expensive to manufacture - and has never been scaled up and has never been shown to protect against anything in humans, and prioritize that in a global emergency?" he asked. "It's very odd."Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain's University of Reading, told Reuters that the plethora of upbeat statements hasn't benefited the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine candidate."I don't want to take away from the fact everybody has worked very hard and (the vaccine) is fundamentally safe and sound," he said. "But reporting has always had a slightly nationalistic tone, which I don't think has been helpful."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-a-british-covid-19-vaccine-went-from-pole-position-to-troubled-start-101610391390460.html
12-01-2021||World||Speedy distribution of vaccine a major challenge for global govts: WHO experts||As India launches the world's most ambitious and biggest vaccination drive against Covid-19, the country will encounter the formidable challenge of rapidly scaling up distribution of the vaccines to secure immunity for its entire population, two prominent Indian scientists at WHO have said. This daunting challenge is not only for India but also for all the governments across the globe as they start inoculating their populations to tackle the pandemic, noted Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist of WHO, and Dr Hamsadvani Kuganantham, Consultant, WHO. On Sunday, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO),India's drugs regulator, had approved Oxford vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use for the frontline warriors and senior citizens in the country. Currently, there are 45 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 156 candidate vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation, the WHO scientists said. COVAX,a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 treatments and vaccines,is jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance set up by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and the World Health Organisation (WHO). Also Read: A new 'dawn': Serum Covid-19 vaccine shipment to start on Tuesday"It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries," they wrote in an article for Manorama Yearbook 2021. "The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification, by the end of 2021. These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritizing healthcare workers, then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions," the scientists pointed out. Further doses will then be made available based on a countrys need, vulnerability and Covid-19 threat. The scientists said it is equally important to ensure sustained surveillance, tracing, test and treat. "Vaccines will help us achieve herd immunity but, until then we need to keep practicing the non-pharmacological measures to prevent infection and spread," said Dr Swaminathan and Dr Kuganantham. "What is clear is that the virus has a foothold in most parts of the world, and transmission increases as soon as public health control measures are relaxed. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing and mask-wearing will reduce spread and, ideally, keep infection and death rates down," they observed. Quoting the global health security index published last year, they said no country is prepared to handle an epidemic or a pandemic. It concluded that most countries lack foundational health systems capacities vital for epidemic and pandemic response. With regard to reopening of schools, the scientists said schools operate not in isolation but within the community. Thus, anything that affects the community affects the schools too. Data shows that even though the schools have moved online, around 463 million children across the world have no access to remote schooling, the article said adding that education of one-third of the world's children has been affected and one in four countries presently do not have a reopening date for their schools. "This has devastating outcomes that can affect the children for a lifetime. They will be more exposed to physical and emotional violence, more prone to be pushed to child labour, suffer sexual abuse and further intensify the cycle of poverty. We need the decision-makers to closely check the factors and ensure a safe environment for the children," they stressed. Observing that there are many lessons from the pandemic that can be learnt to adapt and prepare for the future,the experts said, "This pandemic will come to an end, but the world needs to work together to ensure that we are better prepared next time. It is only through science and solidarity that solutions will be found."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speedy-distribution-of-vaccine-a-major-challenge-for-global-govts-who-experts-101610390830266.html
