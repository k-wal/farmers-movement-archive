The NHS is under severe strain and we must take action to protect it, both so our doctors and nurses can continue to save lives and so they can vaccinate as many people as possible as quickly as we can.”Labour leader Keir Starmer on Sunday reflected the concerns of experts when he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the current curbs may not be strong enough to contain the virus and its variant that have spread exponentially since the norms were eased for Christmas.The National Crime Agency issued a caution on vaccine scams that include people receiving text messages that seem genuine with NHS logo, informing recipients that they are eligible for the vaccine, and asking to click on a link, which seeks personal details and payment. In one case, a scamster injected a 92-year-old woman and charged her £160, with no details of what she was injected with. The vaccines are being administered free according to a priority list of groups of people considered most at risk. So far nearly 2 million people have received shots, including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, who are in the most vulnerable group due to their age.Graeme Biggar of the National Crime Agency said: “The current level of reported fraud in relation to the vaccine remains very low but is increasing. The advice is very simple. The vaccine is only available on the NHS, and you will never be asked to pay for it or to provide your bank details. Anything that suggests otherwise is a fraud.”Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez added: “I am sad to say that throughout the pandemic, we have seen fraudsters adapt their methods to take advantage of Covid support schemes and exploit the fears of vulnerable people when they feel at their most anxious”. “This latest scam, which plays on people’s hopes for a vaccine, is one of the most callous and despicable so far, which is why we want to arm everyone with the knowledge that the NHS will never ask for cash or financial details to pay for the vaccine or verify a patient’s identity,” she added.According to Chand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association, over 40,000 ailing medical professionals are on leave, while there has been no new recruitment, forcing hospitals to deal with increasing caseloads with lesser number of staff.Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said: “Hospitals are always busy in the winter but the NHS in some parts of the country is currently facing the most dangerous situation anyone can remember. If the virus continues on its current trajectory many hospitals will be in real difficulties, and very soon…There will be avoidable deaths”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-scams-medical-staff-shortage-hit-uk-toll-over-80000-101610302230418.html

I was shoved in. I didn't mean to be in there. Hell, I was looking for the bathroom," said Barnett.He added though that he had every right to be in Pelosi's office."My desk. I'm a taxpayer. I'm a patriot. It ain't her desk. We loaned her that desk."Before leaving, Barnett stole an envelope and left Pelosi a note calling her a "bitch," he told KFSM 5News.QAnon 'digital soldier'Shirtless, sporting face paint and a fur hat complete with buffalo horns, Jake Angeli is a prominent supporter of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory.He describes himself as a "digital soldier" of the movement that claims Trump is waging a secret war against a global liberal cult of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.The 33-year-old Angeli presented himself as a "shamanist and consultant for the Trump supporters" when he was photographed by AFP at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona in November. He was wearing his headdress then too."We're patriots on the front lines in Arizona who wish to take our positive energy to DC," he wrote on the ultra-conservative social network Parler in December.Social media users noted similarities between Angeli's look and that of 1990s Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay, forcing the jazz-funk performer to assure fans that he wasn't in Washington on Wednesday.Read | US Capitol violence: What crimes can the rioters be charged with?Military veteranAshli Babbitt was named by police as the woman shot at close range by a police officer as she tried to climb through a broken window in the hallway of Congress.The 35-year-old from San Diego later died from her injuries.

10-01-2021||World||Man who sat at Nancy Pelosi aide's desk during Capitol riots faces charges||A West Virginia state lawmaker and a man pictured sitting at an aide's desk in US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office are among those facing federal charges stemming from the siege on the US Capitol by President Donald Trump's supporters, federal prosecutors said on Friday.In a related development, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen announced the FBI would team up with Washington's police department to jointly investigate the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was injured while defending the US Capitol on Wednesday."Just because you've left the D.C. region, you can still expect a knock on the door if we find out you were part of the criminal activity at the Capitol," Steven D'antuono, the FBI Washington Field Office's assistant director in charge, told reporters in a telephone news briefing.The Justice Department on Friday released details on 13 defendants who were charged in the US District Court for the District of Columbia for their roles in connection with the Capitol riots.They included Cleveland Meredith, who was charged with threatening Pelosi as well as possession of an unregistered firearm and unregistered ammunition, and Richard Barnett, the Gravette, Arkansas, man who was photographed sitting at Pelosi's desk and is also known as Bigo."The shocking images of Mr. Barnett with his boots up on a desk in the speaker of the House’s office on Wednesday was repulsive,” Rosen said in a statement. "Those who are proven to have committed criminal acts during the storming of the Capitol will face justice."Prosecutors also charged Nick Ochs, a prominent member of the Proud Boys, with being in the Capitol unlawfully, based in large part on a photo he posted on Twitter of himself smoking a cigarette in the Capitol along with the caption "Hello from the Capital lol."Among others facing charges were Lonnie Coffman of Falkville, Alabama - whose truck parked near the Capitol and inspected by police contained 11 Molotov cocktails as well as firearms - and Mark Leffingwell, who is accused of assaulting a police officer.Ken Kohl, a prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office, told reporters in the news briefing that West Virginia Delegate Derrick Evans also faces criminal charges after he apparently "recorded himself storming the Capitol."John Bryan, an attorney for Evans, said in a statement that his client is "an independent activist and journalist" who was exercising his First Amendment rights to peacefully protest and ﬁlm a historic and dynamic event" and did not engage in violence.Leffingwell and Meredith both made virtual court appearances in Washington, D.C. on Friday evening. Several others appeared in federal court in other states.Leffingwell's wife Julie told the judge her husband works at a packaging plant in Seattle, and his lawyer said his client is a disabled veteran who suffered a traumatic brain injury while he was serving in Iraq.Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey released Leffingwell from custody but ordered him not to possess any firearms and to report to pretrial services on a weekly basis.Meredith, 52, told the judge he is unemployed after selling his business in 2019.The judge ordered he must remain in custody, pending a hearing on Jan. 13.In addition to the 13 people facing criminal charges in US District Court, another 40 people were facing lesser charges in the District of Columbia Superior Court, a local venue.Many of those individuals were arraigned on Thursday and released, with an order from the judge not to return to Washington unless it is for court appearances or meetings with their attorneys.D'antuono on Friday declined to characterize the probe of Sicknick's death as a homicide investigation during the briefing, saying the circumstances were still being reviewed."We're not going to go into it at this point because it's an active investigation," he said.Capitol Police confirmed late on Thursday evening that Sicknick had died after suffering injuries while on duty at the US Capitol during the riot.After being injured by protesters, the officer returned to his office where he collapsed. He died at a hospital.Capitol Police have said the Washington police's homicide unit was probing the death.Pelosi on Friday ordered flags at the Capitol lowered to half-staff in honor of Sicknick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-who-sat-at-nancy-pelosi-aide-s-desk-during-capitol-riots-faces-charges-101610294868458.html

Earlier, the government resorted to arrest and travel restrictions on its leaders and supporters. But, under Imran Khan's government, the PTM protestors are killed. There are instances of forced disappearances too.Read more: 'Finally Imran Khan introduces night mode': Pak Twitterati on massive blackout"PTM is struggling for the missing persons, for the human rights of Pashtun peoples, they are being oppressed, and they are victims of terrorism," said another demonstrator.He also advised to put sanctions against Pakistan for promoting proxy terrorism, "Sanctions should be imposed on Pakistan, and then only Pakistan can learn it. If America stops giving money, then they can learn it"."We urge Pakistan to instead of sponsoring in proxy terrorism, invest in your people, they need food, your people need food", added another protestor.He called Pakistan a "shrewd" and "thug" country that blackmails America as well as everyone.In response to recent happenings in Pakistan, he said, "because of sponsoring proxy terrorism in Kashmir, they lost Kashmir, now they will lose the other side of Kashmir as well".Read more: Global terrorist Masood Azhar is finally a wanted man in Pak.

10-01-2021||World||US intelligence agencies have less than 6 months to reveal details on UFOs||A unique 180-day countdown for US intelligence agencies started in December when President Donald Trump signed a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government spending bill into law. The Intelligence Authorisation Act for Fiscal Year 2021 was a part of the spending bill under which the Senate intelligence committee directed the intelligence agencies to submit a report on “unidentified aerial phenomena” within 180 days.The Senate intelligence committee's directive came into force months after the department of defence released three declassified videos that showed US Navy pilots encountering what appears to be unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Following the declassification of videos, the US Navy released seven incident reports in May 2020 on the series of encounters between Navy pilots and “unidentified aerial phenomena”.According to the first incident report, a white-coloured aircraft was spotted in 2013 which was approximately the size and shape of a “drone or missile” and left a visible exhaust trail. Another report from 2014 detailed the encounter in which the aircraft appeared to be “approximately the size of a suitcase”, and was silver in colour. The report highlighted that the pilot was able to pass within 1,000 feet of the unknown aircraft but couldn’t identify it.Read | Mysterious monolith found in US Desert draws wild theories about aliens, UFOsA former senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, had then hailed the declassification of videos and called on the authorities to take a serious look at any potential national security implications. Taking to Twitter, Reid said that that the footage only “scratches the surface of research and materials available”. The director of National Intelligence and the secretary of defence now have less than six months to tell the Congressional intelligence and armed services committees what they know about UFOs.According to the Senate intelligence committee's directive, the report must contain detailed analyses of UFO data as well as intel inputs from the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The committee has directed the federal agencies to identify potential national security threats posed by UFOs and to assess the possibility of an adversary nation behind such activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-agencies-have-less-than-6-months-to-reveal-details-on-ufos-101610293547600.html

Al Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, also has celebrated their development.“I will take it not only for what I hope will be the good of my own health, but for others as well,” he said on his website.The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which says fighting abortion is its “preeminent” priority, said last month that getting vaccinated against the coronavirus “ought to be understood as an act of charity toward the other members of our community,” according to a statement by the chairmen of its Committee on Doctrine and Committee on Pro-Life Activities.The bishops said it is morally acceptable for Catholics to use either of the two vaccines approved for use in the US — made by Pfizer and Moderna — despite a “remote connection to morally compromised cell lines.” This entailed the use of fetal cell lines for lab tests seeking to confirm the vaccines' effectiveness.Another leading vaccine, made by AstraZeneca and approved for use in Britain and some other countries, is “more morally compromised,” and should be avoided if there are alternatives available, the bishops said.Coinciding with the USCCB, four bishops in Colorado issued their own statement taking a somewhat more negative stance on AstraZeneca, describing it as “not a morally valid option.”AstraZeneca used a cell line known as HEK293 to develop its vaccine. According to the Oxford University team that developed it, the original HEK293 cells were taken from the kidney of an aborted fetus in 1973, but the cells used now are clones of the original cells and are not the original fetal tissue.As the first vaccines neared approval last year, some Catholic bishops warned they might be morally unacceptable. Among them was Bishop Joseph Brennan of Fresno, California, who urged Catholics not to jump on the “vaccine bandwagon.”He later modified his stance, saying that due to health risks for individuals and communities, “Catholics may ethically decide for serious reasons to utilize such vaccines.”Also questioning the vaccines was Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas, who has depicted any use of aborted fetuses in vaccine development as evil and says he won’t take any of the currently available vaccines.“The Church has said that under some circumstances receiving the vaccine is permissible and I do not dispute that,” he said via email. “The Church has also said we should vigorously call for morally produced vaccines, and I urge those who take the vaccine to join that mission and demand change.”Strickland is encouraging donations to the John Paul II Medical Research Institute, which supports research aimed at developing what it calls “ethical” cell lines — using adults’ stem cells — that would be used in the manufacturing of vaccines and other medical therapies.Some other outspokenly anti-abortion bishops have embraced the vaccines.“As a Christian engages the world, it’s impossible, in many settings, to completely avoid cooperating with moral evil,” tweeted Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence, Rhode Island. “The Church, on multiple levels, has said that it’s morally acceptable to receive the vaccines that are currently available. I agree.”Bishop Richard Stika of Knoxville, Tennessee, said he had no qualms about getting vaccinated.“I just hope they don’t implant a microchip in my arm to ascertain when I cheat on my diet,” he joked on Twitter.Among Protestant evangelical leaders, who generally have strong anti-abortion views, there’s been relatively little anti-vaccine rhetoric, according to the Rev. Russell Moore, who heads the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention.“I wouldn’t be able to think of one evangelical pastor who’s saying, ‘Don’t be vaccinated,’” he said.A more notable challenge for pastors, Moore said, is countering baseless anti-vaccine conspiracy theories embraced by some members of their congregations or communities — for example that the vaccines would alter a recipient’s DNA or covertly implant a microchip.On a global level, the Vatican has issued guidelines largely similar to those from the US bishops, declaring it morally acceptable for Catholics to receive Covid-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.One difference: It didn’t name or give details about specific vaccines. The Vatican plans to use the Pfizer vaccine starting this week for employees and their families, and Pope Francis — in an interview with an Italian broadcaster being aired this weekend — said he has an appointment to be vaccinated.The Vatican has suggested it is wrong to refuse a vaccine based solely on the abortion objection, since refusal "may also result in a risk to others.”Nicanor Austriaco, a molecular biologist and Catholic priest who teaches at universities in the US and the Philippines, said the Vatican has appropriately addressed faith-based concerns about vaccines indirectly connected to research that used aborted fetal cells.“The moral evil being contemplated here” took place in the 1970s when the original cell line was created, Austriaco said, “and it is remote.”G. Kevin Donovan, a pediatrics professor at Georgetown University who directs its Pellegrino Center for Clinical Bioethics, said leaders of his Catholic faith couldn’t have been “more clear-cut.”“The advantage Catholics have is … the highest levels of authority have made it very clear this is a morally acceptable thing to do,” said Donovan.In Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, a Muslim clerical council has been included in that nation's vaccine procurement process to ensure that a product is halal, or acceptable for use under Islamic law. In the past, the council has ruled that some vaccines for other diseases were unacceptable because they used pork-derived gelatin.But on Friday the council gave its approval to China’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, paving the way for its distribution in Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiabortion-faith-leaders-support-use-of-covid-19-vaccines-101610288090658.html
10-01-2021||World||Explained: Why is Indonesia prone to plane crashes||Saturday's plane crash in Indonesia, in which a Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, has once again cast the limelight on the safety of the country's aviation industry.Indonesia's aviation record is one of the worst in Asia, with more civilian airliner passenger accidents since 1945 than any other country in the region. Past accidents have been attributed to poor pilot training, mechanical failures, air traffic control issues and poor aircraft maintenance.While experts say there have been many improvements in recent years, the latest crash has experts questioning the true progress of Indonesia's aviation oversight and regulation.Why has Indonesia had so many plane crashes?It's due to a combination of economic, social and geographical factors.In the early years of Indonesia’s aviation boom, after the fall of Suharto in the late 1990s opened the economy following decades of dictatorships, there was little regulation or oversight of the industry.Low-cost air carriers including Lion Air — which saw one of its planes crash in 2018, killing 189 people — flooded the market, enabling flying to become a common way for many to travel across the vast archipelago nation, which has many areas that still lack efficient or safe transportation infrastructure.According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Indonesia has had 104 civilian airliner accidents with over 1,300 related fatalities since 1945, ranking it as the most dangerous place to fly in Asia.The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country from 2007 to 2016 because they were “deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping or inspection procedures.” The European Union had a similar ban from 2007 until 2018.Have things improved?Yes, they have.“Engagement with the industry has significantly improved and oversight has become more rigorous,” aviation expert and editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com Geoffrey Thomas told The Associated Press.That includes more frequent inspections, stronger regulation of maintenance facilities and procedures, and better pilot training, he said.The US Federal Aviation Administration granted Indonesia a Category 1 rating in 2016, meaning it determined that the country complied with International Civil Aviation Organization safety standards.Why did the latest crash happen?It’s too soon to tell. Experts said there could be several reasons, including human error, the plane’s condition and poor weather in Jakarta, where the plane departed from.Fishermen in the vicinity of the crash said they heard an explosion, followed by debris and fuel surrounding their boat. But heavy rain impaired their vision and they were unable to see much more.Sriwijaya Air has had only minor incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when one of its planes went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue.The airline's president director, Jefferson Irwin Jauwena, said the plane that crashed, which was 26 years old and previously used by airlines in the United States, was airworthy. He told reporters that the plane had previously flown on the same day.But experts said an investigation is needed to determine whether the plane was in fact fit to fly.When will we know more?Officials said they located the wreckage site and the plane's black boxes on Sunday. Authorities are currently working to retrieve the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the sea. Materials pulled from water, including the black boxes, could provide some insight into what happened.But the investigation could take weeks, likely months, said Indonesian aviation consultant Gerry Soejatman.Indonesia is expected to lead the investigation, with international observers typically welcomed as well. There should be an interim report from Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee within a month, Soejatman said.“The analysis will start with that report," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-is-indonesia-prone-to-plane-crashes-101610286049379.html
10-01-2021||World||'Open-door policy': Biden's Cabinet picks shed light on how he plans to govern||Joe Biden promised that his presidency would mean a return to normalcy. His Cabinet picks help demonstrate how he plans to deliver.The president-elect announced his final nominees this past week, completing a diverse team of two dozen people. He noted Friday that this will be the “first Cabinet ever” to reach gender parity and include a majority of people of colour, notable given earlier concerns that he was leaning largely on white men.Some nominees have decades of experience in their respective agencies. Many held prominent roles in the Obama administration. Many have already begun meeting with interest groups and advocacy organizations, and his transition team has had what’s been described as an “open-door policy” toward advocacy groups for months.It’s a sharp contrast to President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, which was dominated largely by white men with little experience in Washington. Biden’s aides say that was one of the goals he set in filling out his Cabinet: to signal that his presidency means a return to competent, stable leadership government.That's especially important, Democrats say, as the pandemic and economic turmoil rage and the country navigates through the aftermath of last week's violent insurrection at the US Capitol.“Joe Biden is taking office under the most challenging circumstances in a century,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama White House senior adviser. “There is no time for on the job training. He needs people who can hit the ground running because what happens in the first six months of his presidency will likely determine the trajectory of all four years.”Biden's Cabinet is unlikely to be in place when he assumes the presidency on Jan. 20. The Senate, which must confirm the nominees, hasn't scheduled hearings for many of the picks. One exception is Lloyd Austin, Biden's nominee for defense secretary, who is expected to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Jan. 19.Some nominees faced early questions about their confirmation prospects, particularly Neera Tanden, Biden's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Tanden has angered Republicans with her outspoken criticism of them on Twitter.But the confirmation process for many of the nominees may be smoother after Democrats picked up two Senate seats in Georgia last week, leaving the chamber evenly divided. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be the tie-breaking vote, giving Democrats the edge.Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said that the president-elect is "working in good faith with both parties in Congress toward swift confirmation because with so much at stake, with our national security on the line and lives and jobs being lost every day, our nation cannot afford to waste any time.”But many nominees may face unprecedented levels of scrutiny as they work to dig their departments out of both the erosion in public trust in government and an erosion of morale from within. Many department budgets and staff were gutted during the Trump administration.That hollowing out is part of why it’s so important for Biden to choose seasoned veterans for his Cabinet, according to Eric Schultz, a former senior White House adviser.“One of the problems that Biden faces that Obama did not in 2009 is how the Trump administration has treated federal agencies and departments,” he said. “Rebuilding — just, operationally — these agencies, to get that back up and running, is going to take a lot of work. So it wouldn’t make sense to put in a bunch of newbies.”They’ll also have to navigate demands from progressives looking for major changes from leaders at agencies ranging from the Department of Homeland Security to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department. Many of them will be on the front lines of addressing a pandemic that’s killed more than 371,000 people in the United States, while taking action on the issues of race and inequality and climate change that have prompted national movements for change in recent years.To get ahead of those problems, Biden's transition team has spent months meeting with trade, advocacy and interest groups across Washington and beyond, looking to re-establish relationships that had atrophied during the Trump administration. Now that his team has been named, his nominees have begun their own meetings with key groups as they prepare to take office.Some meetings are aimed at assuaging concerns among critics, such as when Tom Vilsack, Biden’s pick for agriculture secretary, met with Black farm advocates. Vilsack has faced questions about what critics say was his failure to address discrimination against Black farmers within the agency while he was Obama's agriculture chief.But still others have included representatives from areas not typically seen as pet Democratic constituencies. Three of Biden’s top picks for health adviser positions met with interfaith leaders on Thursday, and the next day Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's pick at Homeland Security, met with 20 leaders who share his Jewish faith.The Rev. Gabriel Salguero, a Florida-based pastor who founded the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, said the Biden transition has made a “very robust and very intentional” effort to build relationships with faith leaders. Salguero recalled other faith-specific calls with Susan Rice, chosen as Biden’s domestic policy adviser, and Tanden.While Salguero recalled meetings with the Trump administration on key issues, he said the Biden transition team’s outreach already has gone further.Even those groups that may be more aligned with Trump and Republicans on their issues are already pleased with Biden's approach to governing. Democratic lobbyist Steve Elmendorf said that the reaction from his business clients and other Washington lobbyists has been, he said, “very positive” because “business likes certainly.”“Business likes a plan,” Elmendorf said. “And while some of the outcomes under Donald Trump, people liked, they really didn’t like the government by tweet and Fox News.”Even those who don’t agree with all of Biden’s policies, Elmendorf said, are relieved at the return to normal working order because “they believe that there will be a process that is know, and is transparent, and where stakeholders will have an opportunity to make their views known."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opendoor-policy-biden-s-cabinet-picks-shed-light-on-how-he-plans-to-govern-101610286841740.html
10-01-2021||World||Daily low flying Israeli jets over Lebanon spread jitters||Israeli military jets carried out several low flying flights over Beirut as reconnaissance drones also buzzed overhead Sunday in what has become a daily occurrence.Israel regularly violates Lebanon airspace, often to carry out strikes in neighboring Syria. On Christmas Eve, Israeli jets flew low late into the night, terrorizing Beirut residents who are no strangers to such flights. They were followed by reported Israeli strikes in Syria.The frequency of low flying warplanes over the capital has intensified in the last two weeks, making residents jittery as tensions run high in the region on the final days of President Donald Trump's administration.Israel rarely comments on these reports.Many fear conflict may erupt in the area before Trump leaves office in retaliation for the US killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq last year, or to scuttle efforts by the incoming administration of Joe Biden to negotiate with Iran.On Friday, the Lebanese army recorded an Israeli flight that lasted nearly six hours in the country’s south.A Twitter account that tracks aircraft movement in the Middle East, #Intel_Sky, has recorded dozens of Israeli jets flying over Lebanon, including mock raids, since the start of the year. #Intel_Sky called Sunday's flights “mock raids.”At one point this summer, the Lebanese army said Israel violated its airspace nearly 30 times in two days, flying reconnaissance drones and jets into Lebanese territory.The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon says Israel enters Lebanese airspace on a daily basis in violation of U.N. resolutions and the country’s sovereignty.Between June and October 2020, UNIFIL recorded a daily average of 12.63 airspace violations, totaling 61 hours and 51 minutes in flight time, a significant increase from the previous four months. Drones accounted for approximately 95% of the violations, UNIFIL said.Israel and Lebanon are technically at war.

10-01-2021||World||'Encouraged violence': Trump legacy on race shadowed by divisive rhetoric||President Donald Trump repeatedly claimed in the final months of his presidency — and without a trace of irony — to have done more for Black Americans than anyone with the “possible exception” of Abraham Lincoln.He boasted that the African American unemployment rate dropped to record lows under his watch before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the economy. Trump heralded his administration’s criminal justice overhaul for shortening mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and leading to the release of thousands of incarcerated people, mostly Black Americans. Trump also relished that he increased funding for historically black colleges and universities.But in the end, historians say Trump’s legacy — and his electoral undoing — will be largely shaped by rhetoric aimed at stirring significant swaths of his white base that tugged at the long-frayed strands of race relations in America.His strategy of divisiveness was on display this past week as he urged supporters, mostly white men, to descend on the US Capitol in the name of his baseless claims of election fraud.After the pro-Trump mob stormed the hallowed halls of Congress, Trump did not immediately condemn the violence. He did not denigrate the rioters as “THUGS” or warn that he was prepared to greet them with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons” as he had threatened largely peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrators after the police killing of George Floyd this year.Instead, his initial response was a series of tepid tweets and video messages in which he asked his violent loyalists to “go home in peace," let them know he felt their “pain" and told them he loved them.Trump was frequently explicit in using race as a cudgel.He claimed without evidence that Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, wasn’t born in the United States, has said Mexican immigrants were “bringing crime” and were “rapists” and argued there were “very fine people on both sides” after violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counterprotester dead.He privately questioned why the United States would accept more immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” in Africa rather than from places such as Norway. Trump even wrote in a tweet that appeared to be intended for a group of then-first-term lawmakers — progressive Democrats and women of color — to “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.”“Since the Black civil rights movement of the mid-20th century, there has been this kind of tacit agreement in the American political conversation that one could appeal to racial animus, but you had to do so in a particular sort of way,” said Eddie Glaude, Jr., chairman of Princeton University’s African American studies program. “Trump made that all explicit again. He brought it to the fore. He mainstreamed certain assumptions about race that were driving our politics anyway.”Human rights activists say that the Capitol siege was the macabre ending of a presidency that embraced white supremacist groups and extremists and fanned the flames of chaos and violence.“This is a moment of reckoning for the United States," said Bob Goodfellow, interim executive director of Amnesty International USA. “President Trump has repeatedly encouraged violence and disorder by his supporters. These are not the actions of a leader, but an instigator.”The New York real estate tycoon rose to the presidency despite his complicated past with his hometown's Black and Latino communities. There was his refusal to apologize for harsh comments in 1989 about five Black and Latino men who as teenagers were wrongly convicted in a jogger's brutal rape in New York City's Central Park. Trump paid for newspaper advertisements back then calling for New York state to adopt the death penalty after the attack.Early in his real estate career, Trump and his father were sued by the Justice Department for violating fair housing laws by discriminating against Black applicants. The Trumps ultimately entered a consent decree but did not admit guilt.Trump's 2016 White House win over Democrat Hillary Clinton was aided by the first decline in Black voter turnout in 20 years. Since his November loss to President-elect Joe Biden, he has made unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in large urban centers such as Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia — all areas with big African American electorates — that proved critical to Trump's defeat.There has been no evidence of the massive fraud or gross error that Trump and his team alleged in scores of lawsuits that judges, whether appointed by Republicans, Democrats or Trump himself, systematically dismissed.Still, the Republican National Committee, in the aftermath of Trump's loss, has tried to cast the Trump era as one in which the GOP loosened the Democratic grip on Black voters."Because of his leadership we have changed the political map forever and Republicans have a road map on how to be competitive and victorious in nontraditional communities,” RNC spokesman Paris Dennard said in a statement.The Rev. Marshall Hatch, a civil rights activist in Chicago, said that Trump’s defeat at the polls brought a moment of relief.But Hatch said his joy quickly was eclipsed by the recognition that some 74 million Americans were OK voting for Trump even though he repeatedly has played down white supremacy, vilified women of color and tried to diminish the issue of racial injustice in American policing.Hatch leads the New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago’s West Garfield Park neighborhood that still has scars from the riots that followed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination more than 50 years ago. The predominantly Black neighborhood has been disproportionately affected by the toll of the coronavirus pandemic.The areas surrounding the church have among the highest infection rates in the state. Hatch's church community has lost several congregants — including his older sister, Rhoda Jean Hatch — to the virus.“If these were disproportionately white people dying, it is hard to see Trump or the nation reacting the way it has in the political context,” Hatch said. “It is hard to reconcile that there are some 74 million Americans — and a majority of white people — who thought Donald Trump still deserved a second term.”A few miles down the road on Chicago's West Side, Hatch's friend and fellow activist, the Rev. Ira Acree, said he fell into a depression early in the summer as the mood darkened in Black neighborhoods like his own after the Memorial Day police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Acree, who was recovering at home after being diagnosed with Covid-19, recalled watching on television as law enforcement officers used tear gas and riot control tactics to clear protesters from near the White House moments before Trump strode across Lafayette Square for a photo op in front of the church that had been damaged during unrest the night before.Acree's concerns grew months later after Trump refused to condemn the far-right extremist group, the Proud Boys, during a presidential debate.Acree said he was trying to remain optimistic that Trump's defeat marked a turning point for race relations, but then the riot at the Capitol dashed much of that hope.“I'm worried that this may be only the beginning,” Acree said. “It's going to blow up if our better selves don't rise up and say enough is enough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encouraged-violence-trump-legacy-on-race-shadowed-by-divisive-rhetoric-101610286861937.html
10-01-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi urges Democrats to return to DC amid Trump's impeachment calls||US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her Democratic colleagues in the lower chamber to prepare to return to Washington this week amid talks of impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time over his role in inciting the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday.According to The Hill, in a "Dear Colleague" letter sent to Democratic members on Saturday, Pelosi wrote: "We will be proceeding with meetings with Members and Constitutional experts and others. I continue to welcome your comments. I urge you to be prepared to return to Washington this week."The letter comes as the lower chamber Democrats "appear poised" to impeach Trump over his role in inciting Wednesday's attack on the Capitol -- as members of both the Senate and the House were certifying Joe Biden's electoral college win in the Presidential election -- which saw a mob of his supporters damaging windows, vandalizing congressional offices and even accessing the chambers.Five people died in the attacks, including 42-year-old Capitol Hill Police Officer Brian Sicknick.Pelosi stated in the letter that lawmakers have taken an oath of office to defend democracy."For that reason, it is absolutely essential that those who perpetrated the assault on our democracy be held accountable. There must be a recognition that this desecration was instigated by the President," she wrote."From what I have heard from Members and from the deluge that I have received from the public, it is clear that, once again, the 'Times Have Found Us' to save our democracy," the House speaker concluded.The Hill reported that Democrats and some Republicans had previously voiced support of vice president Mike Pence and other Cabinet members invoking the 25th amendment to remove Trump out of fear he could incite more violence in the remaining days of his presidency.The Speaker previously threatened impeachment if Pence did not invoke the 25th amendment, a move that the vice president reportedly opposes, according to sources in talks with the White House.Pelosi said on Friday night that if Trump does not resign she has directed the Rules Committee to quickly take up a motion to impeach Trump as well as legislation to create a commission that can declare that the President is "unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office."Chaotic and violent scenes erupted at the Capitol on Wednesday as Trump supporters stormed the building to protest the Electoral College vote, forcing a lockdown and confrontations with the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-urges-democrats-to-return-to-dc-amid-trump-s-impeachment-calls-101610284616822.html
10-01-2021||World||China recovering fast ahead of most big economies, says IMF||China is recovering fast ahead of most large economies, but the recovery is still unbalanced and facing significant downside risks, the IMF has said, projecting an eight per cent growth rate for the world’s second-largest economy in 2021.However, the main concern around the Chinese recovery that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has is the lack of balance, said Hlge Berger, Mission Chief for China and Assistant Director, Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF.The recovery is still relying mostly on public support. Private investment has strengthened recently, but consumption is lagging. Growth rates and consumption recently have been higher, but the level of consumption compared to its pre-crisis trend is still rather low, he told reporters during a conference call on Saturday on the publication of the 2020 China Article IV Staff Report.“China is recovering fast ahead of most large economies, but the recovery is still unbalanced and facing significant downside risks. We are seeing growth at around 2 per cent in 2020 and around 8 per cent in 2021. December numbers have been surprising on the upside, so there are some upside risks to that forecast,” said Berger.On the other hand, he said that there are significant downside risks. Domestically, there is a pandemic risk that is still around. Also, the external environment has generally become a little bit more difficult for China and its economic relations with other countries.“This is a large reason for the fact that we think that there's still an output gap this year of 1.8 per cent. That's the difference between what the economy potentially can have in terms of GDP and what we are actually expecting in terms of demand. So that's where this lack of balance comes in, and this has important implications for the way macro policies should be conducted,” Berger said.In the short term, he said, the IMF does not withdraw macroeconomic policy support prematurely in China. And this is the advice that other countries are getting from the IMF, so this is a bit of a global concern, but it applies to China as well.“The second implication of our analysis of the outlook and the risks around it is that we need to make sure that we adjust the composition of macroeconomic support away from investment towards household support. This will directly help consumption. This has implications, of course, for our policies to strengthen the social safety net,” Berger said.Noting that structural reforms have been progressing despite the pandemic which is quite an achievement in China, Berger said that this reform effort has been predominately in the area of opening financial services to the outside world, and less so in the real sector. Real sector reforms, however, are important, he said.While productivity has increased in the past, the levels for the productivity in China are still relatively low compared to the global frontier, he said. Aerage productivity across all sectors is around 30 per cent of the global frontier.The external environment has become a bit difficult in recent years and if that stays like this, it will be harder to tap into external productivity improvements through normal means of trade and FDI, he said.China, Berger said, can also help others to overcome the challenges from the crisis.“There we note the very helpful engagement of China to providing debt relief for low-income countries,” he added.China is the world's second largest economy behind the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-recovering-fast-ahead-of-most-big-economies-says-imf-101610283090031.html

10-01-2021||World||End in sight? Israel rolls out Covid booster shots||Israel's coronavirus vaccination campaign, the world's fastest per capita, shifted to booster shots on Sunday in a bid to protect the most vulnerable citizens by next month and ease curbs on the economy.Israelis over the age of 60, those with health problems and medical personnel have been receiving first injections of Pfizer Inc. vaccines since Dec 19. As three weeks have passed, they are beginning to be due for follow-up, final doses."It changes everything," said Guy Choshen, a director of the Covid-19 ward at Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, who got his second injection. "I'm really happy that I'm over that (and) looking forward for all this epidemic to be finished."The Health Ministry said 19.5% of the population have been vaccinated, including more than 72% of the over-60s. Latecomer elderly will be admitted for first shots, officials say, but otherwise vaccines will be reserved for boosters.Israel's vaccination rate is by far the fastest compared to the rest of the world, according to the Our World in Data website, which is run by research organisation Oxford Martin School.In second place is the United Arab Emirates, which as of Sunday had inoculated 10% of its population, followed by Bahrain and the United States at 5% and 2%, respectively.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said vaccinating vulnerable cohorts will allow Israel to emerge from the pandemic in February. He is up for reelection in March.Israel has in parallel tightened a lockdown to rein in a surge in coronavirus cases. Officials say public over-confidence in the vaccines may have led to laxity in other precautions and stoked fresh contagions. Hospitals worry about being overwhelmed by patients and personnel being more exposed."We have quite a rise in the numbers of medical staff which are infected in the last 10 days - an extreme increase - and we are afraid that we'll be short of people," Chosen said.A week after the booster, each recipient will be issued with a Health Ministry vaccination certificate providing exemption from quarantine, officials say.Israel last week received an initial shipment of Moderna Inc vaccines which Netanyahu said would be administered at home to those who cannot come to clinics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-in-sight-israel-rolls-out-covid-booster-shots-101610283080714.html
10-01-2021||World||Scarce doses and empty vaccination centres: Germany's vaccine rollout headache||Proud of their national reputation for efficiency, Germans are growing increasingly frustrated by the slow rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine its scientists helped develop.Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by US-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people.Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said.But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes.A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is.The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home.Read more: Germany records more than 1,100 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours as concerns over mutated strain risesThere they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination.The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use.The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration."We've been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough," she told Reuters TV.In the first two weeks of its vaccination drive Germany has given 533,000 shots, just two-fifths of the 1.3 million doses received. Britain, by contrast, has reached the 2 million mark.Read more: Germany set for longer lockdown as death figures spikeIsrael, the world leader in terms of the share of population covered, is inoculating 150,000 people daily, with its universal and digitally enabled healthcare system making it easier to schedule appointments.Germany's larger size and federal set-up are complicating operations, a problem also faced in the United States.Elsewhere in Europe, the decentralisation of Spain's vaccination operation has exposed differences between regions and led to tensions with the central government.Germany's 16 states blame the federal government for not securing enough doses. Doctors in some centres say shifts have been cancelled. In Berlin, one vaccination centre was opened, only to be closed over New Year due to a lack of shots.Spahn says manufacturing problems rather than too few orders are to blame for the limited supply, after Pfizer and BioNTech in December halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots..The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said. BioNTech's chief executive said last week the Marburg plant may enter service in February, ahead of schedule."With the capacity we have already created in Germany, we will be able to carry out between 250,000 and 300,000 vaccinations per day - when we have the vaccine doses," Spahn said this week.Germany expects to receive 5.3 million shots from Pfizer/BioNTech by mid-February and another 2 million doses of a second vaccine from Moderna, just approved by the European Union, by the end of March.Yet this will barely be enough to cover the 5.7 million people, or 6.8% of the population, aged over 80.Read more: Germany urges patience with Covid vaccine rollout under fireThe Last MileAs in Spain, state-by-state performance in Germany varies widely. Top of the class is Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north, with 15.6 vaccinations per 1,000 residents, while Saxony has a rate of just 4.4.In Thuringia, another laggard, state premier Bodo Ramelow said on Tuesday that many doses sent to hospitals had been returned. "If the brakes come on at a vaccination rate of 30 or 33%, we have a real problem," he told Deutschlandfunk radio.In Saxony, the social affairs ministry said missing consent forms, challenges with route planning, Covid outbreaks in homes and last-minute cancellations had slowed its rollout.Shots in Saxony were stored centrally until recently, meaning mobile teams had to drive long distances before heading to care homes.In contrast to Dillenburg, Saxony has been overrun by people volunteering for its vaccination drive, said Lars Werthmann, regional logistics chief at the German Red Cross."The next mammoth task is to coordinate all these people,” Werthmann said.Doctors meanwhile express frustration at appointment booking systems that vary from state to state, saying they cause confusion and erode trust.To speed up the rollout of Covid-19 shots, Germany should distribute them through its network of family doctors' practices as soon as there is a vaccine that can be easily stored in a fridge, said Berlin paediatrician Burkhard Ruppert.Germany is hoping to administer shots at doctors’ practices in a second phase."Our strength in Germany is this outpatient care system," said Ruppert, who heads a local doctors' association. "We're not a country of large-scale managed systems like the United Kingdom or Israel might be.""We are in a race against a virus," he added. "We will only win if we vaccinate as much and as fast as possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scarce-doses-and-empty-vaccination-centres-germany-s-vaccine-rollout-headache-101610280221135.html

The micro-blogging platform said that the tweet “violated the Twitter rules”, but didn’t provide any further details.The Chinese embassy on Thursday shared an article by state mouthpiece China Daily, saying the minds of Uighur women were “emancipated” and their reproductive health was “promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines.” The tweet drew widespread condemnation and the US envoy on international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, said that he was “appalled and disgusted” by the lies of the Chinese embassy.“Mass detention is not emancipation. Coercive population control is not reproductive health care. Uyghur women deserve to enjoy their religious freedom and unalienable rights with dignity to make their own choices,” tweeted Brownback.Appalled and disgusted at lies of the @ChineseEmbinUS. Mass detention is not emancipation. Coercive population control is not reproductive health care. Uyghur women deserve to enjoy their religious freedom and unalienable rights with dignity to make their own choices.The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy group, had urged Twitter to remove the tweet, accusing the Chinese embassy of openly celebrating its use of forced sterilisations and other forms of torture. CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement that Twitter can help by immediately deleting the “horrific tweet” and ensuring that foreign governments cannot use their platforms to “justify or celebrate crimes against humanity.”Also Read | China signals it won’t stop crackdown in Xinjiang despite international backlashAfter Twitter removed the post, the embassy promoted the same article, originally published by another state-run media Xinhua, with a different caption. Citing a study titled ‘An Analysis Report on Population Change in Xinjiang’, the report claimed that the “natural growth rate” of the population in Xinjiang decreased from 11.4 per 1,000 people in 2017 to 6.13 per 1,000 people in 2018. It attributed the change to the implementation of a “unified family planning policy” and eradication of “religious extremism in the region.”Last year, the Associated Press had reported that Beijing has been taking draconian measures to curb birth rates among Uighurs as a part of the crackdown on China’s Muslim population. German researcher Adrian Zenz, who is known for his studies of the Xinjiang re-education camps, found the kind of decline in the Muslim population “unprecedented” and said that there was a ruthlessness to it.US State Secretary Mike Pompeo had then called on China to immediately stop forced sterilisation and said that the revelations made by Zenz were “sadly consistent” with decades of the Chinese Communist Party practices. “We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices and ask all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses,” the top US diplomat had said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-removes-chinese-embassy-baby-making-machines-tweet-on-uighur-women-101610279468132.html

10-01-2021||World||Chinese state media blast latest Pompeo move on Taiwan||China's state media lashed out at the latest move on Taiwan by the departing Trump administration, accusing US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of “seeking to maliciously inflict a long-lasting scar on China-U.S. ties.”A writer for the official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary Sunday that the lifting of longstanding restrictions on US government contacts with Taiwanese counterparts proves that Pompeo “is only interested in stoking unwarranted confrontations, and has no interest in world peace.”A commentary posted online by CGTN, the English-language channel of state broadcaster CCTV, called Pompeo's announcement “a cowardly act of sabotage" of the next US administration.“The Trump administration, in its continuing efforts to burn the house down before leaving office, has crossed a dangerous red line with China days before incoming President Joe Biden takes office,” the commentary read in part.Biden takes office on Jan. 20.There was no immediate comment from the Chinese government on Pompeo's decision to end State Department restrictions on how US officials can interact with Taiwan, which he said had been implemented to appease the Communist regime in Beijing.“No more,” Pompeo declared in a statement Saturday. “Today I am announcing that I am lifting all of these self-imposed restrictions.”Taiwan is a sensitive issue for China's ruling Communist Party, which considers the self-governing island of 23.6 million people a renegade province that should be brought under its rule.Under the one-China policy, the US recognizes Beijing as the government of China and doesn't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. However, it maintains unofficial contacts including a de facto embassy in Taipei, the capital, and supplies military equipment for the island's defense.Taiwanese leaders welcomed Pompeo's announcement.“We are expressing our gratitude toward the US for speaking out and supporting Taiwan,” Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters. "We also hope to interact actively with each other further, so that Taiwan could have an even bigger space in the international society.”He and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, who thanked Pompeo on Twitter, emphasized the values of freedom and democracy shared by Taiwan and the US — a contrast to China’s authoritarian one-party state.Pompeo's announcement came two days after he said he would send Kelly Craft, the US ambassador to the United Nations, to Taiwan for meetings this week. She is due to arrive on Wednesday.Craft's trip follows one by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar in August, the first Cabinet member to visit Taiwan since 2014, and another by Under Secretary of State Keith Krach in September.China, which opposes Taiwan having its own foreign relations, sharply criticizes all such interaction. It stepped up aerial patrols off Taiwan last year and used its diplomatic clout to block Taiwan from participating in international forums, such as the World Health Organization's annual meeting.Hu Xijin, the editor of China's state-owned Global Times newspaper, tweeted that if Pompeo's announcement is the new starting point for America's Taiwan policy, it will also mark the start of the countdown for the survival of Taiwan's government.“(China's) fighter jets can fly over Taiwan island anytime,” he tweeted. “The option of using military means to solve (the) Taiwan question will also be put on the table.”Pompeo said that the US maintains relationships with unofficial partners around the world, and that Taiwan is no exception.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-state-media-blast-latest-pompeo-move-on-taiwan-101610279591117.html

The poll of 1,028 people conducted Thursday and Friday found that 63% doubted the handling of the inoculation effort.Macron and Prime Minister Jean Castex have come under criticism for the slow start to vaccinations since they began Dec. 27. Government officials vowed to speed up the process and said Saturday that 100,000 people will have been vaccinated by the end of the weekend.“We want to go quickly; we wanted first to do things safely, and to be serious,” Castex said Saturday in televised remarks to reporters during a visit to a vaccination center in Tarbes, southwest France.Read more: Moderna vaccine set to arrive in France as country steps up anti-Covid driveFrance reported 20,177 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, while the number of deaths increased by 171 to 67,599, according to statistics from the national health agency. While the government has been aiming to bring the number of daily new cases to below 5,000, there has been around four times that number on most days in January, prompting officials to put more of the nation under an earlier curfew.The virus is circulating at an elevated level, with an average of 18,000 new cases daily, Health Minister Olivier Veran said Sunday in an interview with Cnews television and Europe1 radio.Asked whether France will have to resort to a nationwide lockdown for the third time since the outbreak began, he said that case numbers are still growing slowly, unlike in other European countries such as the U.K. and Germany.Read more: India, France firm on inclusive Indo-Pacific, equal access to Covid-19 vaccines“If we find that there’s again a strong growth in the epidemic, with pressure on the health system, obviously that will have consequences for the decisions we make,” he said. “We’ve always taken and will continue to take the steps necessary, at the moment when it’s necessary to take them, to protect the health of the French.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-lack-confidence-in-macron-virus-effort-poll-shows-101610278324222.html
10-01-2021||World||A year after first death in China, coronavirus source still a puzzle||It is the world's most pressing scientific puzzle, but experts warn there may never be conclusive answers over the source of the coronavirus, after an investigative effort marked from the start by disarray, Chinese secrecy and international rancour.January 11 marks the anniversary of China confirming its first death from Covid-19, a 61-year-old man who was a regular at the now-notorious Wuhan wet market.Nearly two million deaths later, the pandemic is out of control across much of the world, leaving tens of millions ill, a pulverised global economy and recriminations flying between nations.Yet China, which has broadly controlled the pandemic on its soil, is still frustrating independent attempts to trace the virus' origins and the central question of how it jumped from animals to humans.There is little dispute that the virus which brought the world to its knees sparked its first known outbreak in late 2019 at a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where wildlife was sold as food, and the pathogen is believed to have originated in an undetermined bat species.Read more: China: WHO team’s Wuhan visit preparations underwayBut the trail ends there, clouded by a mishmash of subsequent clues that suggest its origins may predate Wuhan as well as conspiracy theories -- amplified by US President Donald Trump -- that it leaked from a Wuhan lab.Establishing the source is vital for extinguishing future outbreaks early, leading virologists say, providing clues that can guide policy decisions on whether to cull animal populations, quarantine affected persons, or limit wildlife hunting and other human-animal interactions."If we can identify why they (viruses) keep emerging, we can reduce those underlying drivers," said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a global NGO focused on infectious disease prevention.Doubts about Wuhan marketChina won early kudos for reporting the virus and releasing its gene sequence in a timely manner, compared with its cover-up of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak.But there has also been secrecy and shifting stories.Wuhan authorities initially tried to cover up the outbreak and later spent precious weeks denying human-to-human transmission.Early on, Chinese officials declared flatly that the outbreak began at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.But Chinese data in January 2020 showed that several of the first cases had no known links to the now-shuttered market, suggesting a source elsewhere.China's story morphed again last March when top Chinese disease control official Gao Fu said the market was not the source, but a "victim", a place where the pathogen was merely amplified.But China has since failed to publicly connect any dots, releasing scant information on animal and environmental samples taken at the market that could aid investigators, experts say.Read more: China sees fresh surge of Covid-19, most cases reported from Hebei provinceAnd it has kept foreign experts at arm's length, with a planned mission by World Health Organization virus sleuths now in limbo after China denied them entry.On Saturday, a top Chinese health official said the country was now "ready" for the 10-strong team and opened the door to a visit to Wuhan.Yet "the specific time is being determined", National Health Commission vice minister Zeng Yixin told reporters.Cold caseWhat the scientists will be allowed to see or may expect to find a year on is also in doubt. Experts say authorities may have destroyed or scrubbed away crucial evidence in a panicked initial response."Every outbreak goes the same way. It's chaotic and dysfunctional," said Daszak."They didn't do a great job on the animal investigation early on," he added."In some ways, they were quite open, in others they were less than open."The reasons for China's secrecy are unclear, but the ruling Communist Party has a history of suppressing politically damaging information.Whistleblowers and citizen reporters who shared details of the terrifying early weeks of the virus on the internet have since been muzzled or jailed.Beijing may want to hide regulatory or investigative lapses to avoid domestic embarrassment or global "blowback", said Daniel Lucey, a Georgetown University epidemiologist who closely tracks global outbreaks.The Wuhan market might not even be the issue, Lucey adds.He notes that the virus was already spreading rapidly in Wuhan by December 2019, indicating that it was in circulation much earlier.That's because it may take months or even years for a virus to develop the necessary mutations to become highly contagious among humans.The market-origin theory is "just not plausible whatsoever", Lucey said."It occurred naturally and it had to have been many months earlier, perhaps a year, perhaps more than a year."Read more: Chinese city sealed off to squash coronavirus outbreakAugmenting the doubt, in December China said the number of coronavirus cases circulating in Wuhan may have been 10 times higher early in the epidemic than revealed by official figures at the time.The trail has now gone cold, with the drip of subsequent clues only adding to the confusion, including findings that the virus may have existed in Europe and Brazil before Wuhan's outbreak, unconfirmed suggestions which China has seized upon to deflect blame.'We'll never know for sure'Daszak remains hopeful the source can be found, especially after US President Donald Trump's re-election loss.He blames Trump for killing cooperation with China by politicising the virus -- typified by his "China virus" label -- and his administration's promotion of the conspiracy theory that China created it in a lab, which scientists reject."I'm confident we will eventually find out the bat species it came from and the likely pathway," Daszak said.Others are less certain.Diana Bell, a wildlife disease expert at the University of East Anglia who has studied the SARS virus, Ebola and other pathogens, said focusing on a particular origin species is misguided.She says the overarching threat has already been exposed: a global wildlife trade that fosters a "combustible mix" of trafficked species, a known breeding ground for disease outbreaks."(The species) actually doesn't matter. We don't need to know the source, we just need to stop that sodding mixing of animals in markets," she said."We need to stop the wildlife trade for human consumption."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-after-first-death-in-china-coronavirus-source-still-a-puzzle-101610276465142.html

The area witnessed a brutal civil war between the LTTE and Sri Lankan forces that continued for several years and led to the loss of lives of thousands of people.Meanwhile, Daily Mirror quoted the UGC Chairman as saying, "The Vice-Chancellor of Jaffna University Professor Srisatkunarajah is an eminent scientist in Sri Lanka. He is also an excellent administrator. He had decided that the memorial statue does not suit the present or the future, so he instructed the statue to be removed from the university premises."Read more: Tamil Nadu reverses 100% occupancy order in movie theatres after Centre’s notice"Our students who are presently in the university system would have been 9, 10, and 11 years old when the war ended. Regardless of their race or religion, Tamil, Sinhala or Muslim, they are all our children. I'm happy to say that some 1,500 Sinhala students study at the Jaffna university today. Similarly, at least 600 to 700 Tamil students, especially from the North and East are studying in universities of the South. There are no problems among these students, and that is most important," he said.Professor Amaratunga said that the only factor that can ensure a repetition of the problems of the past, is the unity of these students. "They reside in common hostel facilities. They participate in common lectures, common sports events, and other activities. As a country we are fortunate that these students have been responsible to experience no issues at these universities," he added."The Vice-Chancellor of Jaffna University has decided to remove the memorial from the university last night. I think it's a timely decision. What we need is memorials of peace, not war. We should engage in these requirements together with our students," he stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-s-jaffna-university-war-memorial-removed-tamil-nadu-cm-condemns-move-101610269261819.html

But now the country is facing the most challenging situation since a famine in the 1990s, and projects such as tourist resorts, economic zones, and a large hospital appear stalled.Kim's decision to stage a huge congress and talk of ambitious projects in the face serious shortages for many North Koreans shows how the government has "internalised its own propaganda," said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul."The country's economic and social conditions are worse than many outsiders appreciate," he said. "Kim tells his people about domestic shortfalls and promises improvements but is unlikely to adjust policies to receive aid and assistance."Economic wish listThe plan - which includes proposals for more advanced nuclear weapons - appears to be doubling down on North Korea's "Byungjin," or parallel development policy, said Kang Dong-wan, professor of Political Science & Diplomacy at Donga University in Busan."North Korea is going back to its 2017 plan – dual policy of improving its nuclear deterrent and self-reliant economy," he said.The new five-year plan includes a long wish list for expanding almost every category of industry, from metal and chemical production to coal mining, tourism, modernized railways, and more public transit.North Korea plans to invest in tidal and nuclear electricity plants as well as "zero-carbon buildings and zero-energy buildings in keeping with the world trends of architectural development", while the country's mobile communication networks should become "next-generation" as soon as possible.At least 50,000 apartments are to be built in the capital of Pyongyang, and another 25,000 dwellings in the Komdok area, which is home to major mining operations.Kim called for the capacity to produce 8 million tons of cement to support the large building projects.Also Read | North Korea's Kim calls US 'our biggest enemy' in challenge to Biden'The state's leading role'Improving the economy can't depend solely on solving outside problems and will only be possible after "breaking with current wrong ideological viewpoint, irresponsible working attitude, incompetence and obsolete working manner," Kim said.North Korea's economy shifted away from being fully centralised after many private markets and business sprung up in the face of government failures to provide in the 1990s.Analysts say those markets are here to stay, but there are signs the government is reasserting itself in ways that effectively roll back or curtail at least some of those reforms."The important tasks... is to restore the state's leading role and control in the overall commerce service activities and preserve the nature of socialist commerce serving the people," Kim said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-big-plan-to-grow-north-korea-s-economy-faces-harsh-reality-101610273419745.html

The city’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under the controversial legislation imposed on the Chinese-ruled city in June, the police can request service providers to restrict access to electronic platforms or messages that could pose a threat to national security.HKChronicles said that based on reports from users, the ISPs suspected of being involved in the blocking included Smartone, China Mobile Hong Kong, PCCW "and others". It did not elaborate.China Mobile, Smartone, and PCCW did not respond to requests for comment.The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.The Hong Kong and Beijing governments say it is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub in 2019.Hong Kong police arrested 53 people in dawn raids on democracy activists on Wednesday, in the biggest crackdown since China imposed the security law. The arrests have raised alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn."I think right now many users are being affected, but few websites are being affected. It seems like it's a technology test, to test the influence of blocking websites to the entire Hong Kong network," Chan told Reuters via the social media platform Telegram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-protest-related-website-says-users-access-blocked-101610273302032.html

Authorities said they came from a depth of 23 metres (75 feet) near a group of islands off the Jakarta coast.One twisted piece of metal was painted in Sriwijaya Air's blue and red colours. Indonesian authorities said they had also retrieved body parts and clothing.Police asked families to provide information such as dental records and DNA samples to help identify bodies.The plane had 12 crew and 50 passengers on board, all Indonesians and including seven children and three babies.President Joko Widodo, speaking at the palace in Bogor, expressed "deep condolences" over the disaster and urged the public to pray the missing people could be found.'We feel powerless'Tracking service Flightradar24 said the aircraft took off at 2:36 p.m. local time (0736 GMT) and climbed to reach 10,900 feet within four minutes. It then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later.There were no immediate clues on what caused the jet's sudden descent. Most air accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors that can take months to establish, safety experts say.A transport ministry spokeswoman said air traffic control had asked the pilot why the plane was heading northwest instead of on its expected flight path seconds before it disappeared.Read more: 'We stand with Indonesia': PM Modi's message after plane crashThe pilots had decades of experience between them with the flight captain reported to be a former air force pilot and his co-pilot at Sriwijaya Air since 2013, according to his Linkedin profile.The Sriwijaya Air plane was a nearly 27-year-old Boeing 737-500, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis."We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time," Boeing said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families."Distraught relatives waited in Pontianak about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta for news of their loved ones. At Jakarta's main airport a crisis centre was set up for families."We feel powerless, we can only wait and hope to get any information soon," Irfansyah Riyanto, who had five relatives on the flight, told reporters.Founded in 2003, Jakarta-based Sriwijaya Air group flies largely within Indonesia's sprawling archipelago. The budget airline has had a solid safety record, with no onboard casualties in four incidents recorded on the Aviation Safety Network database.In 2007, the European Union banned all Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance since deregulation in the late 1990s. The restrictions were fully lifted in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-locates-two-black-boxes-of-crashed-plane-transport-committee-101610270407521.html
10-01-2021||World||Sriwijaya Air crash places Indonesia's aviation safety under fresh spotlight||Indonesia's chequered air safety record is again in the spotlight after a Sriwijaya Air jet carrying 62 people crashed into the Java Sea minutes after takeoff on Saturday, marking the country's third major airline crash in just over six years.Before the crash there had been 697 fatalities in Indonesia over the last decade including military and private planes, making it the deadliest aviation market in the world - ahead of Russia, Iran and Pakistan - according to Aviation Safety Network's database.The Sriwijaya crash of a Boeing Co 737-500 follows the loss of a Lion Air 737 MAX in October 2018 that contributed to a global grounding of the model and the crash of an AirAsia Indonesia Airbus SE A320 in December 2014.Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, is highly dependent on air travel.From 2007 to 2018, the European Union (EU) banned Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance. The United States lowered its Indonesia safety evaluation to Category 2, meaning its regulatory system was inadequate, between 2007 and 2016.Indonesia's air safety record has improved in recent years, receiving a favourable evaluation by the United Nations (UN) aviation agency in 2018. But in a country with a large death toll from vehicle and ferry accidents, the safety culture is battling against a mindset that it is inevitable for some crashes to occur, experts said.Saturday's "crash has nothing to do with the MAX, but Boeing would do well to guide Indonesia - which has a chequered air safety record - to restore confidence in its aviation industry," said Shukor Yusof, the head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.As authorities searched for the Sriwijaya jet's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, experts said it was too early to determine the factors responsible for the crash of the nearly 27-year-old plane.The flight took off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, the same airport from which the Lion Air jet took off and soon crashed into the sea. The Sriwijaya jet climbed to 10,900 feet within four minutes but then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later, according to tracking website FlightRadar24."There has been a lot of noise made about the speed of its final descent," said Geoff Dell, an air accident investigation expert based in Australia. "It is indicative of what happened but why it happened is still in many ways a guess really. There are multiple ways you can get an aeroplane to go down at that pace."He said investigators would look into factors including mechanical failure, pilot actions, maintenance records, weather conditions, and whether there was any unlawful interference with the plane. Most air accidents are caused by a combination of factors that can take months to establish.Various Factors Under ScrutinySriwijaya's operating record will also be placed under scrutiny."Its safety record has been mixed," said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication FlightGlobal. He said the airline had written off three 737s between 2008 and 2012 due to bad landings that resulted in runway overruns, with the 2008 accident resulting in one death and 14 injuries.The airline in late 2019 ended a year-long partnership with national carrier Garuda Indonesia and had been operating independently.Just before ending the pact, more than half of Sriwijaya's fleet had been grounded by the Transportation Ministry due to airworthiness concerns, according to media reports at the time.Sriwijaya did not respond immediately to a request for comment, though the airline's chief executive said on Saturday the plane that crashed was in good condition.Like other Indonesian carriers, Sriwijaya had slashed its flight schedule during the Covid-19 pandemic, which experts said will be examined as part of the investigation."The challenges that the pandemic brings impacts aviation safety," said Chappy Hakim, an Indonesian aviation analyst and former air force official. "For instance, pilots/technicians were downsized, salaries not paid in full, planes are grounded."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sriwijaya-air-crash-places-indonesia-s-aviation-safety-under-fresh-spotlight-101610269641595.html
10-01-2021||World||Boris Johnson under fire as UK again faces onslaught of Covid-19||The crisis facing Britain this winter is depressingly familiar: Stay-at-home orders and empty streets. Hospitals overflowing. A daily toll of many hundreds of coronavirus deaths.The UK is the epicenter of Europe’s Covid-19 outbreak once more, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government is facing questions, and anger, as people demand to know how the country has ended up here — again.Many countries are enduring new waves of the virus, but Britain’s is among the worst, and it comes after a horrendous 2020. More than 3 million people in the UK have tested positive for the coronavirus and 81,000 have died — 30,000 in just the last 30 days. The economy has shrunk by 8%, more than 800,000 jobs have been lost and hundreds of thousands more furloughed workers are in limbo.Follow live update on Covid-19 hereEven with the new lockdown, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Friday that the situation in the capital was “critical,” with one in every 30 people infected. “The stark reality is that we will run out of beds for patients in the next couple of weeks unless the spread of the virus slows down drastically,″ he said.Medical staff are also at breaking point.“Whereas before, everyone went into a mode of, ‘We just need to get through this,’ (now) everybody is like, ‘Here we go again — can I get through this?’” said Lindsey Izard, a senior intensive care nurse at St. George’s Hospital in London. “That’s really, really hard for our staff.”Much of the blame for Britain’s poor performance has been laid at the door of Johnson, who came down with the virus in the spring and ended up in intensive care. Critics say his government’s slow response as the new respiratory virus emerged from China was the first in a string of lethal mistakes.Anthony Costello, professor of global health at University College London, said “dilly-dallying” in March about whether to lock down the U.K. cost thousands of lives.Britain locked down on March 23, and Costello said if the decision had come a week or two sooner, “we would be back down at 30,000-40,000 deaths. ... More like Germany.”“And the problem is, they’ve repeated these delays,” said Costello, a member of Independent SAGE, a group of scientists set up as an alternative to the government’s official Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.Most countries have struggled during the pandemic, but Britain had some disadvantages from the start. Its public health system was frayed after years of spending cuts by austerity-minded Conservative governments. It had only a tiny capacity to test for the new virus. And while authorities had planned for a hypothetical pandemic, they assumed it would be a less deadly and less contagious flu-like illness.The government sought advice from scientists, but critics say its pool of advisers was too narrow. And their recommendations were not always heeded by a prime minister whose laissez-faire instincts make him reluctant to clamp down on the economy and daily life.Johnson has defended his record, saying it’s easy to find fault when looking back.“The retro-spectroscope is a magnificent instrument,” Johnson said in a BBC interview last week.“Scientific advisors have said all sorts of different things at different times,” he added. “They’re by no mean unanimous.”A future public inquiry will likely pore over the failings in Britain’s coronavirus response, but the inquisition has already begun.Parliament’s Science and Technology Committee said in a report published Friday that the government was not transparent enough about the scientific advice it received, failed to learn from other countries and responded too slowly when “the pandemic has demanded that policy be made and adapted on a faster timescale.”The government points out, correctly, that there has been huge progress since last spring. Early problems getting protective equipment to medical workers have largely been resolved. Britain now carries out almost half a million coronavirus tests a day. A national test-and-trace system has been set up to find and isolate infected people, though it struggles to cope with demand and can’t enforce requests to self-isolate.Treatments including the steroid dexamethasone, whose effectiveness was discovered during a UK trial, have improved survival rates among the most seriously ill. And now there are vaccines, three of which have been approved for use in Britain. The government has vowed to give the first of two shots to almost 15 million people, including everyone over 70, by mid-February.But critics say the government has continued to repeat its mistakes, adapting too slowly to a changing situation.As infection rates fell in the summer, the government encouraged people to return to restaurants and workplaces to help revive the economy. When the virus began to surge again in September, Johnson rejected advice from his scientific advisers to lock the country down, before eventually announcing a month-long second national lockdown on Oct. 31.Hopes that move would be enough to curb the spread of the virus were dashed in December, when scientists warned that a new variant was up to 70% more transmissible than the original strain.Johnson tightened restrictions for London and the southeast, but the government’s scientific advisory committee warned Dec. 22 that would not be enough. Johnson did not announce a third national lockdown for England until almost two weeks later, on Jan. 4.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own public health policies and have similar restrictions in place.“Why is this prime minister, with all the scientific expertise at his disposal, all the power to make a difference, always the last to grasp what needs to happen?” said Jonathan Ashworth, health spokesman for the opposition Labour Party. “The prime minister hasn’t been short of data, he has been short of judgment."Costello said Johnson should not bear all the blame. He said a sense of “exceptionalism” had led many British officials to watch scenes from Wuhan, China, early in 2020 and think “that’s all happening over in Asia and it’s not going to come here.”“We were found wanting,” he said. “And I think that’s a wakeup call.”John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, said people should be more forgiving of official missteps.“It’s very easy to be critical about how we’ve done, but you do have to remember that there’s nobody who’s really managed a pandemic like this, who’s ever done it before,” he told the BBC. “We’re all trying to make decisions on the run, and some of those decisions will inevitably be the wrong decisions."“Everybody should be doing their best, and I think on the whole people are — including, I have to say, the politicians. So don’t beat them up too badly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-under-fire-as-uk-again-faces-onslaught-of-covid19-101610269864135.html
10-01-2021||World||Indonesia finds body parts, debris, detects emergency signal of crashed jet||Indonesia detected signals on Sunday that could come from a flight recorder of a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the sea soon after taking off from the capital Jakarta, as human body parts and suspected pieces of the plane were retrieved. The Boeing 737-500 with 62 passengers and crew was headed to Pontianak in West Kalimantan before it disappeared on Saturday from radar screens four minutes after takeoff.It is the first major aircrash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max in 2018 also plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.Even before the latest crash, more people had died in air cashes in Indonesia than in any other country over the past decade, according to Aviation Safety Network's database."We have detected signals in two points. This could be the black box," Bagus Puruhito, chief of Indonesia's search and rescue agency, told reporters aboard a military ship.Pieces of wreckage were brought to Jakarta port by rescuers. One twisted piece of metal was painted in Sriwijaya Air's blue and red colours. Indonesian authorities said they had also retrieved body parts and clothing.Police asked families to provide information such as dental records and DNA samples to help identify bodies.Flight SJ 182 had 12 crew and 50 passengers on board, all Indonesians and including seven children and three babies."I am optimistic we will find (the plane) soon," Henri Alfiandi, an assistant to the chief of staff of the Indonesian Air Force, told a news briefing.President Joko Widodo, speaking at the palace in Bogor, expressed "deep condolences" over the disaster and urged the public to pray the missing people could be found.The search focuses on the outer ring of the Laki and Lancang islands off the Jakarta coast. The sea in this area is about 20 to 23 metres (65-75 feet) deep."WE FEEL POWERLESS"Tracking service Flightradar24 said the aircraft took off at 2:36 p.m. local time (0736 GMT) and climbed to reach 10,900 feet within four minutes. It then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later.There were no immediate clues on what may have caused the jet's sudden descent. Safety experts stress most air accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors that can take months to establish.A transport ministry spokeswoman said air traffic control had asked the pilot why the plane was heading northwest instead of on its expected flight path seconds before it disappeared.The pilots had decades of experience between them with the flight captain reported to be a former air force pilot and his co-pilot had been at Sriwijaya Air since 2013, according to his Linkedin profile.The Sriwijaya Air plane was a nearly 27-year-old Boeing 737-500, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis."We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time," Boeing said in a statement. "Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families."Distraught relatives waited in Pontianak about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta for news of their loved ones. At Jakarta's main airport a crisis centre was set up for families."We feel powerless, we can only wait and hope to get any information soon," Irfansyah Riyanto, who had five relatives on the flight, told reporters.Founded in 2003, Jakarta-based Sriwijaya Air group flies largely within Indonesia's sprawling archipelago. The budget airline has had a solid safety record, with no onboard casualties in four incidents recorded on the Aviation Safety Network database.In 2007, the European Union banned all Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance since deregulation in the late 1990s. The restrictions were fully lifted in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-finds-body-parts-debris-detects-emergency-signal-of-crashed-jet-101610268739084.html

The Chinese foreign ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment on the latest announcement.Taiwan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu said in a tweet that he was grateful to Pompeo for “lifting restrictions unnecessarily limiting our engagements.”“The closer partnership between Taiwan and the US is firmly based on our shared values, common interests and unshakeable belief in freedom and democracy,” the minister said.Future ContactsGoing forward, executive branch agencies should consider all “contact guidelines” concerning relations with Taiwan previously issued by the State Department to be null and void, Pompeo said.The US ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft is expected to visit Taiwan this week. That will be the first such visit since Taiwan was excluded from the UN in 1971, and she will meet with senior Taiwanese counterparts.China’s foreign ministry had earlier called Craft’s visit “a breach of the One China principle” and accused Pompeo of “staging a final show of madness” to “sabotage China-US relations.”The announcement by Pompeo is one of a number the administration has launched or strengthened in the final days of its term, including an initiative to punish companies with close ties to the Chinese military.Bedrock Policy“Best case, the Biden Administration sees this as a blank slate and starts an internal process to develop what the ideal US-Taiwan engagement structure and process looks like, consistent with the unofficial relationship, shared democratic values, and the benefits the bilateral relationship brings,” said Drew Thompson, formerly a US Department of Defense official responsible for Taiwan policy.Beijing’s “One China” principle states that Taiwan and China are part of the same China. While the US recognises that the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the only legitimate government of China, it only acknowledges that the PRC claims Taiwan is a part of China.Why Trump Raising Doubts About ‘One-China’ Is a Big DealTaiwan’s government views the island as a de-facto independent, sovereign nation.Hong Kong StatementIn another action against China, Pompeo on Saturday issued a joint statement with the foreign ministers of the U.K., Canada and Australia in expressing “serious concern” about the arrest of 55 activists and politicians in Hong Kong last week.US, Western Allies ‘Concerned’ Over Hong Kong ArrestsHong Kong’s National Security Law is a breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and undermines the “one country, two systems” framework, according to the statement. The legislation “has curtailed the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. It is clear that the National Security Law is being used to eliminate dissent and opposing political views,” the governments said.Hong Kong’s government later rejected that criticism. China has repeatedly said no other nations have the right to interfere in its internal affairs, including in Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-eases-restrictions-on-contact-with-taiwan-in-jab-at-china-101610268174332.html

The outage, which was also reported in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan etc. was attributed by the government to the tripping of the National Transmission Despatch Company’s lines.Also Read | Several major cities in Pakistan plunge into darkness due to huge power blackoutFederal minister for power, Omar Ayub Khan, on Sunday listed out several power grids in and around the city of Lahore that, he said, had been energised. He, however, added that it will still take some time before normal supply is restored.132 kv Grids Around Lahore Energized including 11kv. 1. Shadman2. Qartaba3. Mc Leod Road4. Gulshan Ravi.5.

The energy ministry, meanwhile, said as per initial reports, there was a fault in the Guddu power plant in Sindh province at 11:41 pm on Saturday, adding that the fault tripped the high transmission lines, which further resulted in the system frequency going from 50 to zero in less than a second, causing power plants to shut down.While Pakistan suffered this major blackout, neighbouring India, too, has had severe outages of its own, including in its financial capital of Mumbai in October 2020. The outage, which lasted for several hours, was attributed by the local administration to a technical failure in one of the power supply circuits at a supply station in the nearby city of Thane.Also Read | Mumbai power outage: Electricity restored in suburban areas after a wait of 15 hoursIn July 2012, a two-day nationwide blackout, among the largest in the world, took place in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-massive-blackout-power-supply-being-restored-gradually-in-pakistan-101610267565586.html
10-01-2021||World||US Capitol violence: What crimes can the rioters be charged with?||Dozens of supporters of US President Donald Trump have been criminally charged in connection with the violent storming of the US Capitol building earlier this week, and many more cases are expected.Five people died as a result of the riot, including a Capitol Police officer. No one has been charged yet in connection with any of those deaths.Several different criminal statutes and theories of liability could be used against the rioters, legal experts said.Here is an overview of some of the potential charges, including seditious conspiracy and felony murder.What criminal charges have been filed so far?Some of the more than 50 defendants in the federal district and superior courts have been charged with gun-related offenses. There are federal laws against carrying a gun in the Capitol building, and possessing an unregistered firearm or unlicensed ammunition in the District of Columbia.A Seattle man, Mark Leffingwell, has been charged with assaulting a federal law enforcement officer, a federal crime. He is accused of punching a Capitol Police officer in a separate incident from the one that led to an officer's death. A lawyer for Leffingwell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Several dozen individuals have been charged with unlawful entry on the Capitol grounds, which is a crime under the Washington D.C. criminal code and federal law. Those include Nicholas Ochs, a member of the far-right group Proud Boys, who posted a photo of himself inside the Capitol building. A lawyer for Ochs could not be identified.Could multiple people be charged with killing a police officer?Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died on Thursday. Sicknick "was injured while physically engaging with protesters," the police department said in a statement. He collapsed after he returned to his divisional office, the statement said.Sicknick was one of the five people to die as a result of the riot.A top priority for law enforcement will be identifying anyone responsible for Sicknick's death, said Matt Jones, a former federal prosecutor in Washington now at the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.If someone assaulted Sicknick, that person could be charged with murder or manslaughter.Anyone who assisted the main perpetrator could face criminal charges for "aiding and abetting" murder or manslaughter.If Sicknick was killed as part of a coordinated plot to attack individuals inside the Capitol, individuals involved in that scheme could be charged as co-conspirators, Jones said."Prosecutors are no doubt scouring every phone and social media post they can," Jones said. "And, to the extent they show an intent to cause harm to an officer, or member of Congress or their staff, that will dramatically move the ball forward."Jay Town, former US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said rioters who were simply present in the room when Sicknick was engaged with protesters are far less likely to be charged."To assign culpability beyond the actual assailant, or those that aided or abetted them, would normally require proof that other individuals knew that the commission of their criminal acts might likely lead to death or serious bodily injury," Town said.Could there be felony murder charges?There is a doctrine of US law, recognized in Washington, called felony murder, which allows prosecutors to charge people with murder even if they did not intend to kill.Typically, a defendant is charged with felony murder if they engage in a violent crime and a death indirectly results from their actions.Ken Kohl, a top prosecutor on the case, said at a news conference on Friday that felony murder "is always in play in something like this."Legal experts said more facts were needed to determine if this theory of liability would apply.Jones said it could be difficult to bring felony murder charges. To do so, prosecutors may need to prove certain underlying offenses such as armed robbery or kidnapping, which do not appear to be present here.What about sedition?It is very possible individuals will be charged with a federal law that bans efforts to overthrow the government, legal experts said.That law prohibits conspiring to "overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force" the U.S. government.The statute "will absolutely apply once the investigation is completed," said Justo Mendez, a criminal defense attorney at Holland & Knight in Texas and a former federal prosecutor. "The evidence of 'conspire to overthrow' is all over social media."Who is bringing the criminal cases?All of the criminal charges so far have been brought by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, part of the US Justice Department. These prosecutors enforce federal laws, as well as the District of Columbia's criminal code.Federal prosecutors around the country could also bring charges if plans to carry out violence were made within their jurisdictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-violence-what-crimes-can-the-rioters-be-charged-with-101610266306683.html

One other person was wounded he said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students. IS has claimed responsibility for rocket attacks in December targeting the major US base in Afghanistan. There were no casualties.Taliban militants have meanwhile continued their insurgency against government forces while keeping their promise not to attack US and NATO troops.Sunday's attack comes as Afghan negotiators are to resume talks with the Taliban aimed at finding an end to decades of relentless conflict. Frustration and fear have grown over a spike in violence that has combatants on both sides blaming the other.The stop-and-go talks between the Taliban and the government come amid growing doubt over a US-Taliban peace deal brokered by the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump. An accelerated withdrawal of US troops ordered by Trump means just 2,500 American soldiers will still be in Afghanistan when President-elect Joe Biden takes office this month.Biden has advocated for keeping a small intelligence-based presence in Afghanistan, but Taliban leaders have flatly rejected any foreign troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roadside-bomb-kills-3-people-in-afghan-capital-officials-101610265126483.html

While Brar has been described as a Conservative Party leader, a spokesman for its leader Erin O’Toole described him as a “private citizen” and added, “Currently there is no Conservative candidate in Brampton South since Conservative Party members have not yet chosen their candidate for the next election.”In response to queries from the Hindustan Times in this regard, the spokesperson, Cory Hann, also had some sharp words for Brar’s presence at the protests at Kundli even as there is public backlash against Canadian politicians who have travelled abroad in recent days for non-essential reasons despite a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.He said, “Mr O’Toole has continued to emphasise the necessity for all members of caucus to follow all public health guidance including travel advisories. Canadians have made it clear that those with political ambitions would be wise to follow that same guidance.”Several politicians have lost their posts due to their travels during this period, including MP Kamal Khera, who resigned as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Development.Brar holds an Overseas Citizen of India or OCI card, a lifelong visa. While OCIs were not allowed to travel to India in the initial months of the coronavirus crisis, such restrictions were later lifted by late summer of 2020.The Ministry of External Affairs had earlier stated that it was aware of Brar’s presence at the protests and was ascertaining if he violated norms for getting an OCI card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-party-distances-from-politician-who-attended-farmers-rally-101610261667974.html

He called on all parties to expend all effort to search for and rescue the victims.An Indonesian search-and-rescue team has located the suspected crash site of the plane, the country’s military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said in a separate televised briefing.

10-01-2021||World||Indonesian search team locates crash site of Sriwijaya Air Flight SJ182||An Indonesian search-and-rescue team has located the suspected crash site of the missing the Boeing Co. jet carrying 62 people operated by Sriwijaya Air, military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said.The team found debris that it suspects to be from Flight SJ182, and plans to recover more of the wreckage on Sunday afternoon. Indonesian President Joko Widodo confirmed the plane had crashed about 20 hours after it went missing following its departure from capital Jakarta, calling on all parties to expend all efforts to search for and rescue the victims.“We believe that it is the location of the crash,” Tjahjanto said in a televised briefing. Items found 23 meters (75 feet) underwater include life vests and parts of the aircraft that bears its registration number, he said.The accident has once again pushed the country’s aviation industry into crisis mode. The Southeast Asian nation has had a spate of plane crashes in the past decade, including the Lion Air Flight 610 disaster that killed 189 people in 2018, the first of the two 737 Max crashes before the global grounding. In December 2014, an AirAsia Group Bhd. plane plunged into the Java Sea with 162 people on board.Weather has been a contributing factor in several of the past crashes. On Saturday, heavy rain in Jakarta delayed the takeoff for the 90-minute flight to Pontianak on the island of Borneo.It finally took off at 2:36 p.m., reaching 1,700 feet a minute later, where it was cleared by the Jakarta air traffic controllers to ascend to 29,000 feet, according to Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi. Four minutes after takeoff, the control noticed the aircraft was not on its assigned track. It radioed the crew, and within seconds, the aircraft disappeared from radar, he said.Flightradar24’s tracking data showed the plane leveling off at an altitude of about 10,000 to 11,000 feet 3 minutes after taking off, before a rapid descent to the water in just 14 seconds. That meant it was dropping at more than 40,000 feet per minute, a rate far above routine operations.Without access yet to the plane’s black-box flight recorders, it’s impossible to say what may have triggered the sudden dive, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, the former head of accident investigations at the US Federal Aviation Administration. “Right now, given the amount of sparse information, that flight track could fit many scenarios, such as flight crew confusion, instrumentation problems, catastrophic mechanical failures or even an intentional act,” he said.Indonesia deployed divers, warships, vessels with sonar and airplanes on Sunday to the area where the aircraft made the last contact, officials from the national army and the search and rescue agency said.The plane that Sriwijaya Air was flying is a 737-500 model that’s much older than the Max 737 aircraft.“This is not even the model before the Max, it has been in service for 30 years so it’s unlikely to be a design fault,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at Teal Group Corp. “Thousands of these planes have been built and production ended over 20 years ago, so something would have been discovered by now.”The crash comes as the aviation industry is reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which brought air travel to its knees. Covid-19 tore through in a tumultuous, unprecedented way -- leaving carriers in a deep hole, along with a constellation of aerospace manufacturers, airports and leasing firms. The International Air Transport Association said last week that global passenger demand dropped significantly during November, down 70% versus the same period of 2019 when measured in revenue passenger kilometers.“While we don’t know anything else about the cause of this crash, the biggest thing concerning me is serious concerns about Indonesian air safety standards that were identified by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and others years ago,” Aboulafia said. “I am not completely certain that the proper procedures have been put in place.”Of the 62 people, 56 were passengers, including seven children and three infants, and there were two pilots and four cabin crew, local media reported. There were no foreign nationals on board.Boeing is “closely monitoring the situation,” spokeswoman Zoe Leong said in a statement. “We are working to gather more information.” Sriwijaya Air said it’s working to obtain more detailed information about the flight, and will release an official statement later.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has appointed a senior investigator to assist in the probe, but is awaiting more information before determining whether it will send a team, it said in an emailed statement. Under a United Nations treaty, the NTSB along with technical experts from Boeing and possibly the manufacturers of other components would participate in the probe because the jet was built in the US.The 737-500 model first flew in 1989 and, according to tracking website Planespotters.net, this particular plane first flew in May 1994.Debris, Oil SpillFishermen in the Thousand Islands regency earlier found debris and an oil spill in the water, according to footage shown by local news channel MetroTV. It also showed parts found that are suspected to come from the emergency slide, with words including “Boeing” and “737” written on a tag. The regent of Thousand Islands received a report of a plane crashing on Laki Island on Saturday afternoon, he told Detik.com.Indonesia, which had one of the fastest-growing airline industries in the world prior to Covid, has a patchy safety record when it comes to air accidents. Its poor aviation history saw carriers from the nation banned from the European Union in 2007 and it was only in June 2018 that the full ban was lifted. In 1997, Garuda Indonesia Flight 152 crashed approaching an airport in Medan in North Sumatra, killing 234. The AirAsia Flight 8501 that crashed in late 2014 was en route to Singapore from Surabaya.On Oct. 29, 2018, the Boeing 737 Max flown by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew. That was Indonesia’s second-deadliest aircraft accident.Boeing woesThe coronavirus pandemic has complicated aviation insomuch as pilots aren’t getting enough opportunities to fly because airlines have grounded planes and scaled back operations due to a slump in demand. On Sept. 15, an Indonesian flight carrying 307 passengers and 11 crew to the northern city of Medan momentarily veered off the runway after landing, sparking an investigation by the transport safety regulator. It found the pilot had flown less than three hours in the previous 90 days. The first officer hadn’t flown at all since Feb. 1.Saturday’s accident also follows a tumultuous period for Boeing, which only in November had its 737 Max cleared to fly again by the US Federal Aviation Administration, ending the longest grounding of a jetliner in US history. Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA was the first airline to resume regular flights using the jet, beginning Dec. 9 on domestic routes from Sao Paulo. American Airlines Group Inc. has since also reintroduced the Max on Miami-New York flights.SettlementEarlier this month, Boeing reached a $2.5 billion agreement with the Justice Department to settle a criminal charge that it defrauded the US government by concealing information about the 737 Max, capping a two-year investigation that devastated the company’s reputation for engineering prowess.Sriwijaya Air was established in November 2003. Its fleet is comprised of the Boeing 737 family of jets and ATR 72-600 turboprops. While the company primarily serves domestic routes, it flies internationally to Penang, Malaysia and Dili, Timor Leste. Flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia briefly took over the operation of Sriwijaya and its unit NAM Air in 2018 to expedite Sriwijaya’s debt restructuring, including clearance of dues to Garuda’s unit.The Boeing jet in question had been operated by Sriwijaya Air since 2012, according to fleet data on Planespotters.net, and was previously used by Continental Air Lines and United Airlines Holdings Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-search-team-locates-crash-site-of-sriwijaya-air-flight-sj182-101610254612381.html
10-01-2021||World||Indonesian divers spot parts of plane wreckage in Java Sea||Indonesian divers on Sunday located parts of the wreckage of a Boeing 737-500 at a depth of 23 meters (75 feet) in the Java Sea, a day after the aircraft with 62 people onboard crashed shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.“We received reports from the diver team that the visibility in the water is good and clear, allowing the discovery of some parts of the plane," Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto said in a statement. “We are sure that is the point where the plane crashed.”He said the objects included broken pieces of fuselage with aircraft registration parts.Earlier, rescuers pulled out body parts, pieces of clothing and scraps of metal from the surface.“Hopefully until this afternoon the current conditions and the view under the sea are still good so that we can continue the search,” he said.The break in the search for Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 came after sonar equipment on a navy ship detected a signal from the aircraft at a location that fit the coordinates from the last contact made by the pilots before the plane went missing on Saturday afternoon.It’s still unclear what caused the crash. There was no sign of survivors.“I represent the government and all Indonesians in expressing my deep condolences for this tragedy," President Joko Widodo said.“We are doing our best to save the victims. We pray together so that the victims can be found,” he said, adding that he had asked the National Transport Safety Committee to conduct an investigation.Fishermen in the area between Lancang and Laki islands, part of an archipelago around Thousand Islands north of Jakarta’s coast, reported hearing an explosion around 2:30 p.m. Saturday.“We heard something explode, we thought it was a bomb or a tsunami since after that we saw the big splash from the water," Solihin, who goes by one name, told The Associated Press by phone.“It was raining heavily and the weather was so bad. So it is difficult to see around clearly. But we can see the splash and a big wave after the sounds. We were very shocked and directly saw the plane debris and the fuel around our boat.”Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said Flight SJ182 was delayed for an hour before it took off at 2:36 p.m. It disappeared from radar four minutes later, after the pilot contacted air traffic control to ascend to an altitude of 29,000 feet (8,839 meters), he said.There were 62 people on board, including seven children and three babies.“We are aware of media reports from Jakarta regarding Sriwijaya Air flight SJ-182,” Boeing said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with the crew, passengers, and their families. We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time.”Authorities established two crisis centers, one at airport and one at port. Families gathered to wait for news of loved ones.On social media, people began circulating the flight manifesto with photos and videos of those who were listed as passengers. One video shows a woman with her children waving goodbye while walking through the airport.Sriwijaya Air President Director Jefferson Irwin Jauwena said the plane, which is 26 years old and previously used by airlines in the United States, was airworthy. He told reporters Saturday that the plane had previously flown to Pontianak and Pangkal Pinang city on the same day.“Maintenance report said everything went well and airworthy,” Jauwena told a news conference. He said the plane was delayed due to bad weather, not because of any damage.Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation, with more than 260 million people, has been plagued by transportation accidents on land, sea and air because of overcrowding on ferries, aging infrastructure and poorly enforced safety standards.In October 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. The plane involved in Saturday’s incident did not have the automated flight-control system that played a role in the Lion Air crash and another crash of a 737 MAX 8 jet in Ethiopia five months later, leading to the grounding of the MAX 8 for 20 months.The Lion Air crash was Indonesia’s worst airline disaster since 1997, when 234 people were killed on a Garuda airlines flight near Medan on Sumatra island. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing 162 people.Sriwijaya Air has only has several minor incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when landing plane went off runway due to a hydraulic issue.The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country in 2007, but reversed the decision in 2016, citing improvements in compliance with international aviation standards. The European Union has previously had similar bans, lifting them in June 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-divers-spot-parts-of-plane-wreckage-in-java-sea-101610253624439.html
10-01-2021||World||Top Republican says Trump committed 'impeachable offenses'||Democrats' momentum for a fresh drive to quickly impeach outgoing President Donald Trump gained support Saturday, and a top Republican said the president's role in the deadly riot at the Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters was worthy of rebuke.Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said he believed Trump had committed “impeachable offenses.” But he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to remove the president from office at the conclusion of a Senate trial if the House sent over articles of impeachment.“I don’t know what they are going to send over and one of the things that I’m concerned about, frankly, is whether the House would completely politicize something,” Toomey said Saturday on Fox News Channel, speaking of the Democratic-controlled House.“I do think the president committed impeachable offenses, but I don’t know what is going to land on the Senate floor, if anything," Toomey said.Late Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues reiterating that Trump must be held accountable — but stopped short of committing to an impeachment vote. Still, she told her caucus, “I urge you to be prepared to return to Washington this week.”“It is absolutely essential that those who perpetrated the assault on our democracy be held accountable,” Pelosi wrote. “There must be a recognition that this desecration was instigated by the President.”Pelosi said House Democrats “will be proceeding with meetings with Members and Constitutional experts and others.”The new Democratic effort to stamp Trump's presidential record — for the second time and days before his term ends — with the indelible mark of impeachment gained more supporters Saturday. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles — or charges — accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, said his group had grown to include 185 co-sponsors.Lawmakers plan to formally introduce the proposal on Monday in the House, where articles of impeachment must originate. If Democrats decide to move forward, a vote could be possible by Wednesday — exactly one week before Democrat Joe Biden becomes president at noon on Jan. 20.The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors who would ultimately vote on whether to acquit or convict Trump. If convicted, Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president.Earlier Saturday, Pelosi told her San Francisco constituents during an online video conference that it is "a decision that we have to make.”Potentially complicating that decision is what it means for Biden and the beginning of his presidency. While reiterating that he has long viewed Trump as unfit for office, Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress does “is for them to decide.”If the House decided to impeach, the soonest the Senate could begin an impeachment trial under the current calendar would be Jan. 20, Inauguration Day.A violent and largely white mob of Trump supporters overpowered police, broke through security lines and rampaged through the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were putting the final, formal touches on Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College.The crowd surged to the domed symbol of American democracy following a rally near the White House, where Trump repeated his bogus claims that the election was stolen from him and urged his supporters to march in force toward the Capitol.Five people, including a Capitol police officer, died as a result of the siege.“It has been an epiphany for the world to see that there are people in our country led by this president, for the moment, who have chosen their whiteness over democracy,” Pelosi said of the attack.She added: “This cannot be exaggerated. The complicity, not only the complicity, the instigation of the president of United States, must and will be addressed.”No. 4 House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York reiterated support for moving against what he deemed “an act of sedition that was incited and encouraged by Donald Trump.”Speaking of Trump, Jeffries said Saturday: “He should be impeached, convicted and thrown out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and forever banished to the dustbin of history."Outrage over the attack and Trump's role in egging it on capped a divisive, chaotic presidency like few others in the nation’s history. There are less than two weeks until Trump is out of office but Democrats have made clear they don't want to wait that long.Trump, meanwhile, has few fellow Republicans speaking out in his defense. He's become increasingly isolated, holed up in the White House as he has been abandoned in the aftermath of the riot by many aides, leading Republicans and, so far, two Cabinet members — both women.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has long voiced her exasperation with Trump's conduct in office, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that he simply “needs to get out.”Sen. Ben Sasse, another Trump critic, said more important than what happens to Trump “is what happens to the United States people and this union 12 days and beyond.”But the Nebraska Republican also told “CBS This Morning” on Friday that he “will definitely consider” whatever articles the House sends over because he believes Trump “has disregarded his oath of office” to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.After spending many weeks refusing to concede defeat in the November election, Trump promised — after the Capitol riot — to oversee a smooth transfer of power to Biden. He called for reconciliation and healing, but then announced he will not attend the inauguration — the first such presidential snub since just after the Civil War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-republican-says-trump-committed-impeachable-offenses-101610253439465.html
10-01-2021||World||Apple, Amazon suspend Parler from App Store over posts inciting violence||Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have suspended Parler from their respective App Store and web hosting service, saying the social networking service popular with many right-leaning social media users has not taken adequate measures to prevent the spread of posts inciting violence.The action by Apple and Amazon follows a similar move by Alphabet Inc's Google on Friday. Parler is favored by many supporters of US President Donald Trump, who was permanently suspended from Twitter on Friday, and it is seen as a haven for people expelled from Twitter."We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues," Apple said in a statement Saturday.Apple had given Parler 24 hours to submit a detailed moderation plan, pointing to participants' using the service to coordinate Wednesday's siege of the US Capitol.Amazon's move effectively takes the site offline unless it can find a new company to host its services.Amazon suspended Parler from its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, for violating AWS's terms of services by failing to effectively deal with a steady increase in violent content, according to an email by an AWS Trust and Safety team to Parler, seen by Reuters.An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the letter was authentic.Due to the "very real risk to public safety" that Parler poses, AWS plans to suspend Parler's account effective Sunday, at 11:59 p.m. PST, the email seen by Reuters showed.Parler Chief Executive John Matze lashed out at Amazon, Google and Apple, saying it was a coordinated effort knowing Parler's options would be limited and it would inflict the most damage right as Trump was banned from other social media platforms."There is the possibility Parler will be unavailable on internet for up to a week as we rebuild from scratch," he said in a post on Parler."This was a coordinated attack by the tech giants to kill competition in the market place... You can expect the war on competition and free speech to continue, but don't count us out."In addition to Parler, right-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to messaging app Telegram and hands-off social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-amazon-suspend-parler-from-app-store-over-posts-inciting-violence-101610253034261.html
10-01-2021||World||Donald Trump likely to target big tech in his final days||President Donald Trump will be targeting Twitter and other social media platforms during his final days in office to shift the narrative away from the riots at Capitol Hill which took place earlier this week, reported CNN.A Trump adviser said that Trump was outraged by Twitter on his permanent suspension from the platform on Friday night (local time).Trump aides have advised him to use this opportunity to reignite arguments of anti-conservative bias on social media and to frame the ban as an attack on his supporters."This isn't just about President Trump, but this is literally about the 75 million Americans" who supported him, the adviser said.Earlier, Trump was banned by other big tech companies like Instagram, YouTube, and Twitch, etc after a chaotic and violent scene erupted at the Capitol on Wednesday (local time) as his supporters stormed the building to protest the Electoral College vote, forcing a lockdown and confrontation with police resulting in the death of five persons, including an Air Force veteran.The violence came hours after Trump coaxed his supporters to fight against the election results as Congress was in process of certifying Biden's victory in the November elections.Meanwhile, Trump and his Republican allies have long accused social media companies of bias against conservatives, often making false allegations that social media platforms secretly "shadow ban" prominent Republicans, reported CNN."Big Tech and Capitol Hill Democrats seem to have the magic ability to galvanize the Republican base in a way that only they know how to do," said the adviser.CNN reported that the fight with social media companies is likely to help galvanize the Trump base; it is unlikely to shift the conversation away from Trump's role in inciting the riots on Capitol Hill last week.Trump is also expected to issue a raft of pardons, travel to the border wall and sign some executive orders in his final days in office.Meanwhile, several of Trump administration members resigned from the post following the violence, including US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, chief of staff for First Lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham, and White House social secretary Anna Cristina "Rickie" Niceta.Also, several lawmakers slammed Trump for inciting violence, with some calling for his immediate impeachment and removal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-likely-to-target-big-tech-in-his-final-days-101610253160972.html
10-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel’s health minister mulling a run for chancellor: Reports||German Health Minister Jens Spahn is considering a run to take over from Angela Merkel as chancellor, local media reported, as competition to succeed her after September’s election heats up.Spahn, whose standing among voters has risen during the coronavirus pandemic, has been sounding out party colleagues to gauge support for the move, Der Spiegel magazine reported Friday, citing six unidentified officials from Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union. Bild newspaper also reported that Spahn is mulling a bid for the chancellor candidacy.The 40-year-old has long been considered a rising star in Merkel’s conservative bloc and one poll last month showed he had moved ahead of her to become the nation’s most popular politician.A protege of former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, Spahn made a name for himself with attacks on Merkel over her handling of the euro crisis and her migrant policy. He put his hat in the ring in 2018 as a candidate for CDU leader, and although he came in third, his run was well received by the party and the media.According to a Kantar poll in Bild last month, 52% of those surveyed said Spahn should play a major role in German politics in 2021, up from 28% at the end of 2019. Merkel’s approval rating was 51%, up 11 percentage points from the previous year.Since then, however, criticism has swirled around the start of Germany’s Covid-19 vaccination program, putting Spahn under pressure. Merkel was drawn into the controversy after a June letter from Spahn was leaked to Bild. The message to the European Commission indicated that the German leader was behind the strategy to hand off vaccine procurement to the bloc.The fallout could hurt his chances. An infratest dimap poll for ARD television published Thursday showed his approval rating had dropped by eight points to 56%, the lowest since May last year, though he held on to second place behind Merkel on 72%.The chancellor will step down following the next election in September after 16 years in power. The CDU will elect a new leader -- who will have a strong say in the chancellor candidacy -- at a virtual congress next week in a tight three-way race.Spahn has backed Armin Laschet to become CDU chief, but the premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia has faltered in recent months. Friedrich Merz, a long-time Merkel rival, and Norbert Roettgen, a former environment minister, are also running.The winner could step aside to allow Spahn to run as chancellor if he’s seen as having the best chance of winning the election. Spiegel said that Laschet rejected handing the chancellor candidacy to Spahn. Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder from the CSU sister party is also a leading contender to become the bloc’s chancellor candidate.Spahn is in regular contact with party member to gauge the mood before the convention and support Laschet and the party, an unidentified health ministry spokesman told Spiegel.Laschet said Friday he did not think that the controversy over Spahn’s handling of the vaccine program would affect his own candidacy for CDU leader.“Jens Spahn is one of the popular German politicians,” Laschet said on ARD television. “But in the crisis it gets bumpy sometimes -- there are problems, the vaccine doesn’t come as quick as you think or whatever. He’s doing a good job.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-health-minister-mulling-a-run-for-chancellor-reports-101610249700650.html

Another officer tumbled over a railing into the crowd below after being body-slammed from behind. Members of the media were cursed, shoved and punched.A vast number of photos and videos captured the riot, which left five people dead. Many of the images were taken by the rioters themselves, few of whom wore masks that would have lowered not only their chances of contracting the coronavirus, but their chances of being identified. Some took pains to stand out.Jacob Anthony Chansley, an Arizona man seen in photos and video of the mob with a painted face and wearing a costume that included a horned, fur hat, was taken into custody Saturday and charged with counts that include violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.Chansley, more commonly known as Jake Angeli, will remain in custody in Arizona pending a detention hearing that will be scheduled during an initial court appearance early in the coming week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Esther Winne told The Associated Press by email. Chansley did not immediately respond to messages left via email and telephone.Chansley, who had become a staple in his costume at pro-Trump protests across the country, is now among dozens of people arrested in the wake of the Capitol invasion by a large mob of Trump supporters enraged over his election loss.The rioters took over the House and Senate chambers, smashed windows and waved Trump, American and Confederate flags.A Florida man accused of making off with Pelosi’s lectern during the chaos was arrested Friday night on a federal warrant and was being held Saturday without bail in Pinellas County, Florida. Jail records do not show if Adam Johnson, 36, of Parrish, Florida, has an attorney.Johnson was charged Saturday with theft, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds.The married father of five was quickly identified on social media by local residents as the man in a photo smiling as he walked through the Capitol rotunda carrying Pelosi’s lectern, The Bradenton Herald reported.Johnson posted on social media that he was in Washington, D.C., during Wednesday’s riots and included disparaging comments about the Black Lives Matter movement, according to The Bradenton Herald. Those posts were later deleted or taken down.During Wednesday's violence, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was wounded in a confrontation with attackers and was reportedly struck by a fire extinguisher. He died Thursday night. Another officer was crushed in a doorway, but it’s unclear what happened to that officer, whose plight was captured on camera and shared by the progressive organization Status Coup. Members of media organizations, including the AP and The New York Times, were also attacked.By Saturday, prosecutors had filed 17 cases in federal district court and 40 others in the District of Columbia Superior Court for a variety of offenses ranging from assaulting police officers to entering restricted areas of the U.S. Capitol, stealing federal property and threatening lawmakers.Prosecutors said additional cases remained under seal, dozens of other people were being sought by federal agents, and the U.S. attorney in Washington vowed Friday that “all options were on the table” for charges, including possibly sedition.Other notable arrests in the Capitol invasion include:— Doug Jensen, an Iowa man, was jailed early Saturday on federal charges, including trespassing and disorderly conduct counts, for his alleged role in the Capitol riot. Jensen, 41, of Des Moines, was being held without bond at the Polk County Jail and county sheriff's Sgt. Ryan Evans said he didn’t know if Jensen had an attorney. Video posted online during the storming of the Capitol showed a man who appears to be Jensen, who is white, pursuing a Black officer up an interior flight of stairs as a mob of people trails several steps behind. At several points, the officer says “get back,” to no avail.— Richard Barnett, an Arkansas man who was shown in a widely seen photo sitting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office with his boots on a desk after the storming of the Capitol, was arrested Friday by the FBI. Barnett, 60, turned himself in to FBI agents at the Benton County Sheriff’s Office in Bentonville, Arkansas. He is jailed in the Washington County Detention Center in nearby Fayetteville, Arkansas, without bond pending an initial court appearance, FBI Little Rock spokesman Connor Hagan said. No attorney is listed in online jail records for the Gravette, Arkansas, man.— Derrick Evans, a West Virginia state lawmaker who posted videos online showing himself pushing his way inside the Capitol, was arrested Friday by the FBI at his home and charged with entering restricted federal property. Evans, who faced bipartisan calls for him to step down, submitted a letter of resignation Saturday to West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice and apologized for his actions. Evans faces charges that he entered a restricted area of the U.S. Capitol after he livestreamed himself rushing into the building with a horde of rampaging Trump supporters. In the videos, Evans is seen fist-bumping a police officer and then milling around the rotunda as he shouted, “Our house!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-arrests-in-us-capitol-riot-as-more-video-reveals-brutality-101610237678024.html
10-01-2021||World||Pompeo lifts restrictions on interactions between Taiwanese and US diplomats||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between US officials and their Taiwanese counterparts, a move likely to anger China and increase tensions between Beijing and Washington in the waning days of President Donald Trump's presidency.China claims democratic and separately ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and regularly describes Taiwan as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up backing for the island country, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China.In a statement, Pompeo said that for several decades the State Department had created complex internal restrictions on interactions with Taiwanese counterparts by American diplomats, service members and other officials."The United States government took these actions unilaterally, in an attempt to appease the Communist regime in Beijing," Pompeo said in a statement."Today I am announcing that I am lifting all of these self-imposed restrictions," he added.The move appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said examples of the restrictions included Taiwanese officials not being able to enter the State Department, but instead having to meet at hotels."The Biden administration will rightly be unhappy that a policy decision like this was made in the final days of the Trump administration," Glaser said.An official with Biden's transition said that once Biden was in office he would continue to support "a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan."The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States in Washington, which serves as Taiwan's unofficial embassy, said the move showed the "strength and depth" of the United States' relationship with Taiwan.Pompeo, who has taken an increasingly hard-line stance toward China and identified it as the principal long-term threat faced by the United States, has repeatedly used the red-button Taiwan issue to push back against Beijing.In November, he appeared to call into question the long-standing US "one-China policy" by stating in a radio interview that Taiwan "has not been a part of China," causing Beijing to warn that behavior that undermined "China's core interests and interferes with China's domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack."The US ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, will visit Taiwan next week for meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders, prompting China to warn on Thursday they were playing with fire.Chinese fighter jets approached the island in August and September during the last two visits: by US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and US Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach, respectively.The United States is Taiwan's strongest international backer and arms supplier, and is obliged to help provide it with the means to defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act."The United States government maintains relationships with unofficial partners around the world, and Taiwan is no exception. ... Today’s statement recognizes that the US-Taiwan relationship need not, and should not, be shackled by self-imposed restrictions of our permanent bureaucracy," Pompeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-lifts-restrictions-on-interactions-between-taiwanese-and-us-diplomats-101610236897245.html
10-01-2021||World||Squelched by Twitter, Trump seeks new online megaphone||One Twitter wag joked about lights flickering on and off at the White House being Donald Trump signaling to his followers in Morse code after Twitter and Facebook squelched the president for inciting rebellion.Though deprived of his big online megaphones, Trump does have alternative options of much smaller reach, led by the far right-friendly Parler — even if Google removed it from its app store Friday and Apple threatened the same.Trump may launch his own platform. But that won't happen overnight, and free speech experts anticipate growing pressure on all social media platforms to curb incendiary speech as Americans take stock of Wednesday’s violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol by a Trump-incited mob.Twitter ended Trump’s nearly 12-year run on Friday. In shuttering his account it cited a tweet to his 89 million followers that he planned to skip President-elect Joe Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration that it said gave rioters license to converge on Washington once again.Facebook and Instagram have suspended Trump at least until Inauguration Day. Twitch and Snapchat also have disabled Trump’s accounts, while Shopify took down online stores affiliated with the president and Reddit removed a Trump subgroup. Twitter also banned Trump loyalists including former national security advisor Michael Flynn in a sweeping purge of accounts promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory and the Capitol insurrection. Some had hundreds of thousands of followers.In a statement Friday, Trump said: "We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the near future.”The “immense power that the social media platforms have as gatekeepers of public discourse” had been flexed as never before — a power that should be troubling even for supporters of the Trump ban, tweeted Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.Experts are betting Trump pops up on Parler, a 2-year-old magnet for the far right that claims more than 12 million users and where his sons Eric and Don Jr. are already active. Parler hit headwinds, though, on Friday as Google yanked its smartphone app from its app store for allowing postings that seek “to incite ongoing violence in the U.S.” and Apple threatened to do the same, giving Parler a 24-hour ultimatum.Apple told Parler executives in an email Friday it got complaints the app was being used to “plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.”Parler CEO John Matze complained on his site of being scapegoated. “Standards not applied to Twitter, Facebook or even Apple themselves, apply to Parler.” He said he “won’t cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech.”Losing access to the app stores of Google and Apple — whose operating systems power hundreds of millions of smartphones — severely limits Parler's reach, though it will continue to be accessible via web browser. Another potential landing spot for Trump is Gab — though both Google and Apple booted it from their app stores in 2017.Online speech experts expect social media companies led by Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube to more vigorously police hate speech and incitement in the wake of the Capitol rebellion, as Western democracies led by Nazism-haunted Germany already do.David Kaye, a University of California-Irvine law professor and former U.N. special rapporteur on free speech believes the Parlers of the world will also face pressure from the public and law enforcement as will little-known sites where further pre-inauguration disruption is now apparently being organized. They include MeWe, Wimkin, TheDonald.win and Stormfront, according to a report released Saturday by The Althea Group, which tracks disinformation.Kaye rejects arguments by U.S. conservatives including the president’s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, that the Trump ban savaged the First Amendment, which prohibits the government from restricting free expression. “Silencing people, not to mention the President of the US, is what happens in China not our country,” Haley tweeted.“It’s not like the platforms’ rules are draconian. People don’t get caught in violations unless they do something clearly against the rules,” said Kaye. And not just individual citizens have free speech rights. “The companies have their freedom of speech, too.”While initially arguing their need to be neutral on speech, Twitter and Facebook gradually yielded to public pressure drawing the line especially when the so-called Plandemic video emerged early in the Covid-19 pandemic urging people not to wear masks, noted civic media professor Ethan Zuckerman of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.Zuckerman expects the Trump de-platforming may spur important online shifts. First, there may be an accelerated splintering of the social media world along ideological lines."Trump will pull a lot of audience wherever he goes,” he said. That could mean more platforms with smaller, more ideologically isolated audiences.A splintering could push people towards extremes — or make extremism less infectious, he said: Maybe people looking for a video about welding on YouTube will no longer find themselves being offered an unrelated QAnon video. Alternative media systems that are less top-down managed and more self-governing could also emerge.Zuckerman also expects major debate about online speech regulation, including in Congress.“I suspect you will see efforts from the right arguing that there shouldn’t be regulations on acceptable speech,” he said. “I think you will see arguments from the democratic side that speech is a public health issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/squelched-by-twitter-trump-seeks-new-online-megaphone-101610236811024.html

10-01-2021||World||China: WHO team’s Wuhan visit preparations underway||hina confirmed on Saturday that preparations were still ongoing for a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to Wuhan to investigate the origins of Covid-19, following a rare rebuke from the UN body over a delay to the long-planned trip.The comments came after WHO chief Tedros Adhanom said on Tuesday he was “very disappointed” that Beijing had yet to finalise permission as the team of experts had begun travelling to China to explore the beginnings of the coronavirus.On Saturday, National Health Commission vice minister Zeng Yixin said, “The specific time is being determined, we are ready here. As long as these experts complete the procedures and confirm their schedule, we will go to Wuhan together to carry out investigations,” he said.In the US, a new, more infectious strain of the coronavirus has spread to at least eight US states, official data showed on Friday. The B.1.1.7 strain, which emerged in Britain late last year, has been shown to be between 40% and 70% more contagious than variants which have spread previously. Data from the US CDC showed on Friday that the strain has been detected in eight states, with California and Florida the worst affected.The pandemic continued to rage across America as the country logged a record new daily virus caseload. Almost 290,000 new cases were reported in the United Status within 24 hours on Friday according to Johns Hopkins University, a day after the world’s worst-hit nation recorded a daily record of nearly 4,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-who-team-s-wuhan-visit-preparations-underway-101610221088485.html
10-01-2021||World||Man pictured sitting at Pelosi’s desk arrested||The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday arrested an Arkansas man who was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office following the storming of the US Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters, authorities announced.Richard Barnett turned himself in to FBI agents at the Benton County sheriff’s office in Bentonville, Arkansas, said FBI Little Rock spokesman Connor Hagan. Barnett is jailed in the Washington County detention centre in nearby Fayetteville, Arkansas, without bond pending an initial court appearance.Barnett is from Gravette in northwest Arkansas. He has identified himself on social media as a Trump supporter and gun rights advocate.Barnett, 60, was charged for entering Pelosi’s office, where he “left a note and removed some of the speaker’s mail”. He faces charges for knowingly entering restricted grounds without authority; violent entry and disorderly conduct; and theft of public property or records. If convicted, he faces up to a year in prison.Authorities were able to identify Barnett through photos taken by news media. They also used footage from inside the Capitol and a video interview Barnett gave to a reporter.Separately, a laptop was stolen from Pelosi’s office during the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday, one of her aides said on Friday. Drew Hammill, an aide to Democrat Pelosi, said on Twitter that the laptop was used for presentations.Late on Friday, a man photographed carrying Pelosi’s lectern from the House chambers was arrested. Adam Christian Johnson, 36, of Parrish, Florida, was arrested on a warrant and booked into the Pinellas County jail. No bond was allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-pictured-sitting-at-pelosi-s-desk-arrested-101610220774721.html
