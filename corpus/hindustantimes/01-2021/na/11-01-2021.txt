Ahead of the ninth round of talks between the government and the farmers on January 15, the Supreme Court pulled up the Centre on Monday for its handling of the protests against the new laws and said it was extremely disappointed with the way talks were going. The apex court added that it will set up a committee, which will be headed by a former chief justice of India (CJI) to resolve the deadlock.Also Read | SC to hear pleas on farm laws, protest at Delhi borders todayTotal eight round of talks, including one each of January 4 and 8, have failed to resolve the deadlock between the government and various farm union leaders, who are representing the protesting farmers.
