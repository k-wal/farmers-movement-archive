According to the newspaper, all the troops were pulled back in military vehicles so that the Indian side could see and verify. The withdrawal, as per the South China Morning Post report, involved troops temporarily deployed from units in the Xinjiang and Tibet military regions.The Indian Army has also confirmed withdrawal of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) training units 1000 kilometres to 500 kilometres from the vast Tibetan plateau without giving out any numbers. The Army, however, says that there is no withdrawal from the friction points in East Ladakh with both armies locked in a stand-off since May 5, 2020.While there is no way to verify the claims of the Chinese newspaper independently, movement of 10,000 troops or three brigades or one division in military parlance cannot be missed either by satellite imagery or by communication intercepts. The troops will have to be withdrawn either by vehicles or sent back to their barracks by transport aircraft. As the Tibetan plateau is more than two million square kilometres and is largely treeless, there would be photographic evidence of the activity. Either way, the withdrawal would largely be part of the feel-good factor since the PLA, with metalled roads to the last post and advanced landing grounds all along the 3,488 kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC), has the capacity to fully deploy within a week.According to national security planners, the Indian military will continue to be on alert till such time the PLA does not restore status quo ante on the East Ladakh LAC. They have also ruled out any withdrawal of Indian troops from the contested points till the agreed disengagement and de-escalation takes place.What is interesting to note is that the PLA conducts annual exercises at Xaidulla or Shahidullah Garrison, 94 kilometres from Karakoram Pass. This pass is merely a stone’s throw from Daulat Beg Oldi. In the 19th century, Dogra general Zorawar Singh had captured all areas up to this strategically-located town. Known as Sanshili barracks and located on the caravan route between Ladakh and Tarim Basin, Xaidulla has been holding PLA training exercises annually except for 2018.In 2020, a division plus PLA troops exercised from March to October 2020 in an area of 100-150 square kilometres with elements of six mechanised infantry division and four motorised division coming down to join their comrades in the stand-off with Indian Army. It is still not clear whether these elements have gone back. Similar training exercises take place at Phari Dzong across the Sikkim border in Chumbi Valley.There is, however, evidence to indicate that the PLA's work and engineering force deployed to upgrade infrastructure in occupied Aksai Chin has moved back after completion of work last month.As many as 320 vehicles moved out and some 40-45 temporary shelters were taken out after the completion of infrastructure work such as building of roads, winter shelters for deployed troops and sophisticated military equipment like surface-to-air missiles, radars, tanks and multi-barrel rocket launchers.The Chinese news report says that the Central Military Commission is sure that it is impossible for both sides to fight in such extremely cold weather in the Himalayas and hence the troops have been sent to home barracks to rest.The newspaper has also quoted a retired Indian diplomat, saying that the reported Chinese move could prompt India to consider a similar response. The Indian Army should be wary of such mind games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-should-be-wary-of-chinese-mind-games-101610513705716.html

The man was identified by a single name as Anoop, a resident of Naujhil in Mathura, who had a ₹1 lakh reward on his arrest. Anoop and three accomplices had allegedly kidnapped a doctor named Nirvikalp Agarwal while on his way home near Govardhan crossing in Mathura. They let him go the same night after his family paid the ₹52-lakh ransom. Police said the family, fearing for Agarwal’s life, informed them only after the ransom was paid.In February 2020, Mathura police had arrested a man named Nitesh from Naujhil in connection with the case. Nitesh allegedly said Anoop, along with two other men Sunny Malik and Mahesh Kumar, were behind the abduction. Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida-STF, said Anoop was hiding in a rented accommodation in Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar. “The STF team and arrested him from there on Wednesday. Since, he was wanted in Mathura, the team took him to Mathura for formalities. On the way, he asked the police to stop so that he could relieve himself. He then managed to snatch a policeman’s gun, opened fire and tried to escape. The police returned fire in which the suspect was injured in his left leg and was arrested,” he said. The suspect allegedly told police that he worked as a technician and was earlier arrested for stealing batteries from mobile towers in 2017. In jail, he allegedly made his acquaintance with Malik. Police said Anoop was wanted in about 20 criminal cases in Western UP. He was produced in court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-wanted-in-doctor-s-abduction-arrested-by-noida-stf-101610561723269.html

The glanders – a life-threatening infectious disease in equines (horse family) by bacteria Burkholderia mallei -- is transmittable to the humans causing lung, kidney and respiratory issues. One such asymptomatic horse, during the routine sampling, was confirmed of glanders last week, officials said. The horse, still with the owner, is being closely monitored and another sample will be sent within a week’s time to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s National Research Centre for Equines, Hisar (Haryana) for further confirmation. If confirmed, the animal will be euthanised or scientifically culled through medicines, veterinarians said. Meanwhile, more samples were collected and sent to Hisar, as a precautionary measure. “We have collected about 11 samples from horses at veterinary hospital in Bisrakh area and nine samples at the government veterinary hospital in Barola area. The serum samples were collected on Tuesday and will be sent for testing,” said Dr Abhishek Dabar, veterinary doctor, animal husbandry department, GB Nagar. The fatal disease was used as biological weapon by the Nazi army during the World War-II, a veterinarian stated.Speaking of the positive case at Dadri, the vet said that they will be sending more samples for testing. “The lab had confirmed glanders in the horse, but since its asymptomatic, the centre at Hisar also cross-checks with us again. So within a week, we will have to send more samples. The sample collected second time also includes nasal swap,” Dabar added. According to the officials, the department had been collecting random samples, a common practice being followed since 2013 when about 30 horses were found affected with glanders, following which samples of over 5,000 horses were checked and those 30 infected were culled. “The symptoms among animals includes leaky nose, health deterioration, body ulcers, among others. The sample from Dadri was collected during the random and routine sampling. The horse has been asymptomatic and a retesting will be done. If finally confirmed, it will be culled and deep buried. Against this, the owner is given a compensation of ₹25,000,” said Dr VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer, GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vets-check-horses-after-a-positive-case-of-glanders-disease-in-greater-noida-101610561663686.html

The police said that the duo fraudulently withdrew the money from the bank account of a former IAF officer. Chetan Singh, the complainant in the case, said that his father Suresh Kumar Yadav is a retired wing commander and presently lives in Myanmar. According to him, a group of criminals got Yadav’s mobile number (linked to the bank account) reissued on forged documents and also managed to get a new debit card issued, and then used the card to fraudulently withdraw the money from ATMs and also for shopping gold. The complainant said that his father shifted to Myanmar about 10 months ago. “My father has an account with a private bank in Sector Alpha 1. We had a good relation with the bank manager who was transferred to other branch a few months ago,” Singh said. Singh further said that the mobile phone number linked to his father’s bank account was presently not in use. “On October 6 last year, the same manager informed us that there was some suspicious transactions from my father’s bank account. We visited the bank and found that ₹67 lakh was fraudulently withdrawn from my father’s account in the first week of October,” he said. The account holder did not receive any notification of transaction at registered email ID, he said. Singh then filed a complaint at Sector Beta 2 police station and a case was registered against unknown persons under Section 66 of IT Act on October 31 last year. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that on Wednesday, the police arrested two suspects – Satish Rana, a resident of Bagpat, and Anuj Singh, a resident of Bulandshahr. Both suspects live on rented accommodations in Greater Noida. “The two suspects admitted that they had committed the crime. They were in contact with their accomplices -- Pradeep Rana and mastermind Ravi. Primary investigation suggests that Ravi was in touch with a bank employee, who leaked the information about Yadav’s account,” Pandey said. Police said that the account holder’s linked phone number was not active for some months. “The gang members visited a mobile shop and got the same mobile number issued on forged identity. Once the number became active, they called the bank’s customer care and asked to deliver the debit card afresh,” Pandey said. The bank delivered the debit card to the account holder’s address, but the suspects received the delivery from the delivery boy on the way, said the police. “The suspects got the debit card, along with PIN, and withdrew ₹11 lakh cash from different ATMs. Further, they also bought gold coins from some jewellery shops using the card. The actual account holder had no information about this transaction. We scanned CCTV footage from different spots and then arrested the two suspects,” Pandey said. Police have launched a search for the bank employee and two other suspects in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-former-iaf-officer-loses-67-lakh-in-atm-card-fraud-2-held-101610561664154.html
13-01-2021||Noida||Noida police to develop app for biometric attendance of domestic helps||Noida Police on Wednesday said it was developing a mobile application to record details of people who worked as domestic help in the city, including their fingerprints.While the city already requires residents to get their domestic helps verified, taking their fingerprints is a first. And while legal, an analyst termed it unfair.Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Sing said that the system is being fine tuned and did not commit to a deadline of when the project will be rolled out. The system, he said, was mooted after several crimes were reported in residential societies and domestic helps were suspects in a few of them.“Most of these workers are loyal to their employers. However, there are instances when some people masquerade themselves as domestic workers and commit crimes. This initiative is to check such people and take actions,” said the commissioner who completed one year in office on Wednesday. The commissionerate system was introduced in the district to streamline policing and improve law and order. “We will soon announce the mobile app’s launch date and following that, the Noida Police will organise camps in different societies and ask people to register their domestic helps. We will record their fingerprints and other details which will be used for safety and security purposes,” said Singh. Apar Gupta, executive director of Internet Freedom Foundation, said that the police could had powers to take fingerprints under the preventive measures as given in the criminal procedure code and police manual. “These preventive measures are normally taken against people with criminal history. Domestic helps do not have any such issues and hence collecting their finger prints is not good. This is like considering domestic helps as suspects (even before they had done anything),” Gupta said.The police commissioner said that to deal with the cyber crime, Noida Police will also sign a memorandum of understanding with a big tech firm on Thursday. “This will help us in solving crime cases and also creating awareness among public,” he said. The police also organised Jansamwad programme at each police stations where they interacted with the local residents and received their feedback on the commissionerate’s completing one year. “People want more police patrolling and increased presence in certain pockets of the city and industrial areas. High rise residents want action to be taken against abandoned vehicles, and better regulation of traffic at roundabouts. Senior officials have assured that they will look into our issues. We have also been informed about more CCTV cameras and better surveillance in the district under the safe city project in the next month,” said Sumit Basoiya, a resident of La Residentia society under the Bisrakh police jurisdiction.Harish Chander, DCP Noida Central, said that police received feedback from the public and listened to their concerns about law, order, traffic, patrolling, and police perception. “Each area has a unique set of problems and we hope to address them all soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-police-to-develop-app-for-biometric-attendance-of-domestic-helps-101610561663326.html

The farmers alleged that the government is not ready to listen to them. The harvest festival of Lohri was celebrated on Wednesday across north Indian states, including Punjab and Haryana, and bonfires were lit during celebrations. Thousands of farmers from UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab are camping at the UP Gate border since November 28 and also blocking the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway since December 3. “We have no option left but to show our resentment by burning the copies of the three farm laws. The government should consider the demands raised by the farmers. Now, our core committee will decide the future course of action,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of the UP Gate protest site committee, said, “Thousands of farmers celebrated the festival at the UP Gate away from homes and burnt the copies of the three laws since the government is not listening to our demands.” Meanwhile, the committee on Wednesday decided that they will install Wi-fi systems due to poor network coverage in the area and will also install new CCTV cameras as the site besides providing more walkie-talkie handsets to their volunteers. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and directed the formation of a four-member committee to resolve the deadlock between farmers and the government. The farmers at the UP Gate after the directions from the court said that they would continue their protest till the three farm laws get repealed and also said that they would carry out their proposed ‘tractor march’ to Delhi on the Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-up-gate-protesting-farmers-burn-copies-of-farm-laws-on-lohri-101610561363710.html

Fire department officials could not confirm the cause of the fire but suspected that it could have been after laptop was left for charging overnight.The incident happened at Leela Homes high-rise in the house of paediatrician Dr. Puneet Kalra who said he had gone to sleep at around 4.30am and left the laptop to charge.“Around 7.30 am, my wife woke me up saying that there was a fire in our flat. We tried to go to the drawing room but there was fire and thick smoke. Unable to move out, we took our seven-year-old daughter to the balcony from where we started shouting for help,” said Dr Kalra. “Then we heard a blast, which could have been the air conditioner.”“Our neighbours in the opposite flat came to our aid help,” he said. “They got a ladder and put it across our balconies. Our daughter, then my wife and finally I crawled over.”The fire department officials said that they got a call around 7am and deployed three fire tenders and about a dozen firemen from nearby Vaishali fire station. By the time they reached there though, the family had been rescued.“One of our teams went up the stairs to reach the flat with water pipes. Another team tried to douse the flame from outside,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. “It is likely that the fire started as the laptop was left on charging mode on a sofa and the heat or a spark caused the fire.”A few residents caught the blaze on their phone cameras that later made it to social media.“We estimate that we lost goods worth ₹3-4 lakh” said Kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/laptop-left-on-charging-mode-starts-fire-at-sixth-floor-flat-in-ghaziabad-high-rise-three-family-members-rescued-101610560703232.html

Greater Noida and Ghaziabad turned out to be the top-two polluted cities in the country. The air quality index (AQI) of Noida deteriorated to “very-poor” for the first time since January 9 when it was “poor”. According to the weather analysts, the minimum temperatures fell and wind was calm on Wednesday leading to poor ventilation.“The wind was calm through evening hours and even at its peak it was around just 10-12 kmph unlike two-three days back when the stronger winds pulled the region out of the very polluted zone. The day had also been misty with shallow fog, which tends to keep particle pollutants in the air,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. Noida’s AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500 on Wednesday was 348 against 278 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 398 against 312 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 388 against 324 a day earlier. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The major pollutant or PM2.5 in the region also spiked from about four times the standards. The average PM2.5 for Wednesday for Noida was 222.14 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³), against 150.90 µg/m³ a day earlier. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 252.36 µg/m³ against 153.94 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 levels for Ghaziabad against 238.66µg/m³ against 161.34 µg/m³ a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m³. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate further due to poor ventilation conditions. “The minimum temperature is likely to fall and surface winds are likely to slow down gradually. The AQI is likely to slip from the middle to the higher end of Very Poor by tomorrow. Extremely low ventilation conditions and lowering of boundary layer height are forecasted for 15th Jan which will lead to further deterioration and SAFAR model predicts that the AQI will touch higher end of Very Poor to Severe category on 15th and 16th Jan. No quick relief to the deteriorated situation is expected in the next few days,” said SAFAR on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noidas-air-quality-enters-very-poor-greater-noida-worst-in-country-101610560643213.html

Garg, who was addressing a press conference at the Mini Secretariat on Wednesday morning, also said that no major changes in circle rates have been proposed this year and rates have been increased only for areas at the periphery of Gurugram.A circle rate is a minimum value set by the government at which a property can be sold. Garg also said that circle rates will be implemented from April 1 this year and that the next revision would be from next January.“The exercise to formulate the circle rates was carried out at the tehsil level by taking local inputs. Previous rates and present market conditions were taken into account while calculating these rates. We shall consider the objections after January 15 and send a final proposal to the state government after February 15,” Garg said, adding that the proposal was posted on the website of the district administration on December 15 for public access.Referring to the proposed circle rates for 2021, Garg said that no major change in rates has been proposed for Gurugram and Sohna tehsils, with changes proposed for Badshahpur, Qadipur and Harsaru sub-tehsils. In Pataudi, the committee has proposed an 8% increase in rates for residential areas and a 12% increase for commercial areas. For Farrukhnagar, a blanket increase of circle rates from 2% to 10% has been proposed for commercial, residential and agricultural properties.The district administration has also proposed an increase in circle rates in Manesar. Garg said that earlier, plots located in the industrial area of IMT Manesar were kept out of the purview of circle rates so far, but that they have decided to implement a revision from this year.For Wazirabad tehsil, the administration has proposed an increase in circle rates for group housing societies located along the Golf Course Road. Circle rates of ₹9,000 per square feet and ₹7,000 per square feet have been fixed for Emaar MGF projects and Emerald Greens, and The Icon, respectively, while a rate of ₹23,000 per square feet has been proposed for Aralias, Magnolias and Camellias.Referring to the problems being faced by buyers and sellers in the registration of properties, Garg said the system would be streamlined further to ensure that it becomes seamless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dc-asks-stakeholders-to-submit-objections-to-proposed-circle-rates-101610559685373.html

The suspect was identified as Vijay Kumar Mandal of Supaul in Bihar. He lived in a rented room in Kanhai village and was running a mobile phone shop for the last four years. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that they had visited the shop twice in the last two days and bought three SIM cards without giving any identification documents. “We deployed two people near the shop who kept a close watch on his operations and Wednesday, we caught him red-handed and recovered a register which mentioned all details of the SIM cards and name and IDs used on their behalf,” he said. Budhiraja said that they started sending decoy customers after receiving a tip-off. Mandal used to allegedly supply SIM cards of different telecom operators and activate the same without any identity proof, he said. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, Crime Investigation Department, said they received a tip-off on Monday about the illegal sale. “On average, he used to sell 10 SIM cards daily for between ₹1,000 and ₹1,200, without taking any details. He has sold more than a 1,000 SIM cards in the last four years and we are probing if anyone else is also part of this fraud,” he said. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Sushant Lok police station on Wednesday. The suspect was taken on a one-day remand for questioning. The police recovered 44 SIM cards and initiated a probe to find the source of these SIM cards in Gurugram. On October 22, 2020, the same squad had arrested another person man for allegedly selling multiple SIM cards on seven identity cards.

13-01-2021||Gurugram||Hooda takes aim at farm laws in Gurugram||Former Haryana chief minister and the leader of the opposition, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the farm laws proposed by the Central government should be withdrawn so that the ongoing farmers’ protests can come to an end.Hooda, who was in Gurugram on Wednesday, said that the farm laws would harm not only the farmers’ interests but also that of workers and consumers, as they are aimed at “giving an advantage to large corporations.”Hooda said that the present state government had lost the trust of both the public and the legislators. “Such governments automatically fall due to the burden of their own failures. The Congress wants to move a no-confidence motion against the government on the issue of farmers. As soon as a no-confidence motion comes in the assembly, the truth of the rebellious MLAs will also be revealed to the public. Everyone will know if they stand with the government or the farmers,” he said.The former CM also alleged that the farm laws were designed to help corporations profit at the cost of producers and consumers. “When the produce of the farmer comes to the market, the rates will be brought down and once the profiteers buy the entire produce, it will be sold to the general consumer at an expensive rate. Similarly, if the government purchases stop, then the government will also stop giving cheap food grains to below poverty line (BPL) families,” he said.Urging the state and central governments to repeal the laws, the Congress leader said that the government should understand the gravity of the situation and factor in the condition of the farmers.Samay Singh Bhati, the president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kisan Morcha for Haryana, said that a majority of the farming community in the state is in support of the three proposed laws and they would create awareness across the state in this matter. “The Congress and its leadership are misleading the farmers. We must remember how many scandals and corruptions were exposed during the rule of previous Congress regimes. They don’t have the interest of farmers in mind, but they just want to fuel the protests. The stay on laws is fine and amendments are welcome, but these should not be repealed,” said Bhati at a press conference in Gurugram.Meanwhile, farmers and workers in Gurugram held a protest against the farm laws on Wednesday. Workers associated with trade unions in Gurugram-Manesar industrial complex wore black bands as a mark of protest against the farm laws. Trade union and Left party leaders also gathered at Rajiv Chowk in the afternoon and burnt copies of the farm laws. The trade union leaders said that they fully support the farmers in their struggle to get these laws repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hooda-takes-aim-at-farm-laws-in-gurugram-101610559685832.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||People must not be reluctant to get vaccinated: Health officials||To assuage public apprehensions regarding any possible side effects from the Covid-19 vaccines, senior health department and district administration officials on Wednesday stated that they are ready to get vaccinated first. Asserting that Covid-19 vaccination will be a voluntary exercise, they clarified that the general public will get the vaccine jab once healthcare and frontline workers, people above 50 years and those below 50 years with comorbidities are covered. In a press conference at the Mini Secretariat on Wednesday, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Over 40,000 healthcare workers will first get the vaccine jab. I am ready to get vaccinated first to deal with apprehensions about the vaccine. Every vaccine has minor side effects like redness at the injection site or fever. People should not fear or be reluctant to get vaccinated. Therefore, I would appeal to prominent doctors of the city and deputy commissioner Yash Garg to get vaccinated along with me.”Garg, who was present at the conference, agreed to the appeal. He said, “Herd immunity in the population can be developed either through letting the virus transmit from one person to the other or by vaccination. Like other inoculations given at birth, it is likely that Covid-19 vaccine, after a certain time period, might become a part of the immunisation programme. Citizens should not be scared of the vaccine .” Garg said that people should take preventive measure until at least 70% of the population is vaccinated against coronavirus.In the state, almost 0.25 million healthcare workers have to be vaccinated, followed by 0.45 million frontline workers. The inoculation of healthcare workers is set to start from January 16, while the data of frontline workers has to be finalised before January 25. For others, union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan earlier this week said that the entire population can be vaccinated after prioritising risk groups, without giving any specific dateline. When asked about the vaccination of the general population, Yadav said, “It is difficult to comment as there has been no direction from the state or central government.” Going by the Covid-19 vaccine guideline issued by the union ministry of health and family welfare, there will be a self-registration tab on the Co-WIN platform for the general population. The portal is currently accessed by health department employees to register healthcare and frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/people-must-not-be-reluctant-to-get-vaccinated-health-officials-101610559684887.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||Dense fog envelops city, minimum temperature at 4.6°C||Mercury levels plummeted as cold winds from the Himalayas continued to sweep the plains for the second consecutive day, bringing the minimum temperature in the city to 4.6 degrees Celsius. Air quality in the city also deteriorated to its worst in over a week and the situation expected to persist till the next week, as per official forecasts.The city was enveloped by a blanket of dense fog on Wednesday morning, which gave way to partially clouded skies during the afternoon.While Gurugram’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the temperatures on Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department’s nearest monitoring station in Delhi’s Palam area recorded a maximum temperature of 15.2 degrees Celsius, while the minimum stood at 4.6 degrees Celsius. This indicates a steep drop from warmer conditions a few days ago. The Palam observatory on January 9 had recorded a maximum temperature of 19.2 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 11.4 degrees Celsius.“Until Monday, we were seeing temperatures above normal. A cloud hanging above the city under the influence of a passing western disturbance had managed to trap the heat and warm up the air, but now that regular northwesterly winds are blowing again, cold drafts from the Himalayas are blowing over the plains and pushing the temperature down,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre in Delhi.The IMD has currently sounded a cold wave alert for parts of north India, including Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. A cold day can be defined as a diurnal cycle in which the minimum temperature drops to 4 degrees Celsius or below, whereas a severe cold day is when the minimum temperature drops to below 2 degrees Celsius. A cold wave, on the other hand, is characterized by a simultaneous dip in both minimum and maximum temperature readings. IMD officials said that both cold days and cold waves remain a possibility in the next two to three days.As per the IMD’s seven-day weather forecast for the region, moderate to very dense fog is expected to prevail in the mornings due to a high level of relative humidity after recent spells of rain. The maximum and minimum temperatures, at the end of the week, are expected to settle at about 7 degrees Celsius and 17 degrees Celsius, respectively.Air quality in the city remained in the poor category, with a reading of 276 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin on Wednesday. However, Gurugram and neighbouring Manesar remained the least polluted major cities in the National Capital Region, as Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad all recorded very poor air, with AQI readings ranging between 350 and 390.The early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR stated: “Winds are likely to slow down and ventilation conditions to remain very poor from 14th to 18th January which will lead to further deterioration in air quality... Air quality is likely to remain largely in the upper end of the very poor category with chances of reaching in severe category owing to poor ventilation conditions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dense-fog-envelops-city-minimum-temperature-at-46c-101610559683714.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||10 faecal samples sent for avian influenza test||The animal husbandry and wildlife departments on Tuesday dispatched 10 faecal samples of wild birds, obtained from the Sultanpur National Park in Farrukhnagar, to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar for testing. This is in addition to the crow and egret carcass samples, retrieved from the Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park in Sector 56, sent on January 8 for testing avian influenza.Lab results for both sets of samples expected within the next three days, officials confirmed.At a press conference on Wednesday morning, deputy commissioner Yash Garg spoke of the threat of avian influenza for the first time. “There are no indications of an outbreak, but we are prepared to launch a containment operation if a case of bird flu is detected. We are in touch with the animal husbandry department, which is monitoring the health of poultry, as well as the wildlife department. We have to remain on alert as we are hearing lots of news of avian influenza from different places,” Garg said.Faecal samples from other popular birding destinations, including Basai and Najafgarh, may also be collected and sent if those from Sultanpur do not provide conclusive results. “If they are positive, then an outbreak may be assumed. If they are negative or inconclusive, we will keep looking. Field surveys are being conducted every day. The Civil Hospital in Farrukhnagar also dispatched a medical officer to inspect the Sultanpur area yesterday, to be sure,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector.Chahal did not specify the species of birds from which faecal samples were collected on Tuesday.Despite the death of over 400,000 poultry birds in Panchkula district last month and proximity to three states — Rajasthan, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh — where avian influenza outbreaks have been confirmed, the situation in Gurugram remains business as usual, officials said, except for a few suspicious deaths at the Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park.They pointed to the nature of the district’s poultry industry, which is relatively small and disorganised in comparison to other parts of the state, as a possible reason for a deferment of the outbreak.Dr Ramphal Mann, a senior veterinarian with the animal husbandry department, said, “Gurugram, at one point, did have a flourishing broiler business, but that was more than a decade ago. As the area became more and more urbanised, large-scale commercial poultry enterprises started moving out to areas where land was cheaper. Presently, the demand for poultry and eggs is met by smaller backyard farmers, and is mostly consumed within the district. There are no organised mandis or even large bird markets, so very little intermingling of flocks happens. This could be one reason why the outbreak hasn’t found its way into bird farms yet.”As per official data, Gurugram’s poultry industry is a fraction of that in districts of Panchkula, Karnal and Panipat. While Gurugram has an estimated poultry population of 148,532 birds, Karnal’s poultry farms have over 63 times that number, with an estimated 9,469,646 poultry birds. In Panchkula and Panipat, the estimated number of poultry is about 5,874,419 and 5,138,898 birds, respectively.“Even if an outbreak is detected, the scale of response required is much smaller and can be easily managed,” said Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director, animal husbandry department.However, officials cautioned that Gurgram happens to be a prime location for migratory birds, which flock to the wetlands in Basai, Najafgarh and Sultanpur between October and March. “These wild birds are natural reservoirs of avian influenza. They may not fall seriously ill or die, but say a crow or a pigeon happens to catch the virus from a wild bird and then interacts with poultry in backyard units, it could set off bird deaths at chicken farms,” said Chahal, emphasising that there is no evidence of unusual poultry deaths, as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/10-faecal-samples-sent-for-avian-influenza-test-101610559684297.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||May deadline set for monsoon preparedness at eight key roads||The city’s civic agencies have shortlisted eight key stretches for executing monsoon preparedness measures and have set a deadline of May 31 for completion of the work.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) will be laying new drains, repairing or widening stormwater drains along CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, the stretch from St Thomas Marg to Ghata T-point, Central Peripheral Road, Old Railway Road, Sheetla Mata Road, Bajgehra Road, Jwala Mill Road and Khandsa stretch on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway.Following massive flooding of the city and seven underpasses on August 19 and 20 in 2019, the MCG, GMDA, district administration and traffic police, in a meeting a week later, had decided to formulate an action plan to prevent a repeat of the incident.As per the joint action plan of the civic agencies, preparedness measures at the eight key roads have been listed as a priority, besides construction of check dams in the Aravallis, ahead of the next monsoon.To resolve waterlogging issues on the CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, located next to the Medanta underpass, a new stormwater line would be set up by the agencies. The original drainage lines were covered during the construction of the underpass in 2017 and GMDA officials are yet to identify them. Hence, instead, they have now opted to lay a new stormwater drain along the stretch between Rajiv Chowk and Bakhtawar Chowk.To resolve waterlogging related issues in DLF Phase-4, sectors 43, 54 and 56, the open stormwater drain running between St Thomas Marg and Ghata T-point, along the Chakkarpur Bundh, will be de-silted and cleaned. “The entire open drain will be levelled. At certain points, the drain is elevated, while at some points, it is at a depression due to which the flow of rainwater gets hampered. In addition, we will also be linking the drain to the master stormwater drains in DLF Phase 4, by constructing a new 200-metre pipeline. This way, the carrying capacity of the drains will also increase and waterlogging issues will be addressed,” a senior GMDA official said.To resolve issues on other stretches, officials have decided to construct stormwater drains along the entire length of the CPR, lay a new drain along Old Railway Road and Bajgehra Road, and clean the entire leg of the master stormwater drains along the Sheetla Mata Road, besides identifying points where repairs are needed.Officials have also identified Jwala Mill Road as a stretche where extensive monsoon preparedness measures need to be executed. However, they are yet to finalise an action plan for the stretch.The MCG has also decided to build a 2.5-kilometre stormwater line to link the drainage lines of the service lanes along the expressway at Narsinghpur to the Badshahpur drain, which is located nearby.“Overall, 19 points have been identified by the GMDA and the MCG where action needs to be taken. Most of these points are located near residential areas while the eight are major stretches. The departments concerned have been allocated duties and directed to complete them before May 31 at any cost, to avoid flooding,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer, GMDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/may-deadline-set-for-monsoon-preparedness-at-eight-key-roads-101610559683194.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||45,000 vaccine doses to arrive today, inoculation to take weeks instead of days||The state health department allocated 44,950 doses of the Covishield coronavirus vaccine to Gurugram on Wednesday, according to senior health department officials, who added that the vaccination will take place over weeks instead of three days.According to officials, the vaccine will arrive in the district on Thursday and the vaccination process of healthcare workers in the district will start on January 16. However, the department has now changed its vaccination strategy, with officials confirming that healthcare workers would be vaccinated over several days or weeks, instead of three days, as proposed earlier.Earlier this week, district health officials had planned to inoculate over 36,000 healthcare workers, of government and private facilities, in three days by holding a vaccination drive at almost 161 session sites. “The plan has to be revised according to the fresh guidelines issued by the state and centre. It is confirmed that vaccination drive to cover healthcare workers in the first phase will continue for days or weeks,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Even the union ministry of health and family welfare, in a series of tweets on Wednesday, clarified that the vaccination process has to stabilised, without haste. The ministry tweeted: “States have been advised to organize vaccination sessions taking into account 10% reserve/wastage doses and average of 100 vaccinations/session/day. Therefore, any undue haste on the parts of States to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised.”Further, it tweeted: “States and UTs have been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilizes and moves forward.”Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, was in the city on Wednesday to inspect the Wazirabad session site, which will be linked with the vaccine launch event of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for two-way communication on January 16.He said, “Within a week after January 16, the pace of the vaccination will be clear. The future strategy depends upon the vaccine supply. After healthcare workers, frontline workers will be inoculated. Their data has to be finalised by January 25.”Yadav, on the other hand, said that it will take a couple of days to devise the vaccination plan as it has to be discussed with private stakeholders too. In Gurugram, as per the vaccine allocation list, over 43,070 are healthcare workers employed by the state government as well as those practising in private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. At least 1,820 are those commissioned by the Central government, while 60 health workers are under the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS).They have to be placed in groups of 100 for every finalised vaccination site and the health department has to identify vaccination sites for maximum coverage. However, for the January 16 vaccine launch, the district has already fixed the six session sites.According to Yadav, Gurugram will also do the procurement of vaccine for four other districts — Palwal (5,090 doses), Nuh (7,120 doses), Faridabad (22,620 doses) and Rewari (5,700 doses). These districts will collect the vaccine from the storage unit at Civil Hospital in Pataudi. Neighbouring NCR districts of Jhajjar, Sonepat, Panipat and Karnal have been allocated 7,990, 10,310, 6,660 and 13,160 doses of the vaccine, respectively, by the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/45000-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-today-inoculation-to-take-weeks-instead-of-days-101610559623230.html
13-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh cuts down Covid vaccination sites from 8 to 4||The Chandigarh administration has decided to restrict the number of Covid-19 vaccination sites to four instead of eight in proportion to the vaccine doses received for now.The health department on Tuesday had received 12,000 doses of vaccines to be used to immunize 5,400-6,000 health workers through two doses with a 28-day gap. The vaccination process will begin on January 16. Senior officials on Wednesday confirmed that two sites will be functional at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and one site each at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Civil Hospital, Sector 45. The remaining sites have been put on hold.“The instructions to the department are that sites once functional should continue to remain so. But, in view of the number of doses received, four sites will be adequate and will function for a longer period of time in a staggered manner,” said a senior UT health official, wishing not to be named.“This will also be helpful in closely analysing any adverse reaction due to the vaccine,” the official added.Among the first beneficiaries will be level-3 and -4 employees involved in the healthcare services. “The automated appointment messages will be sent one or two days in advance. We are hopeful of a good response though vaccination is totally voluntary,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department. Panchkula to get 9,000 doses in first batchWith Haryana receiving the first consignment of the Covishield vaccine on Wednesday, the Panchkula health department is expecting to receive 9,000 doses in the first batch. “The Covid-19 vaccine has reached Haryana. The vaccine has been sent to Kurukshetra, from where it will be forwarded to Hisar, Gurugram and Rohtak. Thereon, it will be dispatched to other districts,” said Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-cuts-down-covid-vaccination-sites-from-9-to-4-101610559083894.html

In the past five years, they have humiliated us on several occasions.”In the 2015 elections, Kulwant had led the Azad group (of Independents) and won 10 seats. With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. Later, in 2017, he joined SAD. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 last year. Last week, SAD had officially declared a list of 28 candidates (all of whom were former councillors) for the upcoming elections, but on Monday, 22 of them sided with Kulwant.With the latest development, a four-cornered fight awaits the MC polls. In the fray are SAD, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Kulwant’s group. The splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has opted out of the elections and will support AAP candidates and Independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akalis-still-hopeful-of-former-mohali-mayor-kulwant-s-return-ahead-of-mc-elections-101610558903878.html

The toxic forth could be seen in large quantity," said 50-year-old Lal Mann, a local resident near Chhat Ghat.Another local resident who is also a diver said, "People here suffer from breathing issue. While diving, we can feel a burning sensation and redness in the eyes."Environmentalists earlier have stated that the reason for the frothing could be the release of certain gases when reacting with few specific bacteria.Toxic forth at the Yamuna River has hit global headlines when in 2019 pictures of devotees of Chhat puja could be seen standing in waist-deep toxic forth in the Yamuna at Kalindi Kunj.Experts when asked about the particular episode of the surge in toxic level, stated that the forth was a common thing in the Yamuna but increased in last five-six years.Government of Delhi recently has sketched out a nine-point action plan to minimise frothing in the Yamuna River is happening due to discharge of untreated sewage in the river.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) convened a meeting on January 4, with the officials of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Irrigation & Water Resources Department of Haryana and Irrigation and Flood Control Department of Delhi to discuss the recurring issue of increase in Ammoniacal Nitrogen in River Yamuna and short and long term remedial actions required.Also, it was agreed to constitute a Joint Surveillance Squad comprising DJB, DPCC, Irrigation and Flood Control Department, Delhi, HSPCB and Irrigation and Water Resources Department, Haryana.Moreover, litters and plastic waste in ample amount could be found across the entire stretch of 22kms of the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/toxic-foam-continues-to-float-near-yamuna-river-bank-in-delhi-101610557940055.html

As many as 60 dead birds have been recovered since the carcass of a migratory bird was found floating in Sukhna Lake last Tuesday. In just the past three days, 41 birds have been found, with dead crows amounting to 34. Even as all eight samples of dead birds sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, last week tested negative on Tuesday, the UT forest and wildlife department is concerned about the samples of 13 crows that were found near the railway station on Monday. This was the first and only case of a number of bird carcasses found at the same spot. The test report is awaited, said chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai. Even in other states where avian influenza has been confirmed, dead crows were found in high numbers. 7,770 more birds culled in PanchkulaMeanwhile, in Panchkula, where bird flu has already been confirmed in its Barwala poultry belt, 7,770 birds were culled on Wednesday. As many as 37,695 poultry birds have been culled at three farms in the past five days. Samples from two farms had tested positive last week, after which five farms (including the two) were declared as falling in the infected zone and culling was ordered. However, two farms were removed from the list on Tuesday, as they fell beyond the stipulated radius of 1km.

This office has no objection to holding of any such elections subject to strict observation of Covid-19 protocols as notified from time to time by the Government of India and UT administration.”In October last year, the UT administration had advised PU to continue with its previous decision to postpone the senate elections to avoid the risk of Covid-19 transmission.Pending since AugustThe senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the Vice-President of India (who is also the university chancellor), two are nominated from the Punjab legislative assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected. The four-year term of the previous senate ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled in August last year, these were postponed twice by vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. The one-year term of the syndicate, which is PU’s executive body and elected from among the senators, also ended on December 31, leaving the varsity without a governing body.Ever since the senate elections were postponed by the V-C for the first time on August 15, the rival group (Goyal alliance), which had majority in senate and syndicate, has been at loggerheads with him.“What we were demanding has proved to be correct. The UT administration ought not to have any objection to the senate polls,” said former senator Ashok Goyal. “Now, we urge the V-C to immediately announce the dates of polling for various constituencies of senate and we hope that good sense will prevail.”PU registrar Vikram Nayyar said: “We are initiating the process. The varsity will look into how to conduct the senate polls while following all safety norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/senate-polls-chandigarh-admn-asks-pu-to-take-decision-on-its-own-101610555723711.html

The number of teams will be increased to 50 and they will catch violators across the city from Thursday to Saturday, a senior Transport Department officer said.The "full-fledged" drive will again be followed by the "limited" drive, he said.All vehicles in Delhi are required to be fitted with HSRPs and colour-coded stickers to determine their engine and fuel type as per various court and government orders. Violators are being fined ₹5,500 by Transport Department teams.According to officials, around 30 lakh vehicles need to be fitted with HSRPs and colour-coded stickers. Two-wheelers don't need the stickers that identify the fuel type.The stickers, which are also known as the third registration plate, the other two being the HSRP and the one at the front of a vehicle, can be booked by vehicle owners online through www.siam.in or www.bookmyhsrp.com.The colour-coded stickers can also be booked online.A vehicle owner who has booked HSRP and colour-coded sticker online will not be penalised if he or she produces the booking receipt, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transport-dept-to-launch-drive-to-check-hsrp-colour-coded-sticker-compliance-101610555432801.html

The study, which focuses on the sources of CO emissions in Delhi and Mumbai, has recorded levels of the pollutant during the Covid-19 lockdown— when restrictions were placed on vehicular movement, industrial operations and other financial activities — and compared it to emissions on regular days when all of these sources were operational and contributing to emissions. The findings show that in Delhi during the Covid-19 lockdown, the total CO emissions showed an 86.39% reduction compared to regular days, as opposed to a decline of 62.14% reduction in Mumbai. It also showed that the biggest reason behind this reduction, especially in Delhi, was because of restrictions in traffic movement. In the national capital, the CO emissions from vehicular movement reduced from 31.01gigagram/month (Gg/month) on regular days to just 3.1 Gg/month during the lockdown period. The second biggest contributor of CO in Delhi was the use of unclean household fuels, which contributed to 1.35 Gg/month on usual days. This did not show any change even during the lockdown. “The major sources of CO in Delhi were transport and household fuels during normal time. Transport was completely shut during lockdown, except for vehicles from law enforcement agencies, emergency services and that of essential supply chains. Not more than 10% of total vehicles were on the road, a data that cross-checks with the total sale of petroleum products,” the findings read. Carbon monoxide (CO), which is a colourless and odourless gas, is highly toxic and is produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, oil, coal, woods, and natural gas. Scientists said that CO is more harmful than particulate matter, as it has the potential to stay for a longer period in the atmosphere and does not get washed away by rain like PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM 10 (PM with diameter less than 10 micrometres). “Exposure to CO is particularly harmful for the elderly, children and people who are suffering from medical conditions such as heart and lung problems. We have examined the scientific processes responsible for the variability in CO during the Covid-19 lockdown in two of the largest megalopolises of India and the role of transport in influencing its concentration during the lockdown, and to understand the role of biofuel emissions,” said Gufran Beig of System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (Safar) at IITM, who headed the study. Beig added, “The CO data was collected from continuous Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) under the Safar network.” Another important observation made by the study was the contribution of CO levels in Delhi’s air from neighbouring states. The findings of the study showed that because of the landlocked demography of Delhi and the long lifespan of pollutant, the sources from long-range transport was also adding to the CO levels in the city. “CO has a long life and hence a significant contribution can come by the long-range transport from surrounding regions. The long-range transport of CO in Delhi, whereas wind reversal combined with emissions from slum clusters in Mumbai played a major role during the lockdown period,” the study said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vehicles-unclean-household-fuels-major-contributors-of-co-in-delhi-govt-study-finds-101610555602981.html

However, Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said the probe so far is pointing to the attack being the result of a personal fight, rather than a robbery bid.While the police continue to hunt for the assailants, they could pursue legal action against the injured man and his friend for lying to the police if it eventually turns out to be a case of a personal fight. The injured man, Firoz Ansari, is a resident of Khanpur Extension and works as a painter. The alleged crime happened around 8.30pm on Sunday while he and his friend, Imran Khan, got off a bus at the Lady Shri Ram College bus stop and were walking towards Moolchand Flyover. In his complaint to the police, Khan alleged that while they were walking, Ansari was suddenly dragged to a drain nearby by two men who began beating him up for not handing over his mobile phone. He alleged that when he tried to rescue his friend, the two suspects stabbed Ansari in the stomach and fled. “While I looked around for a vehicle to take my injured friend to a hospital, some policemen passing by rushed him in a police vehicle to Moolchand Hospital from where he was referred to AIIMS,” Khan said. The DCP said the injury to Ansari are not grievous in nature. The police subsequently registered an FIR at Greater Kailash police station. “Our probe reveals that the two men were actually getting high next to a drain near the flyover when they got into a quarrel with some people standing nearby. We are continuing our probe,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-alleges-stabbing-during-robbery-bid-police-suspect-a-personal-fight-101610555543394.html

The court asked how a fee could be charged if the corporations do not have a tie-up with the hospitals for cashless treatment.It also queried about the employees not getting their pension for a long time and issued a notice to the three municipal corporations, directing them to file an affidavit with all details in this regard.The court’s order came on a plea by Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, through advocate Ranjit Sharma, which contended that despite retired employees having deposited the premium, the corporations are yet to extend to them the cashless medical facility.During the hearing, the counsel for the petitioner said the retired employees have not got their pension from June 2020. Advocate Namrata Mukim, counsel for East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), said there has been a delay in reimbursing the premiums due to paucity of funds. To this, the court said, “You are taking ₹39,000 as subscription and you are not giving them treatment. You are obligated to provide them the medical facility. There is a legal obligation on your part after taking the money. They are not asking for heaven and sky. It is your responsibility to provide them facilities.”“This is the administrative difficulty with the MCD and hospital. They are not foreigners, they were your employees. You have no option but to give the money,” the court further said.The court also issued notice on the petition and posted the matter for further hearing to January 22.The plea had said during the pandemic, a large number of retired employees who did not receive pension on time had to face extreme hardships in arranging money for their treatment as the hospitals did not provide cashless treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcds-have-collected-fee-must-provide-cashless-treatment-to-retired-employees-says-hc-101610555542949.html

The court said the earlier decision of the committee was “cryptic” and “did not give any reason” justifying its conclusion.Justice Pratibha M Singh said the erstwhile committee had not followed the protocol and instructions which the chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had given after the deceased’s brother, seeking relief, had gone to the CM’s Delhi Durbar. In 2019, Kejriwal had directed an inquiry by a committee, while also directing the videography of the proceedings.“Final inquiry report is quite cryptic and does not discuss the facts nor are they recorded by the committee. Entire report is in one para….,” the court said.“Considering the factual matrix of the case, the committee has not followed the protocol or given any reason to dismiss the complaints,” it said.The court said the pending committee will be set aside and a new committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of Dr Sanjeev Kathuria. The proceedings would be videographed and a speaking order would be given to the petitioner within four months.It said the committee will take written responses from all parties and then give a detailed report to the Delhi government as well as the petitioner.The court’s order comes while hearing a plea by a man filed through advocate Prashant Vaxish stating that his brother (deceased) had a minor chest pain after which he was treated by a doctor on March 28, 2016, treated in the Maharaja Agrasen Hospital. He said the doctor prescribed some medicines and asked him to take rest.He said two days later, the doctor called them multiple times and asked them to come to the hospital, stating that the condition of the patient required immediate action.“The brother of the petitioner died on April 2016 due to the sheer medical negligence and wrong treatment by the doctors at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital,” the plea said.The plea had also contended that the authorities created forged reports and he was charged for tests which were never conducted on his brother. It said while no action was taken, the deceased’s brother had sought help from the CM who had directed the constitution of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-constitutes-fresh-panel-in-medical-negligence-case-101610555002920.html

Suhas Chitnis, Pune project director of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and responsible for the infrastructural work of the bypass highway, shares the steps taken to ensure safe travel on this stretch. What would you say about the accidents taking place on the Katraj–Dehu Road accidents? What steps NHAI is taking to prevent accidents on the highway? We are taking steps to better road infrastructure on this stretch of the bypass highway to prevent accidents. Work is going on of road surface markings, curve paintings. More signage boards will soon be installed at various spots on the highway. So, we are taking all necessary steps to improve the infrastructure on the highway and prevent accidents. I personally have visited the recent accident spots along with the traffic police officials, and we reviewed the stretch and have chalked out steps that need to be done best to prevent mishaps. What is the reason for rising number of accidents taking place on the new Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk stretch? While many blame the highway gradient on this stretch for accidents, it is not the reason. The highway road gradient is built within permissible limits and accordingly other infrastructural safety measures have been taken. It has been observed that heavy vehicles and trucks driving on the slope on neutral gear lead to accidents, as the heavy vehicle goes out of control. Brakes of these vehicles sometimes fail. So, there is a need for more efficient enforcement and action on such vehicles. I appreciate the Pune traffic police department pro-activeness as they have started taking action on vehicles that violate the traffic rules. What would you appeal to commuters passing through the bypass highway? The motorists using the bypass highway should not drive on neutral gear or switch off their vehicles on the slope. It is risky to drive in neutral, check the speed limit and do not risk your life and others who are using the stretch. NHAI is working hard to improve the infrastructure on the highway, but people should also follow traffic rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heavy-vehicles-opting-to-drive-in-neutral-on-bypass-highway-slope-could-cause-mishaps-says-suhas-chitnis-101610554282903.html

The leading independent location technology specialist on Wednesday released the report detailing the traffic situation in 2020 in over 400 cities in 57 countries. The report shows that congestion levels in India have fallen due to the pandemic. Apart from Pune, the other three cities from India featured in the index — Mumbai, Bengaluru and New Delhi — saw an average decrease in congestion levels by 12, 20, and 9 per cent respectively. Despite drop in congestion levels, three cities from India featured in the TomTom traffic index’s global top 10 list — Mumbai at second position, Bengaluru at sixth and New Delhi at eighth position. TomTom’s traffic data, which is powered by 600 million connected devices, is an authoritative indicator of people movement, economic activity levels and global trade. Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, TomTom’s traffic insights have been used by analysts, corporations, and the media to explain a world in flux. Apart from ranking cities from the most to the least congested, the TomTom traffic index report provides data insights into how the global pandemic changed mobility through engaging and interactive visuals. Talking about the index release, Werner van Huyssteen, general manager, India, TomTom said, “Last year, we announced that both global and India congestion levels in 2019 had increased for the ninth consecutive traffic index. In 2020, we saw a vastly different picture. From lockdowns to closed borders, people movement changed – and it changed very fast.” “Although traffic congestion in India was down in 2020, it’s not going to become a trend unless we take action. We might even see traffic levels shoot up again as people get back to work and back into old routines. That’s why now is the time that India’s city planners, policy makers, employers – and drivers – must take stock of what they will do to make the roads less congested in the future.” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tom2-2020-traffic-index-pune-sees-17-per-cent-decrease-in-congestion-101610552602866.html

The number may change depending on the order,” said Kunal Agarwal, co-founder, Koolex Cold Chain Solution Pvt Ltd.“We do not get to know the destination of the truck until it is sealed and an invoice is created. There may be delays in the process as we have seen earlier as well,” he said.Pune airport, on Wednesday, witnessed the movement of three more passenger flights which carried the remainder of the boxes of Covishield vaccine as per the work order issued by the Government of India.Through flight and road transport collectively, a total of close to 11 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine produced at SII, Pune, were delivered on Tuesday, according to officials of the institute.“What the firm is left with are 9,000 vials, as part of a purchase order placed by Centre,” according to a statement by Serum. These 9,000 vials contain 90,000 doses.“A GoAir flight carried three boxes to Chennai, a SpiceJet flight carried 34 boxes to Delhi, and one Air Asia flight carried 37 boxes from Pune to Jaipur on Wednesday,” said Kuldeep Singh Rishi, director, Pune airport.Furthermore, six trucks left around 10pm from SII and reached Mumbai Central Hub, Silvasa, Surat, Baroda, Jhansi, and Belgaum, along with Mumbai airport. From Mumbai airport, the boxes further went to Goa, Lucknow, Chandigarh, and Kochin, on Wednesday morning.The vaccines were delivered to Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Shillong, Vijaywada, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, by air. Of the nine flights which carry the load from Pune, eight left in the morning while one left in the evening in six-passenger and two cargo flights.The vials were carried to the airport in three trucks that left Serum at 5am. Two trucks belonged to SII while one belonged to a company to which the major road transport has been outsourced.The trucks in the company’s fleet are of various sizes - ten feet containers which can carry around 40 boxes, 14 feet which can carry 60 boxes, 20 feet containers which can carry 120-130 boxes, 24 feet containers which can carry 200 boxes and 28 feet container which can carry around 250 and 32 feet containers which can carry 400 boxes, according to Agarwal.“The company, on behalf of SII, is currently catering to 48 government depots across the country,” he added.“Later in the evening, six more trucks left from Serum for Mumbai city, Mumbai airport, Surat, Baroda, Jhansi, and Belgaum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/next-consignment-of-covishield-vaccine-over-next-five-days-101610552183269.html

This was the first of many trucks that would send out about 10.10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine across the country. By 10 am, more than five million doses of the vaccine were dispatched to various corners of the country. The transport, by trucks to airport and other locations, was in coordination with Pune-based transporter Kool-Ex Cold Chain Ltd transporter and traffic and police departments. Pune authorities, along with the Centre and the state, carried out a mammoth task on Tuesday when close to 11 million doses were sent via road and air to various locations, including as far as northeast regions, in less than 24 hours. The authorities successfully carried out the challenge of supplying perishable vaccines in the shortest possible time with the help of multiple agencies to various places across the country. A senior official from Serum Institute of India requesting anonymity said, “We at Serum Institute are used to supplying close to 6.1 billion doses across the world for the past six years. We have even transported large number of doses in short span of time like in the case of measles, mumps and rubella when school children aged 9-5 years had to be vaccinated. “During the past nine months since we began the production of Covishield, there have been certain departments, including fermentation, where employees were working round the clock in three shifts all seven days. We were fully prepared and only awaiting information on date and timing of transport. “We had to choose early morning for transport because of the scheduled flight timings as the first flight left at 8 am. As soon as the purchase order was finalised, we contacted the cold van transporter and we have our own fleet of cold vans. Prior to the dispatch, everyone was sensitised by the central government which ensured smooth transportation of the vaccine. Once the last truck left the premises on Tuesday, it was a sense of price and fulfilment, a fruitful result of the efforts we invested since the past nine to ten months. No Covid-19 case was reported from our premises even as we were working in full scale even during the strict lockdown phase.” The official said, “As of Tuesday morning, all the 11 million doses, as per the purchase order from the government, except 90 vials which is 90,000 doses are pending. These are reserved for Lakshadweep and the five states in the northeast. While doses for Lakshadweep are arranged, the quota for northeast states will be leaving Wednesday. Help from the aviation ministry is appreciated. By Wednesday, all 11 million doses would be transported.” Pune police played a pivotal role in the transportation and escort of cold vans carrying the doses from the institute to the airport. Namrata Patil, deputy commissioner of police, zone-5, said, “We provided escort to trucks till the airport and city-limits from Tuesday morning till late night. We found that morning time is good for smooth traffic. It appears that now there is no need for police escort as routine movements have begun. Therefore, unless the company asks for it, we will not be accompanying the vehicles.” Senior airport authorities were conspicuous by their absence when the trucks reached the airport for unloading around 5:30am. The vials from trucks were received by cargo officials of the four airlines. Information of the transport of doses from the airport to other locations could not be properly gathered because of the absence of senior airport officials flow from the staff to the media personnel was also apparent. “There is a small cold storage facility at the Pune airport too. The boxes are kept there if not loaded onto the flights directly,” said Kunal Agarwal, co-founder of Kool-Ex Cold Chain Ltd which provided road transport support to Serum institute. After the early morning movement of trucks to airport, the cargo movement started at night and between 9:30 and 10 pm around seven trucks left the city for nearby states, including Gujarat and Karnataka. Seven trucks left the city for various destinations, including Surat, Baroda, Belgaum, Jhansi, Silvassa, Mumbai airport and Mumbai city between 9:30 and 10 pm. 74 boxes of vaccine transported on Wednesday The vaccine transportation continued on Wednesday as over 74 boxes with Covishield vaccine left for other cities. According to a SpiceJet spokesperson, on January 13, 34 boxes were sent to Delhi. A GoAir flight with three boxes left for Chennai from Pune with Covishield and another Air Asia flight left from Pune to Jaipur with 37 boxes.

They are now taking long routes to travel to their workplace and other destinations. Three persons died in a recent accident near the Navale bridge on the slope where two trucks collided with each other. In another accident, a speeding truck hit a police vehicle on this stretch. Several accidents have been reported on the Katraj to Navale bridge chowk and New Katraj tunnel to Navale bridge chowk stretch. It has become a “death stretch” leaving those who use these roads to avoid the service roads and the highway. “It is a regular thing for us to see damaged vehicles or hear news of fatality on the highway. The accidents cause traffic jams. The residents of our residential society are shocked by the recent accidents involving trucks. We have decided to avoid taking the stretch. Instead, we now travel from Dattanagar chowk road and Satara road to our workplace and for other purposes. While this route is longer by around 2 to 3 kms, it is better to get late or drive a longer distance than risking our lives,” said Nimish Choudhary, resident of a housing society in Ambegaon Budruk located near the highway. Residents of Narhe, Dhayari, Vadgaon Budruk and Warje areas have also started avoiding the bypass highway to travel. “I use the highway to travel to my office. Sometimes, my six-year-old daughter also rides with me on the bike on this stretch. I had slipped on the highway during the rainy season a couple of years ago, but it was not a major accident. Since the last few months, I have been purposely avoiding the highway because of the increasing number of accidents on this stretch,” said Kamna Bhate, a resident of Narhe area. Resident groups have been demanding separate lanes on service roads for regular traffic and ban on heavy vehicles during peak hours. Ramesh Vidhate, secretary of Sinhagad Road Residents Forum, said, “Many citizens from our area travel through the bypass highway on bikes and cars for work, towards Hinjewadi, Chinchwad or other connecting places as it is convenient and saves time. With many mishaps on this stretch being reported and people losing their lives on the highway, we have demanded separate lanes should be kept on the service road for two-wheelers and heavy vehicles should not be allowed to pass during peak hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-avoid-katraj-dehu-road-bypass-highway-for-fear-of-accidents-101610551702720.html

In the initial phase of the pandemic, the civic body created institutional quarantine centres, Covid care centres and dedicated health centres which had a lot of equipment too. Currently, most of them are either closed or only partially functioning and hence, the equipment is lying unused.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Jagtap, said, “As most of the Covid-19 care centres have closed, the equipment purchased for it like bedsheets, beds, fans, TV sets, electrical equipment and buckets, among other items all are lying unused. I have instructed all the departments concerned to submit the present status of these materials to the store department.”Jagtap said, “After getting the report, the PMC can chalk out a plan for its reuse. I have even instructed the store department to undertake its maintenance till it is reused.”PMC store department head Sunil Indalkar, said, “The additional commissioner has given instructions to all the departments and ward offices to submit a list of items purchased during Covid-19 pandemic and their present status. We are waiting for the lists from all the departments.”Electrical department head Srinivas Kandul, said, “Our department has prepared the list of the materials purchased during the Covid-19 pandemic. We installed TV sets, fans, water purifiers and lighting systems at the temporary Covid care centres. The list will be submitted to the store department soon.”PMC had purchased more than 80,000 bedsheets, thousands of buckets for toilets and other daily essential items for these Covid centres.Indalkar said, “We can reuse many of these items. Bedsheets can be used for PMC-owned hospitals and other materials can be reused at other PMC offices. Once the list is finalised, we will chalk out a plan.”Civic activist Vijay Kumbhar, said, “The PMC should have ideally done this work much before. I am doubtful that all the material is at right place as at many places in the state it has been stolen. PMC must make a proper list and publish it on its website. It is the duty of the officials to reuse it immediately at other places instead of keeping it idle.”Opposition party leader in PMC Deepali Dhumal, said, “The material which was used during Covid-19 should be reused. Municipal commissioner and the administration took a call on purchasing this material. It is their responsibility to ensure that it remains in good condition and is utilised at proper places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-seeks-list-of-items-purchased-for-covid-centres-present-status-of-equipment-101610550082690.html

As per the traffic police authorities, challans have been issued against 6,248 vehicles and ₹12, 49,600 fine has been collected between January 1 and January 13. As per Sections 5 and 7 of the Central Motor Vehicles Act, all vehicles should have rear view mirrors. There is a fine of ₹200 for rear view mirror violation, according to the traffic police. “This is a not a special drive against violators of the rule. We are identifying such violators just like other violations of traffic rules. The move is only to ensure traffic discipline and reduce accidents. A majority of riders are unaware that riding without mirrors is a violation of traffic rules,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for the city’s traffic division. “The number of two-wheelers in the city has increased and so is the figure of road mishaps involving two-wheelers. People should be made aware about road safety,” Shrirame said. Experts think that the human behavioural patterns behind such violations should be examined and road safety awareness campaign should be done from school level. “I have observed that many people think mirrors are not necessary while driving in the city. Some feel that a vehicle without mirrors looks stylish. Such tendencies lead to carelessness,” said Tanmay Pendse, a road safety activist. “Mirrors are essential as they improve visibility of road and judgment of the driver. It is also essential that the proper angle of mirrors is maintained,” said Pendse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rear-view-mirror-violations-pune-police-fine-6-248-two-wheeler-riders-collect-rs-12-49-600-fine-in-13-days-101610549962631.html

13-01-2021||Other||Covid-19 vaccine for general public in Maharashtra after 6 months||Even as the state received 9.63 lakh doses of Covishield on Tuesday, the authorities expect the first two phases of vaccination, which will cover around 25 lakh healthcare and frontline workers, to be completed by the end of March, after which the third and largest phase of the vulnerable group is expected to begin. The general population is expected to get the dose after it, which means the wait for them ranges between three and six months. Of the three crore people to be inoculated across the country in the two phases, 25 lakh, including eight lakh healthcare workers, will be from Maharashtra. The state machinery expects the first round for healthcare workers to be completed by the end of January and the second round for frontline workers to begin in the first week of February. “The data of the healthcare workers is being registered by Tuesday midnight, while the registration of frontline workers will be completed by the midnight of January 25. With around 40,000-50,000 people being vaccinated daily, the first lot of health workers is expected to be completed in two weeks. The immunisation of the first two phases is expected to be completed by early March,” said an official from the health department, on condition of anonymity. The official said the third phase, in which the vulnerable population of comorbid people and those over 50 years is being covered, may take longer, as it will have more than 2.5 crore people in Maharashtra. “Decisions on the cost of the vaccine for the third phase, timeline for the vaccine to people outside the prioritised groups are to be taken by the Centre. Once 60% of the vaccination in the first two phases is completed, the Centre would take a call on the drive for the third phase. The Centre expects more vaccines to throng the market and clinical trials for some of the vaccines to be completed. The Centre also expects commercial sale of the vaccine by then, reducing the demand for inoculation from the public healthcare chain,” the official said. “The Central government has adopted a step-by-step approach on vaccination. The three phases are covering most vulnerable groups currently and the availability for the common population will be decided in next three to six months. It all depends on multiple factors, including clinical trials, availability of the vaccines, supply, among others. Currently, the approvals are for emergency use of the vaccines and they are expected to be available for commercial use only after the general approval to them,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, leading endocrinologist and member of the state-appointed task force for vaccination. The state government has its own chain of 3,135 cold chain systems, including one at state level, nine at divisional levels, 34 in districts and 27 in municipal corporations. “The transportation of the vaccine will be handled by outsourced agencies, which are empanelled for the vaccination drive undertaken by the state government for years,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccine-for-general-public-in-maharashtra-after-6-months-101610542283531.html

The gates were locked again using new chains with the keys with Mundu, who is the secretary and treasurer of the committee.‘We served two notices to bishop’Sharma said, “We served two notices to the other party (bishop Bhatti) to hand over the keys, but they didn’t respond. They even said that they would hand over the keys, but later they went untraceable. Today, we forcefully took the cemetery under our custody and handed it over to the first party (Mundu) as per the decision of the British High Commission.”After the decision, Mundu said, “We will start the maintenance and repair work of the boundary wall from tomorrow. We will take up the cleaning work and repairing of the graves in a phased manner.”Anthony said, “For the last couple of years, he (bishop Bhatti) started claiming that he is the owner of the cemetery. On the pretext of cleaning the burial ground, he took the keys and never returned. Some graves had been damaged by a demolition machine while he was cleaning the land to sell it.”Cemetery lay in dilapidated conditionBecause of the dispute, the cemetery could not be cleaned and was in a state of neglect, and the place was covered with long wild grass, some spots inundated by sewer water, gamblers and drug addicts, with its historical importance forgotten.The HT had reported thrice on the sorry state of affairs of over 2 lakh graves spread across 20.54 acres of land, including those of around 66 World War I (1914-1918) soldiers, 20 Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) prisoners who fought in South Africa and those of Britons dating back to pre-independence.Teams from Commonwealth War Graves (CWGC), British High Commission, and Haryana Archaeology department had visited the site several times. The place is also a state-protected site where illegal encroachments have come up along the boundary wall that were inspected by an official from the archaeology department in November.Former Union tourism minister and Rajya Sabha MP from Kerala KJ Alphons had in November written to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and principal secretary to the state government (archaeology and museums department) Ashok Khemka highlighting the “obstruction” created by Bhatti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/father-mundu-tasked-with-upkeep-of-british-era-cemetery-in-ambala-101610542043055.html
13-01-2021||Mumbai||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, hospital births fall by 18% in Mumbai||At 3am on May 12, 2020, Ishita Koli, a resident of a 170 sq ft chawl in South Mumbai’s Bhendi Bazaar, went into labour and started to bleed. With all nearby nursing homes closed, Sunil Mohan, her 32-year-old husband decided to rush her to Prince Aly Khan hospital, less than three km away in Mazagaon. But due to the lockdown, they could not find a vehicle to take here there. “We tried calling an ambulance, but they told us that we’d have to wait for more than an hour. Private taxis were also unavailable. By 5am, my wife’s condition had deteriorated, so we decided to take the help of a midwife,” Mohan said. By 7am, the Kolis were parents to a healthy baby whom they named Rekha, delivered by a retired auxiliary nurse midwife. Around the city, women like Ishita were forced to deliver at home on account of the lockdown and lack of access to medical facilities. Not everyone was as lucky as Ishita, who suffered blood loss and managed to get treatment at Cama Hospital (though it took five hours to find a cab that agreed to ferry her for over four times the normal fare). According to data shared by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), institutional deliveries dropped by almost 18% between March and November 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The number of childbirths registered in public and private hospitals between March and November 2019 stood at 111,411. During the same period in 2020, this dropped to 91,618; the lowest institutional child deliveries in March and April. “By March, thousands of women had gotten pregnant. Their deliveries were scheduled over the next nine months till November. The drop in hospital deliveries therefore doesn’t indicate a fall in the pregnancy rate during the pandemic,” said Dr Jaideep Malhotra, president, Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India. Medical experts and doctors point towards two major reasons behind the drop in the registration of institutional deliveries in these nine months— rise in home births and mass migration during the lockdown when thousands of people lost their jobs. Lakhs of people lost their jobs at the start of the lockdown, leading to a mass exodus of daily wage earners from Mumbai, which had, by mid-May, turned into an epicenter of the Covid-19 disease. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, sexual and reproductive health and rights took a back seat. Overnight, as a precautionary measure, tertiary care hospitals were converted into dedicated Covid care centres. During an emergency, when pregnant women were rushed to the hospital for delivery, they were referred to another hospital. In the initial stages of the pandemic, there was too much confusion among the public,” said Subarna Ghosh, co-founder, ReRight Foundation, a non-government organisation (NGO) that works for safe child births. Health experts discourage home births because it can lead to complications and fatality. Doctors said that even though midwives are experienced in internal examination and vaginal deliveries, they may not possess the expertise — or, indeed, access to medical equipment — to deal with complications like blood pressure fluctuations, obstructed labour, and resuscitation among others. “Home deliveries involve extended labour hours and prolonged internal examination which may increase the chances of septic foetus. Rushing to the hospital after a failed home delivery may invite further risk to the life of mother and baby. Most hospitals like us ensure complete isolation from Covid-19 patients and staffers. So, it is recommended to choose deliveries in hospitals rather than homes,” said Dr Gayatri Deshpande, senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, Nanavati Hospital, Vile Parle. But during the pandemic, as the city came to a standstill, this was not an option for pregnant women. Society for Nutrition Education and Health Action (Sneha), an NGO that works on public health issues conducted a survey among 436 women (during their pregnancy and postpartum period) between April and August. Their findings revealed that institutional deliveries during the pandemic varied from place to place depending on the availability of healthcare facilities. “We saw that areas with better accessibility to hospitals have recorded almost 100% institutional deliveries. Whereas, the number dropped to 75-65% in areas with fewer medical facilities,” said chief executive officer Vanessa D’Souza. During the initial days of the pandemic when families lacked knowledge about Covid and non-Covid hospitals, the NGO received several calls seeking guidance. “We then procured a list of hospitals across Mumbai with bifurcations, and started guiding callers to their nearest hospitals for deliveries.” Taking note of the safety of pregnant women, BMC did not convert civic-run maternity hospitals into Covid centres. In addition to lack of facilities, many pregnant women avoided giving birth at hospitals due to fear of contracting the virus. “Though there were no reports of vertical transmission of the virus from mothers to the new-borns during delivery, pregnant women were still worried of contracting the virus in hospitals. Thus, they opted for home births with the help of experienced women or midwives,” said Malhotra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-hospital-births-fall-by-18-in-mumbai-101610541742884.html

The earlier Deputy CM, who is now sitting in Delhi, bowed before the criminals," said Jha."In Bihar law and order is not a priority for the head and deputy head. They cannot even say two words of condolence in the midst of a barrage of bullets to control criminals. What can be expected of them? What can be expected from the law and order machinery?" he asked.Speaking about the role of Governor, Jha said, "Just think about how people are living in different parts of Bihar in such a situation. Governors are very active in different states, a message should be sent to the Center by the Governor about Bihar."Referring to the rule of RJD being termed as 'Jungle Raj' by the ruling JD(U)-BJP, Jha said, "Those who remind us of the previous Jungle Raj are not looking in the mirror today. Aren't they aware of the reality? What is this? Jungle Raj is a very small metaphor. There is still some system in a forest, there is complete anarachy here.""It should be noted that Rupesh Kumar Singh, a manager with IndiGo Airlines deployed at the Patna Airport was shot dead by criminals outside his residence. Miscreants fired six rounds at him. Rupesh Kumar was returning home when the incident took place."

We want to honour not just those farmers who died here, but also across Maharashtra, UP and other states," Singh told ANI.At Coimbatore, farmers from Pollachi in Coimbatore celebrated Bhogi Pongal by burning copies of the farm laws.Largely celebrated in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, Bhogi marks the beginning of the four-day Pongal festival in which useless household articles are put in a bonfire.Meanwhile, a group of men protesting at the Tikri (Delhi-Haryana) border were seen raising slogans without their shirts, braving the cold weather condition prevailing over this part of the country.They raised slogans of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan', and 'Sadda haq, aithe rakh,' (It's our right, keep it here), and held up signboards saying 'No farmers, no food'.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of three farm laws and asked the committee formed by it concerning the three farm laws to submit its report within two months.The court said the first sitting of the committee, formed to listen to the grievances of farmers and views of the government, should be held within 10 days.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November last year, against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-makeshift-singhu-border-gurudwara-protesters-honour-those-who-died-101610530692928.html

13-01-2021||Other||Words written on the wind||Lahore never left the minds and hearts of people who were forced to leave it with the drawing of the Radcliffe Line with the Partition of 1947. So was the case with Anuradha Kumar Jain, who grew up hearing the Lahore lore from her extended family for whom it had been home.Older to this writer by a decade or more, this is how one grew up listening to the tales of grandeur of the capital of undivided Punjab that was once hailed as the ‘Paris of the East’.It was the cosmopolitan cultural capital where people of different faiths, caste and creed co-existed in harmony. It was the city of poets, writers, artists, actors and singers who built their lives the Sufi way, humming the verses of Lahore’s patron Sufi poet Shah Hussain.What makes Anuradha’s novel ‘Written on the Wind’ singular is that it captures the times that perhaps seem to belong to some fairytale. Equally significant is her way of weaving the stories of women of those times, more so those who came of age in the period of India’s freedom struggle.Thus the telling tales are of two girls who blossom into youth in this coveted city. One protagonist is Harjeet from a landlord Sikh family married to a lawyer of an elite Hindu family searching for her dreams of passion with a Muslim lover. While the second protagonist is Amiya, born out of wedlock to a Brahmin girl and a British army officer, who rejected and scorned, struggles to become a writer. Amiya finds support from a warm and liberal Parsi family living in Lahore.“I grew up listening to legends of Lahore from my large extended family which was a merry mix of Hindus and Sikhs. The Lahore lore that I was raised on lived with me and finally took the shape of this novel even though geography and not literature was my subject of higher studies,” says Anuradha.Well, this is perhaps the reason for her etching out so beautifully the social geography of the city where the drama of human relationships is played out. The glimpses of cultural life and vignettes of freedom struggle with martyr Bhagat Singh’s trial as a point of reference enhances the narrative.The author has done copious research and one waits for more stories from her in times to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/words-written-on-the-wind-101610531782353.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Don't panic, eat poultry product cooked at high temp: Delhi govt advisory||The Delhi Health Department on Wednesday issued an advisory in view of bird flu cases in the city, asking people not to panic and follow a set of dos and don'ts, including not consuming half-cooked chicken, half-boiled or half-fried eggs.Several ducks at Sanjay Lake and a large number of crows across various city parks have been found dead in the last one week.The revenue department has deployed teams of volunteers at the city's borders to prevent unauthorised entry of livestock, and canned and processed chicken from outside.The advisory issued by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) of Delhi on Wednesday stated, "H5N8 is highly pathogenic in birds but the pathogenicity in humans as well as the likelihood of human infection with avian influenza (AH5N8) virus is low."The health department, while issuing the dos and don'ts, asked people to observe precaution and not panic."Avoid contact and prevent exposure from sick-looking sluggish chicken. Avoid direct contact with bird secretions and droppings," the advisory states, adding that bowls used for feeding birds, and their cages should be washed properly with soap or detergent.All slaughter waste must be disposed of properly, the DGHS authorities said.The advisory also cautioned people to not touch dead birds with naked hands. If any bird is found dead, control room should be informed at phone number 23890318."Eat only completely cooked eggs and poultry products cooked at 70 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. Do not consume half-cooked chicken or bird or half-boiled and half-fried eggs," the advisory said.Do not keep raw poultry meat near cooked meat. Wash hands frequently at the time of handling raw poultry products. Take due care of personal hygiene and maintain cleanliness in surrounding, it cautioned.Reports of over 50 bird deaths were received on a helpline of the Delhi government's animal husbandry unit, and 18 samples from different parts of the city were sent for avian flu testing on Tuesday, officials had said.Testing of samples of crows and ducks had confirmed bird flu cases in the national capital on Monday, prompting the city government to impose a ban on sale of processed and packaged chicken brought from outside the city.The Ghazipur poultry market has also also closed by authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dont-panic-eat-poultry-product-cooked-at-high-temp-delhi-govt-advisory-101610531063271.html

13-01-2021||Mumbai||Decision on Mumbai locals' resumption for all likely today: All you need to know||The Maharashtra government is likely to decide today on reopening Mumbai’s local train services to the general public as officials have confirmed that the matter would be taken up for discussion in the state cabinet. An official from the Railways department said, “We are currently operating local train services... We do not have any problem and are waiting for the state government directive regarding permitting the general public. A decision on the permission is expected soon.”After its initial shutdown in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the suburban train services have been partially resumed, allowing only essential workers and some sections of people to travel in them.Also read: Local train services likely to resume for public in MumbaiHere is all you need to know about the timeline for resumption of the local trains in Mumbai -1. Considered to be the ‘lifeline of Mumbai’ for its coverage and vast number of people transported, local services in Mumbai came to a grinding halt after a country-wide lockdown was imposed in India in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 disease.2. On June 15, 2020, services resumed partially, only for essential service providers, with close to 300 trains being run on all lines. Strict social-distancing norms were enforced for travel.3. After gradual reduction in Covid-19 cases in the city, women were allowed in local trains in October 2020. However, travel time was restricted from 11am to 3pm and from 7pm until the final train.4. Also, lawyers were allowed to avail the local train services in October but weren’t allowed to board the trains during peak hours in the morning and evening. However, practicing lawyers and clerks were allowed to take the trains only in December 2020.5. The services were thrown open by the Maharashtra government to all teachers and non teaching staff in November 2020.Since December 2020, authorities have hinted at the services being resumed completely for all general public. However, no decision has been announced yet. Maharashtra has been the most affected state by Covid-19 in India, in terms of number of cases reported and fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/decision-on-mumbai-locals-resumption-for-all-likely-today-all-you-need-to-know-101610524476043.html
13-01-2021||Mumbai||Amid power outages, rural Maharashtra looks for alternatives||With only a few days left for the mass immunisation process against Covid-19, health activists and social workers have raised concerns about the frequent occurrences of load shedding in rural Maharashtra. However, state authorities claimed that they are finding alternatives to ensure uninterrupted power supply to vaccine centres.“Maintaining the cold chain of the vaccine will be a real struggle for authorities. To reach the grass-root level, the health department has to rely on primary health centres. However, many don’t have reliable electricity supply,” said health activist Dr Abhijit More.During the vaccination process, the health department will rely heavily on electronics for data maintenance on the Co-WIN app to get the details of the beneficiaries. “It’s quite impressive that the government has developed a centralised system to maintain all the data, but they will need uninterrupted flow of electricity to charge the electronics,” said Sudhir Tupe from Lokkalyan Charitable Trust, a non-governmental organisation in Satara.While replying to a question asked by Lok Sabha member Janardan Singh Sigriwal on the floor of the house on November 22, 2019, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan shared data of the infrastructure of the primary health centres (PHC) across the country. According to the data, Maharashtra has 1,823 functional PHCs, of which, 1.9% (35) centres did not have electricity. The data also showed that 19% of the centres did not have computers, and almost 32% centres are without telephones.District health officers (DHOs) however, said they are taking several steps to ensure electricity supply is not affected. “We have directed the power board to ensure uninterrupted flow of electricity at the vaccination centres. We also installed additional generators in case of power outage for long hours. To ensure the generators run for long, we have kept extra petrol ready,” said Dr GG Paraghe, district health officer, Latur.Districts such as Gadchiroli are keeping their solar power system ready as an alternative in case of an electricity crisis. “Recently, we serviced the whole system and have kept it on stand-by,” said Dr SC Shanbharkar, DHO, Gadchiroli.Health officials believe power outages are unlikely to be a problem as the vaccine freezers can maintain the required temperature for a maximum of 72 hours without electricity. “All rural and district hospitals have the infrastructure to preserve the vaccines. So we won’t have a problem even if there are power cuts,” said state immunisation officer Dr D Patil.“Unlike Pfizer, which requires a minus 70 degree Celsius storage facility, both the vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) can be stored in 2-8 degree Celsius. All rural and district hospitals have the infrastructure to preserve the vaccines which are being used under the immunisation programme for years. So, we won't have a problem even if some hospitals face power cuts,” said state immunisation officer Dr D Patil.District health officials said they will formulate further plans once the immunisation programme reaches the second level, where primary health centres will be included as vaccination points.“As the drive reaches the second stage where the number of beneficiaries will be larger, we will formulate more detailed plans to address the issue of power shortages focusing on the PHCs. We will mostly hold a meeting next week over the issue,” said Dr Ajay Dahale, DHO, Wardha.The state health department has been working for months to channelise the vaccination process in the state. In the first phase, around 7.72 lakh healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) and anganwadi workers will be vaccinated at rural and district hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-power-outages-rural-maharashtra-looks-for-alternatives-101610518507293.html
13-01-2021||Employment||Vacancy at the top in several Bihar varsities||Several universities in Bihar have once again slipped under ad hoc arrangement at the top. There are at least five universities, which don’t have regular vice chancellors for months, while another will have vacancy in the next couple of months.Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU), set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella, has been without a regular VC since September 20, 2020, when the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Since then, AKU Pro-VC Syed Mohammad Karim has been holding the additional charge of VC by the order of Governor-cum-Chancellor Phagu Chouhan.The Raj Bhawan had invited applications for the appointment of full-fledged VC at the AKU before the Assembly election, but the process is likely to be delayed. According to sources, the application might be invited afresh for the post of VC. The screening committee meeting was also cancelled. The term of the present P-VC is will also end in the next four months and that vacancy may also be advertised soon.Bihar Agriculture University (BAU), Sabour is also set to slip under ad hoc arrangement after the term of its VC Dr Ajoy Kumar Singh ends on January 14. Dr Ravindra Kumar Sohane, director, extension education, BAU has been asked by the Chancellor to perform the duty of the VC in addition to his own duty from January 15 till further orders.Two universities in Patna are also under additional charge. Following the resignation of Pataliputra University VC Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal earlier this month, the additional charge was handed over to the Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU), Darbhanga VC Surendra Pratap Singh. Pataliputra University does not have a Pro-VC.In Nalanda Open University, BRA Bihar University (Muzaffarpur) VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey was handed over the additional charge following the resignation of former VC HN Prasad in November. Though NOU has a full-fledged P-VC, he was not given the charge.In September last year, Purnea University VC Rajesh Singh had also resigned to assume his assignment as VC in Gorakhpur (UP), while the VC of TM Bhagalpur University, Neelima Gupta, did not join and ad hoc arrangement was later made there. TNB College (Bhagalpur) principal Sanjay Kumar Choudhary was made the acting VC in November, but only for carrying out routine matters.He has been directed by the Chancellor not to take any policy decisions, including convening of meetings of selection committee or promotion committee, senate, syndicate or academic council meetings, process related to recruitment and matters having financial implications. TMBU has been under additional charge for nearly a year.Munger University VC RK Verma has also been restrained from taking any policy decisions by the Raj Bhawan, as his tenure is also nearing end.A senior official of the Raj Bhawan said that the applications had been invited for short listing the candidates through the search committee. “Some VCs have resigned, some have completed their terms while the term of one VC will end in a couple of months. The process is on for new incumbents,” he added.Days ahead of Election Commission notification for Bihar assembly election, the Governor had appointed six vice chancellors and eight Pro-VCs in the state universities.“Ad hocism is the bane of institutions of higher learning in Bihar and unfortunately it has become a pattern. It was after the Supreme Court intervention that the provision of search committee for appointment of VCs and P-VCs was made in the state, but the system is yet to properly evolve. Ad hocism at the top hampers the institutions,” said former head, department of economics, Prof NK Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/competitive-exams/upsc-civil-services-pt-exam-2021-heading-for-stiff-competition-this-year-101610510044661.html
13-01-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana meets 2020 sex-ratio target in pandemic year: Data||Haryana managed to largely meet its sex-ratio at birth (SRB) targets in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic posing challenges to the government’s flagship programmes to encourage women’s education and stop female foeticide, showed official data released on Tuesday.Data showed that SRB, a critical indicator of gender equality, stood at 922 female births per 1,000 males in 2020, only slightly lower than 923 registered in 2019, which was also the highest figure recorded in a decade.SRB numbers have steadily improved in the state, from 833 in 2011 to 876 in 2015, 900 in 2016, 914 in 2017 and 923 in 2019. A total 537,996 births were registered in 2020 which included 279,869 male births and 258,127 female births.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who monitors the government’s flagship Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao programme, said Haryana registering 922 SRB was an outstanding achievement in view of the limitations Covid-19 had posed.He also set the set a target of 935+ SRB in 2021.According to Rakesh Gupta, nodal officer of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao, government teams cracked down hard on the touts offering sex-selection facilities.“The state government started an informer incentive scheme wherein a reward of one lakh was given to the informer providing information about the sex determination in any part of the state, which helped in exposing the gangs of criminals involved in this crime,” Gupta said. As many as 100 FIRs were registered in 2020 as compared to 77 during 2019.Sirsa district led the state with an SRB of 949, while Karnal slipped to 900. In 2019 Sirsa’s SRB was 920 and that of Karnal was 908.In 2020, Panchkula and Nuh were tied at the second spot with an SRB of 939, Kurukshetra and Fatehabad both recorded 938, Panipat 935, Sonepat 932, Ambala 931, Yamunanagar 928, Kaithal and Hisar 922, Gurugram and Rewari 921, Bhiwani 920, Faridabad 915, Rohtak 912, Palwal 910, Jind 904, Mahendragarh 902, Karnal 900, Jhajjar 892 and Charkhi Dadri 891.At least 10 districts such as Sirsa, Nuh, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Sonepat, Kaithal, Gurugram, Rewari, Bhiwani, and Rohtak improved their SRB in comparison to 2019.

13-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers say copies of new laws will be burnt on Lohri||On Tuesday, farmers protesting at Delhi borders were seen preparing for festival of Lohri, which will be celebrated on Wednesday.“Lohri marks the beginning of the new harvest season. We pray for the good harvest by burning bonfires and singing songs and dancing around it. This year, we will be singing the songs of resistance by burning copies of the three new laws.” said Gurpreet Kaur, 58, a farmer from Tarn Taran, protesting at the Singhu border.Several farmers said their family members are also travelling to Delhi on Wednesday to celebrate Lohri with them. Devinder Singh, a member of the main stage committee at Singhu, said, “My parents asked me if I was coming home for Lohri. When I told them that I can’t come in the middle of the agitation, they decided to join me here. Parents and family members of many other protesters are arriving in Delhi on Wednesday to celebrate the festival.”Farmer leaders also said that their ongoing agitation is not going to conclude on Republic Day. “There are many rumours about our January 26 plan. There have been attempts to propagate false propaganda that farmers will gherao Parliament or take over the Red Fort on Republic Day. Our programme will be very peaceful. We will announce the complete plan after January 15. We want to request farmers coming from parts of the country to participate in the January 26 plan to remain peaceful. We will never tolerate violence and any irresponsible behaviour,” Rajewal said.The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered 48th day on Tuesday.Farmer unions on Tuesday rejected the committee formed by the Supreme Court to resolve the stand-off over the three farm laws and termed it as a “proxy committee” of the government. The apex court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of three new contentious farm laws and constituted a four-member committee to hear all objections and report to the court.The farmer unions said they will not hold any discussion with the committee and alleged that all the four-members of the committee are pro-reforms. Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border on Tuesday evening, Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal, said, “All the four members of the committee have been openly justifying the three new farm laws. How can we expect them to take a rational stand on the matter? We had been saying that the farm unions will not accept any committee, forget about a committee like this… We never went to the Supreme Court demanding a committee. It’s the government who was trying to form a committee through the court.”Jagmohan Singh, secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said farmers will reject any committee even if its members are changed.“The idea behind setting up committees is to divert the attention of people from the real issues. The government is trying to end our movement. We want to tell the government that this is an indefinite movement and we will not go anywhere till the three new farm laws are repealed.”“The committee has been constituted to find out the drawbacks in the three laws. We don’t want to know that. We want to complete the revocation of these laws. The Supreme Court can help us by taking suo moto cognisance and repealing these laws. We do not want any committee. We want to negotiate with the government,” said another farmer leader Raminder Singh Patiala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-say-copies-of-new-laws-will-be-burnt-on-lohri-101610494951176.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Icy winds from Himalayas make Delhi shiver at 4.3°C||Icy winds that made the winter seem more frigid than it actually was, made residents of northwest India, including the capital, shiver in bitter cold on Tuesday, and the weather is expected to worsen over at least the next three days, the Regional Meteorological Centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The minimum temperature in Delhi fell to 4.3 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The air quality also deteriorated marginally and is likely to get worse in the coming days, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 4.3 degree Celsius, three degrees below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature on Tuesday was 17.6 degree Celsius, which was also two degrees lower than the normal for this time of the year.IMD scientists said the so-called feels-like temperature may be 2 degrees Celsius lower than the actual temperature recorded because of cold winds blowing in from the Himalayas at 15 to 25 kmph.“There is uplifted fog and cloud cover in many parts of NW India because of which the day temperatures are falling, nights are also very cold. This is because an intense western disturbance has passed on January 8 and northwesterly winds are blowing from the direction of the snow-clad Himalayas,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.IMD scientists said that while at the Safdarjung observatory “cold wave-like” conditions were observed on Tuesday, the minimum temperature over the coming few days is expected to remain around 4 degree Celsius.Even after the impact of two back-to-back western disturbances, the temperatures over Delhi have been above the season’s normal in the last 10 days.“After the western disturbance passed over Delhi, the wind direction changed to north-westerly,” said Srivastava.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that on Tuesday, the overall air quality index of Delhi was 293, in the ‘poor’ zone. This was a marginal deterioration from Monday’s 243.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), that the ventilation condition will worsen and wind speeds will drop from Wednesday afternoon.“The AQI is likely to slip in the ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/icy-winds-from-himalayas-make-delhi-shiver-at-43c-101610493761999.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Healthy and young to get the shot first||Younger healthcare workers without comorbidities will be the first to receive the shots against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on January 16, when the nationwide roll-out of the inoculation drive begins, several officials from Delhi involved in the process confirmed on Tuesday, requesting anonymity.Those between 20 and 49 years without comorbidities have to be selected in the list of 100 beneficiaries for each of the 89 centres that will kick-start the vaccination drive in Delhi, according to a communication from the state team to the district administrations.The districts have also been asked to focus on vaccinating safai karmacharis, ambulance staff, and ward boys in addition to the doctors and nurses, the district officials said.“This will help us monitor and better manage adverse reactions, if any. We have to put our best foot forward and instill confidence among people in the vaccines,” said a senior official from the South-West district.A senior official from New Delhi district said: “As a matter of utmost precaution, we will be selecting young and healthy volunteers for the first few days of the vaccination drive.”Senior North and West districts officials confirmed this.“All districts are currently conducting a sort of internal dry run to see everything runs smooth on the CoWIN platform on Saturday. The list of beneficiaries who will be vaccinated on that day will be finalised tomorrow,” said a senior official from Central district, refrying to the app that will facilitate the drive.Delhi has nearly 300,000 health care workers– doctors, nurses, paramedics, safai karmacharis, security personnel, and administrative personnel in health care facilities – who will receive the vaccine first.An estimated 600,000 frontline workers and 4.2 million people above the age of 50 will follow. The government is yet to prepare a list of those below 50 with comorbidities who will be eligible for the vaccine.The Delhi government did not respond to queries.So far, the city has received 264,000 doses of Covishield -- Indian variation of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and a member of the state task force on Covid-19 vaccination, said: “The hospitals will focus on staff other than the doctors and nurses, with many ward boys and other staff receiving the shot on the first day. The beneficiary list is yet to be finalised, but the decision to select young and healthy people is in line with the Centre’s mandate that those with co-morbidities receive the vaccine a little later.”She added: “The compliance is likely to be better among the younger people. Also, it is the young doctors, nurses and staff – those below the age of 50 – who have been working in the Covid-19 wards and it is important to protect them first.” She said a vaccination rate – those who actually get the vaccine among those identified as beneficiaries -- of 75% to 80% would be considered a success.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “The chances of any adverse event happening or the adverse event being dangerous is lower among the young and healthy people for vaccines in general. This could be the rationale behind selecting such beneficiaries early on.”He added: “In case of this vaccine, the decision could also have been based on the safety data that has been provided by the companies to the drug controller. The current analysis of safety is based on those between the ages of 18 and 50 and even though older volunteers have been included in the phase III trials, the sub-group analysis of the data is awaited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/healthy-and-young-to-get-the-shot-first-101610492291259.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Shots in store, Delhi set for vaccine roll-out||Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital in east Delhi’s Tahirpur received 264,000 doses of Covishield -- the Indian variation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – as India on Tuesday began the massive task of transporting the Covid-19 vaccine to all parts of the country ahead of the January 16 start of the immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease.In Delhi, the vaccination drive will be launched at 89 centres – which are part of the 5,000 sites approved by the Centre across the country – with healthcare workers being the first ones to get the jab. In Delhi, the drive is scheduled to be formally launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at Lok Nayak hospital, a senior government official said.“Delhi is fully prepared and all preparations are in place,” said Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain.The 89 locations approved so far include – 49 private hospitals and 40 public healthcare facilities. They include hospitals such as Lok Nayak, AIIMS, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, Sir Gangaram Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Fortis, Indraprastha Apollo, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality (Cancer), Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality (Tahirpur), ILBS, Venkateshwar Hospital (Dwarka), Madan Mohan Malviya (Malviya Nagar), Moolchand Hospital and St Stephen’s Hospital.Preparations at the 89 selected vaccination locations were on a full swing on Tuesday, with district officials taking note of any last-minute requirements. “We, the district officials, are just going to the sites and taking note of any last-minute additions or logistics that needs to be taken care of,” said a second government official.On the first day, one booth or vaccination site each will be there at 89 centres. However, over the next week, the government has planned to increase the total number of booths to at least 225, by setting up multiple vaccination sites in some of the locations, said a senior government official.The official added, “We have set up teams that have assessed the 89 vaccination locations. Several of them are capable of accommodating more than one vaccination site.”The teams have so far identified several hospitals that include Lok Nayak and AIIMS as locations that can have three or more vaccination sites, said the official. “At each site, there has to be space not only for vaccination but also for verification of candidates, and rooms where they can rest while being monitored for at least 30 minutes after taking the shot,” he said.Each booth will administer a maximum of 100 vaccine shots a day and run by six to eight staff.A health department official said, “There are 621 functional cold chain points. Each cold chain point will be connected to four to five vaccination sites. This means, most of the big hospitals will have more than one vaccination sites as they would need to quickly vaccinate all their own staff, before moving on to others from smaller centres,” said a health department official.With time, the government aims to increase both vaccination locations and vaccination sites. “We had sent a list of more than 600 locations, of which 89 have been approved by the central government so far. In the coming days, more locations are likely to get approved. Eventually, we have plans to increase vaccinations sites to 1,000 in several phases,” the official added.On Tuesday morning, 22 boxes containing 1,200 vials each of the vaccine was brought to Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital’s utility block that has been retrofitted with 90 deep freezers which can store 4.1 million doses of the vaccine. “Each of the vials contains ten doses of the vaccine. So far, Delhi has received 264,000 vaccine doses that will be almost enough for the healthcare workers in the city,” said another senior government official.“There are three levels of security that will be in place – first there are CCTV cameras installed within and outside the building, second there are hospital guards stationed at the vaccine store round the clock, and police personnel deployed outside the store,” said Dr Chavvi Gupta, spokesperson for the hospital.The Delhi has pegged the number of healthcare workers at 300,000, of which around 225,000 have already been registered. The government has planned to finish giving them the vaccine shots by the end of this month, said another official.Next in line would be frontline workers – a wide range of people including police, teachers, sanitation, and civil defence volunteers. Their total number has been estimated at 600,000 and registration process for them is underway.The third category that would include people aged over 50 years and those with serious comorbidities irrespective of age. The government has roughly pegged the number at 4.2 million for these categories taken together but, senior officials said, it is likely to witness increase. Registration for this category is yet to begin.While the government has prepared a draft list of people over 50 years through electoral data, those with comorbidities are yet to be identified, the official said.“We are committed to ensuring that the vaccination goes smoothly for people who are vaccinated as well as officials and workers involved in the process,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College and advisor to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shots-in-store-delhi-set-for-vaccine-rollout-101610491814388.html

13-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu: 200 more birds found dead in Maharashtra; tally touches 1,839 in 5 days||With a growing number of bird deaths being reported in Maharashtra, the risk of avian influenza, or bird flu, spreading across the state is also rising. On Tuesday, over 200 birds were found dead in the state, taking the tally of dead birds to 1,839 in the past five days.As of Monday, confirmed cases of bird flu cases have been recorded in Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed, Parbhani and Latur districts.Late on Tuesday evening, Bhandara district in Vidarbha region reported the death of poultry birds. State animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh said the exact number of deaths is yet to be ascertained, but if the number was large, the administration would not wait for official confirmation from ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal, the nodal body for testing bird flu cases. Instead, the local administration would treat the deaths as sign of a bird flu outbreak by enforcing a containment plan.“If the number of deaths is in large numbers at one location then it means it is a case of bird flu. Confirmation from the laboratory in such cases is just a formality because bird flu is virulent and thus, we have decided to immediately impose a containment plan in the concerned area, except culling of birds. We start culling only in case of laboratory confirmation,” said the commissioner.On Friday, over 200 chickens died in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha while 11 and three birds died in Amravati and Akola districts respectively. Akola has also reported the death of four crows in the past 24 hours. However, the state has not received any new reports of confirmed cases of bird flu from NIHSAD.Singh clarified that the state has not imposed any ban on supply, sale and purchase of poultry birds in Maharashtra. As a precautionary measure, sale and purchase of poultry birds is suspended only in a 10-kilometre radius from confirmed bird flu cases. The commissioner said the Centre is not in favour of enforcing a ban because it believes this would cause panic rather than serving any practical purpose.Following a confirmation of the H variant of avian influenza from Pune’s Western Regional Disease Diagnostic laboratory (WRDDL) in samples collected from Latur, the local administration started culling poultry birds and enacting other preventive measures in the district. The Centre has authorized the state government to impose a containment plan in case WRDDL finds the H variant of bird flu in order to contain the infection at the earliest. According to guidelines issued by the Central government, in case of confirmed cases of bird flu, the local administration must cull poultry birds within a one-km radius of the particular poultry farm where bird deaths due to avian influenza have been found. A surveillance zone must be set up in a 10-km radius within which no birds may be sold or purchased. The particular village where the affected poultry farm is situated will be declared a prohibited area, which means no one can enter or exit its boundaries. A medical team will be set up to carry out examinations of locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-200-more-birds-found-dead-in-maharashtra-tally-touches-1-839-in-5-days-101610481199288.html

At Colaba, the minimum temperature was 23.4 degrees Celsius, only 0.1 degrees below Monday’s record and 5.4 degrees above normal. “Usually, cold wave in the state and city is because of the cold wind coming in from north India. This year, however, there is a change in wind patterns. Warm easterly winds from Telangana and Tamil Nadu are causing temperatures to rise,” said a senior official from IMD, western region. Meanwhile, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), with days becoming hotter, pollution levels have dipped further. An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator— of 218 was measured on Tuesday.

13-01-2021||Mumbai||23-year-old Mumbai man gets 10 years rigorous imprisonment for eloping with minor niece||The special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court on Monday sentenced a 23-year-old man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment (RI) for eloping and committing aggravated sexual assault on his 16-year-old niece. The girl in her testimony had admitted that the two were in a relationship. While convicting the accused the court pointed out that despite being her maternal uncle, instead of counselling the victim and talking with her parents, he eloped with her. The court hence convicted him for kidnapping and rape, observing, “He had sexual relations with the victim on more than one occasion and therefore he has committed aggravated sexual assault.” The court has also imposed a fine of ₹25,000 on the accused, of which ₹15,000 is to be paid to the victim’s family as compensation. As per the prosecution’s case, the mother of the girl alleged that on September 23, 2016, the 16-year-old was upset after being scolded for waking up late. The girl later went to college but did not return home. Her phone too was switched off. The family filed a missing person complaint on September 24, 2016. During the probe, the mother disclosed that the accused and the girl were in a relationship and the accused is a maternal uncle of the girl. After this, police started looking for the two and they were found them staying together in Pune. The victim in her statement claimed that they had eloped in Pune and were staying as a married couple. The victim claimed that after leaving from home, she went to Bandra Bandstand and called the accused. She told him that she was under a lot of pressure because of her studies and did not want to continue her education. She further deposed that she asked the accused to take her to Pune where they could settle down. She claimed that they stayed in Pune for almost a month after getting married. “The accused is the maternal uncle of the victim. He has taken undue advantage of the disturbed mental state of the victim. He kidnapped her and took her to Pune where he committed penetrative sexual assault upon her, knowing fully well that she was minor and that he was her maternal uncle. The marriage between the accused and the victim is prohibited as per the Hindu Marriage Act,” the prosecution argued in court. The defence argued that the victim has categorically deposed that she left the house on her own and that she was in a romantic relationship with the accused. “There were consensual sexual relations between them. The victim has further deposed that she had completed 18 years of age at the time of marriage to the accused,” said the accused’s lawyer. The prosecution, however, proved that the girl was 16-years, 11-months-old at the time of the marriage. The court accepted the prosecution’s case and found the accused guilty of kidnapping and sexually assaulting the minor girl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/23yearold-mumbai-man-gets-10-years-rigorous-imprisonment-for-eloping-with-minor-niece-101610480358888.html

This year, the state education department announced a 25% reduction in the syllabus for state board students of Classes 1 to 12. The decision will be applicable for the current academic year 2020-21 and has been taken considering the loss of teaching hours as physical schools are yet to reopen due to the pandemic. In a letter addressed to the board, the Brihanmumbai Association of Heads of Secondary (higher secondary) Schools requested a reduction in the Class 10 syllabus by 50% for the current academic year. “As of now, schools and junior colleges in the city remain shut and there is no clarity on when they will be able to reopen fully. While the education department has already reduced the syllabus by 25%, completing 75% syllabus and preparing for it will be tough for students. We, thus, hope for a further reduction of 25%,” said Prashant Redij, secretary of the association. Principals said they were worried about students suffering in the board exams if a concession is not given during the current situation. “The paper pattern for these students is the same the as last year and so is the difficulty level of the papers. This would push a lot of weak students further on the verge of losing a year,” said the principal of a school in the eastern suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cut-down-class-10-syllabus-by-50-principals-urge-state-board-101610480243071.html

Jagtap said that the ‘Hyderabad pattern of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’ would not have any bearing in Mumbai, during the civic polls.Jagtap, who was appointed as Mumbai Congress president three weeks ago, said that his emphasis would be on weeding out the factionalism in the city unit. “We are well aware that the north Indian voters have shifted away from Congress in the last few years. We have begun the process of winning them back. I have met a few leaders who have an influence on the community. Besides them, a few leaders who have joined BJP in the last few years will soon rejoin Congress and the voters too will come back to us,” he said.Key north Indian leaders including Kripashankar Singh, Rajhans Singh have defected from the party, while its former president Sanjay Nirupam is sulking from the party affairs. Jagtap said that there are a number of leaders who are ready to return to the party. “I would not take names, but there would be ‘gharwapsi’ of leaders in the near future. Secondly, there would be no room for the factionalism in the party. Soon after, becoming the chief of the city unit, I met all the prominent party leaders from the city. There may be camps in the city, but I want to assure you that there is no ‘Bhai Jagtap’ camp in the unit,” he said.Jagtap, while talking to a group of a select journalist on Tuesday, said that BJP’s Hyderabad pattern would not have any bearing in BMC elections. “There may be similar attempts by the party, but we are ready to face it. We will have our own Mumbai-pattern to counter it. If the national leadership of the BJP participated in the civic polls, we will attack their failure in controlling the prices of diesel, petrol and high rate of unemployment. The culture of two cities is different,” he said.Jagtap said that they are demanding delimitation of wards on the basis of 2021 census and reservation of the wards to be announced for 10 years, instead of current reservation of five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/we-will-get-north-indian-voters-back-says-mumbai-congress-chief-101610479998797.html

They charged between ₹80,000 to ₹1 lakh and then sent fake visas and bogus employment contracts with Russian companies to the job seekers,” said Akbar Pathan, deputy commissioner of police. “After scrutinising the seized passports, it appears that the accused had targeted people from other states so they could not register complaints against them once they were cheated,” added Pathan.Follow a tip-off, police inspector Sanjeev Gavade and his team of unit 8 raided the accused’s office on Monday. Six accused were arrested, and during the search, police seized 41 passports, bogus Russian visas and employment contracts of Russian companies. “The accused had accepted the payments through bank transactions as well as cash from the victims,” said Gavade.The accused have been charged for forgery and cheating under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/six-arrested-in-mumbai-for-duping-people-by-offering-bogus-work-visas-fake-employment-contracts-of-russian-firms-101610479939410.html

On April 14, Teltumbde surrendered before NIA in Mumbai. The agency had said it needed to probe Teltumbde’s alleged links with the banned outfit, Communist Party of India (CPI, Maoist).In the bail plea filed on Tuesday, Teltumbde’s legal team has denied all the allegations of his involvement in the case and his connection with activities of the banned organisation.NIA in their supplementary charge-sheet against Teltumbde and others on October 9 last year, claimed that Teltumbde is a senior member of the CPI (Maoist) group and was working in urban areas. The agency claimed that he was in contact with all the arrested accused.The agency claimed that Teltumbde was one of the conveners of the Elgar Parishad incident and was present at Shaniwar Wada when the event took place. “To further the activities of CPI (Maoist) on an international level, he used to attend international conferences under the guise of academic visits to Canada, Pakistan, USA, France, etc. In the said conferences, Teltumbde used to exchange literature on ideology, training and working strategy of the CPI (Maoist) with international communist organisations,” NIA claimed in its charge-sheet.The agency has also claimed that Teltumbde is the elder brother to wanted accused Milind Teltumbde, central committee member (CCM) and secretary of Maharashtra – Madhya Pradesh Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone of CPI (Maoist).“Milind alias Deepak is expanding the Naxal movement of Maoist in urban areas with the help of his elder brother Anand Teltumbde on the international level and took guidance from him.

You’ll get QR code certificate on phone||All vaccine beneficiaries in Maharashtra will be given a vaccination certificate with unique QR (quick response) code as proof of their Covid-19 immunisation.From January 16 (Saturday), the mass immunisation process against coronavirus is set to commence across the country. So far, 7.72 lakh healthcare workers have registered on Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) — an online app for planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the immunisation process.As per a new feature on Co-WIN , the unique QR code-based vaccination certificate can be saved on mobile phones. The certificate will act as a ‘vaccine passport’ for international travellers and also help curb the cases of fake claims of immunisation.“The unique QR code generation for each beneficiary will act as proof that the person has received the vaccine,” said state immunisation officer Dr D Patil. “As everything will be centralised, the code will contain all the requisite information about the individual. So if anyone provides a fake vaccination certificate, the authorities can easily nab the person,” he added.As per protocol, interchanging different types of vaccines is not allowed and a person should take both the shots of a single vaccine. The second shot is administered 28 days after the first dose. Beneficiaries may develop minor side effects such as fever and body ache. The Maharashtra health department has trained its vaccinators to also address the problem of side effects.“People with weaker immunity such as cancer patients or those suffering from diabetes, need to take the vaccine, as they fall into the category of high-risk groups. They should take at least a 30-minute rest after taking the shot,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/got-covid-19-vaccine-you-ll-get-qr-code-certificate-on-phone-101610479579084.html

In Mumbai, till now at least nine deaths of crows have been reported due to bird flu.According to BMC officials, till now deaths have been only reported in crows so far.An BMC’s disaster management cell said, “We have received 32 complaints between January 5 and 11, of which, death of 72 birds was reported. As per the protocol, we inform the animal husbandry department and local ward offices of BMC.”The BMC official added, “Till now, whatever deaths have been reported are of crows or migratory birds. Bird flu reports for only two dead birds have been tested positive yet.”On Tuesday, a day after BMC appealed to citizens to report about deaths of birds on its helpline 1916, the BMC got over 50 calls till evening.The BMC, starting Tuesday, has undertaken a drive to visit all the poultry retailers and shopkeepers to check on cleanliness and hygiene being followed by them. Manish Valanju, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s L ward that covers Kurla area said, “Our market department is visiting shops of chicken and mutton, and inspecting for cleanliness and hygiene.”Valanju added, “We are informing shop owners to report deaths to us, in case of any deaths reported in their shops. We are also attending calls from citizens about bird deaths. On Tuesday, we have attended around five calls for the L ward area.”Further, the BMC in a circular issued on Monday had directed its officials that before burying dead birds, they will have to inform rapid response team formed by the state government to tackle the spread of bird flu.The BMC is also going to conduct citizen awareness programmes on how the spread of bird flu takes place. This comes in the backdrop of retailers selling eggs and chicken, citing that their business has gone down owing to fear of bird flu.Vasant Kumar Shetty, president of Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association in Maharashtra said, “We have witnessed a drop of 10-15% in sales of chicken in the last few days. However, from time to time we as an association and the government have promoted that it is safe to consume chicken if it is cooked properly. We expect the demand to gather pace in another 10 days.”Shetty added, “I feel that from next week the fear will die down, and people will come back to eating chicken, considering it is a very affordable form of non-vegetarian food. There will be few who have migrated to mutton for now, but that will not be feasible for a longer period, owing to its cost.”Meanwhile, the animal husbandry department of the state in a statement issued on Monday had appealed citizens to not spread unscientific information about bird flu adding that it is safe to consume eggs and poultry meat if cooked above 70 degree Celsius for 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/72-birds-found-dead-in-city-since-january-5-says-mumbai-civic-body-101610478858867.html

According to the presentation made to the chief minister, the ₹7,000-crore BVSL is expected to be completed by 2025. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is executing both the projects, has also completed the pre-feasibility study for the Versova-Virar sea link. The 43-km sea link is expected to be completed in two phases. The first phase will be between Versova and Vasai and the second between Vasai and Virar, a statement issued by the chief minister’s office said. According to MSRDC, the construction of the sea bridge will not deter the daily routine of fishermen. “Navigation spans will be provided at four locations to facilitate movement. A detailed project report will now be made on the project,” a senior official from MSRDC said. HT had earlier reported that the 4+4 lane main bridge will connect Versova to Virar with 3+3 lane connectors at four locations. With the coastal road, the Bandra-Worli sea link, Bandra-Versova sea link and the Virar extension, the state is looking at reducing the travel distance from Nariman Point in south Mumbai to Virar (almost 30km from Borivli) from the current three hours to one hour by car.

13-01-2021||Mumbai||35-60% seats in Maharashtra vacant in private dental colleges: Report||Days after the Central government extended the admissions deadline for undergraduate medical and dental seats until January 15 to fill up all vacant seats across the country, the Dental Council of India (DCI) through its latest circular has extended admissions deadline for Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) course until January 31. The step comes after several states showed as many as 35-60% vacant seats in private dental colleges.According to information shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell, almost 35% seats - 852 seats out of 2,400 seats - in private dental colleges in Maharashtra remain vacant as of January 8, post three common admission rounds and two mop-up rounds. Last year, 1,028 seats out of 2,350 seats in private dental colleges had gone vacant after three common admission rounds and the same figure stood at 622 in 2018.“In the last two rounds, admission withdrawals were higher than the number of seat confirmations, which could be because more students got a betterment option in a government or private medical college in Maharashtra or any other state,” said a senior official from the CET cell. He added that the extension in admissions deadline might not change the situation, especially since many colleges have already started lectures for their first-year batches.The rise in vacancy in dental institutes has been the trend for some years now, especially in states like Karnataka, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, forcing more and more state governments to seek permission from the central government to lower the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) percentile score for eligibility.An aspirant needs to score at least 50 percentile in NEET to be eligible for admission to a dental institute, however, the state of Karnataka has sought that this eligibility score is lowered to 20 percentile after almost 60% of their seats in private dental colleges remained vacant even after two rounds of admission.Experts have time and again pointed at the issues of unemployment prevailing in this sector for BDS graduates, as well as the high financial back-up to set up a private practice as the main reason for the decline in demand for the course. “Dentists don’t get absorbed into the system as the MBBS graduates do, and if they want to set up their practice they need financial backing which is very difficult for most people,” said Muzaffar Khan, a Thane-based medical education counsellor. He added that this has led to poor demand for the course in most rural parts of the country.Recently, HT had reported how deemed dental institutes in the state have witnessed a 163% increase in seat vacancy under the management and NRI quotas, compared to last year. As per information shared by the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS) recently, close to 318 seats are vacant under the management as well as NRI quotas this year, after three common admission and two mop-up rounds.The deputy dean of a private dental institute in the state said that the constant delay in admissions and insistence of the state government to conduct several common admission rounds is the main reason for discouraging dental aspirants. “Until three years ago, no dental institute complained of seat vacancy but ever since 85% seats of the private dental institutes are being filled up by the state CET cell, more and more dental institutes are bearing the brunt of high seat vacancy in the course,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3560-seats-in-maharashtra-vacant-in-private-dental-colleges-report-101610478678880.html

The woman alleged that the police are not accepting her written complaint against the minister and her life is under threat. Munde, however, claimed that the woman is trying to defame and blackmail him.The woman accusing the minister is the sister of a woman with whom Munde had a prior relationship. In a copy of a complaint uploaded on her Twitter handle, the woman mentioned that Munde made sexual advances towards her without her consent since 2006. “He (Munde) has promised to get me launched as a singer in Bollywood,” the complaint states.Following the post, Munde issued a public clarification on his social media account and said that the victim and her sister with whom he was in a relationship, were blackmailing him since 2019. Her brother is also involved in the alleged conspiracy. “On November 12, 2020, I filed a police complaint, and a case was filed in the Bombay high court. The court has prohibited the woman (with whom he was in a relationship) from posting objectionable posts on social media,” the clarification said.“The allegations made against me by her sister are false and unfounded. They want to blackmail me, and thus [are] making baseless allegations. I have the text messages with me as proof in which she has demanded crores,” Munde added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-social-justice-minister-and-ncp-leader-dhananjay-munde-denies-rape-claims-says-woman-is-blackmailing-him-101610478501595.html
13-01-2021||Mumbai||Will Maharashtra’s MVA government revive the ambitious Konkan coastal road project?||The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is reviving the plan to construct a coastal road through three districts of Konkan. The project is expected to give a boost to tourism and industry in the coastal region. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has chalked out a plan for the development of the 444-km coastal road between Revas in Raigad and Patradevi in Sindhudurg, at an estimated cost of ₹9,573 crore.In a presentation made by MSRDC to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, the corporation proposed the construction of the road to connect ports, industrial nodes, religious places and tourist destinations.It has also proposed the construction of connecting roads and beautification of 27 places along the route.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has already given in-principal approval for the two- and four-lane highway, and consultants have been appointed for four packages of the project. The packages have been segregated between Revas-Bankot in Raigad, Bankot-Jaigad in Ratnagiri, Jaigad-Devgad in Sindhudurg and Devgad-Aronda in Sindhudurg. MSRDC informed the CM that the project reports of these packages have also been prepared.The coastal road assumes importance for the MVA government as the Thackeray-led state government has been focussing on infrastructure development of coastal districts. “The Shiv Sena has its voter base in coastal regions, and in the last one year, the government has concentrated on major projects in this region. The development of the coastal road could be in response to the previous government’s pet project Samruddhi Expressway between Mumbai and Nagpur,” said an official from the state public works department.The Konkan coastal road project was put on the backburner for more than two decades owing to multiple issues, including land acquisition, high cost and priority given to widening of the Mumbai-Goa highway.“The coastal highway will provide a major boost to tourism in the Konkan belt, which has a variety of beaches, forts, and religious places. The proposed plan has nine bridges over creeks and cross-sections at 28 places. It has proposed townships at an average distance of 30km,” said an official from MSRDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/will-maharashtra-s-mva-government-revive-the-ambitious-konkan-coastal-road-project-101610478259219.html

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had vacated the building before monsoon 2020. Due to the dangerous condition of the building, some tenants had moved out but later decided to return. As it is a cessed building, the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) had issued a no-objection certificate to the tenants for repairs at their own cost. Tenants of the building had then said that they were prepared to repair the building with the required permissions, however, the plan got delayed due to the pandemic. “During the investigation, negligence surfaced on the building owner’s part, and hence he has been booked, and further investigation is on. We are yet to receive reports from Mhada and the fire brigade department,” a police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fort-building-collapse-mumbai-police-book-owner-for-negligence-101610478078883.html

The vaccine doses will be stored at a temporary cold storage facility set up on the ground floor of the F-South ward office in Parel, until the civic body prepares the regional vaccine storage (RVS) five-storey Parivar building at Kanjurmarg, which has been identified as the centre for storing doses.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal confirmed to HT that Mumbai will receive its vaccine doses from the state on Wednesday and that the vaccination drive will start as scheduled on January 16.The nine vaccination centres in Mumbai are: The four major hospitals — KEM Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper Hospital and Sion Hospital; four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli; and the Covid-19 facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex.The centres have a total of 72 booths for vaccination, and each booth will be handled by a team of five vaccinators.Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said, “The nine vaccination centres with a total of 72 booths have a capacity to vaccinate 14,000 people a day. Once the drive is launched on January 16, it will continue every day until the beneficiaries shortlisted for the first phase are vaccinated. We have not received information on when the second phase will start. We are also yet to receive information on how many doses we will get in the first lot on Wednesday.”Swapnaja Kshirsagar, assistant commissioner, F-South ward, where the doses will be stored temporarily, said, “We have vacated a room on the ground floor of the ward office building and handed it over to the civic health department for storing vaccine doses. All logistics thereafter are being handled by the health department.”The storage facility at F-South ward has a total of 10 ice-lined refrigerators with a capacity to store up to 600,000 vaccine doses at a time, according to Dr Gomare.The distribution mechanism already existing under the routine immunisation programme shall be implemented for Covid-19 vaccine. Additional vehicles will be deployed for transporting the vaccine from the Kanjurmarg facility to the vaccine centres with the help of police. Deans and medical superintendents of the hospitals will identify dedicated persons (pharmacists or cold chain handlers) for maintaining the inventory of Covid -19 vaccine when it is made available from the central storage. Dr Gomare said, “We will inform the police that the vaccines are being distributed to the vaccination centres.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, in-charge of the public health department, said, “The BMC has to pick up the vaccine doses from the manufacturer. We have already sent vehicles to Pune and they have reached the manufacturer. Hopefully they will pack and leave by tonight [Tuesday night] itself.” Regarding the storage facility at F-South ward office, Kakani said, “Even though the Kanjurmarg storage facility is ready, it is large and in the first phase we are going to get fewer doses in comparison. So we have not activated the facility yet. The F-South ward office is centrally located, so it will also be easier to transport the doses to all centres from here, instead of from Kanjurmarg. Once the facility at F-South office is full, we will begin to store at Kanjurmarg.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-set-to-get-its-vaccine-doses-today-101610477604884.html
13-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccine in Maharashtra: 1st batch of vials in hand, state to inoculate 800K people in two months||Starting from January 16, the state is expecting to complete vaccination of 800,000 health workers in the next two months. The state received 963,000 vials of the Covishield vaccine, of the 1 million to be provided by the Centre in the first lot, at its facility in Pune on Tuesday evening and said it will start the distribution process once it receives a list from the Centre. However, each person is required to take two doses and the stock provided is inadequate. To that, officials have said the gap between two doses is 28 days and thus they have sufficient time to get another stock of vials from the Centre.The Centre is providing both vaccines — Covishield of Serum Institute of India (SII) and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech — approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) for Covid-19, irrespective of the demand made by the state government for providing only one type of vaccine to avoid confusion.“We have received first stock of 963,000 vials from the Centre and following the guidelines, they will be distributed to 511 vaccination centres, covering all districts and cities in the state. We have also developed 3,135 cold chains to be used for storing vaccines,” said health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday.Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare and director, National Health Mission, said the state has got the stock from SII in Pune. “The central government has communicated to provide 963,000 vials of Covishield (SII) and 20,000 vials of Covaxin (Bharat Biotech). We have received SII stock directly from Pune, from where it is going to be distributed in refrigerated trucks,” he said.However, the Centre will decide how many vials are going to be distributed to a particular region. This led to a delay in dispatching the stock to the respective regions as the state did not receive the distribution list, at least till the time of going to press.“We have received the vaccine stock at the Pune facility and are waiting for the distribution list from the Centre to start the process. The Centre is deciding which region will get how many vials. The vaccines are ready to be transported by road in refrigerated trucks and they will start moving as soon as we get the approval. We are hoping to get the nod in the next few hours, following which trucks for regions like Nagpur that are far-off will be released immediately so that we can cover districts like Gadchiroli by January 14,” said Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer.“We have planned the distribution of vaccines by road and a delay of every hour would make the task difficult for us considering the distance. Health is a state subject and at least it should be given the powers to decide the distribution plan, but Centre has said that since registration of all healthcare providers was done at Co-WIN app and since they know which areas has how many health workers, we will take the decision,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The state has planned to cover around 30 million people in the first three phases, which are likely to be completed in six months, the officials said.“According to the priority groups created by the Centre, healthcare providers are going to be provided the vaccination in the first phase, frontline workers in the second phase and people above 50 years of age and those with comorbidities below the age of 50 will be given vaccine shots in the third phase of the drive,” the health ministerThe healthcare workers, include public as well as private workers, who are again divided into nine categories. Of around 800,000 healthcare providers, registration of 784,000 has been completed and the rest can register on the Co-WIN app, developed by the Centre, by Tuesday midnight.The state government has trained 17,749 vaccinators to administer shots to the beneficiaries. It has also developed 3,135 cold chains, covering one state-level cold storage, nine regional-level cold storages, 34 district-level cold storages and 27 municipal corporation-level cold storages. In addition, 21 walk-in-coolers, four walk-in-freezers, 4,153 ice-lined refrigerators and 3,937 deep freezers are going to be used for the drive. The Centre has also provided 1,200 vaccine carriers that have also been distributed among districts, Tope informed.Of the total 511 vaccination camps set up across the state, each will be covering 100 beneficiaries in a day. Each centre will have a team of five with one vaccinator and four supporting staff, who will confirm a person’s identity, ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour has been followed at the centre, make entries on the mobile application (Co-WIN) and follow the Adverse Event Following Immunisation (AEFI) protocol in case a person starts facing health complication or side effects post vaccination,” the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccine-in-maharashtra-1st-batch-of-vials-in-hand-state-to-inoculate-800k-people-in-two-months-101610477178663.html
13-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body gives nod for schools to hold offline exams||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has allowed city schools under the Cambridge board to conduct exams for Classes 9 to 12 offline, with all precautions as prescribed by the civic body, while schools of all other boards will be allowed to conduct board exams for Classes 10 and 12. As per a circular issued by the civic body late on Tuesday, schools under all boards such as the state, ICSE, CBSE etc shall be allowed to conduct all exams announced or to be announced by the respective boards for Class 10 and 12 in the offline format. “Schools under the Cambridge board can conduct preliminary exams or preboard exams as per their schedules offline while those under all the other boards can also conduct exams prescribed by the respective boards for Classes 10 and 12,” stated the circular. The circular comes a few days after the Members of International Schools’ Association (MISA) requested the civic body to allow reopening of schools for the conduct of prelim exams especially for students of Classes 10 and 12. This year, Cambridge International has scheduled its board exams from the last week of January. Francis Joseph, who represented MISA in the matter said schools were now hoping to get permission to reopen for classes too. “We hope that schools are allowed to reopen from January 18 with all the precautions in place,” he added. Due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, there was a lot of uncertainty about the conduct of exams in schools across various boards. While the CBSE has announced that its board exams will be held in May, the Maharashtra state board has recently said that the exams will be held in April and May for Class 12 and 10 respectively. The state board is yet to announce a timetable for its exams. As per the guidelines issued by the BMC in December, schools in the city shall remain closed at least until January 15. In other parts of the state, schools for Classes 9 to 12 have reopened since November 23 with the necessary precautions. Schools under consulates and embassies in Mumbai are allowed to reopen from January 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-gives-nod-for-schools-to-hold-offline-exams-101610476699295.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||DDA approves construction of Ravidas temple in Jahanpanah forest||Two years after its demolition, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday gave final nod for the construction of Ravidas temple in Jahanpanah City forest in South Delhi’s Tughlaqabad.The proposal will now be sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for final notification after which the land will be handed over to the devotees.The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, in which the DDA also approved the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy and other major decisions for the city’s development.A senior DDA official said, “The land use of a 400 sqm plot, site where the temple existed, in the city forest has been changed from recreational to public and semi-public. We have got all the necessary permission from various departments for this. Once notified by the HUA ministry, we will initiate the process to transfer the land to the trustees for construction of the temple.”A proposal to allot 400 sqm land parcel in the city forest for the construction of the temple was approved by the DDA in October last year.In August last year, the DDA had demolished the temple following a Supreme Court order. The demolition had led to a protests by the devotees of Guru Ravidas in Delhi and several parts of north India. In November 2019, the Supreme Court had allowed construction of the temple at the same location.The revised TOD policy, which has been hanging fire for the past five years, will now be sent to the ministry for final notification. The DDA will now develop the Sanjay Lake complex in Trilokpuri based on the new policy.“Considering the carrying capacity of Delhi in terms of infrastructure requirement, the TOD policy for Delhi was revised and notified by the ministry in December 2019… However, it required certain corrections in the corresponding chapters to enable the revised TOD policy to be implemented on the ground,” said the official.It was also decided to set up CNG/electric vehicle fuel stations in community centres located on roads with right of way of 24m. “As per the existing provision, a minimum 30 metres RoW is needed. This will facilitate setting up CNG-cum-electric vehicle stations in the developed areas where there is no scope of road widening. CNG-cum-EV fuel stations are completely green fuel retail outlets which are the priority for environment and the need of the hour,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-approves-construction-of-ravidas-temple-in-jahanpanah-forest-101610475677782.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Special prosecutors appointed by us not binding on Delhi govt, police tells HC||The Delhi police on Tuesday told the Delhi High Court that the appointment of Special Public Prosecutors (SPPs) for the north-east Delhi riots was not “binding” on the state government.The police, in an affidavit, told Justice Pratibha M Singh that it had merely sent a recommendation for the appointment of the SPPs under law but the decision was taken by the Delhi government using its constitutional power. The investigating agency said that it would not want to interfere in the internal matters of the city government.“…the police does not have the authority to appoint Special Public Prosecutors and it falls within the domain of the Delhi government. Delhi police being an investigating agency had recommended the name of the prosecutors who were met the criteria and had vast professional experience as practicing lawyers in criminal matters.“However, such recommendations are not binding and the Delhi government, subject to the constitutional limitations, is empowered to appoint such SPPs,” the Delhi police said, while responding to a plea by the Delhi Prosecutors Welfare Association (DPWA) challenging appointment of the SPPs in the riots cases.The police, in response, also said that an investigation is taken to its logical conclusion by prosecution and Delhi Police has consistently recommended the appointment of certain counsels as SPPs.During the hearing, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, Gautam Narayan told the court that the list sent by the police was initially rejected by the Delhi government, which had forwarded its own list of SPPs.However, the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) intervened in the matter and did not agree with the Delhi government’s list and in view of the difference of opinion, the matter was referred to the President of India who approved the list sent by the police.“The Delhi government only issued the notification informing about the appointment of the SPPs and it has not appointed them,” he added.Justice Singh, after the brief hearing, was of the view that the petition appeared to be in the nature of a PIL and directed the high court registry to list it before the appropriate bench on March 15.The plea filed through advocates Kushal Kumar and Akashdeep Gupta has questioned how SPPs can be appointed at the behest of the police. It has contended that the prosecution has to be independent and insulated from the police and therefore, the SPPs cannot be appointed at the behest of the investigating agency.The petition has sought quashing of Delhi government’s June 24, 2020 notification appointing the SPPs, including Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, on the grounds that it was issued on police recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ne-delhi-riots-special-prosecutors-appointed-by-us-not-binding-on-delhi-govt-police-tells-hc-101610475618305.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||4,000 suspects scrutinised, 220 questioned to arrest molester||A scrutiny of 4,000 men released recently from jail, analysis of dossiers of 140 criminals, footage from 160 CCTV cameras and interrogation of 220 suspects led the police to arrest a man who had molested and robbed a 17-year-old girl in a forested area near a prominent hotel in Chanakyapuri neighbourhood late last month, the police said Tuesday.The suspect, identified as Neetu Lal, had allegedly robbed the girl at knifepoint, tore off her clothes and molested her before a fightback by the girl forced him to flee.The girl had been living with her aunt in Bihar and her parents live in Old Delhi. “She did not want to stay with her aunt and had escaped from that home with her belongings and documents. She had caught a train and reached New Delhi railway station on December 24,” said a senior police officer, not authorised to speak to the media.As she waited at the New Delhi railway station to catch a train to Old Delhi railway station, Lal allegedly approached her and offered her help to board a local bus that would take her home quicker than a train.The girl agreed, but the man made her alight from the bus at Sardar Patel Marg bus stop near Taj Hotel in Chanakyapuri, said the officer. “Thereafter, he led the girl to the forested area nearby where he robbed her of her bag at knifepoint, tore off her clothes and molested her,” the officer said.The girl, however, fought back. “She picked up stones and threw them at Lal and began screaming for help. That forced Lal to take her belongings and flee,” the officer said.Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), said after escaping from Lal, the girl contacted the police upon which a case of robbery, molestation, kidnapping and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered.“We formed four teams to find the suspect. The teams pursued over 4,000 potential suspects even as the survivor helped with a sketch of the assailant. The breakthrough came in the form of CCTV footage that showed the suspect getting off the bus with the girl,” the DCP said.Thereafter, the police showed the CCTV footage to hundreds of people along the route the suspect had taken.“We finally found a street vendor near the crime spot. He said he had seen the suspect around that area in the past. We asked him to alert us the next time he was seen around. On Saturday, the vendor alerted us and we caught the suspect,” the other officer said.Lal is unemployed and hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. While there are no previous criminal cases against him, the police are probing if he had targeted others the way he did the girl.The police have recovered much of the stolen items, the knife allegedly used in the crime and the girl’s clothes from the crime spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4000-suspects-scrutinised-220-questioned-to-arrest-man-who-molested-minor-in-chanakayapuri-101610475617856.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||MCD strike cloud on Covid vaccination drive in Delhi||As Delhi moves towards commencing a mega vaccination drive in its battle against Covid, an ongoing strike by civic body employees to demand outstanding wages is likely to throw a spanner in the works.The vaccination programme will start in the city from January 16, with municipal employees — such as primary health workers, nursing staff and teachers — likely to be roped-in for the programme.Nurses, paramedic staff, ward boys, primary teachers along with the employees of other departments in civic bodies, majorly from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, have been on strike since January 7 against non-payment of pending salaries for the last 3-5 months.The agitating employees, especially those from health and education departments of the civic bodies, have said they will “not cooperate” in the vaccination drive until their salaries are cleared.AP Khan, convener Confederation of MCD Employees Union, said that nurses, paramedic staff, sanitation staff and teachers will be engaged in the vaccination process from the three civic bodies, but it has been decided that there will be “complete non-cooperation”.“We have communicated to the concerned heads of the health and education departments of the civic bodies regarding our non-cooperation in the vaccination drive. It is a matter of our survival and we cannot keep working without salaries for eternity. It has been over three months since nurses and paramedic staff in north corporation received their salaries. The teachers have not been paid since July 2020,” Khan said.According to details, nearly 3,500 employees of the three municipalities are likely to be roped-in during the massive vaccination programme, which will be conducted in different phases.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has 64 vaccination centres including at its three hospital — Hindu Rao, Kasturba and Girdhar Lal. Nearly 1,000 employees of north corporation were imparted training for vaccination programme. Similarly, the number of vaccination centres in South Delhi Municipal Corporation is 58 and nearly 800 workers have been trained for the drive. Officials of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) said that they have made 32 centres for vaccination programme and have imparted training to over 250 employees.Officials in the state health department said that once the vaccination drive begins in full swing with 1,000 (vaccination) centres, the government has estimated it would need a total 3,500 trained personnel to run these booths.“Of the 3,500 personnel, around 1,750 will be workers from the municipal corporations (MCDs). These personnel will run vaccination booths and include doctors, nurses, paramedic staff and even teachers,” a senior official said.Government officials said the strike by MCD employees will not immediately impact the drive. “But, if the stalemate doesn’t end by the end of this month, we may face some serious manpower crunch once the main vaccination programme is rolled out,” a second senior official said.“The first phase is starting with just 89 centres in Delhi. So, the strike will not have much of an impact.None of the 89 centres are in any MCD facility. We have calculated the manpower requirement and found that only around 50-60 MCD workers will be needed in the first phase,” the official said.Civic authorities said that they are reaching out to agitating employees and have appealed them to “not create hinderance” . They say that if the deadlock does not end, then action — such as invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) — may be taken.Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said that vaccination programme is a national campaign and employees would have to participate in the drive.“I have appealed all the employees, whose duty has been assigned for the vaccination programme, to return to work . Issue of salaries and vaccination drive should not mix and we are making efforts to release pending salaries as soon as possible,” he said.Responding to this, convenor of the Confederation, Khan, said that agitating employees are “ready to face any action”.Nirmal Jain, mayor EDMC, said, “There is no significant strike in the EDMC so the chances of impact on vaccination drive is bleak. We have made all preparations and are ready to start the mega campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mcd-strike-cloud-on-covid-vaccination-drive-in-delhi-101610475557778.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Claps, cheers greet arrival of vaccine at Rajiv Gandhi super speciality hospital||Local residents and those who work at the nearby chemist shops clapped and cheered as a truck carrying a consignment of 264,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine entered the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital in east Delhi’s Tahirpur on Tuesday afternoon.Several people who had gathered near the hospital gate said they knew by the heavy police deployment that the “corona vaccine is coming”. As the truck entered the hospital building with four police vans escorting it, many of those who were waiting on the road, clicked photos on their mobile phones.Several hospital staff also clicked selfies when the vaccine was taken from the truck to the storage facility.Hospital authorities said they received 22 boxes of Covidshield, Indian variant of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Each box has 1,200 vials and each vial has 10 doses. The hospital authorities are expecting a consignment of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on Wednesday morning.As the boxes were kept inside the facility, Delhi police placed barricades to stop outsiders from going inside. Police then formed a two-layer security ring to guard the vaccine -- one on gate number 3, which is the main gate of the hospital (near the storage facility) and another outside the facility where the vaccine was stored. At both the layers, police placed barriers to restrict movement of unauthorised persons. Within minutes of the vaccine reaching the hospital-- outside the facility but within the hospital complex -- there were several relatives of Covid-19 patients who had come to see the vaccine.A gate (connected to the main road) used by outsiders until recently has also been closed so that there is no movement of outsiders near the facility.“There is a temple and two churches outside the hospital. I saw many locals and patients of relatives praying once they saw the vaccine. This is what everyone was waiting for, “said Ramnishkit, 40, who runs a chemist outside the hospital.A quick response team (QRT) of the Delhi police was also parked outside the hospital gate before the vaccine reached the hospital. Police officers posted at the spot said the QRT and other officers would be present at the hospital premises round-the-clock. As the quantity of vaccines increase, more police personnel will be posted, a police officer at the spot said.Hospital director, professor Dr BL Sherwal said they are treating the vaccine like “gold”.“We are treating the vaccine like gold. For its safety and security, we also informed Delhi police. The security here is round-the-clock. Our officers check temperature at the storage twice a day and note the findings. This is done to ensure that the temperature remains between 2-8 degree Celsius and that there is no fluctuation. There are CCTV cameras at every point. The building is also cut off from the other facilities inside the hospital to keep off outsiders,” Sherwal said.Dr Chhavi Gupta, spokesperson of the hospital, said the freezers have an alarm system. “If the temperature falls or rises beyond a specific temperature, the alarm will go off. The vaccine will be transferred to another freezer within no time. It is monitored round-the-clock,” she said.The first batch of transfer from the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital to over 80 storage points identified by the government is likely to start on Thursday. Officials said they are waiting for more vaccine doses to come.Dr Sherwal added, “The storage unit has been specially chosen for its location. When vehicles come to deliver or take the vaccine, it can come or leave without getting caught in traffic on the road or having to manoeuvre to other parts of the hospital . Every part of the storage facility is visible and well-lit for security purposes. It is in safe hands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/local-clap-and-cheer-the-arrival-of-vaccine-at-rajiv-gandhi-super-speciality-hospital-101610475497772.html
13-01-2021||Delhi||Hopes up as maiden flight carrying Covishield reaches Delhi||The very first flight carrying 672,000 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses, reached the national capital on Tuesday morning. The SpiceJet flight SG8937 departed the Pune airport at 8.05 am landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport around 10.15am.The consignment of 56 boxes of vaccine Covishield, having 12,000 doses in each, was later transported to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Delhi’s Tahirpur and also to Karnal in Haryana, ahead of the nationwide inoculation drive, starting January 16.During the course of Tuesday, eight other flights carried a total of 565,000 lakh vaccine doses out of Pune to 12 other cities, including Chandigarh, Patna, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Lucknow.At the Delhi airport, a team comprising officials of the Airports Authority of India, ministry of civil aviation, health ministry, Delhi airport operator and Central Industrial Security Force received the vaccines and shifted them to the cargo terminal, where they are being stored in temperature controlled units.Officials aware of the developments said around noon, the process to load the vaccines into two temperature controlled container trucks started. “At 1.15pm one of the trucks, carrying 34 boxes, left for Karnal. An hour later, the second truck left the airport with 22 boxes of vaccine for the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Tahirpur. Each of these boxes contained 12,000 doses,” said a senior official from the Delhi airport, requesting anonymity.The Central Industrial Security Force, that secures the Delhi airport, ensured that the vaccines were duly packed and checked the certification forms of the consignment before both the trucks were dispatched to their respective destinations.Deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajiv Ranjan, said they had ensured adequate deployment outside the cargo terminals to ensure law and order. “The trucks were escorted by Delhi Police vehicles for a smooth passage as traffic police kept the route clear. The truck headed to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital through a dedicated corridor,” Ranjan said.Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director, SpiceJet, said the airline on Tuesday carried the country’s first consignment of Covid-19 vaccine from Pune to Delhi. “This was followed by multiple flights to different cities as SpiceJet transported close to four million Covishield vaccine doses weighing around 11 tonnes on the very first day of shipment,” Singh said.The airline also carried vaccine consignments to the cities of Guwahati, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Bengaluru, Patna and Vijayawada on Tuesday, Singh said.An official from the ministry of civil aviation, who wished not to be named, said the first two flights operated by SpiceJet and Indigo from Pune went to Delhi and Chennai on Tuesday morning. “Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir and Indigo operated nine flights from Pune carrying 56.5 lakh doses to Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Chandigarh, on Tuesday,” the official confirmed.In days to come, the Delhi airport is expected to receive many more flights carrying Covid-19 vaccines. CEO of the Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said the temperature-controlled facilities, the temperature ranging from -20 degrees centigrade to 25 degrees centigrade, at the two cargo terminals at Delhi airport can safely handle these vaccines. “We have cool chambers and cool dollies to maintain the temperature required for these vaccines at the terminal and during transit between aircraft and terminal or vice versa. Our both terminals can handle around 5.7 million vials a day,” Jaipuriar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hopes-up-as-maiden-flight-carrying-covishield-reaches-delhi-101610475437766.html
13-01-2021||Gurugram||How farmers at Haryana border have made the protest site their home||Hundreds of farmers from Haryana and Rajasthan arrived at Shahjahanpur on National Highway-8 on December 12 last year with the intent of proceeding towards Delhi. Stopped by the Rewari Police from entering Haryana, the farmers hunkered down and started a sit-in protest, which has evolved into a mass movement of sorts over the past month. With their tractors, trolleys and makeshift tarpaulin tents, the highway has become the new home, say the protesting farmers.Around 25- 30 farmer groups and organisations have been protesting at the Haryana border. Farmer groups from different states also visit the site to extend support. Groups of farmers from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa joined the ongoing agitation on Monday. Earlier, farmers from Jammu and Kashmir joined their ranks. Farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat too camped at the protest site for several weeks. While it is difficult to give an estimate of the total number of farmers at the site, farmer leaders said that presently, there are no less than 5,000 protesters and the number is increasing on a daily basis.Sohni Singh Punia, a 58-year-old farmer from Sikar in Rajasthan, is among the women protesting at the border since December. “We are used to working in our farms under harsh conditions — be it summer or winter. If the laws are not repealed, we will move towards Delhi, but won’t go home,” said Punia, who was sitting on a 24-hour hunger strike along with 10 others on Monday.She added that the livelihood of farmers like her was dependent on the removal of the new laws. “I have three sons and daughters, who are looking after the farms and the children back home. By next week, all but one will join the agitation here. Our lives depend on the removal of these laws,” said Punia, who sat in front of a row of police barricades on one carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway.What the farmers wantLike their counterparts agitating on the Delhi borders, farmers here have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them vulnerable to exploitation by corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops by reducing the scope of the state-run market yards, known as the agricultural produce marketing committees (APMCs) or the so-called mandis. While the government has assured farmers that both the MSP and AMPCs will continue, farmers have stuck to their demands and want the laws to be repealed.Baldev Singh Mann, a 62-year-old farmer from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, said that farmers were prepared for the long haul and won’t back down. “We will return only after convincing the government. The government should kill us directly if it wants. If these laws are implemented, we will die anyway,” said Mann. He said that farmers had sustained the protest for nearly a month and could do so for several more months or years, if required. “If the Modi government doesn’t relent, we will make our homes here,” said Mann.Managing essentialsAn informal network of sorts connects the protesting farmers with their families back home, which ensures that supplies are replenished from time to time. These supplies keep the multiple langars or community kitchens running at the site.Manjeet Singh, a young farmer, who reached the protest site with a truck of supplies from Patiala on Monday, has made six such trips during the past month. The current batch of supplies had been bought from contributions made by residents of three villages in Patiala, Singh said, while unloading packs of bottled water. “Everyone in the village contributes towards the supply. NRIs from our villages also crowdfund towards the supplies,” he said.Farmers from nearly all states protesting here have set up a mechanism for the supply of essentials. While trips from Punjab are weekly or fortnightly, farmers from Haryana and Rajasthan get supplies after a day or two. The nature of crowdsourcing also differs from village to village.“Back home in our village, containers have been placed at every crossing. Every house contributes 2-4 litres of milk and lassi depending on their capacity. Once the collections are combined, they are dispatched here. Every alternate day, we receive 500 litres of milk and lassi each,” said Mintu Ram, a farmer from Bhiwani in Haryana, who has been at the site since the past month. Other supplies such as vegetables, cooking oil and spices are sent after every 15 days.Ram said that the movement will not end until the government repeals the laws or makes multiple amendments that completely negate the damaging provisions of the laws. “Rich corporates will exploit us if these laws are implemented. If farmers start selling their produce to corporates, the poor farmers will have nowhere to go. They will sell our produce at four times the price whereas we will get a pittance,” he said.Countering government allegationsBrushing aside the claims of government representatives, Ram said that farmers from Haryana were united in the struggle against the three laws. In the past, Haryana government has claimed that farmers from Haryana were not participating in the movement in big numbers. The BJP-led government in the state has also raked up the issue of the construction of SYL (Sutlej-Yamuna Link) canal— a bone of contention between Punjab and Haryana. Ram and his fellow farmers from Haryana said that they could see through the intentions of the government.“The BJP government has been in power for the past six years. In all these years, they did nothing to resolve the SYL impasse. They are now trying to create differences between farmers but they will not succeed. What will we do with water if our land is not safe? We will talk to our brothers in Punjab ourselves,” he said. His friend, Raj Kumar, nodded in agreement.Kumar has been at the site since December 18 and shares a truck with Ram. “We will die but we won’t go home. When the time comes, even the SYL dispute will be resolved,” said Kumar, while smoking from a hookah. The duo has a quintal of tobacco at their disposal. “We have one quintal of tobacco with us. It can easily last us six months, if used judiciously. We can always ask our families to send more,” said Kumar.When asked about the concerns of the farmers, Jawahar Yadav, BJP spokesperson, said that the three laws were for the betterment of farmers and the party would continue to take steps in the interests of farmers. “The work that we are doing for the betterment of farmers will continue. The BJP will continue to make efforts to make farmers understand the various benefits of the three farm laws,” said Yadav, adding that the party is presently deliberating on the recent Supreme Court’s decision to put the implementation of the farm laws on hold.Daily choresBesides food supplies, farmers also send back their unwashed clothes on alternate days. While there’s a washing machine at the site, it’s not enough to meet the requirements for the hundreds camping at the site. “Along with the supplies, we return our unwashed clothes and get a set of washed clothes,” said Kumar.Other concerns pertaining to electricity and sanitation facilities are also being met. The Rajasthan government has set up mobile toilets at the site besides providing an electricity connection, farmers said. A team of volunteers maintains a vigil at night for security.“There is a team of volunteers who ensure that all of us stay safe at night. We don’t face many difficulties here,” said Sheetal Kanwar, a 17-year-old, who is protesting at the site with her family. A native of Bawadi tehsil in Jodhpur, Kanwar joined the protest on December 29.“Our friends back home call and ask us about the protest here. We have told them that we will sit here till the laws are rolled back,” Kanwar, adding that she didn’t miss home. “We have forged many relationships here. Even this place has begun to feel like home,” she said.The protesting farmers plan to proceed towards Delhi on Republic Day. They said that the Supreme Court’s decision of staying the laws will not have any impact on their plans and that the agitation will continue until the government repeals the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/how-farmers-at-haryana-border-have-made-the-protest-site-their-home-101610473098034.html
13-01-2021||World||Pelosi says Trump ‘must go, he is a clear and present danger’||The Democratic-led House of Representatives is set to impeach President Donald Trump for a historic second time in a vote later Wednesday, charging him with inciting an insurrection in which his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election defeat to President-elect Joe Biden.Some Republicans have announced they will vote to impeach Trump, and others, including the top Republican in the Senate Mitch McConnell, signalled their support for the move.Impeachment proceedings started on Wednesday after Vice-President Mike Pence rejected a call from the House to invoke the 25th Amendment of constitution to remove Trump.The House is expected to vote on the impeachment motion at around 3 pm US Eastern Standard Time (2 am Thursday in India). The motion is set to go through with the votes of all Democrats and between 10 to 20 Republicans, making Trump the only American president to be impeached twice, and within 19 months. His first impeachment was in December 2019.Democrats have brought just one article of impeachment against the president: “incitement of insurrection”, for the attack by his supporters on the US Capitol on January 6.“We know that we faced enemies to the Constitution, we know we experienced the insurrection that violated the sanctity of the people’s capital and attempted to overturn the duly recorded will of the American people, and we know that the President of the United States incited this insurrection, this armed rebellion against our common country,” said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker starting the debate to be followed by the vote.She added: “He must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.”The House judiciary committee had laid the impeachment case in a report on Tuesday. “President Trump committed a high crime and misdemeanor against the nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election,” it had said, adding, “The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.”Pence announced his decision on the 25th Amendment of the American constitution — which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to sideline the president finding him unable to govern — in a letter to Pelosi as the House was just about to take a vote on a resolution calling for him to do just that.“I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our constitution,” Pence wrote. “Under our constitution, the 25th Amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th Amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedence.” House Democrats went ahead with the vote anyway, and won by 223-205.Democrats have enough votes to pass the impeachment resolution on their own. But they will be joined by an increasing number of Republicans, outraged by President Trump’s actions before and during the riots; that he incited them to attack the Capitol and refused to call them off for hours.Liz Cheney, who is third in seniority in the House Republican caucus, John Katko, senior-most Republican in House committee on homeland security; Adam Kinzinger, Fred Upton and Jaimie Herrera Beutler have all said they will vote to impeach the president. Between 10 and 20 Republicans are expected to vote in support of impeachment.But the most devastating blow for Trump was losing the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. He had been one of Trump’s closest allies. He is said to be “pleased” now with the impeachment, seeing an opportunity there to purge him from the party, the New York Times reported. Trump could be convicted by the Senate without McConnell’s support.Trump struck defiant note in a series of remarks on Tuesday. He defended his January 6 speech, which triggered the supporters, as “totally appropriate” and sought to characterise the impeachment as a continuation of the “witch hunt” that led to his first impeachment, in December 2019. In Texas, he said he will survive the 25th Amendment, but warned “will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration”.Investigations into the Capitol attack, in the meantime, are growing “unprecedented” in scope. The FBI and the justice department said more than 160 cases are being investigated with more to follow. Charges being considered range from forcible entry to assaulting officials to sedition and conspiracy.And US military’s joints chiefs of staff issued a statement condemning the January 6 attack. “We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection,” it said.The military leaders also signalled support and acknowledgment of the incoming administration. “On January 20, 2021, in accordance with the Constitution, confirmed by the states and the courts, and certified by Congress, President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-says-trump-must-go-he-is-a-clear-and-present-danger-101610561604724.html
13-01-2021||World||US finalises wages for H-1B visa holders||The United States has announced the finalisation of a rule that will force American employers to offer foreign workers on H-1B and similar visa programmes the same, or higher, wages as their local counterparts.The change announced on Tuesday is intended to prevent employers from hiring low-cost foreign workers to replace Americans, which has been a key criticism of the foreign workers programme. India, which accounts for upwards of 70% of the annual 85,000 H-1B visas granted, is a major source of such foreign workers.Labour secretary Eugene Scalia said these measures will strengthen wage protections, address “abuses in visa programmes, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour”.“These changes help ensure that these important foreign worker programmes function as Congress intended, while securing American workers’ opportunities for stable, good-paying jobs”.The new rule will come into effect 60 days from publication in the Federal Register, the American gazette.Last week, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued another final rule to amend the lottery system to select H-1B applications by prioritising those for high-paying jobs.“The H-1B temporary visa programme has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs,” USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow said last Thursday. “The current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the programme to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominately resulted in the annual influx of foreign labour placed in low-wage positions at the expense of US workers.”The Trump administration has been modifying the H-1B visa programme to make it harder for the scheme to be used to replace Americans workers with cheaper foreign workers, under “Buy American, Hire American” policy championed by outgoing President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-finalises-wages-for-h-1b-visa-holders-101610560164948.html
13-01-2021||World||US issues final wage rules for H-1B, green card holders to prevent 'abuses'||The US department of labour (DOL) on Tuesday announced final wages rule in its last-minute attempt to push the so-called protectionist policy of the Trump administration. The department said that the US employers, seeking H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 visas for foreign workers, must attest that they will pay non-immigrant workers the higher of the prevailing wage or the actual wage paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications.The final wages rule also directs employers to recruit US workers for the position, on the prevailing wage issued by the department, when seeking to hire an immigrant under an EB-2 or EB-3 classification. US secretary of labour Eugene Scalia said in a statement that the department is taking these steps to strengthen “wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour.”The final rule was announced days after the department published an interim final rule and invited public comments. It will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. Scalia said that the department has adjusted the wages levels used in the interim final rule to “better reflect market wages and included provisions to smooth the transition to the new wage levels.”“The prevailing wage rates in these programs serve to protect US workers from unfair competition posed by the entry of lower-cost foreign labour into the US labour market,” the department stated.The H-1B visa allows American companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The US employers have been hiring tens of thousands of foreign worker every year from countries like India and China. Last week, USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow claimed that the H-1B visa program has been “exploited and abused by employers” primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-final-wage-rules-for-h-1b-green-card-holders-to-prevent-abuses-101610559373356.html
13-01-2021||World||‘Uphold apolitical standards’: US army's rare message amid threats of violence||The United States army has sent out a rare message to its community amid threats of violence in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration. In a letter addressed to soldiers, civilian employees and their family members, the US army called on them to uphold their values during this critical period. The army said that the violent riot at the Capitol was an attack on the Congress and the Constitutional democracy, reminding all soldiers and civilians to “uphold the army's apolitical standards.”“Democratic elections are a constitutional right, and the military has no role in determining their outcome. The Nation expects all member of the United States Army to follow the law and do the right things the right way, whether we are in or out of uniform,” the letter read.The message was sent out on Wednesday just before the House was scheduled to convene to vote on an article of impeachment, an attempt to oust President Donald Trump. The army stressed that American soldiers and civilians have committed themselves to safeguard democratic ideal while adhering to civilian authority by swearing an oath to support and defend the Constitution.“To maintain the sacred trust of the American people, it is important that all those who represent the Army, in any capacity, remain models of professionalism, character, and integrity,” the army further stated.Read: Trump impeachment 2.0: List of Republicans who will join Democrats in House voteThe letter was signed by Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, and Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston. The unusual reminder followed a rare memo by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which they said the deadly insurrection at the Capitol was anti-democratic and a criminal act, emphasising that the right to free speech gives no one the right to commit violence.Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly warned of armed protests being planned at all 50 state capitals and in Washington DC in the run-up to the inauguration. The federal agency has received information on a group calling for others to join them is storming state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in case Trump is removed as President before the inauguration day.“Armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitals from January 16 through at least January 20, and at the US Capitol from January 17 through January 20," according to the internal FBI bulletin obtained by several US media outlets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uphold-apolitical-standards-us-army-s-rare-message-amid-threats-of-violence-101610554725095.html
13-01-2021||World||US imposes new sanctions on Iranian foundations in last days of Trump's term||The United States on Wednesday blacklisted two Iranian foundations controlled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and their subsidies, saying the institutions enabled Iran's elite to sustain a 'corrupt' system of ownership over large parts of the economy.The designations announced by the US Treasury Department target Execution of Imam Khomeini's Order (EIKO) and Astan Quds Razavi (AQR), their leaders and subsidies. They are the latest action to reinforce the "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran pursued by President Donald Trump's administration.Republican Trump is due to hand over power to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden after losing the Nov. 3 election."EIKO has systematically violated the rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime, including political opponents, religious minorities, and exiled Iranians," the Treasury said in a statement.The sanctions freeze any US assets of those targeted and generally bar Americans from doing business with them. Anyone who engages in certain transactions with these individuals and entities runs the risk of being hit with US sanctions.US-Iranian tensions have risen since Trump two years ago abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and restored harsh economic sanctions designed to force Tehran into a wider negotiation on curbing its nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy forces.Biden, set to take office on Jan. 20, has said he will return the United States to the nuclear deal, if Iran resumes compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-iranian-foundations-in-last-days-of-trump-s-term-101610554752465.html
13-01-2021||World||Progress stalls in Afghan peace talks as sides await Joe Biden||Afghan peace talks that resumed four days ago are effectively on hold, sources from both sides said on Wednesday, as negotiators wait for President-elect Joe Biden to signal whether he will stick to Donald Trump's aggressive schedule to pull out troops.After a month-long break, some negotiators from both sides have yet to return to Doha, the Qatari capital that has served as venue for negotiations between the Afghan government and the insurgents to end decades of war. A diplomatic source in Kabul said expectations were low for progress before Biden takes office on Jan. 20.The sides "do not want to commit to anything before the 20th. They wanted to have the process going in the meantime because that was one of the requirements of the international community, so they have the process. But it is stagnant," he said.In an agreement reached last year, Trump, who had long promised to end America's longest war, signed the United States up to a full withdrawal in coming months. But that depends on the Taliban meeting security conditions which the Afghan government says have not been met. Biden and his advisors have so far given few clues as to their plans.'TOUGH DECISIONS'"We are waiting for the new U.S. administration and their policies towards Afghanistan to see whether they would respect the peace accord,” a Taliban negotiator told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly."If they don't honour their commitment of withdrawing their forces as promised...then we would need to make tough decisions by appointing hardliners to key positions on the ground."After months of little progress, the sides finally agreed ground rules for talks late last year. The talks then broke up in December, in part to allow negotiators to return home for consultations with their leadership.The sides announced last week they would re-start talks on Saturday. But so far only limited meetings between smaller teams called 'contact groups' have taken place, three diplomatic and Afghan government sources told Reuters.Around four top members of the Taliban negotiating team were not yet in Qatar, the group's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. He said this was due to logistical issues travelling from remote areas where they were visiting family. They would arrive in the next few days and the delay would not affect the talks, he said.Some Afghan government negotiators were also not yet in Doha. One, who has been receiving treatment for cancer, told Reuters she planned to travel there this week.Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute think tank, said one reason for the delay on the Taliban side could be that negotiators needed more time to confer with the group's leaders."It's not yet fully clear why they are delayed, but with the growing speculation this can't go on too much longer without some sort of explanation," she said. The delayed return "reflects the existing lack of momentum".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progress-stalls-in-afghan-peace-talks-as-sides-await-joe-biden-101610554233143.html

13-01-2021||World||Emotions run high as US House begins debate on impeaching Donald Trump||A week after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol, the House of Representatives began debate on Wednesday as lawmakers considered impeaching him for his role in an assault on American democracy that stunned the nation and left five dead.At least five Republicans have said they would join Democrats in voting for an article of impeachment - a formal charge - of inciting an insurrection just seven days before he is due to leave office and President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. If the House approves it, Trump would become the first president impeached twice.House impeachment of Trump would not immediately remove him from office but would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. It remained unclear whether such a trial would take place in time to expel Trump from office. As lawmakers debated the matter, National Guard troops and police were stationed around the Capitol to provide security.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat, said Democrats intended to send the impeachment charge, once approved, to the Senate "as soon as possible," and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named nine impeachment managers who would present the House's case during a Senate trial.The extraordinary swiftness with which Democrats were moving reflects the ongoing danger that Trump poses to national security, according to top Democrats. It also increases pressure on Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, to consider holding an immediate trial.McConnell has said no trial could begin until the chamber returns from its recess on Jan. 19. But Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is set to become the majority leader after two newly elected Democratic senators from Georgia are seated and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is sworn in later this month, told reporters the Senate could be recalled to handle the matter if McConnell agrees.'CRIME SCENE'Washington is on high alert after the Jan. 6 riot, with a week to go in Trump's term. Thousands of National Guard troops were to be on hand and some service members wearing fatigues, with weapons at hand, could be seen sleeping inside the Capitol building on Wednesday ahead of the session.The House convened just after 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) in the same chamber where lawmakers hid under chairs last Wednesday as rioters clashed with police in the halls of the Capitol."We are debating this historic measure at an actual crime scene," Democratic Representative Jim McGovern said as the session opened. "This was a well-organized attack on our country that was incited by Donald Trump."House Republicans who opposed the impeachment drive argued Democrats were going too far, as Trump was on the verge of leaving office, and argued for the creation of a commission to study the events surrounding the siege."Instead of moving forward as a unifying force, the majority in the House is choosing to divide us further," Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole said on the floor. Cole was one of 139 House Republicans who voted against certifying the Nov. 3 presidential election results on Wednesday, hours after the violence, after Trump made false claims of widespread voting fraud.Republican Representative Jason Smith accused Democrats of acting recklessly and urged the House not to impeach Trump in order to help "heal the nation."Democrats moved forward on an impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence rejected an effort to persuade him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution to remove Trump.As the House prepared for the impeachment vote, there were signs Trump's hold on the Republican Party was beginning to ebb. At least five House Republicans, including Liz Cheney, a member of her party's leadership team, said they would vote for his second impeachment - a prospect no president before Trump has faced."There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said in a statement.Trump "summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack" on the Capitol, she said.Republicans Jaime Herrera Beutler, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton also said they supported impeachment.In a break from standard procedure, Republican leaders in the House have refrained from urging their members to vote against impeaching Trump, saying it was a matter of individual conscience.The New York Times reported that McConnell was said to be pleased about the impeachment push, another sign Trump's party is looking to move on from him after the attack on Congress.The House previously voted to impeach Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter ahead of the election, as Democrats accused him of soliciting foreign interference to smear a domestic political rival. The Republican-led Senate in February 2020 voted to keep Trump in office.The article of impeachment accused Trump of "incitement of insurrection," saying he provoked violence against the U.S. government in a speech to thousands of supporters near the White House shortly before the Capitol siege. The article also cited Trump's Jan. 2 phone call asking a Georgia official to "find" votes to overturn Biden's victory in the state.'TOTALLY APPROPRIATE'In his first public appearance since last Wednesday's riot, Trump showed no contrition on Tuesday for his speech shortly before the siege."What I said was totally appropriate," Trump told reporters.At a meeting to set the rules for Wednesday's impeachment vote, Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who helped craft the impeachment measure, said it had the support of 217 lawmakers - enough to impeach Trump.A two-thirds majority of the Senate is needed to convict Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to vote for conviction.Democrats could also use an impeachment trial to push through a vote blocking Trump from running for office again.Only a simple Senate majority is needed to disqualify Trump from future office, but there is disagreement among legal experts as to whether an impeachment conviction is needed before a disqualification vote.A different part of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, also provides a procedure for disqualifying Trump from future office with a simple majority of both chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emotions-run-high-as-us-house-begins-debate-on-impeaching-donald-trump-101610551530820.html
13-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to appoint 'Indo-Pacific coordinator' to address concerns from China||US president-elect Joe Biden is set to create a new position within the National Security Council (NSC) and appoint veteran foreign policy expert Kurt Campbell to focus on challenges emerging from China in the Indo-Pacific, according to media reports on Wednesday.Campbell, a former top Pentagon official who also served as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in the Obama administration and helped frame the “pivot to Asia”, is expected to join as the “Indo-Pacific coordinator”.The job will give him “broad management over the NSC directorates that cover various parts of Asia and China-related issues", The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed Biden transition officials.Campbell will report to incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and the NSC will have several “coordinators”, who will have more authority than the “senior directors” below them, The Post said.Biden was considering creating the new position inside the White House “because of the rising importance attached to tackling a range of challenges from China”, the Financial Times reported.A person familiar with the decision told the Financial Times that it was “partly taken because of the need to better integrate China policy across different government agencies with a veteran Asia expert at the helm”. The person added Biden “recognised that China was an issue that every government agency — not just the traditional foreign policy, defence and economic-related departments — would have to grapple with more than in the past”.Campbell is considered to be close to both incoming secretary of state Antony Blinken and incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan. He is also seen as one of the more hawkish Democrats on China.Earlier this month, Campbell and Rush Doshi, expected to be named China director in the NSC, wrote an article for Foreign Affairs magazine that said the US will have to build a coalition of allies and partners to address challenges from China in the Indo-Pacific.“A strategy for the Indo-Pacific today would benefit from...the need for a balance of power; the need for an order that the region’s states recognize as legitimate; and the need for an allied and partner coalition to address China’s challenge to both. Such an approach can ensure that the Indo-Pacific’s future is characterized by balance and twenty-first-century openness rather than hegemony and nineteenth-century spheres of influence,” the article said.In another article for Foreign Affairs in 2018, Campbell argued the US strategy of engaging China in the hope that it would liberalise and reform hadn’t worked.“Neither carrots nor sticks have swayed China as predicted. Diplomatic and commercial engagements have not brought political and economic openness. Neither US military power nor regional balancing has stopped Beijing from seeking to displace core components of the US-led system. And the liberal international order has failed to lure or bind China as powerfully as expected. China has instead pursued its own course, belying a range of American expectations in the process,” that article said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-appoint-indo-pacific-coordinator-to-address-concerns-from-china-101610550486678.html
13-01-2021||World||UK's PM Johnson pledges Covid-19 vaccine program to operate 24-7||Britain's coronavirus vaccine program will operate around the clock seven days a week “as soon as we can,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged Wednesday as the UK accelerates efforts to inoculate millions of its most vulnerable people against coronavirus.Johnson said “at the moment, the limit is on supply” of the vaccines rather than on the ability of the country's health service to deliver jabs quickly. The push to inoculate millions quickly comes as a more contagious variant of Covid-19 is sweeping across Britain and driving hospitals to their breaking points.The UK is already under an indefinite national lockdown to curb the spread of the new variant, with nonessential shops, gyms and hairdressers closed, most people working from home and schools largely offering remote learning. But some are calling for even tougher measures.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tightened restrictions Wednesday, barring the consumption of alcohol outdoors and barring the public from going inside a business to collect takeaways.The UK government has set a goal of delivering the first vaccine dose to everyone over 70, as well as frontline health care workers, nursing home residents and anyone whose health makes them especially vulnerable to the virus, by the middle of February. That’s more than 15 million people.Vaccinations will be given at hundreds of doctors’ offices and community pharmacies, 50 mass vaccination sites at convention centers and sports stadiums, as well as at 223 hospitals.Britain is already using Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca and has approved one made by Moderna, but that one is not expected to be delivered until spring.But the pace of vaccinations remains a constant source of discussion.Johnson’s comments came as his vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, testified before a parliamentary committee that the government now had “line of sight” of deliveries to the end of February but sidestepped questions about week-by-week vaccine deliveries.“In any manufacturing process, especially one where you’re dealing with a biological compound, a novel vaccine, is lumpy at the outset,” he told the Commons Science and Technology Committee. “There’s no doubt that it was, but getting better. ... We have millions of doses coming through in the weeks and then next month and the month after.”The challenge, Zahawi said, was not just getting vaccine shots into people's arms, but the difficulty of reaching vulnerable people. Greater daily volumes of inoculations could be achieved if specific groups weren't targeted, he said.In a reflection of the frantic demand, Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, asked the committee to help gain permission for people working in the vaccine process to get priority for the Covid-19 shots.“One of the things that I’m worried about is actually maintaining a continuous supply and work on this vaccine,” he said as he appealed for workers to be immunized. “If you have an outbreak at one of the centers — which we’ve had actually — or in one of the groups in Oxford working on new variants, or the people that are working on the regulatory files, everything stops.''On the timing front, the government is desperately trying to protect people with vaccines before hospitals are overwhelmed with cases of the new, more infections virus variant. Britain already has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 83,000 deaths.England’s health care system may move patients into hotels to ease the pressure on hospitals struggling to handle rising Covid-19 admissions.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Wednesday that the National Health Service was looking at ways to reduce the strain on hospitals, including moving patients to hotels when appropriate.“We would only ever do that if it was clinically the right thing for somebody,” Hancock told Sky News. “In some cases, people need sit-down care, they don’t actually need to be in a hospital bed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-pm-johnson-pledges-covid-19-vaccine-program-to-operate-247-101610550349658.html
13-01-2021||World||Two friends in the contest, India has a tough call to make for UNHRC presidency||India and China are expected to play key roles in choosing the next president of the UN Human Rights Council, with New Delhi faced with the tough challenge of choosing between rival candidates from two countries with which it has close ties.The current president, Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, completed her year-long term on December 31 and the post was set to go to Nazhat Shameem Khan, Fiji’s top diplomat in Geneva and a noted human rights activist.However, China and Russia opposed her candidature at the last minute and backed a Bahraini candidate, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Human Rights Council is currently working without a chief for the first time in its 15-year history.With a key meeting of the council to be chaired by the president scheduled for January 18, hectic efforts are underway to find a solution to the impasse. Both India and China are seen as key players in the Asia-Pacific group, which is slated to hold the presidency of the UN’s human rights body this year.India has close ties with both Fiji, where more than a third of the population is of Indian-origin, and Bahrain, a key energy partner and home to some 350,000 Indian expatriates. This factor, the people cited above, has complicated the process of choosing a candidate for New Delhi.There are concerns in some quarters as Bahrain’s candidate is being backed by China and also apprehensions that some members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) could use a possible Bahraini presidency to raise issues that are of concern to India, the people said.On December 16, the 47-member Human Rights Council elected Keva Lorraine Bain of the Bahamas, Ali Ibn Abi Talib Abdelrahman Mahmoud of Sudan and Monique TG van Daalen of the Netherlands to three of four posts of vice presidents for a one-year term beginning on January 1. They represent the Latin American and Caribbean states, African states and Western European and other states respectively in the five-member bureau or the council’s top decision-making body.However, the council was unable to choose a president because of opposition to the Fijian candidate, primarily from China, which was concerned about Khan’s past reputation as a human rights advocate, the people said.Some reports have suggested China is also keen on having a friendly candidate in the council’s top post at a time when the US is expected to rejoin the body under president-elect Joe Biden. President Donald Trump had pulled the US out of the council in 2018.The Asia-Pacific group had sought additional time in December for consultations on filling the position of president and a vote may be needed to break the impasse. In such circumstances, both India and China are expected to play key roles, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-may-play-key-roles-in-ending-impasse-over-election-of-unhrc-chief-101610548965935.html

"So, the city of New York will no longer have anything to do with the Trump Organization."Trump addressed thousands of supporters on Jan. 6, reiterating his unsupported claim that his re-election was stolen. He urged them to march to the Capitol where Congress was affirming Joe Biden's election by the Electoral College.The crowd quickly overwhelmed Capitol security, with many of them entering the building and forcing a halt to the proceedings as lawmakers took cover in a secure location. Five people died as a result of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-to-cut-contracts-with-trump-organization-says-mayor-101610548342408.html
13-01-2021||World||Donald Trump on verge of second impeachment after Capitol siege||President Donald Trump is on the verge of being impeached for a second time in an unprecedented House vote Wednesday, a week after he encouraged a mob of loyalists to “fight like hell” against election results just before they stormed the US Capitol in a deadly siege.The House chaplain opened the session with a prayer for “seizing the scales of justice from the jaws of mob-ocracy.”While Trump's first impeachment in 2019 brought no Republican votes in the House, a small but significant number of leaders and lawmakers are breaking with the party to join Democrats, saying Trump violated his oath to protect and defend US democracy.The stunning collapse of Trump's final days in office, against alarming warnings of more violence ahead by his followers, leaves the nation at an uneasy and unfamiliar juncture before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.Trump, who would become the only US president twice impeached, faces a single charge of “incitement of insurrection.”The four-page impeachment resolution relies on Trump’s own incendiary rhetoric and the falsehoods he spread about Biden’s election victory, including at a White House rally on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, in building its case for high crimes and misdemeanors as demanded in the Constitution.“If inviting a mob to insurrection against your own government is not an impeachable event, then what is?” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a drafter of the article of impeachment.Trump took no responsibility for the riot, suggesting it was the drive to oust him rather than his actions around the bloody riot that was dividing the country.“To continue on this path, I think it’s causing tremendous danger to our country, and it’s causing tremendous anger,” Trump said Tuesday, his first remarks to reporters since last week’s violence.A Capitol police officer died from injuries suffered in the riot, and police shot and killed a woman during the siege. Three other people died in what authorities said were medical emergencies. Lawmakers had to scramble for safety and hide as rioters took control of the Capitol and delayed by hours the last step in finalizing Biden's victory.The outgoing president offered no condolences for those dead or injured, only saying, “I want no violence.”At least five Republican lawmakers, including third-ranking House GOP leader Liz Cheney of Wyoming, were unswayed by the president's logic. The Republicans announced they would vote to impeach Trump, cleaving the Republican leadership, and the party itself.“The President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack,” said Cheney in a statement. “There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.”Unlike a year ago, Trump faces impeachment as a weakened leader, having lost his own reelection as well as the Senate Republican majority.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is said to be angry at Trump, and it's unclear how a Senate impeachment trial would play out. The New York Times reported that McConnell thinks Trump committed an impeachable offense and is glad Democrats are moving against him. Citing unidentified people familiar with McConnell's thinking, the Times reported McConnell believes moving against Trump will help the GOP forge a future independent of the divisive, chaotic president.In the House, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California, a top Trump ally, scrambled to suggest a lighter censure instead, but that option crumbled.So far, Republican Reps. John Katko of New York, a former federal prosecutor; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, an Air Force veteran; Fred Upton of Michigan; and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state announced they, too, would join Cheney to vote to impeach.The House tried first to push Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to intervene, passing a resolution Tuesday night calling on them to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to remove Trump from office. The resolution urged Pence to “declare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: That the President is unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office.”Pence made it clear he would not do so, saying in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that it was “time to unite our country as we prepare to inaugurate President-elect Joe Biden."Debate over the resolution was intense after lawmakers returned the Capitol for the first time since the siege.Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, argued that Trump must go because, as she said in Spanish, he’s “loco” — crazy.In opposition, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said the “cancel culture” was just trying to cancel the president with his ouster.While House Republican leaders are allowing rank and file lawmakers to vote their conscience on impeachment, it's far from clear there would then be the two-thirds vote in the evenly divided Senate needed to convict and remove Trump. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania joined Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska over the weekend in calling for Trump to “go away as soon as possible.”With just over a week remaining in Trump's term, the FBI warned ominously of potential armed protests by Trump loyalists ahead of Biden’s inauguration. Capitol Police urged lawmakers to be on alert.New security in place, lawmakers were required to pass through metal detectors to enter the House chamber, not far from where Capitol police, guns drawn, had barricaded the door against the rioters. Some Republican lawmakers complained about the screening.Biden has said it's important to ensure that the "folks who engaged in sedition and threatening the lives, defacing public property, caused great damage — that they be held accountable.”Fending off concerns that an impeachment trial would bog down his first days in office, the president-elect is encouraging senators to divide their time between taking taking up his priorities of confirming his nominees and approving Covid-19 relief while also conducting the trial.The impeachment bill draws from Trump's own false statements about his election defeat to Biden. Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, have repeatedly dismissed cases challenging the election results, and former Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, has said there was no sign of widespread fraud.Like the resolution to invoke the 25th Amendment, the impeachment bill also details Trump's pressure on state officials in Georgia to “find” him more votes and his White House rally rant to “fight like hell” by heading to the Capitol.While some have questioned impeaching the president so close to the end of his term, there is precedent. In 1876, during the Ulysses Grant administration, War Secretary William Belknap was impeached by the House the day he resigned, and the Senate convened a trial months later. He was acquitted.Trump was impeached in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine but acquitted by the Senate in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-on-verge-of-second-impeachment-after-capitol-siege-101610548311714.html
13-01-2021||World||US House convenes to impeach Donald Trump for his role in Capitol assault||A week after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol, the US House of Representatives gathered on Wednesday to impeach the president for his role in an assault on American democracy that stunned the nation and left five dead.At least five Republicans have said they would join Democrats to impeach Trump for the second time, just seven days before he is due to leave office and President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20.A vote of the House majority to impeach would trigger a trial in the still Republican-controlled Senate, although it was unclear whether such a trial would take place in time to expel Trump from the White House.Washington is on high alert after the riot and with a week to go in Trump's term. Thousands of National Guard troops were planned to be on hand and some members in fatigues, with weapons at hand, could be seen sleeping inside the Capitol building on Wednesday ahead of the session.The House convened just after 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) in the same chamber where lawmakers hid under chairs last Wednesday as angry rioters clashed with police in the halls of the Capitol.Democrats moved forward on an impeachment vote after Vice President Mike Pence rejected an effort to persuade him to invoke the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove Trump."I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution," Pence said in a letter Tuesday evening to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Despite the letter, the House passed a resolution late Tuesday formally calling on Pence to act. The final vote was 223-205 in favor.As the House prepared for the impeachment vote, there were signs Trump's once-dominant hold on the Republican Party was beginning to ebb.At least five House Republicans, including Liz Cheney, a member of her party's leadership team, said they would vote for his second impeachment - a prospect no president before Trump has faced."There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution," Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, said in a statement.Trump "summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack" on the Capitol, she said.Republicans Jaime Herrera Beutler, John Katko, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton also said they supported impeachment.In a break from standard procedure, Republican leaders in the House have refrained from urging their members to vote against impeaching Trump, saying it was a matter of individual conscience.The New York Times reported that the Republican majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Mitch McConnell, was said to be pleased about the impeachment push, another sign Trump's party is looking to move on from him after the attack on Congress.'TOTALLY APPROPRIATE'In his first public appearance since last Wednesday's riot, Trump showed no contrition on Tuesday for his speech last week in which he called on his supporters to protest Biden's victory by marching on the Capitol."What I said was totally appropriate," Trump told reporters.At a meeting to set the rules for Wednesday's impeachment vote, Democratic Representative David Cicilline, who helped craft the impeachment measure, said the impeachment drive had the support of 217 lawmakers - enough to impeach Trump.House Republicans who opposed the impeachment drive argued Democrats were going too far, as Trump was on the verge of leaving office."This is scary where this goes, because this is about more than about impeaching the president of the United States. This is about cancelling the president and cancelling all the people you guys disagree with," said Republican Representative Jim Jordan, one of Trump's staunchest defenders when the president was impeached in 2019 after encouraging the government of Ukraine to dig up political dirt on Biden.Pelosi on Tuesday named nine impeachment managers who would present the House's case during a Senate trial. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat, said Democrats intended to send impeachment charges, once approved, to the Senate "as soon as possible."It remained unclear how swiftly such a trial would take place. McConnell has said no trial could begin until the chamber returns from its recess on Jan. 19.But Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is set to become the majority leader after two Democrats from Georgia are seated and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is sworn in later this month, told reporters the Senate could be recalled to handle the matter.A two-thirds majority of the Senate is needed to convict Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to vote for conviction.Democrats could also use an impeachment trial to push through a vote blocking Trump from running for office again.Only a simple Senate majority is needed to disqualify Trump from future office, but there is disagreement among legal experts as to whether an impeachment conviction is needed before a disqualification vote.A different part of the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, also provides a procedure for disqualifying Trump from future office with a simple majority of both chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-convenes-to-impeach-donald-trump-for-his-role-in-capitol-assault-101610548541105.html
13-01-2021||World||FBI says it warned about prospect of violence ahead of Capitol riot||The FBI warned law enforcement agencies ahead of last week's breach of the US Capitol about the potential for extremist-driven violence, US officials said on Tuesday, contradicting earlier statements that they were caught off guard by the assault by supporters of President Donald Trump.Nearly a week after the riot, officials said they were combing through mountains of evidence and vowed to aggressively seek out those who perpetrated the brazen attack on the US Capitol. Though most of the charges brought so far have been misdemeanors, acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin said the Justice Department was considering bringing sedition charges against some of the rioters, effectively accusing them of attempting to overthrow or defeat the government.“This is only the beginning,” Sherwin said. “We’re going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent because, regardless of it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found.”The Justice Department has created a specialized strike force to examine the possibility of sedition charges, which could carry up to 20 years in prison. Officials said they were utilizing some of the same techniques in the riot probe as they use in international counterterrorism investigations, examining the money flow and movement of defendants leading up to the breach. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for the rioters to be added to a no-fly list, a tool most commonly associated with terrorisms investigations.The statements by FBI and Justice Department officials on Tuesday were intended as both a defense of federal law enforcement preparations before the deadly riot and as a warning to participants. But they also raised new questions about the coordination across agencies for the Jan. 6 riot, which was sparked by Trump's calls for his supporters to fight Congress' vote confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.In the immediate aftermath of the riot, some law enforcement officials, including the Capitol police chief, said they were unaware of serious concerns leading up to Jan. 6 and had prepared only for a free-speech protest.But on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported on the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI’s field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could commit “war” in Washington the following day. Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the joint terrorism task force.D'Antuono was among the officials who suggested law enforcement had simply been caught off guard, saying on Friday: “There was no indication that there was anything other than First Amendment protected activity.”He did not explain the discrepancy in his statements, though he suggested Tuesday that the Norfolk warning was based on nonspecific information in terms of individual leads to investigate, characterizing it as a “thread on a message board" that was not attributable to any specific person.In a statement Tuesday night, the FBI said the report's author had warned that the “FBI might be encroaching on free speech rights" in pursuing further action, and that the document itself did not necessarily associate the comments with a national security threat or crime. It highlighted D'Antuono's remarks at the news conference suggesting that without knowing the identity of the people whose words were cited in the report, there was not much that could be done with the information.US Capitol Police and other official didn't immediately respond to questions about their own initial assessments of the threat.A US defense official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was not notified about the FBI warning.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that it is unclear whether any defense or military officials heard about the notification from the FBI, but that statements in recent days from all the leaders indicate they weren’t aware that violence of that level was expected at the Capitol.Defense and National Guard officials, including McCarthy, have said in interviews over the past several days they were told by DC. that they believed the protests would be similar to the ones on Nov. 14 and Dec. 12. And they said that federal law enforcement authorities said that there was activity on Twitter, but that they weren’t expecting the level of violence they ultimately saw last Wednesday.Even without intelligence from law enforcement, there had been ample warning about pro-Trump demonstrations in Washington. But Capitol Police did not bolster staffing and made no preparations for the possibility that the planned protests could escalate into massive, violent riots, according to several people briefed on the law enforcement response. Officials turned down help offered by the Pentagon three days before the riot.When backup was finally requested, it took more than two hours for troops to mobilize near the Capitol. By then the mob had raged inside for more than four hours.Once the mob began to move on the Capitol, a police lieutenant issued an order not to use deadly force, which explains why officers outside the building did not draw their weapons as the crowd closed in. Officers are sometimes ordered to keep their weapons holstered to avoid escalating a situation if superiors believe doing so could lead to a stampede or a shootout.In this instance, it also left officers with little ability to resist the mob. In one video from the scene, an officer puts up his fists to try to push back a crowd pinning him and his colleagues against a door. The crowd jeers, “You are not American!” and one man tries to prod him with the tip of an American flag.The rampage through the halls of Congress sent lawmakers of both parties and Trump’s own vice president into hiding, as crowds called for Mike Pence’s lynching for his role overseeing the vote count. The scene also undermined the hallmark of the republic — the peaceful transition of power. At least five people died, including one Capitol Police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-says-it-warned-about-prospect-of-violence-ahead-of-capitol-riot-101610545979693.html
13-01-2021||World||Explainer: Who's been charged in the deadly Capitol siege?||Prosecutors have brought dozens of cases after the deadly attack at the US Capitol, and they promise more charges are to come as investigators work to identify members of the pro-Trump mob.Investigators are combing through thousands of tips, photos, videos and social media accounts to collect evidence against the attackers who overran the Capitol to stop the certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the next president.Officials predict hundreds of criminal cases will ultimately be filed and said they are considering sedition charges against some of the rioters.Some questions and answers about the investigation into the Capitol breach:How many people have been charged?The top federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia said Tuesday that 70 people have been charged so far. About 20 federal cases have been made public, and 40 others have been filed in D.C. Superior Court.The people charged in Superior Court are mainly accused of things like curfew violations and gun crimes. Those being tried in federal court, where prosecutors can generally secure longer sentences, are charged with offenses such as violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, assaulting a federal law enforcement officer and threatening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.On Tuesday, federal agents arrested the son of a New York City judge, who was seen inside the Capitol wearing a fur costume and a police vest authorities say he stole during the mayhem. Aaron Mostofsky faces charges including theft of government property.Federal authorities on Sunday arrested two men who were photographed with plastic restraints inside the Capitol. Investigators said they used social media and livestream videos to identify Eric Munchel of Tennessee as the masked person seen in photos carrying plastic hand restraints in the Senate chamber.Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was photographed on the Senate floor carrying zip-tie handcuffs and wearing a military-style helmet and vest, authorities said. He confirmed to The New Yorker that he was the man in the photographs and claimed he found the handcuffs on the floor. “I wish I had not picked those up,” he said.Why haven't more people been charged?The recent arrests are “just the tip of the iceberg,” said Steven D’Antuono, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.Authorities have opened about 170 investigations into people who potentially committed a crime, said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. The number of charges will likely grow to into the hundreds, he said.The vast amount of evidence and the number of people involved mean it will take months for investigators to sort through everything, Sherwin said. Federal agents are scouring more than 100,000 pieces of digital media they have received from the public, D’Antuono said.Sherwin vowed that authorities are in it for the “long haul.”"Even if you’ve left D.C., agents from our local field offices will be knocking on your door if we find out you were part of the criminal activity at the Capitol," D’Antuono said.U.S. attorneys across the country have also said people could face charges in their home states if they traveled to Washington and took part in the assault.Could there be more serious charges?Prosecutors are looking at “significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy," Sherwin said. He has organized a group of national security and public corruption prosecutors whose sole focus is to bring that type of charge for the “most heinous acts that occurred in the Capitol."After protests across the US over police brutality in the summer, then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen t old prosecutors in September that they should consider using the sedition charge against violent demonstrators. Rosen, who took over the top Justice Department job when Attorney General William Barr stepped down last month, said the charge does not require proof of a plot to overthrow the US government and gave the hypothetical example of a group that “has conspired to take a federal courthouse or other federal property by force.”The FBI has also opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol police officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly.Could Trump be charged?Trump urged the crowd to march on the Capitol, even promising to go with them, though he didn’t. The president told his supporters to “fight” to stop the “steal” of the election, while his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for “trial by combat.”The legal bar for charging the president or any other speakers at the rally with inciting violence is high. Experts say it might be tough to prove in a normal prosecution that the president intended for violence to happen on Capitol Hill.However, Trump faces a charge of “incitement of insurrection” in an impeachment resolution to be debated by the House on Wednesday as part of an extraordinary effort to remove Trump in the final days of his presidency.Could any officers face charges?At least two Capitol police officers have been suspended — one who took a selfie with the attackers and another who put on a Make America Great Again hat. At least a dozen more are under internal investigation for their behavior during the uprising, according to lawmakers.The Capitol officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, a Trump supporter who was trying to climb through a broken window into the speaker’s lobby, has been placed on administrative leave per agency policy, and the shooting is under investigation by Capitol police and the Metropolitan Police Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-who-s-been-charged-in-the-deadly-capitol-siege-101610546018672.html
13-01-2021||World||In a rare memo, top US military leaders remind troops of limits of free speech||Amid worry about renewed violence on Inauguration Day, the military's top leaders issued a written reminder to all service members Tuesday that the deadly insurrection at the Capitol last week was an anti-democratic, criminal act, and that the right to free speech gives no one the right to commit violence.A memo signed by all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also reminded military members that Joe Biden was duly elected as the next president and will be sworn in to office on Jan. 20.The memo was unusual in that the military leadership, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, felt compelled to remind service members that it is wrong to disrupt the constitutional process. The language went further than statements by the civilian leader of the Pentagon, Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, by describing the assault as an act of sedition and an insurrection. Miller has called it “reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the United States Constitution.”It comes as law enforcement agencies attempt to determine the full extent of criminal activity at the Capitol and to discover the extent of participation by current or past military members.It has already been established that some military veterans participated in the riots at the Capitol, but the extent of any active-duty involvement has not been established. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran, on Monday wrote to the Defense Department requesting that its criminal investigative organizations cooperate with the FBI and the US Capitol Police in investigating whether current and retired members of the armed forces were part of a “seditious conspiracy” against the government.The Joint Chiefs memo did not allude directly to the question of military involvement.“We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law,” the memo said. "The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.“As service members, we must embody the values and ideals of the nation. We support and defend the Constitution. Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values and oath; it is against the law.”Gen. Robert Abrams, who as commander of US forces in South Korea is one of the Army's most senior generals but is not a member of the Joint Chiefs, wrote on Twitter that no military member should misunderstand what happened Jan. 6.“There is no ambiguity of what occurred at the Capitol — that was an attempted insurrection,” he wrote. “If you are serving in uniform and think it was something else, I would encourage (you) to sit down and read the constitution that you swore an oath to support and defend. No gray area there either. No room on our team if you are not willing to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign AND domestic.”Ahead of next week's inauguration and President Donald Trump's departure from office, the National Guard is gearing up to provide support to law enforcement agencies. There is no plan to use active-duty forces in security operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-rare-memo-top-us-military-leaders-remind-troops-of-limits-of-free-speech-101610545973683.html
13-01-2021||World||Social media manipulation a growing threat to democracies: Oxford study||Social media manipulation of public opinion is a growing threat to democracies around the world, according to the 2020 media manipulation survey from a University of Oxford institute, which found evidence in each of the 81 countries surveyed, including India.The number of countries with evidence of organised social media manipulation campaigns was up 15% in one year, from 70 countries in 2019, the report by the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) released on Wednesday said.Governments, public relations firms and political parties are producing misinformation on an industrial scale, the report says, adding that disinformation has become a common strategy, with more than 93% of the countries (76 out of 81) seeing disinformation deployed as part of political communication. Philip Howard, director of the institute and the report’s co-author said: “Our report shows misinformation has become more professionalised and is now produced on an industrial scale. Now, more than ever, the public needs to be able to rely on trustworthy information about government policy and activity”. “Social media companies need to raise their game by increasing their efforts to flag misinformation and close fake accounts without the need for government intervention, so the public has access to high-quality information,” he added.The OII team warns the level of social media manipulation has soared, with governments and political parties spending millions on private sector ‘cyber troops’, who drown out other voices on social media. Citizen influencers are used to spread manipulated messages; these include volunteers, youth groups and civil society organisations, who support their ideologies, it adds.Key findings include: Private ‘strategic communications’ firms are playing an increasing role in spreading computational propaganda, with researchers identifying state actors working with such firms in 48 countries; almost $60 million has been spent on firms who use bots and other amplification strategies to create the impression of trending political messaging. The report adds that social media has become a major battleground, with firms such as Facebook and Twitter taking steps to combat ‘cyber troops’, with some $10 million spent on social media political advertisements. The platforms removed more than 317,000 accounts and pages from ‘cyber troops’ actors between January 2019 and November 2020.The 2020 report draws upon a four-step methodology to identify evidence of globally organised manipulation campaigns, including content analysis of news articles on cyber troop activity, secondary literature review of public archives and scientific reports, generating country-specific case studies and expert consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/social-media-manipulation-a-growing-threat-to-democracies-oxford-study-101610546303113.html

Its parents are seven-year-old Maruska and an 11-year-old male, Manas.“Maruska, a first-time mom, behaves wonderfully,” zoo president Radoslaw Ratajszczak was quoted as saying.“She looks after her daughter, allows her to nurse, and is very delicate, despite weighing more than 2 tons. For example, when she lies down, she’s very careful not to crush the little one, and even gently moves her aside.” Ratajszczak said.The new baby is being cared for away from the public so far.The Indian rhinoceros was close to extinction but thanks to a protection program launched in the 1970s there are some 3,600 now, including over 170 living in 66 zoos around the world.The Indian rhinoceros can stand 3.8 meters ( 12 ft., 5 inches) tall and weigh up to 3 tons. They live in the wet, grassy areas of the northern India. They mainly feed on grass, leaves and twigs but also on fruit and aquatic vegetation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/endangered-indian-rhinoceros-baby-is-born-in-zoo-in-poland-101610543405112.html

Biden's Democratic Party will control Congress, boosting the chance his ideas become law."We will support efforts by the new Congress and incoming Administration to pass comprehensive immigration reform that improves employment-based visa programs that enhance American competitiveness, gives greater assurance to immigrant workers and employers, and promotes better and more humane immigration processing and border security practices," said Google senior vice president Kent Walker in a blog post.Walker added Google's philanthropic arm would donate $250,000 to the organization United We Dream, which helps immigrants unlawfully living in the United States after arriving as children secure work permits and avoid deportation using the deferred action program, or DACA.A court ruling expected soon threatens to pause renewals and applications for those permits, Walker said. Recipients are often called "Dreamers."Google has in the past teamed with fellow large technology companies when making statements on immigration policy. But only one other tech company spoke out on the issue this week.Uber Technologies Inc told Reuters it continued to support "Dreamers" and welcomed "the new Administration's effort to reform our nation's immigration system."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-backs-biden-immigration-efforts-covers-fees-in-dreamer-program-101610541748253.html

He added that his comment reflected only his personal view."My own personal view is you want to protect as many people as quickly as possible so you want to get through the nine categories and then move towards teachers ... police officers, shop workers," he told lawmakers on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-favours-vaccinating-teachers-police-ahead-of-2nd-dose-deployment-101610539396372.html
13-01-2021||World||China Covid pandemic control goes rural ahead of Lunar New Year||China is concentrating its pandemic prevention efforts in the rural areas as officials urge people to not travel home for the Lunar New Year festival while the country combats its most serious latest outbreak of Covid-19.Authorities said Wednesday local clinics and hospitals in villages need to strengthen their vigilance for any new Covid-19 cases, and local governments must take responsibility at every level — from county to town to village.The government is bracing for the world's largest annual migration in which hundreds of millions travel home for Lunar New Year break in February, many of them workers from cities going back to their home villages.“In the period leading up to Lunar New Year, we urge the public that those who do not need to travel, should not travel, and if one must travel, please observe all travel information and try to stagger travel to off-peak times,” Wang Bin, an official with the National Health Commission, told a news conference. “And to do personal protective measures and avoid crowded places with lots of people.”Meanwhile, millions of people are lining up in freezing temperatures to receive a second round of coronavirus tests in a city south of Beijing that is at the heart of the latest outbreak.The health commission on Wednesday announced another 90 confirmed cases in Hebei province, whose capital Shijiazhuang has accounted for the vast majority of the recent surge. Another 16 cases were reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang and one in the northern province of Shanxi.China had largely contained domestic spread but frigid winter temperatures have brought new outbreaks, even as China pushes to vaccinate 50 million people by mid-February. The Hebei outbreak is of particular concern because of the province’s close proximity to Beijing. Travel to and from three cities — Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang — has been suspended and residents of some communities have been told to stay home for the next week.All of Shijiazhuang’s roughly 10 million people have been ordered to undergo a second round of testing as authorities seek to isolate the sources of infection, some of which have been tentatively linked to wedding gatherings.Similar measures have been ordered around the country, particularly in Wuhan where 11 million people were placed under lockdown for 76 days last winter during the early days of the pandemic.The increased numbers come as World Health Organization experts prepare to fly on Thursday to Wuhan at the start of their investigation into the origins of the pandemic. Chinese officials said they would cooperate “closely” with the WHO in the investigation following rare criticism of the WHO head that Beijing was dragging its feet in issuing the necessary permissions.China has strictly controlled all research into the origins of the coronavirus and have used state media to promote theories that the virus may have actually been brought to China from outside.On Dec. 15, China started a mass vaccination campaign for select groups. Health workers have given over 10 million doses of one of the domestically produced Covid -19 vaccines, officials said Wednesday. Currently, China has only approved one vaccine for general use in populations aged 18-59 — an inactivated virus shot from state-owned Sinopharm.It has also approved three vaccines for emergency use, including two from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac, a private company.Sinovac's CEO announced at the same news conference that they have supplied more than 7 million shots to provinces across the country. Its vaccine has not yet been sent to regulators for final market approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-covid-pandemic-control-goes-rural-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-101610539630787.html

HRW said he has disseminated misleading information about the virus.The president's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Bolsonaro has argued that lockdowns badly damage Brazil's economy and leave many out of work.Outside of the pandemic response, Bolsonaro has also undermined women's rights, lashed out at reporters and civil society groups, and stigmatized and bullied independent Brazilian media, HRW said."The Supreme Court and other institutions have helped to protect Brazilians and to block many, although not all, of Bolsonaro's anti-rights policies. They need to remain vigilant," said Anna Livia Arida, HRW's Brazil Associate Director.Weakened environmental law enforcement has also allowed the illegal use of fires to clear land to soar again in the Amazon region. Deforestation hit a 12-year high in 2020, when an area of forest seven times the size of London was cleared, according to the government's space research institute (INPE)."President Bolsonaro's policies have been a disaster for the Amazon rainforest and the people who defend it," Arida said."He blames indigenous people, nongovernmental organizations and local residents for environmental destruction, instead of acting against criminal networks that are the driving force behind the lawlessness in the Amazon," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-sabotaged-anti-covid-efforts-says-human-rights-watch-101610535873241.html

Discussions about the issue were first reported by the Guardian newspaper.“We would only ever do that if it was clinically the right thing for somebody,” Hancock told Sky News. “In some cases, people need sit-down care, they don’t actually need to be in a hospital bed.”Britain already has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with over 83,000 deaths, and the number of hospital beds filled by Covid-19 patients patients is still rising. Hospitals in England English are now treating 55% more Covid-19 cases than during the first peak of the pandemic in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-may-move-patients-into-hotels-to-ease-hospital-strain-101610539425188.html

But the things have dramatically changed within less than 13 months and some of the House GOP members have come up in support to impeach the president for the second time. While there is scepticism around the trial and conviction of Trump in the Senate, the race to impeach the outgoing president has gathered momentum.Here’s the list of House Republicans in support of Trump’s impeachment:Liz Cheney: The third-highest-ranking Republican leader in the House issued a statement on Tuesday, saying she would vote to impeach the president. Referring to the insurrection that caused injuries, deaths and destruction at the US Capitol, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney said that the president summoned and assembled the mob and “lit the flame of this attack.” She further stated that the president could have “immediately and forcefully intervened” to stop the violence.“He did not. There has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” Cheney added. "I will vote to impeach the President."Read: Controversies that dogged US President Donald Trump's time in officeAdam Kinzinger: The 42-year-old US Representative from Illinois, a known Trump critic, broke ranks with the majority of GOP colleagues, announcing that he will vote in favour of impeachment. Kinzinger said in a statement that the country was in uncharted waters and there was no doubt in his mind that the president broke his oath of office and incited the insurrection. He accused Trump of using his position in the “Executive to attack the Legislative”.“So in assessing the articles of impeachment brought before the House, I must consider: if these actions...are not worthy of impeachment, then what is an impeachable offense? I will vote in favor of impeachment,” Kinzinger said.John Katko: The former federal prosecutor was the first Republican to publicly announce that he would support the impeachment proceedings. Katko, a US representative for New York's 24th congressional district, said that impeachment of sitting president is a decision he does not take lightly. Outlining the facts related to the Capitol riots, the Republican member said it cannot be ignored that Trump encouraged the insurrection – both on social media ahead of January 6 and in his speech that day. While Katko emphasised that there must be a continuance of government and a peaceful transition of power, the GOP member said that he also stated the need to “follow the law and the facts and hold this President accountable for his actions.”“To allow the President of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy. For that reason, I cannot sit by without taking action. I will vote to impeach this President,” Katko said in a statement.Read: Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment voteFred Upton: The representative from southwest Michigan said that Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that the nation cannot tolerate any effort to impede the peaceful transfer of power. Referring to Trump’s latest remark in which he called his rally “totally appropriate”, Upton said the president sent the wrong signal to those who support the core of democratic principles and took a solemn oath to the Constitution.“I would have preferred a bipartisan, formal censure rather than a drawn-out impeachment process. I fear this will now interfere with important legislative business and a new Biden administration. But it is time to say: Enough is Enough,” Upton said in a statement, adding that he would vote to impeach.Jaime Herrera Beutler: The representative of Washington State is the latest Republican to announce her support in the favour of impeachment. Beutler said the offences of the president were impeachable based on the “indisputable evidence we already have.” She stated that Trump’s denouncement to the violence was not only “pathetic” but also served as a “wink and nod” to those who perpetuated it.“I understand the argument that the best course is not to further inflame the country or alienate Republican voters,” she said. “But I am a Republican voter. I believe in our Constitution, individual liberty, free markets, charity, life, justice, peace and this exceptional country. I see that my own party will be best served when those among us choose truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-2-0-list-of-republicans-who-will-join-democrats-in-house-vote-101610538479140.html
13-01-2021||World||Covid-19: UK armed forces dealing with ‘most dangerous situation’||Record numbers of personnel from British armed forces have been deployed to help deal the “most dangerous situation” in living memory facing hospitals, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and ministers implored Britons not to flout current lockdown rules.This is the largest peacetime resilience operation ever undertaken by the UK armed forces and is drawing on every corner of expertise of the military, defence secretary Ben Wallace told parliament on Wednesday, as new cases and deaths continued to surge.Johnson confirmed in parliament on Wednesday that vaccination centres will soon be open 24 hours to enable more people to be vaccinated.There have been several reports of Britons weary of continuing restrictions violating them, prompting Scotland Yard in London and other police forces imposing heavy fines. Some hospitals are shifting non-Covid patients to hotels to free up space for new coronavirus patients.According to chief medical officer Chris Whitty, “Hospitals are always busy in the winter but the NHS in some parts of the country is currently facing the most dangerous situation anyone can remember”.Wallace said a record 5,300 personnel committed to winter and Covid operations have been supporting 56 different tasks in the UK and abroad, including the vaccine rollout, NHS support and community testing across the UK.Nearly 1,600 military medical professionals are deployed in the hospitals every day, from intensive care nurses to specialist surgeons, which means that very few defence medics are not currently deployed or working in the NHS.Wallace said: “Our country faces an unprecedented challenge and our Armed Forces are working hand in hand with the NHS. We will continue to bolster those on the front line as they protect and care for the most vulnerable”.Chief of the defence staff General Nick Carter added: “These are really challenging times for everyone at the moment. We all have a role to play in supporting those on the frontline in the fight against the virus”.The ministry of defence said the military is also working with education authorities to ensure that staff, vulnerable children and children of key workers can continue to attend school. Military planners and liaison officers are also embedded in local authorities and government departments, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-armed-forces-dealing-with-most-dangerous-situation-101610539283616.html
13-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un Sister slams ‘Weird Group’ in South Korea for spying||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a new rhetorical attack on their neighbor, slamming South Korea for spying on its actions during a rare party congress that included a military parade in Pyongyang.Kim Yo Jong, in a statement released by the state’s official Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday condemned South Korea for taking a “hostile approach toward fellow countrymen in the North,” and called the country’s intelligence officials “idiots,” for paying so much attention to what Pyongyang was doing during the gathering.Her comments followed the eight-day ruling party congress that concluded Tuesday. Her brother Kim Jong Un outlined Pyongyang’s military goals during the gathering of party officials that included boosting his nuclear arsenal in the face of U.S. “hostilities.”“The southerners are a truly weird group that’s hard to understand,” she said, criticizing South Korea’s military intelligence for tracking the movements in Pyongyang. She also disclosed that North Korea may have held a military parade Sunday night.“Why do they crane their necks to follow what’s happening in the North?” Kim Yo Jong said, according to the KCNA report.Her comments come after South Korean President Moon Jae-in made a fresh appeal this week for cooperation between the neighbors on the heavily armed peninsula.Despite a litany of insults and provocations, which included the June destruction of a joint liaison office just north of the border that was the president’s most tangible symbol of his reconciliation push, Moon has steadfastly embraced rapprochement with Pyongyang, which has shown no interest in taking the aid he has offered.During the ruling party congress, leader Kim declared the U.S. the “biggest main enemy” and said he would do “everything” to advance Pyongyang’s nuclear and military capabilities, laying out a renewed diplomatic challenge to the incoming administration of Joe Biden.North Korea is due to convene its parliament on Jan. 17, KCNA said, a meeting that could give further indications about how it will engage with Seoul and Biden.The state has not yet aired footage of the military parade, after it broadcast a slickly edited program hours after an October parade that was the biggest display of new weaponry in years. The event with thousands of goose-stepping soldiers included a new intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said was designed to deliver multiple nuclear warheads to the U.S.The ‘Princess’Kim Yo Jong’s status has changed from first deputy director of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea to vice department director of the Central Committee of WPK, according to KCNA, in what appears to be a demotion in the party structure.But the sister who was reportedly dubbed “Princess Yo Jong” by her father and former leader Kim Jong Il is a direct bloodline member of the ruling family, a status that exceeds posts in the party structure. Her name is still being called before most other party officials in the state broadcasts.Kim Yon Jong’s statement “shows that she is still in charge of South Korean affairs, regardless of her official title,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center based in Washington. “We can’t say that her political status has declined.”Kim saw her profile rise among political analysts as the likely successor to her brother when a prolonged absence in April raised questions about his health. She also took a more prominent role on policies toward the country’s two biggest adversaries, the U.S. and South Korea.Kim Yo Jong made her debut at a major global event in 2018 when she served as her brother’s envoy to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, sitting behind U.S. Vice President Mike Pence at opening ceremonies.The upcoming Summer Olympics planned for Tokyo in July could offer her another chance to stand on the world stage. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told a news conference Wednesday that he’s willing to meet Kim Jong Un without preconditions and wouldn’t miss a chance that may arise with the upcoming games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-sister-slams-weird-group-in-south-korea-for-spying-101610538609983.html
13-01-2021||World||China scrambles to control Covid outbreak, more than 28 million locked down||China is scrambling to control a new wave of Covid-19 outbreak, locking down some 28 million people across two provinces, carrying out mass-scale nucleic acid tests and appealing to citizens not to travel ahead of the Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays in February.Several provinces and cities across China have put in place travel restrictions as health authorities work overtime to contact-trace and isolate suspected cases who have travelled out from the locked down regions.More than 28 million residents in four cities in the provinces of Hebei and Heilongjiang have been put under home quarantine with intercity travel suspended and intracity movements restricted.China has recorded the biggest daily jump in Covid-19 cases in more than five months with 115 new confirmed cases reported for Tuesday in the mainland compared with 55 a day earlier. This was the highest daily increase since July 30.The increase in new infections comes as a World Health Organization team is slated to arrive in China on Thursday to probe the origins of the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The team will fly from Singapore to Wuhan on Thursday.The new infection numbers – though fewer than daily numbers in many Covid-hit places in the world – are a source of worry for the Communist Party of China-led government, which has repeatedly trumpeted its success in controlling the pandemic since it emerged from a Chinese city in late 2019.Officials said that new clusters have been triggered through community transmission.The national health commission (NHC) spokesperson, Mi Feng said the new outbreaks are characterised by long duration, wide coverage, rapid transmission, older patients, and high proportions in rural areas. In some places, community transmission and multi-generation transmission, Mi told a press conference on Wednesday, adding that the situation was complex and severe.The worst affected Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, has put three cities - Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang - into lockdown as part of the efforts to keep the virus from spreading further.The northeastern province of Heilongjiang province on Wednesday declared a Covid-19 emergency, putting the city of Suihua and its 5.2 million residents, under lockdown.Tieli, a city of about 300,000 people that borders Suihua, according to agency reports, said on Wednesday it will not allow any people or vehicles to leave for three days as part of new prevention measures.The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at 87,706, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.Meanwhile, China is administering domestically developed vaccines to specific groups with high infection risks, including medical workers, airport staff and people handling cold-chain imported products.“Over 1 million people in Beijing had received the first dose of vaccine as of 11 am Monday. The city is expected to complete administering the first dose of the jab among specific groups by Friday,” Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said in a report on Wednesday.The WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said that a WHO team in China is working with producers of the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines for potential emergency use listings.“I’m pleased that a WHO team is in China currently working with producers of the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines to assess compliance with international quality manufacturing practices ahead of potential emergency use listing by WHO,” Tedros said at a media briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-scrambles-to-control-covid-outbreak-more-than-28-million-locked-down-101610538562949.html

Earlier this week, J&J's chief executive officer said the company was on track to have close to a billion Covid-19 vaccine doses by 2021-end, and that it was in the final stages of analyzing data from a large trial of the vaccine.J&J and the US Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.In August, J&J signed a $1 billion contract with the US government to supply up to 100 million doses by mid-2021.Approval for J&J's vaccine could help speed up the vaccination effort in the United States as it likely requires a single dose unlike the two currently approved vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are to be administered in two-dose series weeks apart.J&J said in December it expects interim data from the late-stage trial by the end of January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-may-not-meet-us-covid-19-vaccine-supply-target-by-spring-report-101610538164871.html

That is the challenge of the Chinese Communist Party and its capacity and intention to expand its influence and ultimately deliver a world that is very different, one not governed by the rule of law, by respect for sovereignty, all the things that the world has come to know in the post-World War II environment," he said in the interview as quoted by the transcript provided by the Department of State."The Chinese Communist Party wants to upend with a very different theory of international relations, one dominated by the East, one controlled in a way that won't create more security, freedom, more prosperity," Pompeo added.When asked about whether President-elect Joe Biden would stand up to the CCP, the top US diplomat said that he was confident that the American people including Biden would make sure that America remains the country it has for the last 240-plus years."I am confident the American people will demand that whoever is leading their country, President-elect Biden included, respond to that in a way that continues to make sure that America remains the country it has for the last 240-plus years, and that the world continue to operate under a set of rules that are based in human rights, based in the law, based in respect for sovereignty," he said.Pompeo lashed out at the CCP for refusing to allow anybody to get access to the information they need to figure the origins of Covid-19 adding that he was not optimistic about the World Health Organization's (WHO) visit to China."It sounds like yesterday or the day before they may finally have let the World Health Organization enter. I hope, but I'm not optimistic, that they will actually let them do the work that needs to be done: see records, see the lab, see the original work that was done, see - talk to, interview all of the people, not with minders around, but in a situation where those people would be free to speak their mind. I hope that investigation can be thorough," he said.When asked about whether he would accept any other alternative explanation that Covid-19 originated from Wuhan, he said that the CCP "has offered not one, not two, but at least three alternative theories for where this began.""They continue to attempt to obfuscate. Everything that we have seen indicates that this began not only inside of China but at Hubei province, Wuhan," he added.On the subject of whether China owes reparations to the world, Pompeo said that there "will be hundreds and hundreds of thousands" more people continue to live in poverty as a direct result of the economic challenges that the 'Wuhan virus' has foisted upon the world."I think the world will respond to this in a way that recognizes what the Chinese Communist Party did by delaying their activation of the promises that they had made to the World Health Organization, and there will be costs that are attached to that as a direct result of the things that the Chinese Communist Party did," he said.Pompeo, who has been critical of the world health body, said it was corrupted by China's influence, "and bought cheap." "WHO investigators still can't access Wuhan - a year after the first cases were reported #ChinaLiedMillionsDied," he said in a tweet on Monday.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ccp-wants-different-theory-of-global-relations-that-won-t-create-freedom-pompeo-101610537624970.html
13-01-2021||World||US must reverse Trump course, make human rights central: Human Rights Watch||US President-elect Joe Biden needs to restore the country's credibility on human rights at home and abroad, the head of New-York based Human Rights Watch told Reuters on Wednesday, after what he said were four years of abuse of democratic principles.Speaking to Reuters before the release of the activist group's annual report, Kenneth Roth said outgoing president Donald Trump had flouted human rights at home and been inconsistent in criticising other countries' rights records.Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, should make human rights a cornerstone of US foreign policy, said Roth, HRW executive director."Trump has been a complete disaster for human rights, he flouted human rights at home with the fomenting of the January 6 attack on the Capitol being just the latest example of the natural culmination of four years of abuse of democratic principles," Roth told Reuters Television in Geneva.With eight days remaining of Trump's term, the House will vote on Wednesday on an article of impeachment accusing him of inciting insurrection in a speech to his followers last week before a mob of them stormed the Capitol, leaving five dead.Trump has denied responsibility for the violence and previous allegations of violating human rights. He has said his critics stole the election to block his "Make America Great Again" and "America First" policies, but produced no evidence.Roth accused Trump of having "cozied up to every friendly autocrat under the sun" while reserving criticism on human rights issues for his "perceived adversaries" - Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, and "sometimes China"."But that kind of utterly inconsistent approach had no credibility. There was no force to his criticism when people knew that it was serving another political agenda, not a principled agenda," he said.Biden should articulate human rights as a "guiding principle of US foreign policy and then to stick with it, even when that’s difficult", Roth said.He urged him to call off arms sales to countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel and criticise Indian prime minister Modi over his policy towards Muslims, "even though India is going to be an important ally in contesting China".Roth also called for Biden to re-engage with the United Nations' Human Rights Council, a Geneva forum which Trump quit in June 2018, "even though it criticizes Israel".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-reverse-trump-course-make-human-rights-central-human-rights-watch-101610536229327.html
13-01-2021||World||Intense Israeli airstrikes in east Syria said to kill dozens||Israeli warplanes carried out intense airstrikes on eastern Syria early Wednesday, apparently targeting positions and arms depots of Iran-backed forces. Dozens of fighters were killed or wounded, according to an opposition war monitor.A senior US intelligence official with knowledge of the attack told The Associated Press that the airstrikes were carried out with intelligence provided by the United States — a rare incidence of publicized cooperation between the two countries over choosing targets in Syria. The official said the strikes targeted a series of warehouses in Syria that were being used in a pipeline to store and stage Iranian weapons.The US official, who requested anonymity to speak about sensitive national security matters, said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed Tuesday’s airstrike with Yossi Cohen, chief of Israel’s spy agency Mossad, at a public meeting in popular Washington restaurant Café Milano on Monday.The official said the warehouses also served as a pipeline for components that support Iran’s nuclear program.Syria’s state news agency SANA said the strikes hit areas in and near the towns of Deir el-Zour, Mayadeen and Boukamal along the border with Iraq. An unnamed military official was quoted as saying Syrian air defenses responded to the incoming missiles. It gave no further details.An opposition war monitor reported at least 18 strikes in Deir el-Zour and along the border with Iraq, saying several arms depots were hit. Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 40 people were killed, including nine Syrian troops, and the rest were Iran-backed fighters. It said 37 were wounded.“They burnt Iranian positions in Deir el-Zour,” said Omar Abu Laila, a Europe-based activist from Syria’s eastern Deir el-Zour province who runs an activist collective that reports on news in the border area. He recorded at least 16 targeted buildings, warehouses or bases for Iranian, Lebanese and Iraqi militias in the towns of Boukamal, Mayadeen and Deir el-Zour.Israel has launched hundreds of strikes against Iran-linked military targets in Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations.The Observatory said it recorded 39 Israeli strikes inside Syria in 2020 that hit 135 targets, including military posts, warehouses or vehicles. In those attacks, at least 217 people were killed, mostly Iranian-allied militiamen, according to the Observatory.The strikes come at a time of heightened tension in the region in the final days of President Donald Trump’s administration.Many fear retaliation for the US killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani last year may come before Trump leaves office, or that conflict could erupt to scuttle efforts by Joe Biden’s incoming administration to negotiate with Iran.Israel views Iranian entrenchment on its northern frontier as a red line, and it has repeatedly struck Iran-linked facilities and weapons convoys destined for Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.The strikes also come amid intensifying low-altitude Israeli warplane missions in Lebanese skies that have caused jitters among residents and prompted Lebanon to file an urgent complaint to the UN about the violations of its airspace. Israeli officials have said the overflights are necessary because Hezbollah is violating the 2006 UN resolution that bars it from building up its military capabilities and operating near the Israeli border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intense-israeli-airstrikes-in-east-syria-said-to-kill-dozens-101610536447012.html

The demonstration was organized by Crime Minister, one of several groups that have sprung up in recent months calling for Netanyahu to resign over the trial and his government's handling of the coronavirus.For months, protesters have held weekly demonstrations outside the prime minister's office and at major road intersections and bridges across the country.Netanyahu was indicted last year on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust linked to three corruption cases. He has denied any wrongdoing and accuses the media, law enforcement and judicial officials of waging a “witch hunt” against him.The protesters Wednesday morning read the indictment outside his residence. He was supposed to appear in court Wednesday, but the hearing was postponed to Feb. 8 because of a coronavirus lockdown that heavily restricts public gatherings.Netanyahu is once again fighting for re-election ahead of a nationwide vote in March — the fourth to be held in Israel in less than two years. Polls show his Likud party winning the most seats but being unable to form a coalition government because of rivalries with other right-wing leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelis-hold-dawn-protest-over-pm-s-corruption-trial-101610522856407.html
13-01-2021||World||As China Covid-19 cases rise, millions more placed under lockdown||China posted its biggest daily jump in Covid cases in more than five months on Wednesday, stepping up containment measures that have seen four cities put under lockdown, as the world's second biggest economy scrambles to head off a new wave of infections.Most of the new cases were reported near the capital, Beijing, but a province in the far northeast also saw a rise in infections, official data showed, amid a resurgence that has seen more than 28 million people put under home quarantine.While the Chinese city of Wuhan was the initial epicenter of the novel coronavirus, which emerged there in late 2019, China had in recent months largely kept it at bay.On Wednesday, the National Health Commission reported a total of 115 new confirmed cases on the mainland, compared with 55 the previous day, the highest daily increase since July 30.It said 107 of the new cases were local infections. Hebei, the province that surrounds Beijing, accounted for 90 cases, while northeastern Heilongjiang province reported 16 new cases.The wave of infections is likely to put a damper on next month's Lunar New Year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people typically travel to their home towns. Far fewer are expected to hit the road this year, and many provinces have asked migrant workers to stay put during the break.A "massive" resurgence is unlikely during the holiday if control and prevention measures are enforced properly, Feng Zijian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a media briefing.The spike in new cases comes as a World Health Organization team of experts investigating the origins of the pandemic is set to arrive on Thursday in Wuhan. The team will have to spend 14 days in quarantine, NHC spokesman Mi Feng said.Much remains unknown about the origins of the coronavirus and China has been sensitive about accusations of a cover-up that delayed its initial response and allowed the virus to spread. A health expert affiliated with the WHO said previously that expectations should be "very low" that the team would reach a conclusion from its trip.Testing capacityHebei province has put three cities - Shijiazhuang, Xingtai and Langfang - into lockdown, while Beijing city authorities have stepped up screening and prevention measures.China has administered more than 10 million vaccine doses, NHC official Wang Bin said on Wednesday, and has ramped up testing capacity to 12.55 million people per day, or 10 times the level last March.Heilongjiang province on Wednesday declared a Covid-19 emergency. The city of Suihua, which borders the provincial capital Harbin, put its 5.2 million people under lockdown.Most of the cases in Heilongjiang have been found in Wangkui county, under Suihua's jurisdiction. Tieli, a city of about 300,000 that borders Suihua, said on Wednesday it would ban people and vehicles from leaving for three days as part of new Covid-19 prevention measures.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 38 from 81 cases a day earlier. Seven of those were reported in Jilin, a northeastern province bordering Heilongjiang.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 87,706, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-china-covid-19-cases-rise-millions-more-placed-under-lockdown-101610533121047.html
13-01-2021||World||Japan widens Covid-19 emergency for 7 more areas as cases surge||Japan expanded a coronavirus state of emergency for seven more prefectures Wednesday, affecting more than half the population amid a surge in infections across the country.Prime Minister Yoshide Suga’s announcement comes less than a week after he declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and three nearby prefectures. The new declaration, which adds seven other prefectures in western and central Japan, takes effect Thursday and lasts until Feb. 7.The government is asking bars and restaurants in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Fukuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures to close by 8 pm, employers to have 70% of their staff work from home and residents in the affected areas avoid going out for nonessential purposes.Suga has been criticized as being to slow to act as the country’s number of reported coronavirus infections and deaths roughly doubled over the past month to about 300,000 and 4,100. Both states of emergency were declared only after local leaders had pleaded with him to do so.Experts have warned that even the state of emergency measures, which are non-binding and largely rely on voluntary cooperation, may be insufficient to significantly slow the infections.Unlike the earlier seven-week emergency Japan had in April and May last year, schools, gyms, theaters and shops will stay open.Suga has faced criticism for not taking strong enough government action earlier in the outbreak. He mostly limited his interventions to asking the public to take basic safety measures such as wearing masks, washing hands and avoiding drinking and dining in groups until mid-December, when he finally announced the suspension of a government-subsidized tourism campaign.Suga eventually took action after calls from the local leaders, while his support ratings nosedived in polls showing the public increasingly dissatisfied with his handling of the virus.Suga took office in mid-September and pledged to keep the infections under control while also getting the economy back on track. He also promised to successfully hold the Tokyo Olympic, which were postponed from last year until this coming summer.Despite the current surge in infections, Japan has reported far fewer infections than many countries of its size.Japan made it through earlier surges in infections without a lockdown, but experts and officials warn that people are growing fatigued and are becoming less cooperative than before.In a bid to more effectively enforce virus measures, Suga has said he will seek a legal revision in parliament next week to allow authorities to penalize business owners who defy official requests for coronavirus measures, while legally providing compensation to those who comply. Suga’s government also plans to revise the infectious disease control law so it can penalize patients who defy self-isolation requirements, hospitalization or cooperation with health authorities, Japanese media reports say.Japan Medical Association President Toshio Nakagawa said at a news conference Wednesday that medical systems in the country have been collapsing, with regular daily treatment at many hospitals compromised due to the growing burden of coronavirus patients.“I’m afraid a fear of explosive infections as in the U.S. and Europe can become a reality,” he said, urging people to cooperate, regain their sense of crisis and urgency.Japanese coronavirus measures have relied heavily on widespread mask wearing, contact tracing and other safety measures. But the number of new cases in the current outbreak has made contact tracing impossible, prompting Tokyo and neighboring prefectures to announce a cutback on the strategy to relieve the burden on local public health officials.Experts have also raised concerns about cases of more contagious variant of the coronavirus that has spread across Britain. About 30 cases of the new variant have been detected since late December. Another variant was also detected in four people arriving from Brazil this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-widens-covid-19-emergency-for-7-more-areas-as-cases-surge-101610532705606.html

We hope that with vaccinations picking up the pace we will reach the point of full recovery in the shortest possible time," the crown prince wrote on Twitter.According to the statistics of the ourworldindata.org web portal, which compiles official data on Covid-19 in each country, the UAE ranks second in the world after Israel and first among the Arab states in the number of vaccinations.The vaccine is currently available to any individual aged over 18. The UAE authorities intend to inoculate 50 per cent of the country's over-9-million population during the first quarter of 2021. In December, Abu Dhabi approved two vaccines against the coronavirus, namely the one developed by US firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and the one by China's Sinopharm.Among other things, western media have reported that some of the wealthiest citizens of the United Kingdom prefer receiving a shot in Emirati private clinics without waiting for their turn for vaccination back home.In December, the UK informed the World Health Organisation of a mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is reported to be 70 per cent more transmissible than other coronavirus strains. Although the new strain has not been proven to be more pathogenic, many states shut their borders and suspended travel with the United Kingdom.

13-01-2021||World||Trump impeachment 2.0: All you need to know about historic vote on January 13||The US House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday on one article of impeachment against President Donald Trump after vice president Mike Pence rejected a resolution that called on him to invoke 25th Amendment of the Constitution. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Pence said that the 25th Amendment is not a means of "punishment or usurpation", and invoking it would set a "terrible precedent". Now that the Democrats have exhausted all options to remove Trump from the office, their initiative to impeach him for the second time has gathered momentum, with some House Republicans turning their back on the outgoing president.What are the charges against Trump?House Democrats have introduced a single article of impeachment against Trump, charging him with “incitement of insurrection” that led to the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 when the Congress was scheduled to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win. In the final text of the resolution to impeach the president, Democrats stated that Trump engaged in “high crimes and misdemeanours” by inciting violence against the government of the United States.The Democrats have accused Trump of repeatedly issuing false statements in which he had asserted that the presidential election results were the product of widespread fraud. They have alleged that the outgoing president incited members of the crowd at The Ellipse in Washington, DC, in an attempt to interfere with the joint session of the US Congress.Read | Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment voteThe impeachment article also mentions Trump’s previous efforts to overturn the election by attempting to obstruct the certification of the results. It highlights Trump’s phone call to the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, in which he was caught on tape urging the official to "find" enough votes to overturn the election results of the state.“In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of Government. He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government. He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,” the text reads.How likely is Trump’s impeachment?The House of Representatives will vote on the article of impeachment and the majority of members would require to vote in favour to get Trump impeached for the second time during his four-year tenure. Though Republicans narrowed their disadvantage in the recently concluded House elections, Democrats held onto their majority.While the House Republicans didn’t vote for Trump’s impeachment in 2019, three GOP colleagues have come up in support of his impeachment and removal from the office. Republican House members Liz Cheney, John Katko and Adam Kinzinger have said that they would vote for impeachment. It is now highly likely that Trump will get impeached by the House with Democratic majority, with additional support from some Republicans, making him the only president in the history of the United States to be impeached twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-2-0-all-you-need-to-know-about-historic-vote-on-january-13-101610531350615.html

Now Broadsheet revelations have again exposed the massive scale of our ruling elite corruption & money laundering,” Khan tweeted.“These revelations (are) tip of the iceberg. We want complete transparency from the Broadsheet on our elites money laundering and on who stopped investigations,” he said.Khan said these revelations had repeatedly exposed what he had been saying in his "24-year fight against corruption which is the biggest threat to the country's progress"."These elites come to power and plunder the country. They do money laundering to stash their ill-gotten gains abroad, safe from domestic prosecution. Then they use their political clout to get NROs. That is how they kept their plundered wealth safe," he said, adding that the nation suffered as a consequence.He went to add that these elites cannot hide behind the "victimisation" card on these international revelations.National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) was the law enacted by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf to waive off all cases and corruption charges against former premier Benazir Bhutto, her husband Asif Ali Zardari and dozens of others in 2007 to strike a political deal with her.The infamous law has become synonymous with the political concession to make political deals.After Moussavi's revelations, Khan formed an inter-ministerial committee to probe the allegation of corruption against people mentioned.“The cabinet formed an inter-ministerial committee, which will reveal details of the individuals mentioned in the Broadsheet scandal,” Information Minister Shibli Faraz said.He said that Khan had decided to make the names public after thorough scrutiny.The UK company Broadsheet LLC was registered in the Isle of Man in the time former president Pervez Musharraf and it entered into a deal with Pakistan’s National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to track down ill-gotten foreign assets of Pakistani.The contract was terminated in 2003 by the NAB.Dawn reported that a lawyer associated with the company earlier told the newspaper that the Sharifs were the “top target” of the Broadsheet investigation.The company's owner alleged that someone claiming to be associated with Sharif approached him in 2012 and offered a sum of money to drop the probe against him.The timing of fresh allegations against Sharif coincides with his party fully supporting an Opposition alliance to topple Khan’s government on the allegations of electoral fraud.Sharif, 70, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) supremo, has been living in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court permitted him to go abroad for four weeks for treatment.The three-time former prime minister, convicted in two corruption cases -- Avenfield properties and Al-Azizia -- was declared a proclaimed offender by the Islamabad High Court after he failed to appear before it despite several warnings.

13-01-2021||World||US carries out its first execution of female inmate since 1953||A Kansas woman was executed Wednesday for strangling an expectant mother in Missouri and cutting the baby from her womb, the first time in nearly seven decades that the US government has put to death a female inmate.Lisa Montgomery, 52, was pronounced dead at 1:31 am after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. She was the 11th prisoner executed at the facility since July when President Donald Trump, an ardent supporter of capital punishment, resumed federal executions following 17 years without one.As a curtain was raised in the execution chamber, Montgomery looked momentarily bewildered as she glanced at journalists peering at her from behind thick glass. A woman standing over her shoulder leaned over, gently removed Montgomery’s face mask and asked if she had any last words.“No,” Montgomery responded in a quiet, muffled voice. She said nothing else.She tapped her fingers nervously for several seconds — a heart-shaped tattoo on her thumb — showed no signs of distress, and quickly closed her eyes. As the lethal injection began, Montgomery kept licking her lips and gasped briefly as pentobarbital, the lethal drug, entered her body through IVs on both arms. A few minutes later, her midsection throbbed for a moment, but quickly stopped.Montgomery lay on a gurney in the pale-green execution chamber, her glasses on and her grayish brown hair spilling over a green medical pillow. At 1:30 a.m., an official in black gloves with a stethoscope walked into the room, listened to her heart and chest, then walked out. She was pronounced dead a minute later.“The craven bloodlust of a failed administration was on full display tonight,” Montgomery’s attorney, Kelley Henry, said in a statement. “Everyone who participated in the execution of Lisa Montgomery should feel shame.”“The government stopped at nothing in its zeal to kill this damaged and delusional woman,” Henry said. “Lisa Montgomery’s execution was far from justice.”It came after hours of legal wrangling before the Supreme Court cleared the way for the execution to move forward. Montgomery was the first of the final three federal inmates scheduled to die before next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to discontinue federal executions.In a separate ruling Tuesday, which the government can still seek to overturn, another federal judge halted the scheduled executions later this week of Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs. Johnson, convicted of killing seven people related to his drug trafficking in Virginia, and Higgs, convicted of ordering the murders of three women in Maryland, both tested positive for COVID-19 last month.The men's attorneys argued that lung damage caused by the coronavirus would make it more likely that the lethal injection would cause them severe pain. If they aren't executed before Biden becomes president, they may likely never be put to death.Montgomery killed 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then cut the baby girl from the womb with a kitchen knife. Montgomery took the child with her and attempted to pass the girl off as her own.An appeals court granted Montgomery a stay of execution Tuesday, shortly after another appeals court lifted an Indiana judge’s ruling that found she was likely mentally ill and couldn’t comprehend she would be put to death. But both appeals were lifted, allowing the execution to go forward.As the only woman on federal death row, Montgomery had been held in a prison in Texas and was brought to Terre Haute on Monday night.Montgomery’s legal team says she suffered “sexual torture" for years, including gang rapes, as a child, permanently scarring her emotionally and exacerbating mental-health issues that ran in her family.At trial, prosecutors accused Montgomery of faking mental illness, noting her killing of Stinnett was premeditated and included meticulous planning, including online research on how to perform a C-section.Henry balked at that idea, citing brain scans that supported the diagnosis of mental illness. She said the issue at the core of legal arguments was not whether she knew the killing was wrong in 2004 but whether she fully grasped why she was to be executed.According to her lawyers, Montgomery suffered from depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. At around the time of the killing, they say she had a rare condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman’s false belief she is pregnant triggers hormonal and physical changes as if she were actually pregnant.Montgomery also experienced delusions and hallucinations, believing God spoke with her through connect-the-dot puzzles, defense experts said.Details of the crime at times left jurors in tears during her trial.Prosecutors told the jury Montgomery drove about 170 miles (274 kilometers) from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Stinnett. She strangled Stinnett, performed a crude cesarean and fled with the baby.Prosecutors said Stinnett regained consciousness and tried to defend herself as Montgomery cut the baby girl from her womb. Later that day, Montgomery called her husband from Topeka, Kansas, telling him she had delivered the baby earlier in the day at a birthing center.Montgomery was arrested the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who is now 16 years old and hasn’t spoken publicly about the tragedy.Prosecutors said the motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children. Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.Anti-death penalty groups said Trump pushed for executions prior to the November election in a cynical bid to burnish a reputation as a law-and-order leader.The last woman executed by the federal government was Bonnie Brown Heady on Dec. 18, 1953, for the kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old boy in Missouri.The last woman executed by a state was Kelly Gissendaner, 47, on Sept. 30, 2015, in Georgia. She was convicted of murder in the 1997 slaying of her husband after she conspired with her lover, who stabbed Douglas Gissendaner to death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-its-1st-execution-of-female-inmate-since-1953-101610527834096.html

13-01-2021||World||Controversies that dogged US President Donald Trump's time in office||Donald Trump may or may not be impeached over last week’s violence at the US Capitol, but come January 20, 2021, he won’t be the President any more as on this day, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn-in as President and Vice President respectively.Also Read | Donald Trump’s impeachment on cards after Mike Pence refuses to invoke 25th amendmentTrump, who became the 45th US President after winning the November 2016 elections, had a rather controversial time in office. Here are some major events that took place during his term in the White House and before the US Capitol riots:1. Border wall: Stopping illegal immigration, including from Mexico, was one of Trump’s major poll planks. On January 25, 2017, just four days after taking oath, he signed Executive Order 13767, directing that a wall be built on the US-Mexico border. The construction began in 2019 but is yet to be completed.2. Protests against ‘Muslim’ ban: Widespread protests broke out after Trump signed Executive Order 13769 on January 27, 2017. In reality a travel ban, it was called a ‘Muslim’ ban as it barred immigration to the US from countries with substantial Muslim population.3. US withdraws from Paris climate accord: In accordance with his “America first” policy, Trump announced on June 1, 2017, that the US would be withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement, popularly known as the Paris climate accord.4. ‘March for our lives’ protests: Amid a spiral in gun violence, with many incidents taking place in schools and campuses, student-led ‘March for our lives’ protests, in support of gun control legislation, took place on March 24, 2018.5. Withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal: On May 8, 2018, the US announced its withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCOPA), known in popular parlance as the “Iran nuclear deal.” It was signed on July 14, 2015 between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), and Germany.6. Trump meets Kim Jong-un: The two leaders met for the first time on June 12, 2018 in Singapore, in what was the maiden meeting between leaders of the US and North Korea. Trump and Kim met for a second time in Hanoi on February 27-28, 2019 and followed it up with a meeting on the heavily militarised border between South and North Korea on June 30, 2019.7. Death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: The ISIS chief detonated a suicide belt as the US Special Forces carried out a raid targeting him in Barisha, Syria, on October 26-27, 2019. “Baghdadi died whimpering and crying and screaming,” Trump would announce at a press conference.8. First “impeachment” and acquittal: The US House of Representatives “impeached” Trump on December 18, 2019 after he was found “guilty” of actions which led to him being charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. However, on February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted by the Senate.9. Killing of Qasem Soleimani: A US drone strike killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq on January 3, 2020. This led to a spike in tensions between the US and Iran, leading to events that many speculated would result in the “third world war.”10. George Floyd murder and BLM protests: The killing at the hands of the Minneapolis Police of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, triggered massive outrage. It also reignited the ‘Black Lives Matter’ (BLM) protests, which swept across the US and later spread to other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-as-us-president-some-major-events-during-his-term-in-white-house-101610525510187.html

13-01-2021||World||Indonesian searchers hunt for crashed plane's voice recorder||Divers searching for a crashed jet's cockpit voice recorder were sifting through mud and plane debris on the seabed between Indonesian islands on Wednesday to retrieve information key to learning why the Sriwijaya Air jet nosedived into the Java Sea over the weekend.Indonesian navy divers on Tuesday recovered the flight data recorder from the jet that disappeared Saturday minutes after taking off from Jakarta with 62 people aboard. The information on both black boxes will be key to the crash investigation.The 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 had resumed commercial flights last month after almost nine months out of service because of flight cutbacks caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The US Federal Aviation Administration sent an airworthiness directive requiring operators of various Boeing 737 aircraft models, including the 737-500, to carry out engine checks before they can be flown again after being out of service. The order followed reports of engines shutting down in mid-flight because of corrosion in a key valve.Director General of Air Transportation Novie Riyanto said the plane was inspected on Dec. 2, including checks for engine corrosion, and was declared airworthy by Indonesia’s Transportation Ministry on Dec. 14. It resumed commercial flights on Dec. 22, according to ministry data. After returning to service, the plane made 132 flights, including the last one, according to aviation-data firm Flightradar24.Aviation experts said planes that are parked for long stretches can be returned to flight safely.“It depends on how the airline maintains the aircraft while it is grounded,” said William Waldock, an aviation-safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. He said airlines should run engines periodically and perform other maintenance. “It tends to keep everything lubricated, and it reduces the likelihood of corrosion building up in places you don’t want it to be,” he said.John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board, said preparing a long-grounded jet can be an intensive and expensive chore, taking a team of mechanics up to two weeks to check engines and make sure that electronic, hydraulic and fuel systems are operating and free of contamination.Goglia said that his initial thought on learning about the plane’s long grounding “was if they did the proper due diligence, because sometimes that stuff doesn’t show up for a little while.”Navy officials have said the two black boxes were buried in seabed mud under tons of sharp objects in the plane’s wreckage, slowing the search efforts. A signal that may be from the cockpit voice recorder was detected near where the flight data recorder was recovered, between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain just north of Jakarta.At least 160 divers were deployed Wednesday to boost the search for the recorder that holds conversations between pilots.More than 3,300 rescue personnel, 13 helicopters, 54 ships and 20 raft boats searched Wednesday in the area of the java Sea where the jet crashed and have found parts of the plane and human remains.Bambang Suryo Aji, the National Search and Rescue Agency’s operations director, told reporters that bad weather and high waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high forced authorities to suspend the search in the afternoon.So far, the searchers have sent 139 body bags containing human remains to police identification experts. Anguished family members have been providing samples for DNA tests to the disaster victim identification unit, which on Tuesday said it had identified four victims.The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that the team it is sending to join the crash investigation will arrive in a few days.The four NTSB investigators will be joined by personnel from the US Federal Aviation Administration, General Electric and Boeing, who have expertise in operations, human performance, airplane structure and systems, the NTSB wrote on Twitter.The airline’s data showed that both pilots in command of the plane were highly experienced and had relatively good safety records.Capt. Afwan, who goes by one name, began his career as an air force Hercules pilot and had several decades of flying experience. He was known to his relatives and friends as a devout Muslim and preacher. Afwan’s co-pilot, Diego Mamahit, was equally qualified.Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator with Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said the crew did not declare an emergency or report technical problems before the plane nosedived into the sea.Indonesia's aviation industry grew quickly after the nation's economy was opened following the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s. Safety concerns led the United States and the European Union to ban Indonesian carriers for years, but the bans have since been lifted due to better compliance with international aviation standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-searchers-hunt-for-crashed-plane-s-voice-recorder-101610519472695.html
13-01-2021||World||Iran holds missile drill in Gulf of Oman amid tensions||Iran’s navy began a short-range missile drill in the Gulf of Oman on Wednesday, state TV reported, amid heightened regional tensions over Tehran’s nuclear program and a US pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.The two-day missile drill was being held in the gulf's southeastern waters and two new Iranian-made warships joined the exercise: The missile-launching Zereh, or “armor," and the Makran, a logistics vessel with a helicopter pad named for a coastal region in southern Iran.President Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from Iran’s nuclear deal, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Trump cited Iran’s ballistic missile program among other issues in withdrawing from the accord.When the US then ramped up sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits on its nuclear development as a series of escalating incidents pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year.In recent weeks, Iran has increased its military drills. On Saturday, the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard held a naval parade in the Persian Gulf and a week earlier Iran held a massive drone maneuver across half the country.Also last week, Iran seized a South Korean oil tanker and its crew members in the Gulf, and continues to hold the vessel at an Iranian port. The Islamic Republic has apparently sought to increase its leverage over Seoul ahead of negotiations over billions of dollars in Iranian assets frozen in South Korean banks tied to US sanctions on Iran.On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Iran of having secret ties with the militant al-Qaida network and imposed new sanctions on several senior Iranian officials. Iran has denied the accusation.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday said in a televised speech during a Cabinet meeting that US sanctions will fail. “We are witnessing the failure of a policy, the maximum pressure campaign, economic terrorism,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-holds-missile-drill-in-gulf-of-oman-amid-tensions-101610520950995.html
13-01-2021||World||China sees spike in coronavirus cases ahead of WHO team visit||China's Covid-19 cases crossed the 100-mark for the first time in recent months, ahead of Thursday's visit of the WHO team to Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.The number of coronavirus cases in China climbed to 115 on Tuesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday, adding that 107 of the infections were locally transmitted and the rest arrived from outside.Of the locally transmitted cases, 90 were reported in north China's Hebei Province, which neighbours Beijing; 16 in Heilongjiang Province and one in Shanxi Province, the NHC said.As of Tuesday, China reported a total of 87,706 Covid-19 cases and 4,634 deaths due to the virus.The sudden spike in cases after China contained the virus raised concern as the surge comes ahead of the Spring Festival, the biggest annual holiday in the Chinese lunar calendar.The week-long festival, which also marks the Chinese New Year, will commence on February 12 during which millions of Chinese travel to home and abroad to celebrate the holidays.While Beijing, which has reported few cases, is tightening control because of the surge in infections in neighbouring Hebei province where millions of people are under lockdown due to the fast spread of the virus, provinces across the country are taking measures to contain the disease.Local governments across China are shutting down funerals and weddings to cut down the risk of coronavirus spreading across rural areas, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday.Funerals and weddings in China’s rural areas sometimes involve hundreds and maybe even thousands of guests. They are an important element of traditional Chinese culture and low attendances involve a huge loss of face for the families.The surge of the virus comes ahead of the long-awaited visit of the 10-member World Health Organisation (WHO) team to Wuhan, where Covid-19 first emerged in December 2019.The team will directly fly from Singapore to Wuhan, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. It is not clear whether they would go through 14-day quarantine.The WHO team's visit has become a bone of contention as Beijing, which questions the widely-held view about the virus' origins in Wuhan, had delayed granting permission to it.China has been proactively questioning the view that the deadly outbreak took place in a wet market in Wuhan where live animals, birds and reptiles are sold and spread to humans. The market remained closed and sealed since early last year.Observers say it is to be seen what comes out of the visit as China is asserting that the virus has emerged in several places in the world and it only reported first and wants WHO team to visit other countries as part of the world health body's investigations into the origins of Covid-19.Meanwhile, another team of WHO officials is assessing compliance with international quality manufacturing practices ahead of potential emergency approval for China’s Covid-19 vaccines Sinovac and Sinopharm, state-run China Daily quoted WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as saying.China has granted emergency approval for Sinopharm. Over nine million people in China have already been administered the vaccine.A number of countries, including Egypt, the UAE, Jordan and Indonesia, have authorised the Covid-19 vaccines produced by China for emergency use. And many more countries, including Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Nigeria, have ordered the vaccines or are cooperating with Beijing in procuring or rolling out the vaccines, the China Daily reported.Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday received the Covid-19 vaccine shot developed by China's biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-spike-in-coronavirus-cases-ahead-of-who-team-visit-101610520968666.html
13-01-2021||World||Saudi Aramco seeks $7.5 billion loan for pipeline investors||Saudi Aramco is lining up a loan of about $7.5 billion for potential investors in its oil pipelines, according to people familiar with the matter.The world’s biggest oil producer has begun talks with lenders to secure favorable terms for the funding package that would then be offered to investors, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The discussions are occurring in parallel with the sale of a stake in a pipeline unit, which could raise about $10 billion for Aramco, the people said.A pipeline deal would be the first phase of Aramco’s effort to raise money from leasing rights or stakes in non-core assets, mirroring what Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has done in the past few years. The Saudi company is working with advisers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Moelis & Co., the Wall Street investment bank that’s also involved in the Adnoc deals.Aramco declined to comment.Adnoc, which pumps most of the oil and gas in the United Arab Emirates, has generated more than $15 billion from the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund. The company sold shares in its fuel-retail arm and leasing rights for properties and natural-gas pipelines.Aramco, which for years maintained only minimal corporate debt, is increasingly tapping new sources of funding as it looks to maintain annual dividend payments of $75 billion at a time of lower oil prices. Most of those payouts go to the Saudi state, which needs the money to fund its budget.The company listed in Riyadh in late 2019, but is still 98% owned by the government.The firm’s gearing, a measure of debt to equity, has risen to 21.8%, above its target range of 5% to 15%. Debt also rose because it took on loans to pay for a $69 billion acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp., a local chemical maker, last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-aramco-seeks-7-5-billion-loan-for-pipeline-investors-101610512245455.html
13-01-2021||World||North Korea ends party meeting with calls for nuclear might||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed all-out efforts to bolster his country's nuclear deterrent during a major ruling party meeting where he earlier laid out plans to work toward salvaging the broken economy.Separately, Kim’s powerful sister criticized South Korea’s military for saying it had seen an apparent military parade taking place in Pyongyang. Kim Yo Jong, who was described last year as being in charge of inter-Korean relations, said in a statement Wednesday that such close tracking proved Seoul’s “hostile approach” toward its rival.The eight-day Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday came as Kim Jong Un faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.Pandemic-related border closures and floods and typhoons that wiped out summer crops further shocked an economy already devastated by mismanagement and US-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons program.“We must further strengthen the nuclear war deterrent while doing our best to build up the most powerful military strength,” Kim said during his closing remarks at the congress, which were published by state media.North Korean state television later showed Kim, wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a black Mao suit, delivering the speech to thousands of party elites, who responded with thunderous cheers and applause.Kim said the country must “continue to give fresh spur” in making the military more elite and powerful so that it could cope with “any form of threat and emergency.”“The hostile forces will try to check our advance more frantically, and the world will watch how the political declaration and fighting program of our (party) are realized,” he said.Kim also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries in a five-year plan. Outside experts say such sectors would be crucial to North Korean hopes to revitalize industrial production that has been decimated by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.South Korean intelligence officials and analysts have said there are signs that the North is taking dramatic steps to strengthen government control over markets, including suppressing the use of US dollars and other foreign currencies.Such measures, which are apparently aimed at forcing people to exchange their foreign currency savings for the North Korean won, demonstrate the government’s sense of urgency over its depleting foreign currency reserves, said Lim Soo-ho, an analyst at a think tank run by Seoul’s spy agency.Foreign currencies have been broadly used in both trade and private market transactions in North Korea since 2009 when a botched currency revaluation under the rule of Kim’s father sparked hyperinflation and public unrest.The KCNA said the North will convene its rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday to adopt the decisions made by the congress into law.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump. Their diplomacy deteriorated after the collapse of their talks in Vietnam in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.During the congress, Kim doubled down on his ambitions to expand the North’s nuclear capabilities and announced plans to develop more sophisticated military assets, including longer-range missiles that could potentially target the American homeland, new tactical nuclear weapons, nuclear-powered submarines, spy satellites and hypersonic weapons.It's unclear whether the North is fully capable of acquiring such systems. While the country is believed to have accumulated at least dozens of nuclear weapons, outside estimates on the exact status of its nuclear and missiles programs vary widely.In comments that were apparently aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration, Kim labeled the United States as the North’s “principal enemy” and said the fate of bilateral relations would depend on whether Washington discards what Pyongyang perceives as hostile policies.Kim during the congress was also named as the ruling party’s general secretary, a title formerly held by his late father and grandfather, in a move apparently aimed at further bolstering his authority.The statement from Kim's sister suggested she is still handling the North's relations with South Korea, but KCNA referred her as a “vice department director” of the ruling party’s Central Committee, indicating she had been demoted from her previous status as first vice department director.Seen as the most powerful woman in North Korea, Kim Yo Jong has come in and out of prominence under her brother’s rule.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff had said Monday that it had obtained intelligence showing a North Korean military parade in Pyongyang on Sunday night and was checking whether it was an official event or a rehearsal.“We are only holding a military parade in the capital city, not military exercises targeting anybody nor launch of anything. Why do they take trouble craning their neck to follow what’s happening in the (North)?,” Kim Yo Jong said.“The (South Koreans) are a truly weird group hard to understand. They are the idiot and top the world’s list in misbehavior as they are only keen on things provoking world laughter.”North Korean state TV has not shown a military parade as of Wednesday morning. During its last military parade in October, the North unveiled a series of new strategic weapons, including what appeared to be its biggest-yet intercontinental ballistic missile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-ends-party-meeting-with-calls-for-nuclear-might-101610516894555.html
13-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s impeachment on cards after Mike Pence refuses to invoke 25th amendment||US Vice-President Mike Pence has refused to invoke the 25th amendment of the constitution to remove President Donald Trump from office immediately, but his last act of loyalty may have come too late for his boss, who is rapidly losing the support of top Republicans, some of whom have announced their support for his impeachment to be voted on Wednesday.Pence announced his decision on the 25th amendment in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the House was just about to take a vote on a resolution calling for him to do just that.“I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our constitution,” Pence wrote. “Under our constitution, the 25th amendment is not a means of punishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th amendment in such a manner would set a terrible precedence.”House Democrats went ahead with the vote anyway, and won by 223-205. They will move to consider and pass a resolution on Wednesday to impeach Trump for “incitement of insurrection” for the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by his supporters.Democrats have enough votes to pass the impeachment resolution on their own. But they will be joined by an increasing number of Republicans, outraged by Trump’s actions before and during the riot.Liz Cheney, who is third in seniority House Republican caucus, John Katko, senior-most Republican House committee, Adam Kinzinger and Fred Upton have said they will vote to impeach the president. They could be joined by others as the party leadership is not insisting on a unity vote.The most devastating loss for Trump was the support of Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the upper chamber. He had been one Trump’s close allies. But he is now said to be “pleased” with the impeachment plan, seeing an opportunity there to purge him from the party, The New York Times reported. Trump could be convicted by the Senate without McConnell’s support.Democrats have named their impeachment managers to present their case. They also released a report in support of the impeachment. “President Trump committed a high crime and misdemeanor against the nation by inciting an insurrection at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.” it said. “The facts establish that he is unfit to remain in office a single day longer and warrant the immediate impeachment of President Trump.”Trump struck defiant note in a series of remarks on Tuesday. He defended his January 6 remarks, which triggered the supporters, as “totally appropriated” and sought to characterise the impeachment as a continuation of the “witch hunt” that led to his first impeachment in December 2019. In Texas, he said he will survive the 25th amendment, but warned that the episode “will come back to haunt Joe Biden and the Biden administration”.Investigations into the Capitol attack are growing “unprecedented” in scope. The FBI and the justice department said more than 160 cases are being investigated with more to follow. Charges being considered range from forcible entry into the premises, to assaulting officials, to sedition and conspiracy.The US military’s joints chiefs of staff issued a statement condemning the January 6 attack, saying, “We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.”The statement added, “On January 20, 2021, in accordance with the constitution, confirmed by the states and the courts, and certified by Congress, President-elect Biden will be inaugurated and will become our 46th commander in chief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-impeachment-on-cards-after-mike-pence-refuses-to-invoke-25th-amendment-101610517081826.html
13-01-2021||World||Meet German chancellor Angela Merkel’s potential successors||Germany’s political future will start to take shape when 1,001 delegates from Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union pick a new leader at a virtual congress on Saturday.The winner of a tight three-way race will be in prime position to run as the conservative bloc’s chancellor candidate, but there are two other contenders who might do better with voters. The messy process will set up a tense few months for Germany’s strongest political group.Here’s a look at the top contenders from the CDU and its CSU sister party to succeed Merkel after the Sept. 26 national election:Armin Laschet, the Continuity CandidateA Merkel ally and defender of her migration policy, Laschet has governed Germany’s most-populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia since he ousted the Social Democrats in 2017. That gives him a significant power base as head of the CDU’s biggest regional chapter.The 59-year-old is a moderate committed to European integration and the most likely to protect and foster Merkel’s legacy. However, his political star has faded during the coronavirus pandemic. NRW is one of the hardest-hit states and his initial, more laissez-faire approach was badly received by some voters.In the ruthless Berlin political arena, Laschet is untested. If he wins Saturday’s vote, his supporters are hoping he doesn’t wilt in the same way as a party colleague who struggled with the transition from the state level to the federal stage: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Merkel’s handpicked successor took over as party chief in 2018 but faltered under the pressure and decided to step aside.Friedrich Merz, Merkel’s NemesisAt 65 the oldest of the candidates, Merz is a long-time Merkel rival and has portrayed himself as a challenger to the CDU establishment she dominates. A champion of the party’s conservative, pro-industrial wing, moderates view him as a relic of a back-slapping, old-boy’s club that belongs in the past.After having his political career eclipsed by the chancellor, Merz stormed back onto the scene in 2018 in an attempt to take control of the party, only to be thwarted in a close contest by Kramp-Karrenbauer. A corporate lawyer, he returned temporarily to his job at BlackRock Inc. before mounting his latest bid for Germany’s top political post.Merz -- who chaired the CDU/CSU’s parliamentary group from 2000 to 2002 -- has the backing of the party’s youth wing and is relatively popular among the CDU rank and file. However, the fact that he is not widely embraced by the broader electorate could scupper his chances.Norbert Roettgen, the Rebel ReturnedThe chairman of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee has the dubious distinction of being the only cabinet member whom Merkel fired outright.A former protege of the chancellor, Roettgen’s ambition got the better of him when he secured the leadership of the CDU in NRW in 2010 -- notably by defeating Laschet. But he failed badly against the SPD in a regional vote two years later and refused to give up his post as environment minister at the national level. That act of hubris triggered his ouster.In the years since, the 55-year-old moderate has built a reputation as something of a party rebel. He led a revolt among CDU lawmakers against Merkel’s tolerance of China’s Huawei Technologies Co. and disagreed with her backing for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline connecting Germany and Russia.While a long shot, he could be a compromise candidate who looks like a break with Merkel without a hard shift to the right. In the weeks leading up to the contest, he has mounted a savvy media campaign that appears to have boosted his chances of pulling off an upset.Markus Soeder, the Bavarian WildcardBavaria Premier Soeder, head of the CDU’s sister party in the prosperous southern state, is consistently ranked as one of Germany’s most popular politicians.That means he could be the conservative bloc’s most potent weapon for September’s national vote, although he has repeatedly said he intends to stay put. His chances could increase if Laschet or Roettgen win, while Merz would almost certainly want the chancellor candidacy for himself.The fact remains, however, that only two CSU chiefs have contested the chancellorship since World War II and both lost.Once a party rabble-rouser, 54-year-old Soeder has morphed into a dominant leader of his home state, becoming premier in 2018 and CSU chairman a year later.He improved his standing among conservatives at the CDU party conference in 2018, when he brought delegates to their feet with a punchy speech that overshadowed Kramp-Karrenbauer’s weaker performance. He has also been a high-profile presence during the pandemic, consistently pushing for tougher restrictions.Jens Spahn, the Young PretenderHealth Minister Spahn removed himself from the CDU leadership race early on and threw his backing behind Laschet. Since then, what many voters perceive as his competent handling of the coronavirus pandemic has burnished his reputation. He even overtook Merkel in one ranking published in late December.After gauging support among party officials for a possible chancellorship bid, Spahn has said he currently has no plans to run.The openly gay 40-year-old’s ambitions were clear when he put his hat in the ring in 2018 as a candidate for CDU leader with nothing to lose. Although he finished third, he got much of the positive media attention.A standard-bearer of the party’s right wing, Spahn made a name for himself with attacks on Merkel over her handling of the euro crisis and the influx of migrants in 2015. Perceived problems with Germany’s rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine could hinder his progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meet-german-chancellor-angela-merkel-s-potential-successors-101610516855848.html

It's actually against Republicans. I have talked to some of my colleagues -- I don't want to say who -- but they have had death threats,” Khanna told CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin."People who have voted for certification, they are facing the threats of violence. So, this is a terrible situation for many people who are serving, and it crosses party lines," the Democratic leader from California said.A Joint Session of the US Congress on January 6 formally certified the Electoral College victory of Biden as the next US President and Kamala Harris as the Vice President in the November 3 election.The Electoral College votes were approved after both the Senate and the House of Representatives rejected objections raised by the Republicans to the votes in the states of Pennsylvania and Arizona.Biden, a Democrat, received 306 votes while Trump, a Republican, got 232. To win the race for the White House, a candidate should garner at least 270 Electoral College votes out of the 538 up for grabs.Responding to a question on Tuesday, Khanna said the argument of President Donald Trump that the impeachment move is causing tremendous damage to the country does not hold logic."It says if someone commits a crime, robs a bank, and then says, well, the person to blame is the police for arresting them or the prosecution for holding them accountable,” he said.The US House of Representatives is all set to vote on articles of impeachment against President Trump on Wednesday. Trump has been charged with 'incitement of insurrection' for his actions on January 6 when he delivered a speech inciting his supporters to lay siege to the Capitol, an action that temporarily halted the counting of Electoral College votes and resulted in the deaths of five individuals, including an officer of the US Capitol Police.“What we need is accountability for the act, and then we do need to figure out how we start to stitch this country together. And, Brooke, it's not going to be easy, because the reality is, there is still a large base of Donald Trump supporters in these constituencies who believe him,” Khanna added.“We have to be candid about that, that this country is divided. And the question is, how are we going to have a peaceful transition of power and then convince a chunk of that base that it's time to heal this country?” he said.On the eve of the impeachment vote, Khanna said Republicans are in a tough spot right."They're facing enormous pressure. And I think many of them are grappling with their conscience, and then what some of the base and constituency is demanding,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congressmen-who-voted-for-certification-of-elections-facing-threats-ro-khanna-101610516528576.html
13-01-2021||World||Challenging outlook for airlines despite vaccine progress: IATA||The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects the industry to turn cash positive this year but not until the fourth quarter with the rollout of vaccines gradually giving governments the confidence to reopen markets."We can see light at the end of the tunnel," said Chief Economist Brian Pearce. "But it is still some way away, and the situation is likely to get worse first."While the industry saw some modest improvement in bookings after the vaccine announcement news in the fourth quarter of 2020, the trend was reversed towards the end of December and into the first few days of 2021."We've actually seen quite a sharp drop-off in bookings, which means that the immediate outlook looks pretty challenging," said Pearce citing the impact of spiking virus cases and imposition of further travel restrictions by governments across the world.Bookings for the first quarter of 2021 are down 75 per cent, 82 per cent and 81 per cent year-on-year respectively for January, February and March.At the same point of the fourth quarter of 2020 -- which Pearce said was already weak -- IATA figures show forward bookings were down 71 per cent, 81 per cent and 80 per cent year-on-year respectively for October, November and December.The tough booking outlook comes as the aviation industry continues to experience a reversal of the traffic recovery trend that peaked in the northern hemisphere summer season last year.In early January, the majority of international travel markets are showing very little change from the April 2020 lows, said Pearce adding that while performance of global financial markets suggests the pandemic is over, IATA disagrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/challenging-outlook-for-airlines-despite-vaccine-progress-iata-101610516444425.html
13-01-2021||World||Trump's Republican wall eroding ahead of impeachment vote||Republicans offered only modest reproach when President Donald Trump said there were “very fine people” on both sides of a white supremacist rally. They stayed in line when Trump was caught pressuring a foreign leader and later defended his handling of a deadly pandemic.But with a sudden force, the wall of Republican support that has enabled Trump to weather a seemingly endless series of crises is beginning to erode.Trump's weakened standing among his own party will come into sharper focus on Wednesday when the House is expected to impeach the president for inciting a riot at the U.S. Capitol last week. A handful of Republicans have already said they'll join the effort, a number that could grow as the vote nears.The choice facing Republicans isn't just about the immediate fate of Trump, who has just seven days left in his presidency. It's about whether the party's elected leaders are ready to move on from Trump, who remains popular with the GOP but is now toxic in much of Washington.How they proceed could determine whether the party remains viable in upcoming elections or splinters in a way that could limit their relevance.“We’re at the moment now where we’re seeing a fracturing, a breaking, because of the unprecedented situation — the sedition, the violence, the death,” said Steve Schmidt, a longtime Republican strategy who left the party because of Trump.The stunning nature of the deadly insurrection — and Trump's role in fueling it — has shaken many lawmakers. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, gave rank-and-file conservatives the green light to abandon Trump in a scathing statement Tuesday evening."There has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution,” she charged.While stunning, the fast-moving developments do not ensure Trump will be forced from office before Democrat Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration. The timing of a Senate trial is unclear and could spill into Biden's presidency.But for the first time, there are real signs that a significant faction of Republicans want to purge Trump from their party.Already, three Trump Cabinet members have resigned in protest. Former Attorney General Bill Barr, who left the White House less than a month ago, accused his former boss of a “betrayal of his office.”It took almost a week for Vice President Mike Pence, whose relationship with Trump has soured considerably since he and his family were forced into hiding during the Capitol siege, to publicly declare he would not to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump from office.The president still enjoys some level of Republican support. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a top Trump ally just honored this week at the White House, refused on Tuesday to concede that President-elect Joe Biden won the election outright, the same demonstrable falsehood that sparked the riot.Trump emerged from his White House fortress for the first time since the riots for a trip to the wall his administration built along the Texas border. As he left Washington, he was careful to insist “we want no violence," but denied any responsibility for the insurrection.Once he reached the border, his remarks to a small crowd were fairly muted. In the end, he spoke for just 21 minutes and spent less than 45 minutes on the ground in what was expected to be the final trip of his presidency.Before leaving, he offered an ominous warning to Democrats leading the charge to remove him from office: “Be careful what you wish for.”That veiled threat came as the nation — and members of Congress — braced for the potential of more violence ahead of Biden's inauguration. The FBI warned this week of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington.Capitol security officials made the extraordinary decision to require members of Congress to pass through metal detectors to enter the House chamber beginning on Tuesday, although some Republicans resisted the new rule.It's unclear whether the chaos in Washington represents an existential threat to the party, but it almost certainly threatens to undermine the GOP's short-term political goals.Several major corporations, many of them reliably Republican donors, have promised to stop sending political donations to any of the 147 Republicans who perpetuated Trump's false claims of election fraud by voting to reject Biden's victory last week.The fundraising challenge comes at a bad time for the GOP. History suggests that the Republican Party, as the minority party in Washington, should regain control of the House or Senate in 2022.At the same time, a collection of ambitious Republicans are trying to position themselves to run for the White House in 2024. They are also contending with Trump's legacy.One of them, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, reminded reporters on Tuesday that he's condemned the Trump presidency from the very beginning.“I’ve been in the same place I’ve been for the whole four years. A lot of people have just changed their position,” Hogan said, while vowing not to leave the GOP. “I don’t want to leave the party and let these people who did a hostile takeover four years ago take over.”Despite Hogan's confidence, a significant portion of the Republican Party’s political base remains deeply loyal to the president, and has already shown a willingness to attack anyone — especially Republicans — who is not. That helps explain why two other 2024 prospects, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, voted to reject Biden's victory last week, even after the uprising.“Republican leaders do not know how to move forward,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz said. “Everybody’s afraid that Donald Trump will tell people to come after them, but they also realize they’re losing the center of America. They’re trapped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-republican-wall-eroding-ahead-of-impeachment-vote-101610515371106.html
13-01-2021||World||EU to initiate launcher alliance to enhance space autonomy||The European Space Program needs a European launcher alliance to ensure independent access to space, European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton said Tuesday.The launcher alliance will be initiated in the next few months, said Breton, who delivered a keynote speech at the European Space Conference in Brussels, Belgium.The European Union (EU) needs to develop a "more offensive, aggressive, coherent global strategy" about the launchers, according to the commissioner.French launcher Ariane and Italian launcher Vega, although competitive on the global space market, might not be able to rival non-EU competitors in the future."The standards for launchers are currently being redefined outside of Europe. We all know that. We must ask ourselves, will our current approach successfully get us to 2050?" Breton said.Calling for a reflection over the disruptions in the implementation of the space programs, the commissioner preferred fast reaction and intensified discussions about how to keep the EU's position as a key player on the global space stage.Breton said he will gather relative actors in the next months to initiate a European launcher alliance to jointly define with the European Space Agency, the member states, the European parliament and the industry "a common road map for the next generation of launchers and technologies relevant to ensure an autonomous access to space."Space autonomy is "not about closing the door to our partners. It is just about developing and maintaining our infrastructures, technologies, skills, competencies, and reducing critical dependencies on third countries, so we can rely on our own if necessary," he added.Addressing the conference on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel stressed that space action is "at the heart of" European strategic autonomy."Less dependence, more influence," he added.The EU plans to spend Euros 14.9 billion (USD 18.2 billion) in the space program in 2021-2027, which will help step up support for a space industrial base from data to the Internet of Things, broadband, Earth observation and launch systems, Michel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-initiate-launcher-alliance-to-enhance-space-autonomy-101610515606543.html
13-01-2021||World||US Supreme Court clears way for first federal execution of a female inmate||The US Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Justice Department to carry out the first execution of a female death-row inmate in almost seven decades.The rulings, handed down just after midnight on Wednesday, allow the federal Bureau of Prisons to proceed with the execution of Lisa Montgomery.The court lifted an injunction that had been put in place by the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals that had temporarily halted Montgomery’s execution. It came hours after the Supreme Court also lifted a separate injunction by the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.Montgomery is scheduled to be put to death at the federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana.Her lawyers have argued she is not mentally competent and should not be executed. They say she suffered from years of physical and emotional abuse and is severely mentally ill.Lisa Montgomery faced execution Tuesday for killing 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then cut the baby girl from the womb with a kitchen knife. Montgomery took the child with her and attempted to pass the girl off as her own.But an appeals court granted a stay of execution Tuesday, shortly after another appeals court lifted an Indiana judge's ruling that found she was likely mentally ill and couldn't comprehend she would be put to death. If a higher court puts the execution back on, Montgomery, the only female on federal death row, would receive a lethal injection at a federal prison complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. By Tuesday night, the Supreme Court lifted a separate injunction that was put in place by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.Separately, a federal judge for the U.S. District of Columbia halted the scheduled executions later this week of Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs in a ruling Tuesday. Johnson, convicted of killing seven people related to his drug trafficking in Virginia, and Higgs, convicted of ordering the murders of three women in Maryland, both tested positive for COVID-19 last month.Delays of any of this week's scheduled executions beyond Biden’s inauguration next Tuesday would likely mean they will not happen any time soon, or ever, since a Biden administration is expected to oppose carrying out federal death sentences.One of Montgomery’s lawyers, Kelley Henry, told The Associated Press Tuesday morning that her client arrived at the Terre Haute facility late Monday night from a Texas prison and that, because there are no facilities for female inmates, she was being kept in a cell in the execution-chamber building itself.“I don’t believe she has any rational comprehension of what’s going on at all,” Henry said.Montgomery has done needle-point in prison, making gloves, hats and other knitted items as gifts for her lawyers and others, Henry said. She hasn’t been able to continue that hobby or read since her glasses were taken away from her out of concern she could kill herself.“All of her coping mechanisms were taken away from her when they locked her down” in October when she was informed she had an execution date, Henry said.Montgomery’s legal team says she suffered “sexual torture,” including gang rapes, as a child, permanently scarring her emotionally and exacerbating mental-health issues that ran in her family.At trial, prosecutors accused Montgomery of faking mental illness, noting that her killing of Stinnett was premeditated and included meticulous planning, including online research on how to perform a C-section.Henry balked at that idea, citing extensive testing and brain scans that supported the diagnosis of mental illness.“You can’t fake brain scans that show the brain damage,” she said.Henry said the issue at the core of the legal arguments are not whether she knew the killing was wrong in 2004 but whether she fully grasps why she is slated to be executed now.In his ruling on a stay, U.S. District Judge James Patrick Hanlon in Terre Haute cited defense experts who alleged Montgomery suffered from depression, borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.Montgomery, the judge wrote, also suffered around the time of the killing from an extremely rare condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman’s false belief she is pregnant triggers hormonal and physical changes as if she was actually pregnant.Montgomery also experiences delusions and hallucinations, believing God spoke with her through connect-the-dot puzzles, the judge said, citing defense experts.“The record before the Court contains ample evidence that Ms. Montgomery’s current mental state is so divorced from reality that she cannot rationally understand the government’s rationale for her execution,” the judge said.The government has acknowledged Montgomery’s mental issues but disputes that she can’t comprehend that she is scheduled for execution for killing another person because of them.Details of the crime at times left jurors in tears during her trial.Prosecutors told the jury Montgomery drove about 170 miles (274 kilometers) from her Melvern, Kansas, farmhouse to the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore under the guise of adopting a rat terrier puppy from Stinnett. She strangled Stinnett performing a crude cesarean and fleeing with the baby.Prosecutors said Stinnett regained consciousness and tried to defend herself as Montgomery used a kitchen knife to cut the baby girl from her womb. Later that day, Montgomery called her husband to pick her up in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant in Topeka, Kansas, telling him she had delivered the baby earlier in the day at a nearby birthing center.Montgomery was arrested the next day after showing off the premature infant, Victoria Jo, who is now 16 years old and hasn’t spoken publicly about the tragedy.Prosecutors said the motive was that Montgomery’s ex-husband knew she had undergone a tubal ligation that made her sterile and planned to reveal she was lying about being pregnant in an effort to get custody of two of their four children. Needing a baby before a fast-approaching court date, Montgomery turned her focus on Stinnett, whom she had met at dog shows.Anti-death penalty groups said Trump was pushing for executions prior to the November election in a cynical bid to burnish a reputation as a law-and-order leader.The last woman executed by the federal government was Bonnie Brown Heady on Dec. 18, 1953, for the kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old boy in Missouri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-clears-way-for-first-federal-execution-of-a-female-inmate-101610514776507.html
13-01-2021||World||‘No Regrets’: US Capitol rioter Brandon Fellows tells his story from inside||Brandon Fellows has never attended a Trump rally before last week. He said he was motivated to drive to Washington after seeing a tweet from the president. “Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” President Donald Trump wrote on Dec. 19. “Be there, will be wild!”Fellows didn’t know about a planned march that would eventually overtake the U.S. Capitol. He said he had simply come to see Trump give a speech.But within hours of watching Trump’s speech, Fellows had his feet propped up on a table in the office of a U.S. Senator, smoking a joint. He roamed the halls of the Capitol, heckled police officers and posted videos along the way on Snapchat.“I have no regrets,” said Fellows, a 26-year-old former grocery store worker from upstate New York who now makes money cutting trees and repairing chimneys. “I didn’t hurt anyone, I didn’t break anything. I did trespass though, I guess.”Indeed, in the days since the upheaval, Fellows said his profile on the dating app Bumble is “blowing up” after he posted pictures of himself at the Capitol.Fellows was among hundreds of Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6, forcing Vice President Michael Pence, members of Congress and their staffs into hiding. Five people died in the melee, including a rioter who was shot by police and a Capitol Police officer from unspecified injuries suffered during an altercation with the intruders.Fellows’s story provides a detailed account of how one Trump supporter ended up participating in the Capitol riot, an event that has spawned mass condemnation and prompted House Democrats to pursue impeachment for a second time in less than two years.His story also offers a real-world example of a Trump supporter who absorbed false information on social media and heeded the president’s call to take action. It’s an illustration of why so many technology companies have taken steps since the Capitol riot to crack down on conspiracies that have proliferated on its platforms, including Twitter’s ban on Trump’s account.Fellows, who lives in a converted school bus, said he stopped working last spring because of fears of Covid-19. But he said he became disillusioned when New York state denied him unemployment benefits. “For awhile, in early March and April, I was super poor,” he said.Fellows said he gets much of his news from conservative commentators on YouTube, including Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder. He said he has also started watching Newsmax and One America News, which have both promoted false claims of a rigged election.He said his political views have created friction with his family, so much so that on Christmas Day only his grandparents invited him to dinner. They asked him to eat on his bus because he didn’t take Covid-19 seriously enough, he said.At the Capitol, he said, even though many of the rioters were people he wouldn’t normally get along with, it “felt like family.”“We were there for one common cause, which is making a statement that the government is crushing down on us,” he said.His stepfather of 14 years, Timothy Monroe, said he wasn’t surprised when he learned that Fellows was inside the Capitol. “He knows what he believes,” Monroe said. “You can’t really change it with any kind of reality.”Fellows said he came to D.C. in part because he believes that the election was rigged. But his primary motivation was his anger at government measures to prevent Covid-19, such as lockdowns of restaurants and gyms.On Jan. 6, Fellows said he arrived outside of the Ellipse, a park adjacent to the White House, just after 1 a.m. He was one of the first people in line to get into Trump’s rally and sat just five rows away from where the president spoke, video shows. Fellows came prepared for the cold weather, wearing snow pants, a leather jacket with an American flag emblazoned on the back and a knit hat that resembles a knight’s helmet and beard.“This is the last stand,” Fellows said, in an interview with a Bloomberg News reporter prior to Trump’s speech. “I feel like I’ve seen a lot of the election fraud evidence, and I don’t understand why nothing is being done.” Trump’s claims of election fraud in the Nov. 3 election have been rejected by state and federal courts, as well as some members of his own party.Following the conclusion of Trump’s speech, Fellows joined in on the march on Pennsylvania Avenue, headed toward the Capitol. “I was like ‘Oh cool, there’s gonna be a march,’” he said. “I’ve never been in a march.”By the time he arrived, he said the barriers protecting the perimeter had already been overrun. As he was scaling a wall to reach the Senate side of the Capitol, he said he was thinking, “I’m not missing this, this is history.” Fellows helped others climb over the wall, videos show.Fellows said he watched a fellow Trump supporter bashing in a door at the Capitol with a cane and eventually break through the door. A crowd of rioters pushed through only to be pushed back outside by police officers. Once the building was overrun, he said he initially hesitated before going in but did so after hearing that people inside weren’t being arrested. He got in through a broken window.In the 30 minutes or so he was in the Capitol, he filmed dozens of videos and posted them on Snapchat.In one of them, which was reviewed by Bloomberg News, he heckled Capitol Police officers who weren’t wearing helmets.“Where’s your helmet, bro?” Fellows asked an officer. “I wasn’t issued one, because they ran out,” the officer replied.“They don’t care about you? Are you guys rookies, is that why?” Fellows shot back. “I’ve been here eight years,” the officer said. “Pretty cool what happened here today,” Fellows replied.Another video shows his muddy boots propped on a table in Senator Jeff Merkley’s office, where Fellows said he took two puffs from a joint someone handed to him. “This one is going to get me incriminated,” Fellows said of the video in Merkley’s office.In a video posted to Twitter, Merkley surveyed the damage in his office in which a door was smashed “off its hinges” and artwork was torn from the wall. “It was unlocked, they could have simply opened the door,” Merkley said. “So count this office trashed.”After leaving Merkley’s office, Fellows said he wandered the Capitol and asked a police officer for directions to the National Statuary Hall. The police officer explained that the statues represent each state and provided directions on how to get there, according to Fellows’s video of the encounter. “Dude, you’re super cool,” Fellows said.Fellows’s interactions with police officers inside the Capitol led him to believe there wouldn’t be consequences for going inside. “Did I think I was going to get in trouble?” Fellows said. “Uh, no.”After leaving the Capitol, Fellows posed for pictures next to a line of police officers in riot gear and on an abandoned police motorcycle.He said he is planning to return to Washington for more protests surrounding President-Elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, and he predicted there would be more violence. The FBI issued a warning that there are plans for armed protests in D.C. and at all 50 state capitals in the days leading up to the inauguration.“Obviously Trump started a movement in a way, but I think we started something even bigger by doing this,” Fellows said. But now the law enforcement is rounding up others who participated in the Capitol intrusion, he believes he too may be arrested.“Do you think I’m going to go to federal prison?” Fellows asked. “I was told federal prison is not fun.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-regrets-us-capitol-rioter-brandon-fellows-tells-his-story-from-inside-101610514887266.html
13-01-2021||World||Demoted? Pushed aside? Fate of Kim Jong Un's sister unclear||Where is Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s influential sister?That is a question many who watch the cloistered, nuclear-armed country are wondering after she failed to appear in absolute leader Kim Jong Un’s newly released lineup for the country’s powerful Politburo in recent days.Some say Kim Jong Un may have demoted his sister over general policy failures. Others, however, believe he could be worried about her rapid rise and increasingly high profile as he tries to bolster his domestic authority in the face of growing economic challenges.Rumors that Kim Yo Jong is her brother’s heir apparent could be dangerous because they "raise the issue of Kim’s hold on power and health inside North Korea," said Oh Gyeong-seob, an analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. This, he said, is why Kim Jong Un is slowing down her rise in power.The development is a surprise because Kim Yo Jong, who became an alternate member of the Politburo last year, was widely expected to receive a full bureau membership during a ruling Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday. A Politburo membership is viewed as crucial for high-level officials hoping to thrive in Kim Jong Un's government because he's made key decisions at bureau meetings, including the 2013 move to execute his powerful uncle Jang Song Taek, and the 2012 purge of military chief Ri Yong Ho.When the eight-day congress, the first of its kind since 2016, opened last week, Kim Yo Jong, who is thought to be about 32, sat on the leadership podium, standing out amid the often elderly, overwhelmingly male party cadres. But when the congress on Monday announced a list of 30 alternate and full members of the Politburo, including the 37-year-old Kim Jong Un, her name wasn’t there.Kim Yo Jong hasn't been purged or forced to quit politics, a fate that some officials have met under Kim Jong Un, and she still retains her membership in the party’s Central Committee, also a high-level body. But when she released a statement criticizing South Korea on Wednesday, state media identified her as a “vice department director” of the party, a lower rank than her previous title of “first vice department director.”Kim Jong Un is urging his 25 million people to rally behind his leadership to overcome what he has called his nation's “worst-ever” difficulties. North Korea has faced coronavirus-related economic shocks, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent U.S.-led sanctions over its pursuit of illicit nuclear weapons. During the congress, Kim vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal and build a stronger, self-reliant economy.“The congress’ purpose is to solidify Kim Jong Un’s leadership. If Kim Yo Jong had become a full Politburo member, all eyes would have been on her ... and Kim Jong Un likely felt that as a burden,” Ko Young-hwan, a former deputy head of the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said during a TV news program Monday.Previously little known to outsiders, Kim Yo Jong has soared politically since her brother inherited power after their father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.The current Kims are the third generation of their family to rule North Korea, and their leadership is based on a personality cult established after their grandfather Kim Il Sung founded the country in 1948. Their mythical “paektu” bloodline, named after the North’s most sacred mountain, allows only direct family members to rule the country.Kim Yo Jong rose to international prominence after her brother's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump and other world leaders in 2018 and 2019. In those meetings, her proximity to Kim Jong Un sparked speculation that she was serving as her brother’s chief of staff.In South Korea, she built an image as “a peace messenger” after she attended the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, becoming the first member of the North’s ruling family to visit the South.Last year, however, she abruptly changed course by launching harsh diatribes against South Korea and putting pressure on the United States to make concessions amid deadlocked nuclear diplomacy. North Korea’s state media said she was in charge of relations with South Korea, and outside experts speculated that she might be handing U.S. affairs as well.In her statement on Wednesday, she slammed South Korea for provoking the North by announcing that it had detected intelligence that North Korea held a military parade or a rehearsal for such a parade this week.When unconfirmed global rumors about Kim Jong Un’s health rose last year, some observers said Kim Yo Jong was next in line to rule North Korea if her brother became incapacitated. South Korea’s spy agency said later that she was virtually the North’s No. 2 official but hadn’t been anointed as her brother’s heir.“Kim Jong Un likely held his sister responsible for worsened (external) ties, as she had no achievements in relations with the US and South Korea,” said Kim Yeol Soo, an analyst with South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.Whatever the reason for her apparent loss of the Politburo job, many experts say her political clout likely remains unchanged thanks to her direct link to the paektu bloodline. There's also a feeling that Kim Jong Un could eventually give her another high-profile job.Oh, the analyst, said Kim Yo Jong is likely the second-most powerful woman in North Korean history after Kim Song Ae, the late second wife of Kim Il Sung.“Kim Yo Jong can meet and talk to Kim Jong Un freely anytime ... so we can’t help saying that she has a tremendous influence,” Oh said. “As she gets older, her roles will be bigger."But, he added, her rise could end if she covets more power. “She has to be careful about that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/demoted-pushed-aside-fate-of-kim-jong-un-s-sister-unclear-101610514167470.html
13-01-2021||World||US to require negative Covid-19 tests for arriving international air passengers||Nearly all air travelers will need to present a negative coronavirus test to enter the United States under expanded test testing requirements announced on Tuesday.Under the rules taking effect Jan. 26, nearly all travelers including US citizens must show a negative test within three days of departure or documentation of recovery from Covid-19, under an order signed by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield.Also Read: These 10 countries are recording highest daily Covid-19 casesAll travelers aged 2 and older must comply except passengers who are only transiting through the United States. The CDC will also consider waivers of testing requirements for airlines flying to countries with little or no testing capacity, including some places in the Caribbean.The order dramatically broadens a requirement imposed on Dec. 28 for travelers arriving from the UK as a more transmissible variant of the virus circulated there.In an interview, Marty Cetron, director of CDC's global migration and quarantine division, said, "We to have really up the ante... We have to take these mutations seriously."Canada imposed similar rules for nearly all international arrivals starting Jan. 7, as have many other countries.Click here for Covid-19 live updatesThe CDC confirmed last week it had circulated a proposal to expand the testing requirement after discussing the idea for weeks. Some senior White House officials opposed it, and officials briefed on the matter said last week that US public health officials had essentially given up winning approval until President-elect Joe Biden took office.At a White House meeting on Monday, Redfield again made an urgent case to adopt the testing requirements, people briefed on the meeting said. He raised concerns that vaccines could potentially not be effective against virus variants.Airlines for America, an industry trade group, praised the testing plan. Airlines had also wanted a ban to be dropped on most non-US visitors who have recently been in Brazil and most of Europe, but the White House opted not to end it.Cetron said the entry restrictions should "be actively reconsidered."Cetron confirmed the CDC has discussed the idea of expanding the testing requirement to domestic US flights but emphasized the new order only applies to international flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-require-negative-covid-19-tests-for-arriving-international-air-passengers-101610511639188.html

13-01-2021||World||Indonesia starts emergency use of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac||Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday received the first shot of a Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine after Indonesia approved it for emergency use and began efforts to vaccine millions of people in the world’s fourth most populated country.After Widodo, top military, police and medical officials were vaccinated, as well as the secretary of the Indonesian Ulema Council, the clerical body that last week had ruled the vaccine was halal and could be taken by Muslims.“This vaccine is the instrument we can use to protect us. But more importantly, the vaccine is the instrument to protect our family, our neighbor, Indonesian people and the human civilization,” Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Wednesday.“This vaccine is given to achieve herd immunity. All 70% of the world’s people must be vaccinated for that to be achieved. The participation of all Indonesians will greatly determine the success of this program,” he said.Conditional use of the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. vaccine is scheduled to be rolled out in the coming months with health care workers, civil servants and other at-risk populations prioritized first. It will be free for all Indonesian citizens.For Indonesia to vaccinate two-thirds of its population, 181.5 million people, to reach herd immunity, Sadikin said the two-shot vaccine would require almost 427 million doses, including the estimate that 15% may be wasted.Distribution will not be easy in the vast archipelago where transportation and infrastructure are inadequate in places. Health officials have cited concerns about keeping the vaccine refrigerated at the required 36–46 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain its safety and effectiveness.“We know that the cold-chain distribution is not complete. This is the obstacle,” Sadikin said Tuesday. “The cold-chain facilities are not enough so we are still distributing some of the vaccines. We are worried.”Indonesia received its first shipment of the Sinovac vaccines on Dec. 6 and locked it in cold storage surrounded by armed guards. Authorities began distributing the vaccines to key locations around the country while awaiting emergency use authorization.The vaccine was cleared for emergency use based on clinical trial data and after the Indonesian Ulema Council declared the vaccine holy and halal.Indonesia’s vaccination program is the first large-scale use of the Sinovac vaccine outside of China.Indonesia has recorded more than 846,000 cases of the virus, including over 24,600 deaths.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

13-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un vows to strengthen North Korea's nuclear arsenal||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed all-out efforts to bolster his country's nuclear deterrent during a major ruling party meeting where he earlier laid out plans to work toward salvaging the broken economy.Separately, Kim’s powerful sister criticized South Korea’s military for saying it had seen an apparent military parade taking place in Pyongyang. Kim Yo Jong, who was described last year as being in charge of inter-Korean relations, said in a statement Wednesday that such close tracking proved Seoul’s “hostile approach” toward its rival.The eight-day Workers’ Party congress that ended Tuesday came as Kim Jong Un faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule.Pandemic-related border closures and floods and typhoons that wiped out summer crops further shocked an economy already devastated by mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons program.“While further strengthening our nuclear war deterrent, we need to invest every effort to build the strongest military capabilities,” Kim said during his closing remarks at the congress, which were published by Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency.Kim also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of chemicals and metal industries in a five-year plan. Outside experts say such sectors would be crucial to North Korean hopes to revitalize industrial production that has been decimated by sanctions and halted imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his high-stakes summitry with President Donald Trump. Their diplomacy deteriorated after the collapse of their talks in Vietnam in February 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.During the congress, Kim doubled down on his ambitions to expand the North’s military capabilities and announced plans to develop more sophisticated nuclear assets, including longer-range missiles that could potentially target the American homeland, spy satellites, new tactical nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered submarines.In comments that were apparently aimed at pressuring the incoming Biden administration, Kim labeled the United States as the North’s “principal enemy” and said the fate of bilateral relations would depend on whether Washington discards what Pyongyang perceives as hostile policies.The statement from Kim's sister indicated she is still handling the North's relations with South Korea, but KCNA referred her as a “vice department director” of the ruling party’s Central Committee, indicating she had been demoted from her previous status as first vice department director.Seen as the most powerful woman in North Korea, Kim Yo Jong has come in and out of prominence under her brother’s rule.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff had said Monday that it had obtained intelligence showing a North Korean military parade in Pyongyang on Sunday night and was checking whether it was an official event or a rehearsal.“We are only holding a military parade in the capital city, not military exercises targeting anybody nor launch of anything. Why do they take trouble craning their neck to follow what’s happening in the (North)?,” Kim Yo Jong said.“The (South Koreans) are a truly weird group hard to understand. They are the idiot and top the world’s list in misbehavior as they are only keen on things provoking world laughter.”North Korean state TV has not shown a military parade as of Wednesday morning. During its last military parade in October, the North unveiled a series of new strategic weapons, including what appeared to be its biggest-yet intercontinental ballistic missile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-vows-to-strengthen-north-korea-s-nuclear-arsenal-101610500807603.html

We're a rule of law country."The remarks came during an interview that was arranged with Cook at Apple headquarters in Silicon Valley to discuss an announcement being made by the company on Wednesday.Cook did not specifically mention Trump, but said that anyone with a role in the insurrection should be held accountable under the law."I don't think we should let it go," Cook said."This is something we've got to be serious about. I think holding people accountable is important."Tech giants Amazon, Apple and Google have all cut ties with Parler, the social media platform popular with some conservatives.The three mega-corporations have accused the platform of continuing to post messages inciting violence even after the Jan 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters of Trump.Twitter has suspended the president's main account for the same reason.Trump's accounts have also been suspended by other big social media outlets including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitch in the wake of the violence in the Capitol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-chief-wants-us-capitol-attackers-held-accountable-101610500624252.html
13-01-2021||World||US Vice President Pence rejects invoking 25th Amendment to oust Trump||Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday he won’t invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office, writing in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that it’s time for the nation to heal after last week’s attack on the Capitol.Pence’s letter comes in response to a resolution House Democrats will put to a vote Tuesday night urging him to use his constitutional authority to end Trump’s term early. Pence said he’s asking members of Congress to “avoid actions that would further divide and inflame the passions of the moment.”Also Read: House set to give Mike Pence ultimatum before moving to impeach Donald TrumpPence said that the 25th Amendment was designed to address presidential “incapacity or disability” and accused the House of Representatives of playing “political games.” Democrats still plan to vote on non-binding the 25th Amendment resolution, even though Pence said he won’t meet its demand.Democrats have also set up a vote as soon as Wednesday to impeach the president for the second time.“We will act with urgency, because this president represents an imminent threat,” Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues this weekend. “The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this president is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.”Democrats had hoped that Pence - who drew Trump’s ire for rebuffing his calls to reject election results, saying such a move was unconstitutional - would call on the cabinet to immediately remove Trump from power. The president has been widely rebuked for his role stirring last week’s riot at the U.S. Capitol, which left five people dead and dozens more injured.Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said earlier Tuesday she would join with Democrats and vote to impeach the president.“On Jan. 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and stop the counting of presidential electoral votes,” the Wyoming lawmaker said in a statement. “The president of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.”Also Read: Democrats give Mike Pence 24 hours to oust Donald Trump as US PresidentIf Trump is impeached by the House, two-thirds of the Senate would be needed to convict him. Trump escaped removal from office last year when only one Republican senator - Mitt Romney of Utah - voted with Democrats.Even though the Senate probably won’t be able to conclude the trial before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20, Democrats plan to push forward with Trump’s second impeachment because the process could include a vote to prohibit him from again seeking federal office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-mike-pence-rejects-invoking-25th-amendment-to-oust-t-101610500533705.html

Two other accused – Muhammad Salman and Muhammad Ahmed – were convicted for six months. However, four other accused were acquitted for want of evidence,” a court official told PTI.All the suspects were present in the court when the sentence was announced. Strict security measures were taken to handle any protest by the religious elements in the wake of their conviction.Imran Chishti, a government employee working in the Fisheries Department, and other suspects were arrested under terrorism and blasphemy charges following the attack on the Gurdwara last year.They faced charges under sections 295A, 290, 291, 341,506, 148 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code and 7-ATA (anti-terrorism act).According to the FIR, Chishti had incited the Muslim mob in the name of religion.

13-01-2021||World||Mike Pompeo slams Iran for Al-Qaida support on his way out||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of having secret ties with the Al-Qaida network and imposed new sanctions on several senior Iranian officials.Pompeo’s comments come just a week before the Trump administration leaves office and appeared aimed at President-elect Joe Biden’s stated desire to resume negotiations with Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018.In a speech to the National Press Club just, Pompeo attacked Iran for alleged secret ties with Al-Qaida, citing newly declassified intelligence suggesting Tehran harbored the group’s No. 2, Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in August, reportedly by Israeli agents.Shiite-ruled Iran and predominantly Sunni Al-Qaida are not natural allies in the Islamic world and have had a fraught relationship since the Taliban, which harbored bin Laden, took over Afghanistan in 1996. Two years later, Iran accused the Taliban of murdering several of it diplomats in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.Although U.S. officials had previously confirmed the death of al-Masri and his daughter, the widow of Osama bin Laden’s son Hamza, Pompeo’s remarks were the first on-the-record comments supporting the claim.“Today, I can confirm publicly to the world for the first time, his death on Aug. 7 of last year,” Pompeo said. He also alleged that Iran had “closely monitored” Al-Qaida members before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States and had stepped up such activity and had decided to actively support them following the nuclear agreement.Speaking after Pompeo's remarks, two senior US officials told reporters that Iran had facilitated al-Masri's stay in Tehran, including by sending security guards with him on shopping excursions and granting him access to a swimming pool. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence information, spoke on condition of anonymity.Pompeo claimed that ties between Al-Qaida and Iran vastly improved in 2015, when the Obama administration, along with France, Germany and Britain, were finalizing the nuclear deal. He offered no evidence for the claim. Pompeo has been adamantly opposed to the nuclear agreement since he was a member of Congress.“A sea change was happening within the Iran-al-Qaida axis,” Pompeo said. “Iran decided to allow Al-Qaida to establish a new operational headquarters, on the condition that Al-Qaida operatives inside abide by the regime’s rules governing Al-Qaida’s stay inside the country.”He said that since 2015, Iran has given Al-Qaida leaders greater freedom of movement inside Iran and have provided safe havens and logistical support to Al-Qaida. Pompeo asserted that Al-Qaida had now based its leadership in Tehran and was continuing to plot attacks on the US and Western targets from there.Iran has denied all such charges, and did so again on Tuesday.Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh Tuesday condemned Pompeo’s accusations as a "repeat of blaming and fabricating false evidence” against Iran since President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal and began to re-impose sanctions that had been lifted under the accord.Khatibzadeh derided Pompeo's accusations as an indication of the “failure of the maximum pressure campaign” by the Trump administration against Iran, the official IRNA news agency reported. He said Iran has had “a crystal-clear and defendable record” in fighting Al-Qaida and IS terrorism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-slams-iran-for-al-qaida-support-on-his-way-out-101610478857716.html
13-01-2021||World||Brazil researchers report disappointing 50.4% efficacy for China's CoronaVac||A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac showed "general efficacy" of 50.4% in a late-stage trial in Brazil, researchers said on Tuesday, barely enough for regulatory approval and far short of earlier indications.The latest results are a major disappointment for Brazil, as the Chinese vaccine is one of two that the federal government has lined up to begin immunization during the second wave of the world's second-deadliest Covid-19 outbreak.The letdown after a more promising partial data disclosure last week may also contribute to criticism that vaccines developed by Chinese manufacturers are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.Last week, the Brazilian researchers had celebrated results showing 78% efficacy against Covid-19 cases, a rate they have since described as "clinical efficacy."Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo, said the new figure included infections classified as "very mild" because they did not require clinical assistance.Researchers at Butantan delayed announcement of their results three times, blaming a confidentiality clause in a contract with Sinovac.In the meantime, Turkish researchers said last month that CoronaVac was 91.25% effective based on an interim analysis. Indonesia gave the vaccine emergency use approval on Monday based on interim data showing it is 65% effective.Butantan officials said the design of the Brazilian study, focusing on frontline health workers during a severe outbreak in Brazil and including elderly volunteers, made it impossible to compare the results directly with other trials or vaccines.Still, Covid-19 vaccines in use from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc proved to be about 95% effective in preventing illness in their pivotal late-state trials.The disappointing CoronaVac data is the latest setback for vaccination efforts in Brazil, where more than 200,000 people have died since the outbreak began - the worst death toll outside the United States.Brazil's national immunization program currently relies on CoronaVac and the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc - neither of which has received regulatory approval in Brazil.Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, which has stipulated an efficacy rate of at least 50% for vaccines in the pandemic, has already pressed Butantan for more details of its study, after it filed for emergency use authorization on Friday.AstraZeneca failed to deliver active ingredients to Brazil over the weekend, leaving the government scrambling to import finished doses of the vaccine from India to begin inoculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-researchers-report-disappointing-50-4-efficacy-for-china-s-coronavac-101610475117401.html

In 2020, around five million pilgrims from across India took the holy dip at the confluence of River Ganges and Bay of Bengal to celebrate Makar Sankranti, the first major Hindu festival in the Gregorian calendar.The Mamata Banerjee administration has made elaborate arrangements for the mela. For the first time, provisions have been kept so that pilgrims can also take the holy dip sitting in their home (e-snan) and watching the mela, live on the website. Pilgrims can book online a tirtha samagri pack comprising Ganga Jal in a container, prasad and the holy tika.“The court has directed the state government to freely distribute the e-snan kits to pilgrims who opt for it on the mela ground. People can also opt for the e-snan kit sitting in their homes. In that case people have to pay only the delivery charge,” said Chatterjee.Officials said that till Wednesday 100,560 e-snan kits have been delivered to devotees and only 3432 pilgrims are likely to take the holy dip. At least 35 counters have been set up at Sagar Island and Kolkata from where devotees can take the e-snan kit.Till Wednesday afternoon around 780,000 pilgrims had arrived at the mela ground. Last year around 1.5 million had reached by this time.“At least 5.3 lakh pilgrims have been medically screened at 13 entry points and around 23,000 Rapid Antigen Tests have been done. Announcements were being made in eight languages to make the people aware about the safety norms such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” said Arup Biswa, state minister, who along with a few other ministers and MLAs have reached the mela ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-nod-for-ganga-sagar-mela-asks-state-to-distribute-e-snan-kits-101610561718917.html

Work on the Green Ashiyana Resort is taking place on the Haldhibari animal corridor of KNPTR; the state forest department and the local administration are blaming each other for the flouting of the ban. This is the second instance of construction near KNPTR. In July last year, HT had reported about the construction of a building on the Kanchanjuri animal corridor of the park, a UNESCO world heritage site known as the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos. In April, 2019, acting on an application by animal activist Rohit Choudhury, the SC had “restrained” all mining along the southern boundary of KNPTR and in the entire catchment area of rivers/streams and rivulets originating in the Karbi Anglong hill ranges and flowing into the park. “No new construction shall be permitted on private lands which form part of the nine identified animal corridors,” the order said. Despite the SC order, construction is taking place on private land on the animal corridors in and around KNPTR.In September, the central empowered committee of the top court had written to the Assam chief secretary as well as chief wildlife warden, terming the violations a “serious issue” because they amounted to contempt of the court. On January 4, P Sivakumar, director of KNPTR, wrote to the Golaghat deputy commissioner mentioning the construction of the Green Ashiyana Resort on an animal corridor and urging the district administration to take action against it. “The resort has constructed a boundary wall over the stream in the southern side of the resort. During October, 2019, a wild elephant while coming back from the Karbi Anglong area to the park had got stuck up inside the boundary wall enclosures of the resort,” said the letter, a copy of which has been seen by HT. Despite instructions by the forest department to remove the boundary wall over the stream and allow smooth movement of wild animals, the resort authorities didn’t do anything. “The resort is carrying out new construction work on the eastern side. They are not allowing forest personnel to carry out road cum high land work and are trying to {wrest} control over the temple and fishery pond which they have constructed inside,” the letter added. Golaghat deputy commissioner Bibhash Chandra Modi said the administration came to know about the construction just two days ago from the forest department. He said action would be taken against the resort soon and the SC order complied with. “This is a mockery and contempt of the SC order and neither forest department nor civil administration are serious on implementing the order. While the blame game continues, it is the wildlife and the environment which is getting affected. The SC should take action against the KNPTR director as well as the Golaghat DC for clear violation of its order,” said wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury. Owner of the Green Ashiyana Resort, Kishore Hazarika, said he had been in occupation of the property since 2003 and till 2019 he was not informed by either forest officials or the district administration that the area falls in an animal corridor. “All this is part of a vindictive campaign against me. There is no notification yet mentioning that the area is in an animal corridor. And even if that is the case, there should be a comprehensive compensation package if action is taken against me or others who have been staying in the area,” said Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resort-construction-near-kaziranga-national-park-afoot-despite-sc-ban-101610561543266.html
13-01-2021||India||Asaduddin Owaisi helped BJP in Bihar, will do so in WB, UP polls: Sakshi Maharaj||Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Unnao, Sakshi Maharaj on Wednesday mocked All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader Asaduddin Owaisi saying he had helped the BJP in the Bihar assembly elections and would also help in the polls in West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.The assembly election in West Bengal is due in April-May this year while Uttar Pradesh will go to the polls in February-March next year.Sakshi Maharaj was meeting party workers in Saurikh on the Lucknow-Agra expressway. He was on his way to Delhi from Lucknow.“Many thanks to him. May God give him strength and help him. He supported us in Bihar, he will help us in UP and West Bengal elections," the MP told reporters when asked about Owaisi's entry in UP politics.The BJP MP is not the first political leader to claim that Owiasi’s presence in elections helps the saffron party but the AIMIM chief insists that he has no deal with India’s largest political party. Others have often derided him as the “BJP’s B-team”.On Tuesday, Owaisi on Tuesday visited Varanasi where he said that the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a coalition of small parties including the AIMIM and Omprakash Rajbhar’s SBSP, would contest the 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls and put up a strong fight.On January 3, he also forayed into West Bengal in a significant first move to emerge as a threat to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the assembly polls due in West Bengal a few months, Asaduddin Owaisi.Owaisi met a popular young Muslim leader in Kolkata, who, in recent months, has emerged as the most vocal critic of the TMC.The AIMIM contested 24 seats in the Bihar assembly election and won five.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asaduddin-owaisi-helped-bjp-in-bihar-will-do-so-in-wb-up-polls-sakshi-maharaj-101610560206893.html
13-01-2021||India||Pollution in Yamuna under Supreme Court scanner for a second time||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took a second shot at cleaning the polluted Yamuna River by taking suo moto cognizance of significantly high levels of ammonia in water discharged from neighbouring Haryana into the Capital.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) issued a notice to two Central Ministries - Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, governments of states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and National Capital Territory of Delhi to be represented on January 19, the next date of hearing.The Court noted that the Constitution and judicial decisions of the past have given the mandate of setting up Sewage Treatment Plants and stoppage of sewage effluents in surface water to the municipalities. However, as seen in the present petition, the Court said, “It is often found that either the sewage is not treated through a plant before being discharged or the treatment plants are not functional or incapacitated.”The Court directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to prepare a report identifying the municipalities along the stretch of the river which are yet to install sewage treatment plants (STP). “It (CPCB) shall also submit priority-wise list of Municipalities, river stretches adjacent to which have been found to be most polluted,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. The central pollution body will also be at liberty to identify other gaps causing untreated sewerage to be discharged into the river.A similar exercise was undertaken by the Supreme Court in July 1994 by taking suo moto notice of a HT report “And Quiet Flows the Maily Yamuna”. After monitoring the case for 23 years and gaining little success, the apex court on April 24, 2017 transferred the suo moto petition to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).The bench seemed to be aware of this order as it recorded in its order, “It is clarified that the suo moto petition and directions issued herein, shall not in any way dilute any other directions issued by other Court or Tribunal.” The suo moto petition has been titled “Remediation of polluted rivers”What prompted the top court to examine the matter a second time over was a petition filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to stop Haryana government from discharging pollutants into the river. Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora who appeared for DJB pointed out that level of ammonia in the river water flowing through Delhi had reached alarming proportions. On December 25 last year, ammonia concentration in water peaked to 13 ppm as against the permissible limit of 0.5 ppm.Arora said, “The water treatment plants of DJB are able to treat water with ammonia content up to 0.9 ppm. Due to this reason, our plants at Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla are forced to function at nearly 50 per cent capacity. The problem is with Haryana as their STPs do not work. They should not discharge untreated sewerage into the river. Ammonia mixed with chlorine can cause cancer. We cannot supply this water to residents.”DJB in its petition demanded an immediate order against Haryana to stop discharge of pollutants into the river. Haryana was even accused of not releasing the full 450 cusecs of water to Delhi at Wazirabad and demanded an order to that effect. The DJB had in the past written several letters to its Haryana counterpart but no concrete action has been forthcoming.Pointing to the “extremely dire and urgent situation” facing Delhi, DJB in its petition filed by advocate Shadan Farasat said, “The water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrawal, Okhla, Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi may not be able to process/pump any water at all due to the extremely high impurity levels. This would completely disrupt the supply of drinking water in the NCT of Delhi and can potentially plunge it into a humanitarian crisis where many of its residents are unable to access drinking water.”The bench said, “We find that in addition to the issue raised by present petition, it will be appropriate to take suo moto cognizance with regard to the issue of contamination of rivers by sewage effluents and ensure that the mandate is implemented by municipalities as far as discharge of sewage into rivers is concerned…We deem it appropriate at this stage to start with the issue of contamination of river Yamuna.”The Court appointed Arora as amicus curiae to assist them in the suo moto petition. The Court issued notice to Haryana government and CPCB on DJB’s petition and posted it along with the suo moto proceeding on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-in-yamuna-under-supreme-court-scanner-for-a-second-time-101610560472152.html
13-01-2021||India||Supreme Court stays FIRs against Bengal BJP leader Kabir Bose||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed proceedings in two criminal cases lodged against West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Kabir Shankar Bose after the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) told the top court in a sealed cover report that Bose, a CISF protectee, was not present at the incident spot on December 6 last year, where he had allegedly beaten and molested workers of the Trinamool Congress.The protection offered to Bose, comes almost a month after the top court had extended protective cover to senior BJP leaders Arjun Singh, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and two others by ordering no coercive action to be taken in any of the criminal cases lodged against them in the state of West Bengal.Appearing for Bose, senior advocateMahesh Jet hmalani had maintained that the criminal cases were based on false charges leveled against Bose at the behest of his father-in-law Kalyan Banerjee, a senior leader and Member of Parliament belonging to the Trinamool Congress. It was at Jethmalani’s insistence that the court had sought the Special Incident Report prepared by CISF’s Special Security Group that protects his client.On Wednesday, the bench of Justices SK Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy went through the contents of the CISF report submitted in the sealed cover. The bench then issued a notice on Bose’s petition to the West Bengal government and state police. In the meantime, it added, “Proceedings in pursuance to FIR bearing Nos. 400 of 2020 under Sections 341/323/325/326/307/354/504/506/34 IPC and 401 of 2020 under Sections 341/325/354A/34 IPC both dated December 7, 2020 registered with Serampore police station shall remain stayed.”In his petition, Bose stated that TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee was seeking his arrest after he filed for annulment of marriage with Banerjee’s daughter in 2015 and joined BJP. On December 6, Bose’s car was attacked and he was unlawfully restrained from moving out of his house. The FIRs alleged that Bose had caused injuries to the Trinamool workers and allegedly molested a woman. Bose claimed that he was not present in the area where the incident was said to have occurred. The Court was convinced on this count after it saw the “movement register” produced by CISF which maintains log of all protectees.On December 18 last year, the bench issued a notice on Bose’s petition and directed the CISF’s Special Security Group to submit the Special Incident Report in a sealed cover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-firs-against-bengal-bjp-leader-kabir-bose-101610559835374.html

13-01-2021||India||Bird flu: Centre asks states not to ban supply of poultry from other states||New Delhi [India], January 13 (ANI): Amid the spread of bird flu in the ten states across the country, the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying (MFAHD) on Wednesday asked all the states not to ban the supply of poultry and poultry products from other states, stating that it would cause "negative impact" on the poultry industry.Taking note that many states are banning poultry from other states, the MFAHD Ministry in a statement said this would add to the negative impact on the poultry industry, adding that the states were requested to reconsider such a decision.This comes as cases of avian influenza have been confirmed in 10 states."Further, cases of unnatural mortality of birds have been reported in Ganderbal district of Jammu and Kashmir and 4 districts of Jharkhand," the release said."On January 12, 2021, a VC was organised under the chairmanship of Secretary, DAHD and was attended by representatives from 17 states. Through the meeting, states were advised to efficiently manage the spread of Avian Influenza in their respective states in accordance with the Action Plan 2021," the release further said.To deal with the situation the states were asked to coordinate with the department of health and forest and sensitize them about the issue, the ministry said.States were also asked to maintain a sufficient supply of protective equipment and maintain biosecurity measures in poultry farms. The ministry said States were also directed to identify BSL-II labs at the state level for speeding up the identification of infection in the state and timely introduction of control mechanism.The states were also asked to ensure that the infection does not spread among poultry, as it would have a high economic cost for the poultry farmers."It was found that many states are banning the supply of poultry and poultry products from other states. As this would add to the negative impact on the poultry industry, the states were requested to reconsider such a decision. Awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements, seminar etc are being conducted by several states," the release said.The states were encouraged to continue such awareness generation activities with support from their state Directorate of Information and Public Relations and were assured about the availability of funds for such activities.The release said that states should issue advisories on Dos and Don'ts regarding consumption of poultry and eggs, so as to avoid spreading of rumours/ misinformation thereby leading to economic loss for the poultry farmers.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said poultry farms, zoos, water bodies will have to be constantly monitored to contain the disease. He had also asked all states to remain on alert to control the spread of the disease."Bird flu has been confirmed in Kerala, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, UP, MP, Delhi and Maharashtra. Poultry farms, zoos, water bodies have to be constantly monitored to control the spread of bird flu," said PM Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-centre-asks-states-not-to-ban-supply-of-poultry-from-other-states-101610558746006.html
13-01-2021||India||ECI warns Bengal govt staff of action for negligence of duty ahead of polls||The Election Commission of India (ECI) has warned the state’s bureaucrats and senior police officers of stern action in case of dereliction of duty ahead of the crucial 2021 assembly elections in West Bengal.Deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain held a meeting with the district magistrates, superintendents of police and police commissioners of West Bengal to take stock of the poll preparedness in the state. Assembly elections in the state are due in April – May 2021.“The ECI has directed all districts to strictly maintain law and order to ensure free and fair elections. The poll panel has made it clear that strict action would be taken against anyone in case of negligence in duty,” said a senior police officer present at the meeting.The opposition has been frequently raising allegations of deterioration of law and order in the state citing multiple incidents of political violence. The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress had, however, refuted such allegations.West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar too had in the past voiced his concern over the alleged law and order deterioration in the state in several tweets and during his interaction with the media.“The two main issues which were discussed in Wednesday’s meetings were law and order and summary revision of electoral rolls,” said a senior state government official.The Bharatiya Janata Party has already urged the Commission to enforce the Model Code of Conduct at the earliest and deploy central forces well in advance to avert any violence during the campaign period and ensure free and fair elections.“The ECI is aware of the state’s scenario. We have also raised some issues before the ECI. The poll panel will now have to look into them. We have requested that the Model Code of Conduct be enforced at the earliest and that central forces should be deployed so that opposition parties can campaign freely and without any fear,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of BJP’s Bengal unit.The TMC, however, hit back saying that MCC and central forces can come in only after elections are declared.“It seems that Dilip Ghosh doesn’t know anything about the Constitution. The MCC cannot be enforced before the polls are announced. Law-and-order is a state matter. Unless the state wants or elections are announced, central forces can’t be deployed,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.This is Jain's second visit to the state. Earlier he had come to the state in December to take stock of the poll preparedness and even had a meeting with the state's top health officials as polls would be held amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Jain is likely to hold a meeting with some of the state's top bureaucrats on Thursday too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eci-warns-bengal-govt-staff-of-action-for-negligence-of-duty-ahead-of-polls-101610558108380.html
13-01-2021||India||India wants Pfizer to do local study before approval: Official||Any vaccine maker, including Pfizer Inc that has sought emergency-use authorisation for its Covid-19 shot in India, must conduct an additional local study to be considered for the country's immunisation programme, a senior government official told Reuters.Serum Institute of India, the local manufacturer of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University, did a months long local study on more than 1,500 people before seeking and receiving emergency approval on Jan. 3.India, which has reached 10.5 million coronavirus infections - the second highest in the world after the United States - has also approved a homegrown vaccine made by Bharat Biotech ahead of its inoculation campaign which starts on Saturday.Local media have reported that Pfizer had sought to import and distribute its vaccine in India without doing local trials. In early December, it was the first company to seek emergency-use approval in the world's second-most populous country but has not attended subsequent meetings called by Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, according to minutes https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/en/Committees/SEC of the deliberations released on the drugs regulator's website."As of now, the pre-condition for any vaccine to be implemented is that you have to do a bridging trial," Vinod K. Paul, who heads a government panel on vaccine strategy, said in an interview in his office near the parliament building.The government has already distributed 16.5 million doses of the two approved vaccines to states, with a plan to deliver 600 million jabs to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months. Serum Institute has stockpiled 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and says it will raise its monthly output to much more than that now the approval has come.Health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens whose genetic makeup can be different from people in western nations. There are, however, provisions under New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, to waive such trials in certain conditions.A Pfizer spokeswomen had no immediate comment.The Pfizer vaccine, developed in partnership with Germany's BioNTech SE, is already being administered to people in countries such as the United States and Britain. It was not immediately clear if any other countries had asked for similar smaller local trials before approving vaccines developed and tested abroad.Paul said officials have had discussions with Pfizer and Moderna Inc - both U.S. companies have reported more than 90% efficacy for their vaccines - to make the shots in India given its large pharmaceutical capacity. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker.Paul, a paediatrician who had taught at the state-run All India Institute of Medical Sciences, also said Russia's Sputnik V, which is now undergoing last-stage trials after completing a Phase 2 study there, will soon apply for emergency-use approval in the country.No vaccine maker will be given indemnity by the government should something go wrong, Paul said. Serum Institute had written to the government seeking indemnity. AstraZeneca has said it has received such indemnity in many other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wants-pfizer-to-do-local-study-before-approval-official-101610556790549.html
13-01-2021||India||Death toll in Morena hooch tragedy rises to 21, DC, SP shunted out||The death toll in the hooch tragedy in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh rose to 21 on after seven more people died overnight Tuesday.The seven men died in different hospitals in Morena and Gwalior. Seventeen others who had fallen ill after drinking the illicit alcohol at a party Monday night are still in hospitals in Morena and Gwalior.The high death toll led to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announcing on Wednesday the transfers of collector Anurag Verma and superintendent of police (SP) Anurag Sujania from the district and suspension of a deputy superintendent of police Sujeet Singh Bhadoria. He also ordered constitution of a high-level three-member probe team headed by additional chief secretary (Home) Rajesh Rajora, according to an official statement.Two members of the probe team - additional director general of police (CID) A Sai Manohar and deputy inspector general (DIG) of police (training) Mithilesh Shukla - will visit the district.Earlier on Tuesday, a police station in charge and the district excise officer were suspended shortly after the tragedy began to unfold.The victims of the hooch tragedy are from five villages- Chhaira-Manpura, Pahawali, Bilaiyapura, Chheechhawali and Meerpur, all villages in the vicinity of small town Chhaira in the district.Police have booked seven men but no one has been arrested yet.“An FIR against seven accused has been lodged for sale of spurious liquor. Two of them are among those hospitalised. They will be arrested as soon as they are discharged from the hospital. A manhunt has been launched to arrest the others, inspector general (IG) of police, Morena zone, Manoj Sharma said,Morena’s chief medical and health officer, Dr RC Bandil said, "Initial autopsy reports suggest the deaths caused by excessive consumption of liquor that caused damage to vital body parts of the victims like liver etc. The FSL report may reveal if there was some poison in the liquor.”A police officer who did not wish to be named, said the preliminary investigation found that the accused used chemicals to make spurious liquor and sell it to people in villages at low price. Police seized a large number of liquor bottles from an agriculture farm where the accused used to make the hooch.Villagers of Chhaira-Manpur and some other villages staged a blockade at Morena by placing bodies of three of the victims on the road while accusing the local police of patronising liquor and gambling gangs in the region. The agitation was withdrawn on assurances by authorities that all the culprits responsible for the tragedy will be brought to book.Satyendra whose brother Jitendra, 32, lost his life in the tragedy said, “The police’s inefficiency claimed my brother’s life. He is survived by four children including three daughters. Who will take care of them?”Ex-sarpanch of Chhaira-Manpura village Rajesh Yadav said, “Police are hand in glove with illicit liquor racket and gambling gangs in the area. We complained several times against these gangs' activities on even the CM helpline but nothing happened.”Earlier in the morning, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “A campaign will be launched across the state against illicit liquor and stringent action will be taken against government officials and employees responsible for such incidents, to check recurrence of such incidents.”The Opposition Congress continued to attack the BJP government in general and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in particular for the hooch tragedy.Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The BJP government and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan have miserably failed in maintaining law and order situation in the state. The home minister Narottam Mishra is busy in BJP affairs in West Bengal. That spurious liquor claimed more than 20 lives in Morena within just 3 months of Ujjain hooch tragedy which had claimed more than 14 lives over there speaks volumes for the functioning of the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-toll-in-morena-hooch-tragedy-rises-to-21-dc-sp-shunted-out-101610557620125.html

Fire department officials could not confirm the cause of the fire but suspected that it could have been after laptop was left for charging overnight.The incident happened at Leela Homes high rise apartments in the house of paediatrician Dr. Puneet Kalra who said he had gone to sleep at around 4.30am and left the laptop to charge.“Around 7.30 am, my wife woke me up saying that there was a fire in our flat. We tried to go to the drawing room but there was fire and thick smoke. Unable to move out, we took our seven-year-old daughter to the balcony from where we started shouting for help,” said Dr Kalra. “Then we heard a blast, which could have been the air conditioner.”“Our neighbours in the opposite flat came to our aid,” he said. “They got a ladder and put it across our balconies. Our daughter, then my wife and finally I crawled over.”The fire department officials said that they got a call around 7am and deployed three fire tenders and about a dozen firemen from nearby Vaishali fire station. By the time they reached there though, the family had been rescued.“One of our teams went up the stairs to reach the flat with water pipes. Another team tried to douse the flame from outside,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. “It is likely that the fire started as the laptop was left on charging mode on a sofa and the heat or a spark caused the fire.”A few residents caught the blaze on their phone cameras that later made it to social media.“We estimate that we lost goods worth ₹3-4 lakh” said Dr Kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laptop-on-charging-mode-sparks-fire-at-6th-floor-flat-3-family-members-rescued-101610553013781.html

13-01-2021||India||Vaccine drive accelerates, doses reach far corners of India||India’s drive against Covid-19 gathered momentum on Wednesday with planes carrying vaccines flying into airports across the country from where the precious cargo was dispatched to small cities and towns in readiness for the inoculation exercise beginning January 16.From Assam to Goa and from Jammu and Kashmir to Kerala, the vaccines were carefully and swiftly transported to far corners of the country, a day after the first consignment of the Covishield vaccine from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable rolled out of the Serum Institute of India manufacturing facility in Pune.According to sources, 95 per cent of the 1.1 crore doses of Covishield vaccine purchased by the government have been delivered and shipped to nearly 60 consignee points across India in two days.Of the 55 lakh doses of indigenously developed Covaxin of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech ordered by the Centre, the first tranche of 2.4 lakh doses have been dispatched to 12 states.Covaxin has been sent to 12 sites, one each in Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai, Lucknow and Hyderabad, according to official sources.The vaccines have been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database, the Health Ministry said.The Mumbai airport authorities said it has facilitated the delivery of about 2,72,400 doses of the Covishield vaccine to 22 domestic destinations on Wednesday, starting with low-cost carrier GoAir's first flight to Goa with 23,500 doses of Covishield vaccine.These shipments were carried out by SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir and Vistara to Bagdogra, Rajkot, Ranchi, Imphal, Agartala, Cochin, Bhopal, Kanpur, Jammu, Srinagar, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Raipur, Dehradun, Varanasi, Indore, Trivandrum and Jabalpur, it said.On Tuesday, consignments were sent from Pune to 13 cities including Delhi.As the vials began reaching their destinations, in readiness for the pan-India vaccination drive that will be launched on Saturday, states firmed up their plans and fine-tuned logistical details.In Delhi, where the drive will begin in 89 centres, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said his AAP government will provide the vaccine free if the Centre fails to do so.He said he has already appealed to the Centre as there are many people in the country who can’t afford the life-saving jab.In accordance with the national priority list, the vaccine will be first given to healthcare and frontline workersWhile Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand and Union territories of Puducherry and Jammu and Kashmir were among those to receive the first consignment of the vaccines on Wednesday, others like Maharashtra and West Bengal started their transportation to various districts.A special vehicle carrying Covid-19 vaccines was held up and had to take a five-kilometer detour in West Bengal's Purba Bardhaman district after the national highway was blocked by protesters led by state minister Siddiqullah Chowdhury who were agitating against the new farm laws, sources said.The van, piloted by the West Bengal Police, was on its way to Bankura and Purulia to deliver the vaccines when it was stranded despite a 'green corridor' being arranged for its swift movement, they said.Chowdhury, who is the state library services minister, said he was not aware of the movement of the vaccine van and cleared the road once it was brought to his notice, but by that time the vehicle had been already diverted.The first consignment of about 94,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine reached the Madhya Pradesh capital on a scheduled flight from Mumbai, a state government official said.From the airport, insulated vans of the health department transported the boxes -- that signal India entering a decisive phase in its fight against the pandemic -- to the State Vaccine Centre where Medical Education Minister Visvas Sarang inspected the arrangements. The doses will be dispatched to eight districts from Bhopal.Kerala, too, received its first Covishield vaccine consignment on Wednesday morning on a Go Air flight that landed at Kochi. Another flight was expected to land in Thiruvananthapuram later in the day.Sources in the National Health Mission sources said of the 4.33 lakh doses of the vaccine, 1,100 will be sent to Mahe, an enclave of Puducherry.The vaccine will be stored in the regional vaccine centres at Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode from where it will be distributed to 133 centres.So far, 3,62,870 people have registered themselves for a shot.Giving details of the vaccination plans for Maharashtra, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the state had already received 9.83 lakh doses of the total requirement of 17.5 lakh for the first phase.Of these, 9.63 vials were from SII and 20,000 from Bharat Biotech, the state minister told reporters."We have to give the doses twice to a person in a gap of four weeks, hence 55 percent of the around eight lakh registered health workers will undergo vaccination as of now," he said.The Centre, he said, has asked the state to reduce the number of inoculation centres from 511 to 350, saying the government should focus on other emergencies as well.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries per day and the Union Health ministry said it has advised the states not to organise "unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day"."States have been advised to organise vaccination sessions taking into account 10 percent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session each day."Therefore, any undue haste on the part of states to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised," the Union Ministry said.It also said that states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward.The country's financial capital, Mumbai, which will have 72 centres, received over 1.39 lakh Covishield vaccine doses, said civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.Health department staffers of the BMC brought the vaccines from neighbouring Pune under police security, it said. The civic body has created a centralised cold storage facility for vaccines in Kanjurmarg.The towns of Aurangabad and Thane in the state got their share of the first doses too.Goa Health Services Director Jose D'Sa told PTI that two boxes comprising 23,500 doses of the Covishield vaccine were received in the morning.Around 18,000 health workers in the coastal state will be covered during the initial phase, another health official said.The northeast state of Assam received its second consignment of Covid-19 vaccines when a cargo flight of a private airline carried 12,000 doses of Covaxin weighing around 78.5 kg, from Hyderabad to Guwahati."The consignment was shipped by Bharat Biotech and handed over to state government officials within six minutes of its arrival," said an Airports Authority of India spokesperson.The first batch of 2.40 lakh vials of Covid-19 vaccine for Assam and Meghalaya had landed on Tuesday.Guwahati’s LGBI Airport has been marked as the nodal point of distribution of vaccines for the northeast.Assam and Tripura welcomed their first lot of Covishield doses."The vaccine containers were transported to a National Health Mission (NHM) storage facility at Gorkhabasti area," State Immunization Officer Kallol Roy told reporters in Agartala.SpiceJet said it had transported 3.5 tonnes of Covid-19 vaccines on Wednesday from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad to 11 cities.GoAir said it was airlifting a total of 69,600 vials of the vaccine.The Mumbai airport said that the standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented by it in anticipation of the vaccine distribution saw the terminal register a cargo processing time of just seven minutes, right from goods acceptance to dispatch at the ramp, it added.Besides, the airport has deployed a dedicated Covid-19 task force to reduce dwell time and facilitate advanced planning and collaboration between the airport and all stakeholders in this process, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-accelerates-doses-reach-far-corners-of-india-101610554448440.html

13-01-2021||India||Odisha BJP MP's free food scheme for needy in Bhubaneswar irks civic body||Ahead of the upcoming civic polls in Odisha, the fight between BJP and BJD seems to have intensified with BJP's Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi getting into a conflict with the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation over its diktat that no one would be allowed to give food and clothes free of cost to the poor and homeless people in the state capital.Sarangi, a former IAS officer of Odisha cadre who won from the prestigious Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha constituency had started an organisation called Annapurna Trust for feeding poor people in the city free-of-cost. The project was started a month ago on a trial run basis in Bhubaneswar for providing cooked meals to 200 poor and hungry people, but an announcement was made to scale up.“Annapurna will provide hot meals everyday to needy people residing in Bhubaneswar during lunchtime. Five organisations have joined hands for this initiative. Every day, volunteers on two vehicles will distribute food to 750 people listed in the 1st phase,” said Sarangi who is the chief advisor of the Trust.Clearly aimed at slum dwellers, who form the bulk of Bhubaneswar's electorate, Sarangi's lunch on wheels for the poor has not pleased officials in the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.“Poor people living on the roadside in the city hesitate to shift to the shelter homes being managed by the BMC due to free distribution of food and clothes by some organisations. It leads to failure in making the state capital a beggar-free city. Individuals and organisations may distribute free food and clothes to destitute people at shelter homes managed by the BMC after taking permission from it. In violation of the order, legal action will be taken against the individuals/organisations,” said BMC commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhury.After the BMC’s objection to giving free food, the MP said the order does not affect her plans as the trust would charge Re 1 for each meal. “Annapurna is not free. We are charging one rupee. It does not come under the BMC order purview,” said Sarangi.Political analysts said Sarangi may have taken a leaf out of BJD's book on wooing the slum dwellers. “In April 2015, BJD had started the Aahar meal scheme in which 5 lakh people were getting lunch at ₹5 everyday at 110 centres. It helped the BJD in 2019 polls. So it's quite natural for Sarangi to adopt the same populist technique as no political party in Odisha can survive without such measures. But I hope as Bhubaneswar MP she brings structural changes to the lives of slum dwellers,” said Gyana Ranjan Swain, professor of political science in Ravenshaw University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-mp-s-free-food-scheme-for-needy-in-bhubaneswar-irks-civic-body-101610553741390.html
13-01-2021||India||North shivers as Srinagar records lowest temp in 8 years; no relief soon||There was no let-up in the intense cold conditions in the north and northwestern parts of the country on Wednesday as Srinagar recorded its lowest temperature in eight years, while some places reported traffic disruptions as fog reduced visibility.A cold wave gripped the national capital too as frosty winds from the snow-clad western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down to 3.2 degrees Celsius. A dense fog blanketed some parts of the city, lowering visibility to 50 metres and affecting traffic movement.The IMD said the lowest minimum temperature of 0.2 degrees Celsius was reported at Ganganagar (West Rajasthan) over the plains of the country.Due to the prevalence of dry north/northwesterly winds, minimum temperatures are very likely to remain below normal over most parts of Northwest India during next 3-4 days, the IMD said"Hence, Cold Day/Severe Cold Day conditions very likely to continue in many pockets over Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during next 3 days," it said.Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are also likely in many pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and Uttar Pradesh; in some pockets East Rajasthan and in isolated pockets over West Rajasthan during next 3-4 days, the IMD said.Meanwhile, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall and moderate thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over south Tamil Nadu, south Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next 24 hours, the IMD said in its 8 pm bulletin.It said extremely heavy rainfall was observed at isolated places over Tamil Nadu on Wednesday."Today, cold day conditions at a few places with Severe Cold Day conditions at isolated places (were) observed over Haryana, Chandigarh & Delhi and East Uttar Pradesh; Cold Day to Severe Cold Day conditions at isolated places over West Uttar Pradesh and Cold Day conditions in isolated places over Punjab," the IMD said.Himachal Pradesh's Keylong and Kalpa shivered at subzero temperatures, while state capital Shimla registered a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius, the meteorological department said.Lahaul and Spiti's administrative centre Keylong continued to be the coldest place in the state at minus 11.4 degrees Celsius, Shimla MeT centre director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius, he added.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places as Churk recorded the lowest temperature of 3.2 degrees Celsius.Dense to very dense fog occurred at isolated places over the state.Intense cold conditions prevailed in parts of Rajasthan too, where Ganganagar was recorded as the coldest place at 0.2 degree Celsius.The Kashmir Valley reeled under severe cold too, with Srinagar city -- the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir -- recording its lowest minimum temperature in eight years, the Meteorological Department said here on Wednesday.Srinagar recorded a low of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius, which was the lowest temperature recorded in the city in eight years, an official of the MET department said.He said the exact same minimum temperature was recorded in the city in 2012 on January 14.The rest of the Valley was also reeling under intense cold.Biting cold conditions prevailed in most parts of Punjab and Haryana also with Narnaul being the coldest place in both the states at 1.4 degrees Celsius.Narnaul in Haryana recorded a low of three notches below the normal. Hisar was the another place where the mercury settled below the 2 degrees Celsius-mark. It registered a minimum temperature of 1.7 degrees Celsius, five notches below the normal.Among other places in the state, Ambala, Karnal and Rohtak experienced cold conditions at 7.8, 6.5 and 5 degrees Celsius, respectively, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said here.Bhiwani and Sirsa reeled under cold conditions at 2.8 and 3.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.Chandigarh, the joint capital of both states, recorded a low of 5.7 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-shivers-as-srinagar-records-lowest-temp-in-8-years-no-relief-soon-101610553758113.html
13-01-2021||India||Publication of notice for interfaith marriage optional, rules Allahabad HC||In an order likely to bring relief to interfaith couples, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has ruled that the publication of a notice of intended marriage under the Special Marriage Act and inviting objections is not mandatory.Justice Vivek Chaudhary passed the judgment on Tuesday 2 on a habeas corpus petition filed by an interfaith couple intending to marry.The order was uploaded on the high court’s website on Wednesday.“This court mandates that while giving notice under Section 5 of the (Special Marriage) Act of 1954 it shall be optional for the parties to the intended marriage to make a request in writing to the marriage officer to publish or not to publish a notice under Section 6 and follow the procedure of objections as prescribed under the Act of 1954,” the court observed.“In case they do not make such a request for publication of notice in writing, while giving notice under Section 5 of the Act, the marriage officer shall not publish any such notice or entertain objections to the intended marriage and proceed with the solemnization of the marriage,” the court added.“It goes without saying that it shall be open for the marriage officer, while solemnizing any marriage under the Act of 1954, to verify the identification, age and valid consent of the parties or otherwise their competence to marry under the said Act. In case he has any doubt, it shall be open for him to ask for appropriate details/proof as per the facts of the case,” the court ruled.“Since the matter relates to protection of fundamental rights of large number of persons, the Senior Registrar of this court shall ensure that a copy of this order is communicated to the Chief Secretary of the State of Uttar Pradesh who shall forthwith communicate the same to all the marriage officers of the state and other authorities concerned as expeditiously as possible,” ordered the court.The court also observed that the matter could have come to an end at this stage, but for the views expressed by the young couple while interacting with the court on their personal appearance.“The young couple expressed that they could have solemnized their marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 but the said Act requires a 30-day notice to be published and objections to be invited from the public at large,” the court said.“They expressed that any such notice would be an invasion in their privacy and would have definitely caused unnecessary social pressure/interference in their free choice with regard to their marriage,” the court added.“They further stated that such a challenge was being faced by a large number of similarly situated persons who desire to build a life with a partner of their own choice,” the court said.It may be mentioned that after the Adityanath government promulgated the ordinance enforcing the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, the marriage officer is bound to publish the notice for a period of 30 days and invite objections. Any person can object to the marriage.Since the ordinance was passed, several Muslim men have been arrested under controversial circumstances and accused if trying to forcibly convert Hindu women for marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/publication-of-notice-for-interfaith-marriage-optional-rules-allahabad-hc-101610551094375.html
13-01-2021||India||Talks must continue: MoS Rupala on Jan 15 scheduled meeting with farmer groups||The government is in favour of continuing talks with protesting farmer groups as it believes a solution can be found only through dialogue, Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala said on Wednesday.While eight rounds of negotiations so far between the government and a representative-group of thousands of farmers protesting against three farm laws have failed to resolve the crisis, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three Acts till further orders and set up a four-member committee to end the impasse.However, the protesting farmer unions have said they will not appear before the committee as they consider it to be "pro-government". They have, however, shown willingness to attend the scheduled ninth round of talks on January 15 with the government, though they have asserted they would not settle for anything less than a complete repeal of the laws."Talks must continue. It is only through dialogue, a way forward can be found," Rupala told PTI.He was responding to a query whether the government talks with protesting farmers' leaders on January 15 will be held as scheduled in the wake of the Supreme Court setting up of a committee to resolve the crisis.On Tuesday, Kailash Choudhary, who is also Minister of State for Agriculture, had said the government was willing to go ahead with the meeting and it was for the farmer groups to decide what they want.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at several border points of Delhi since November 26 last year, demanding a repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) procurement system for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-must-continue-mos-rupala-on-jan-15-scheduled-meeting-with-farmer-groups-101610553147765.html

13-01-2021||India||For TMC and BJP, swing in Left, Congress votes can be crucial in Bengal polls||For the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the principal contenders in the upcoming West Bengal assembly election, change in vote share of the Left and Congress may play a crucial role although the latter has weakened significantly in the districts since the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.The Congress and the Left Front partners, headed by the CPI (M), contested as allies in the 2016 assembly polls but could not stop the TMC from retaining power with 211 out of the state’s 294 seats. Since the Congress benefited more from the alliance and wrested 44 seats against the Left’s 32, the tie-up did not last.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left contested as opponents but it was the BJP that turned heads by winning 18 of the state’s 42 seats, thanks to a huge swing in Left votes towards the saffron camp.This time around, the bigger stakeholders in Bengal politics feel that the smaller parties, especially the CPI(M), cannot be taken lightly because assembly polls are fought on local issues and Muslim voters and farmers will play a decisive role.In some of her recent rallies, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee took a seemingly softer stance towards the CPI (M) while her follower-turned electoral foe Suvendu Adhikari has openly appealed to Left and Congress workers to help the BJP oust the ruling party. “I appeal to our friends in Left Front and Congress to attend rallies of their parties but vote for us in the interest of Bengal,” Adhikari said at a rally in West Burdwan district on Tuesday.Analysis of the 2019 poll results showed that the biggest contributor to the BJP’s stunning performance were voters who were d loyal to the CPI(M) and its partners for more than three decades. Out of 40 Left candidates in the race, 39 lost their election deposit as they failed to secure one sixth of the votes cast in their respective seats.The phenomenon was seen even in East Midnapore district, Suvendu Adhikari’s home turf, where the TMC won. His father, two-time TMC MP Sisir Adhikari, got 50% votes in the Kanthi seat but the BJP secured 42% while CPI(M) ended third with 5.3 %. In 2014 and 2009, Adhikari won the seat but the CPI (M) came second with 34.72 % and 42.5 % respectively. It was apparent that the bulk of the votes for the CPI (M) in the past went to BJP’s kitty last year.In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections when the TMC was not in power in Bengal, the Left Front secured 43.3% votes but won only 15 seats. In comparison, 19 seats went to the TMC although Mamata Banerjee had a lower vote share of 31.18%. In that election, the BJP got only 6.14% votes and one seat in Bengal.The BJP has dramatically improved its position since then, winning two Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and 18 seats in 2019. Seen in terms of assembly segments, the BJP is already ahead of the others in 122 assembly seats in 2021 while the TMC is ahead in 163.In terms of vote share in the 2019 polls, the TMC got 43.69 % in 2019 against 40.64 % secured by the BJP. The CPI (M)’s vote share came down to 6.34 % while the Congress got only 5.67%.“Neither the Left nor the Congress ever supported the BJP. These parties should either secure their own votes or support us,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy.“TMC and BJP leaders are daydreaming. The Left-Congress alternative is the answer to the TMC’s misrule in Bengal and the BJP’s policies at the Centre. People will give these parties a befitting reply,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI (M) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the assembly.According to the 2011 census, Bengal’s population stood at 91.3 million. It is projected to reach 101.9 million in 2021 and around 30 % comprise Muslims. The census showed that around 68.13% of the population lives in villages of rural areas where the literacy rate was 72.13% in 2011.Veteran political commentator and columnist Suvashis Maitra said if the CPI (M) regains even one vote then it will be at the cost of the BJP.“The TMC cannot possibly lose more than what it has already lost. Rather, it may win some additional Muslim votes. If the CPI (M) makes some gains then it will be because of the extensive relief work it carried out after cyclone Amphan and the community kitchens has been running across Bengal since the pandemic began. A section of Left voters who shifted allegiance to the BJP in 2019 may vote for the Marxists again,” said Maitra.“Election is a game of possibilities and our party is ready to take on the challenge. But one must bear in mind that the CPI (M) has nothing to offer to its supporters because it simply cannot come to power,” a BJP vice-president said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-tmc-and-bjp-swing-in-left-congress-votes-can-be-crucial-in-bengal-polls-101610546644561.html
13-01-2021||India||Shouldn’t be iota of apprehension about Covaxin's safety: ICMR scientist||As critics continue to raise doubts about the reliability of an indigenously developed coronavirus vaccine which is still in the third phase of trial, a top Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist on Wednesday said that Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech) is safe and there should not be an iota of apprehension about its safety. He called for people to dispel the myths and misconceptions around Covid-19 vaccines.“The vaccine that India has developed (Covaxin) presents to the immune system a wide array of antigens, so the immunity which will be produced after vaccination is expected to address the mutants as well,” Dr Samiran Panda, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases division, ICMR, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Speaking about the speed at which the vaccines have been developed, Dr Panda said, “In older days, it would take 20-30 years to get a vaccine or medicine out in the market. Given the knowledge about the whole genome of the virus, the vaccine (Coviaxin) has come out within 10-12 months, which underlines the superiority, ability and commitment of Indian scientists."His remarks come in the backdrop of the health ministry saying the recipients will not get to choose which vaccine they want to be administered to them. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said that there will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and its effectiveness can be seen only after 14 days.Earlier in the day, Congress MP Manish Tewari said that the government should not roll out Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based pharma firm Bharat Biotech, till its efficacy and reliability is completely established and phase 3 trials are over.The ICMR scientist told ANI that the Indian program has taken a smart vaccination approach, rather than mass vaccination approach. “Herd immunity produced by vaccination is a good idea but when the virus mutates, immunity might not be working against it even if it is a drift,” he said.India’s vaccination drive is set to begin on January 16, for which a total of 11 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine produced at Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune, have been delivered across the country, according to Serum officials. Bharat Biotech has also shipped its vaccine Covaxin to several cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shouldnt-be-iota-of-apprehension-about-covaxin-s-safety-icmr-scientist-101610544740365.html

The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost ₹971 crore.The new building will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of ₹83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.According to the plan, provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-work-of-new-parliament-building-to-start-on-jan-15-say-sources-101610545157252.html

The farmers reiterated that they will not end their stir till the laws are withdrawn.Tejendra Singh Virk, president, Terai Kisan Sanghthan said, “Farmers are dying in protest against the farm laws at Delhi’s border but the Modi government has turned a deaf ear towards their plight.

Bazpur farmers gathered at Bhagat Singh Chowk and burnt copies there. They said when the farmers want the laws repealed, why is the Modi government unnecessarily imposing the laws on them. The government should understand the sentiments of the farmer, they added.Farmers in Sitarganj took out a tractor rally and burnt the copies of the farm laws. Several farmers said that they will continue the agitation from Sitarganj to Delhi till the Modi government gives up.Virk said Lohri is a festival of fun and frolic but this year farmers are disappointed due to the new farm laws.

It followed a double-bind, randomised, multi-centre phase two clinical trial which included children as well.4) Bharat Biotech in its report published after animal studies said that its vaccine candidate showed protective efficacy. The vaccine candidate was administered in 20 rhesus macaques, divided into four groups. One group was administered with placebo, while three other groups were immunised with three different vaccine candidates. “To summarise, the vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” the company had said.5) The company received a nod for emergency use authorisation for Covaxin on January 3 by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-101610543719610.html

LCA-Tejas incorporates a large number of new technologies many of which were never attempted in India. The indigenous content of LCA-Tejas is 50% in Mk1A variant which will be enhanced to 60%,” Singh said in a statement posted on his Twitter timeline.Last March, the defence ministry gave a green light to the purchase of 83 advanced Tejas jets from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The jets to be ordered include 73 LCA Tejas Mk-1A fighter aircraft and 10 LCA Tejas Mk-1 trainer aircraft at the cost of ₹45,696 crore, along with design and development of infrastructure sanctions worth Rs1,202 crore, the defence ministry said in a statement.The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123.The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability.“The LCA Mk-1A variant is an indigenously designed, developed and manufactured state-of-the-art modern 4+ generation fighter aircraft. This aircraft is equipped with critical operational capabilities of AESA radar, BVR missiles, electronic warfare (EW) Suite and air-to-air refuelling and it would be a potent platform to meet the operational requirements of the IAF,” the defence ministry said.“The decision taken today will considerably expand the current LCA ecosystem and help in creating new job opportunities.

A forensic team also collected evidence from the scene of the crime as well as the SUV in which Singh was shot.Police said the killers seemed to be professional hit men.The police have so far not been able to ascertain the identity of the killers or who hired them.A senior police official said that the reasons behind the killing are still not clear but it could involve airport related tenders and personal dispute. A police team has been sent to Singh's Jalalpur residence in Chhapra district, about 100 km north of Patna, as part of the probe.Another police team collected details, information about Singh and recorded the statements of his colleagues and other employees at the Patna airport. Police suspect that someone hired an assassin to eliminate Singh.Police have scanned nearby CCTV footage from cameras on apartments, shops and examined the victim’s call data records.The incident triggered panic among citizens and over 2,000 policemen were deployed to maintain law and order in the area. The spot where the murders took place is located near a high-security zone that includes chief minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence, the Bihar police headquarters and state secretariat.Singh was gunned down in front of his apartment on Shankar Path at Punaichak area at around 7.15 pm on Tuesday. Singh had returned from duty on his new SUV and was waiting for the guard to open the main gate when two motorcycle borne assailants pumped several bullets into his body and sped away.Police suspect the killers tailed Singh from the airport. The victim who was shot in the neck and chest died on the spot. Five CCTV cameras of the apartment were non-functional. A nearby CCTV captured a grainy image of the motorcyclist.Police found six empty cartridges from the spot and a mobile phone from Singh’s car.Another police official said they have received some clues about the criminals but are yet to identify the culprits.Villagers of Jalalpur had threatened to block the national highway and hold protests if the police failed to arrest the accused within seven days. Singh’s father retired from Kolkata police while his elder brother runs a skill development centre in Jalalpur.Villagers said that Singh had political ambitions and wanted to fight the assembly election from the Marhaura seat on a BJP ticket. He was reportedly close to many BJP leaders including Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sushil Modi.“We are in utter shock after the incident. Police should arrest the criminals immediately and ensure that such incidents do not happen in future,” said agriculture minister, Amrendra Pratap Singh.Vivek Thakur, Rajya Sabha member, also expressed concern over the incident. “Police should intensify night patrolling in the city to avoid such incidents,” he added.Attacking the NDA government over the deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar, Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav said, "The incident took place in the VIP area, which is considered the safest zone in Patna. Even with the CM's house nearby and all roads equipped with CCTV, such incidents are happening. The crime graph is soaring in the state since this government came to power.""The area where the chief minister lives is considered a VVIP zone and even when the CM reviews law and order five times within 45 days, criminals have the courage to shoot the IndiGo manager," said CPI leader and Paliganj MLA Sandeep Sourabh."This says it all about the current law and order situation in the state. People of the state are living in fear and criminals are having a free run," said Congress MLC Premchand Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-police-set-up-sit-to-nab-killers-of-indigo-s-patna-station-manager-101610538100927.html
13-01-2021||India||Delhi HC seeks timeline from Centre for finalising Draft Health Policy 2020||The Delhi high court has asked the Centre to give a timeline for finalising the Draft Health Policy 2020, which includes the guidelines for treatment of rare diseases. The court said that “Right to Health is a fundamental right and no child in our country should be deprived of treatment because of the drug being expensive”.Justice Pratibha M Singh noted that the Centre had not finalised the health policy on rare diseases despite the lapse of one and half years since an earlier direction of the court. She said that the Draft Health Policy 2020 has also “yet not seen light of the day” while the earlier one is kept in “abeyance”.Hearing two pleas seeking treatment of children suffering from rare genetic disease known as Duchene Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) which was beyond the capacity of the parents because of the high cost of drugs and cure, the single judge bench remarked that “such a policy cannot be left indefinitely when young human lives are on stake” .DMD is a severe type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects boys where muscle starts weakening at a young age. During the hearing, the Central government standing counsel, appearing for the ministry of health, told the court that they would not be able to bear the entire cost of the treatment but it would be made possible through donations by private parties and others. The Centre had told the court in an affidavit that the Draft policy has been released and it is still in consultation.The matter would be now heard on January 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-timeline-from-centre-for-finalising-draft-health-policy-2020-101610538502844.html
13-01-2021||India||Information under RTI, if sought for vested interests, cannot be provided: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that whenever information is sought under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, especially by disgruntled persons in the garb of transparency, the authorities have to see whether the details asked are for some personal or vested interest.Justice Pratibha M Singh made the observation while dismissing a plea by a man who had sought details of the persons who had been appointed at the President’s secretariat as multi-tasking staff.The judge said that the petitioner had “cleverly” concealed the information from the court that he had filed the plea because his daughter had been unsuccessful in this selection process.Also Read: Delhi govt allows schools to reopen for classes 10, 12 from January 18The court also imposed a cost of Rs25,000 on the petitioner for hiding the facts, while also noting that providing him with details of the persons who have been appointed will be a complete evasion of their privacy.Advocate Anurag Alhuwalia, the Central government’s standing counsel, told the court that while five of the six details sought were provided to the man, the last one, with respect to the phone numbers, name and address of the residence of the successful candidates was not given, because that would infringe upon their privacy.During the hearing, the court repeatedly sought to know from the petitioner’s counsel as to what was the motive for seeking such information. The court was finally informed that the petitioner’s daughter had also appeared for the recruitment process and was unsuccessful in her attempt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/information-under-rti-if-sought-for-vested-interests-cannot-be-provided-delhi-hc-101610538082885.html

It didn’t give further details.Doval, who is on a two-day visit, also met President Ashraf Ghani at the presidential palace in Kabul and “discussed cooperation in countering terrorism and strengthening a regional consensus on the Afghan peace process”, Afghan chargé d’affaires Tahir Qadiry said on Twitter.The visit comes at a time when the troubled Afghan peace process between the government and the Taliban is very delicately poised, especially in the wake of a sharp surge in violent attacks blamed on the militant group.A growing number of civilians in influential positions and human rights activists have been assassinated across Afghanistan in recent weeks, and Kabul and other major cities have been witnessing almost daily bomb attacks. Countries in the region are closely watching the situation to see if the incoming Biden administration in the US makes any major changes in the approach to Afghanistan.There was no official word from the Indian side on Doval’s visit.India has consistently backed an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process and said that the gains made in the war-torn country in the past two decades must be preserved. New Delhi has also said any solution in Kabul must ensure that Afghan territory isn’t used for terrorism directed against India.The Afghan NSA met US chargé d’affaires Ross Wilson on Tuesday and discussed the ongoing peace efforts, reforms in the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces and joint efforts related to the security situation.Mohib has also been travelling to countries in the region to shore up support for Afghanistan in the peace process. Last month, he travelled to Azerbaijan and Iran for talks on the regional security situation.While in Tehran, Mohib met his Iranian counterpart Ali Shamkhani and foreign minister Javad Zarif and held wide-ranging discussions about enhancing bilateral relations on security, trade, economic and transit issues. Mohib also told his Iranian interlocutors of the need to boost neighbourly relations and “combat common threats based on mutual confidence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-visits-afghanistan-for-talks-on-strategic-issues-101610537602831.html

13-01-2021||India||Heavy snowfall in Kashmir offers opportunities to revive trekking||Heavy snowfall may have disrupted normal life in Kashmir over the last few weeks, but it has offered opportunities for more advantageous trekking in the snow-clad Himalayas to many young women and men, who have over the last few years formed clubs to revive adventure sports in the Valley.Jalal Jeelani, a filmmaker, said they try to go trekking every season though it is most adventurous and challenging in the winter when they only go for day trips. “Snow trekking needs proper clothing and gear... every new trek comes with new challenges which give us new experiences,” said Jeelani.He said their group of doctors, engineers, and businessmen have trekked to several snowy high-altitude places. “Last month, we went to Bangus [Valley in Kupwara district located at an altitude of 10,000 feet]. It was first ever snow trekking by civilians to Bangus with over six feet of the snow.”Also read | Jammu & Kashmir bans poultry import amid bird flu outbreakTariq Mughloo, who is a part of the Varmul Trekking Club, said they have organised three trekking trips this winter. “Our club is four-year-old and we used to go trekking only in summer or autumn. This time, we also started winter trekking. It has a different experience, especially when you walk on the snow.”Mughloo said trekking in winter cannot be done with proper gear and that they want younger people to trek and enjoy nature.Mohammad Aslam, a tourist guide in the resort town of Gulmarg, said the mercury may have plunged to minus 10 degrees Celsius but that has not deterred younger people from going trekking.Tanvir Khan, the president of Pathfinders Hiking and Trekking club, said before trekking they do their research about the places or mountains they have to trek to and whether there is any danger of avalanches or any other difficulty. “Once we are satisfied, then we begin our journey and always take help from the local guides because all tracks are under snow. There is low visibility at some places--not more than 10 metres,” said Khan, who began snow trekking four years back.He said there are around 10 to 11 members in their group including one woman. “After our journey, we upload short videos on our Facebook page... to create awareness about these places, especially among our young generation, who spend most of their leisure time sitting at home watching television or mobiles.” He said their videos and pictures have inspired many to join them for trekking.Kashmir has received six spells of snow since November. Last week, it experienced the season’s heaviest--up to five feet--snow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-snowfall-in-kashmir-offers-opportunities-to-revive-trekking-101610534723211.html

Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to follow the Standards laid down in Indian Pharmacopoeia," the tribunal was informed.The tribunal said that in view of the revision of the Pharmacopeia, the adverse health effect of plastic packaging has been regulated to an extent."The matter being required to be primarily dealt with by the concerned Executive authorities, we do not consider it necessary to pass any further order in exercise of jurisdiction under Sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010," the bench said.However, it is necessary to ensure that compliance of the norms is duly monitored at appropriate level of the Health Ministry to safeguard the health of the citizens, the tribunal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-directs-fssai-to-finalise-draft-packaging-regulations-within-3-months-101610533968261.html

13-01-2021||India||Mumbai second most congested city in the world after Moscow||Mumbai was the second most congested city in the world after Moscow in 2020 in terms of traffic, according to the latest report released by TomTom Traffic index which conducted a study in 416 cities across 57 countries.Two other Indian - Bengaluru and New Delhi - rank sixth and eighth respectively in the list of most congested cities.Mumbai’s position worsened from the fourth spot in 2019 and 2018. Bengaluru improved its position from fifth to sixth with 51 per cent of congestion compared to 71 per cent in 2019.According to TomTom data , drivers in Mumbai spend an average of 53 per cent extra travel time because of the traffic congestion. Other global cities that feature among the top 10 include Manila from The Philippines, Bogota from Colombia, Moscow and Novosibirsk from Russia, Kyiv in Ukraine, Lima from Peru, Istanbul from Turkey and Jakarta from Indonesia.The report, which analysed traffic data in 400 cities in 57countries around the world, said that although Mumbai’s ranking has worsened, the congestion decreased by 12 per cent. Parag Bedarkar, manager enterprise sales, TomTom said that the reason for decrease in congestion across the world and Mumbai could be due to the lockdown induced by the Covid-19 lockdown. Bedarkar said that analyzing Mumbai proved that congestion levels were down by 18 per cent in the morning peak hour and 17 per cent during the evening rush hour."Solutions offered by companies like work from home have helped in reduction of congestion even after the lockdown," added Bedarkar.Apart from helping commuters plan their travel TomTom provides real time traffic management data along with historical traffic congestion data which could help governments plan their infrastructure projects and initiate more public transport like increasing bus frequency, etc.Werner van Huyssteen, General Manager, India, TomTom, said: “Last year, we announced that both global and India congestion levels in 2019 had increased for the ninth consecutive Traffic Index.

He said reports of samples were coming every 48 hours.Earlier on Sunday, the government issued a circular declaring UP as a ‘controlled area’ in view of the outbreak of bird flu in states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It also put a complete ban on import of live birds to UP till January 24. “We will review the situation in the meantime and take an appropriate decision accordingly,” Kumar said.He also made it clear that there was no ban at all on sale and consumption of eggs and meat in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-scare-uttar-pradesh-bans-import-of-birds-poultry-till-january-24-101610531663123.html
13-01-2021||India||Secret tunnel on India-Pak border reveals PM Imran Khan’s real plans||Indian security forces on Wednesday discovered another tunnel built by Pakistani security officials to push terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, people familiar with the matter said. This is the second tunnel found by Indian security forces since November last.ALSO WATCH | ‘Must be no ifs and buts, no double standards in fight against terrorism: EAMThe Border Security Force has told the national security establishment that the underground tunnel, like the last one found in November, was a professionally-engineered effort to infiltrate terrorists trained in terror camps commissioned by the Pakistan army.The entry to the tunnel was spotted about 300 feet from the zero line; about 65 feet from the fence on the Indian side, a senior Border Security Force officer said. The 3-feet wide tunnel appears to have been constructed at a depth of 25 to 30 feet.But this time, the BSF did not stumble upon the tunnel. “Given the sophistication of the last tunnel that had been found, we had figured that the Pakistan army had started building cross-border terrorists to create a new infiltration route and had constituted special teams to look for them,” the BSF officer said.Counter-terror officials in New Delhi said the tunnel also explained instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistani Rangers in this region.It has been an old tactic of Pakistani security forces to open fire at border guards on the Indian side to distract them. Usually, it was to help terrorists infiltrate into India. “Now, it is also being used to draw the attention of security forces from spots where they are building tunnels,” a counter-terror official said.And there has been a sharp increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces all along the border in Jammu and Kashmir in 2020.According to statistics compiled by the Jammu and Kashmir police, there were 930 instances of ceasefire violations in 2020, a 54% increase over the 605 instances the previous year. There was also a 22% increase in recruitment of terrorists by Pakistan’s deep state.“But the security forces were on their toes,” a top Jammu and Kashmir police officer said. Only 52 of the 174 terrorists recruited in 2020 are still active. “Nearly 50 of them were arrested or surrendered. Another 76 were killed in security operations,” the officer said.A national security planner in Delhi said the Pakistan army’s approach to infiltrate terrorists via tunnels reflected how desperately they wanted to keep Kashmir on the boil. “The general understanding earlier was that the Pakistani side would largely pause infiltration attempts during the winter. The tunnels indicate that General (Qamar Ahmad) Bajwa does not want the terror tap to be turned off…. That he does not want a dip in terrorist attacks in Kashmir,” he said.But the desperation to keep the Kashmir Valley in the news, he said, could also be linked to Imran Khan’s troubles from the opposition that has united to target the PM Khan and even the army. This would explain why PM Khan and Gen Bajwa have been trying to focus on Kashmir back home.The Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance of opposition parties formed in September to mobilise nationwide protests against Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government is already gaining public support.“If the economic situation is not properly controlled, Pakistan will face political instability with growing risks of government collapse,” an internal assessment by the United Nations’ department of safety and security said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/secret-tunnel-on-india-pak-border-reveals-pm-imran-khan-s-real-plans-101610531648760.html

It also constituted a committee to resolve the stand-off between the farmers and the government. As per the order, the four-member committee will hear all objections and report to the court.However, the protesting farmers rejected the committee saying it is "proxy for government". They also said that they will not hold any a discussion with its members.As per the court's order, the first sitting of the committee should be held within 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-lohri-protesting-farmers-near-delhi-burn-copies-of-farm-laws-101610531770838.html

Meanwhile, another rebel BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal alleged that Yediyurappa was being blackmailed by at least three of those being sworn-in into giving them ministerial berths. Yatnal also claimed that the chief minister was distributing money to “lingayat mutts” so that they rebel against the Centre in case he is asked to step down.Refusing to step down, Karanataka’s excise minister H Nagesh said his community will revolt if he is dropped from the cabinet. In December last year, after the minister was accused of seeking a bribe of ₹one crore for a transfer, he had alleged that he was being targeted for being a Dalit.From nearly 24 aspirants, Umesh Katti, Arvind Limbavalli, Murugesh Nirani, C P Yogeshwar, S Angara, MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar are being accommodated in the cabinet.Political analyst Aravind had earlier said that irrespective of who gets the nod, the exercise was likely to kickstart another round of dissidence. "There are simply too many claimants for too few posts. It will definitely create heartburn amongst those who have been denied a berth. Remains to be seen how he will handle the aftermath of the cabinet expansion exercise," he said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-yediyurappa-being-blackmailed-claims-rebel-mla-ahead-of-karnataka-cabinet-expansion-101610531560791.html

The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of these laws, but the farmers have hardened their stance reiterating that they want the laws to be scrapped.The top court has formed a committee to resolve the impasse over the three laws, but the protesters have said that they won't listen to it as all the four members of the panel are pro-government.Apart from the three laws, which were passed in September last year, Chautala also held discussions on textile hubs, airports, east-west corridors and railway routes, news agency ANI reported.The meeting with PM Modi comes a day after Chautala met home minister Amit Shah with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.After the meeting on Tuesday, Khattar had said that the political situation in the state was alright and dismissed the claims that his government is weak. “The speculations by the Opposition and media are baseless. Our government is going on strong and will complete its tenure,” he had said."I think the government (in state) is going strong. As far as the farmers are concerned, each and every issue was discussed. Hopefully, the Supreme Court will resolve it," Chautala had said after the meeting.Chautala is the leader of Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) which is an alliance partner in the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Haryana.

Covaxin is a highly purified and inactivated 2 dose SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses,” the company said in a statement.Even though it said that 1.65 million vaccine doses were donated to government of India for free, it did not disclose how many doses were shipped in the first batch out of 5.5 million doses that the government had purchased. The remaining doses will be sold at a price of ₹295 plus government taxes.Covaxin is an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).This indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) biocontainment facility in Hyderabad. The vaccine received restricted emergency use approval under clinical trial mode by the national drugs controller early this month.“The evaluation of COVAXIN™ has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants,” the company statement further read.“This vaccine has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and a rapid antibody response to future infections. Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data…,” it added.Covaxin is presented in multi-dose vials, and can be stored at 2-8ºC.The product development and clinical trial data thus far has generated 5 publications, which have been submitted to international peer reviewed journals, 4 of which have been accepted and will be published soon. The publication of phase II trial data is undergoing the peer review process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-shipped-to-11-cities-across-country-bharat-biotech-101610529622411.html

Now the government is saying that the recipient won't be able to pick and choose the vaccine which he's administered to. When phase 3 trials of Covaxin are not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari told news agency ANI.He said that the government should not roll out Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based pharma firm Bharat Biotech, till its efficacy and reliability is completely established and phase 3 trials are over. “It (the government) should act in a manner whereby there's complete confidence in people. You can't use rollout as phase 3 trial, Indians are not guinea pigs,” the Congress MP was quoted as saying by ANI.His remarks come as the health ministry on Tuesday hinted that for now, the Covid vaccine recipients will not have the option to choose from the two vaccines recently approved for restricted emergency use in India. "At many places in the world, more than one vaccine is being administered, but presently, in no country, vaccine recipients have the option of choosing the shots," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had told reporters.Tewari had earlier too questioned the reliability of the vaccine and accused the government of misusing the situation. “The BJP government has politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety. The controversy over the vaccine is its latest manifestation. Who is going to get himself vaccinated with a vaccine that has question marks on its reliability,” he had said without naming Covaxin.Two vaccines - Oxford University's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin - have been approved for the viral disease for restricted emergency use. The shipment of both the vaccines, which will be first given to nearly 30 million health and frontline workers, has begun across cities as the nation gets in motion to kickstart the vaccination drive on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-are-not-guinea-pigs-manish-tewari-targets-govt-over-covid-19-vaccine-101610528959240.html

13-01-2021||India||Explained: How much will one dose of Covishield and Covaxin cost?||The first phase of vaccination in India in which healthcare workers will be inoculated first is all set to begin from January 16. The Centre has procured both the vaccines that have got restricted emergency use approval from the Drug Controller General of India. The procurement has been done by the Centre requiring no fund from the state government. The inoculation of frontline workers will be free of cost. But as it is not clear what will happen at the later stage when it comes to the vaccination of common people, the cost factor will come into play.Covishield vs CovaxinIndia is procuring 110 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine at the cost of ₹200 per dose. Taxes are extra. However, this is a special discount price for the Indian government. For other countries and private buyers, the price will go up beyond ₹400 per dose.Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was always said to be cheaper than Oxford vaccine, which is known as Covishield in India. But for Centre, there has not been much price difference. The Centre is procuring 38.5 lakh doses of Covaxin at a rate of ₹295 per dose. But as Bharat Biotech is also providing 16.5 lakh doses to the Centre free of cost, the cost per dose comes at ₹206.Bharat Biotech authorities earlier said that their price will be the same for everyone. Hence, it can be expected that one dose of Covaxin will cost something around ₹295.At present, states can't choose which vaccine they get, the ministry has clarified.Price of all vaccines which have been approved across the world (per dose)Pfizer-BioNTecg: ₹1,431Moderna: ₹2,348- ₹2,715Sinopharm: More than ₹5,650Sinovac Biotech: ₹1,027Novavax: ₹1,114Sputnik V: Over ₹734Johnson & Johnson: ₹734Several states including Delhi, Punjab, West Bengal, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala have promised free vaccine to all residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-what-is-the-cost-of-covishield-and-covaxin-101610526317829.html

However, the child should be called to school only with the consent of parents, following the enclosed standard operating procedure. Further, while the records of children coming to school be maintained, the same should not be used for attendance purposes as sending the child to school is completely optional for parents.”According to the circular, only schools outside containment zones will be allowed to reopen and students, teachers, and staff living in these zones will not be allowed to attend. The schools have been asked not to hold any assembly and physical outdoor activities . The principals have been asked to guide children not to share books, copies and stationary items.While the pre-board exams of Class 12 will be conducted between March 3 and April 15, for Class 10 they will be held between April 1 and April 15, the circular started.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has already announced the timeline of practical and written examinations. While practical exams will begin from March 1, written exams will be conducted between May 3 and June 10.The DoE has asked schools to provide emotional and trauma support to students and teachers upon their return to the campus. The schools have to maintain social distance of six feet, have staggered timings and maintain hygiene, among other Covid-19-appropriate guidelines already issued by the government. While a majority of the schools has welcomed the decision, several parents said they are still apprehensive about the safety of their children. Jyoti Arora, the principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “It was much needed to prepare students for hands-on practice for the forthcoming CBSE practical exams. There are also students in a class who need extra help from teachers, so it’s going to be very helpful for them. Students will be able to get detailed guidelines and supervision from teachers for projects and practical files.”Sumit Vohra, the father of a Class 10 student at DPS Vasant Kunj, said, “Whose responsibility would it be if my child is infected with the virus while attending school? I will not send my child to the school till the situation becomes totally normal. It’s good that the government has given an option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-allows-schools-to-reopen-for-classes-10-12-from-january-18-101610528122427.html

13-01-2021||India||Government plans to boost robotics, manufacturing, export of drones||The Union electronics and information technology ministry plans to boost robotics and manufacturing and export of drones under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, officials aware of the matter said.The ministry introduced the scheme last year to provide incentives of four to six percent to electronics firms for manufacturing mobile phones and other electronic equipment to boost exports.“The mobile phones PLI approximately aims to create [production worth] $8 billion... per players with overall $150 million incentives...Similarly, for drones and robotics, [it]...will be at least [production worth] $2 billion...per player,” said an official, who did not want to be named. There is an emerging market for drones and robotics and the scheme will help India capture a space in it on the global scale, the official added.Also read | India leases hi-tech US naval drones to boost surveillance, intelA second official familiar with the matter said there will be greater demand for robotics and drones with companies such as Amazon investing heavily in the latter. “All delivery services will have to reorient themselves to accommodate the new technology.”The drones are expected to be increasingly used for aerial surveys, fighting large scale insect attacks such as those by locusts last year apart from military purposes. Robotics has a huge potential in boosting healthcare services. Umakanth Soni of Robotics Technologies Park said India’s output is pretty low in the robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector. “It is great that...[the ministry] is looking at doing this [boosting robotics and manufacturing and export of drones],” Soni said.Soni said the technology park seeks to set up an ecosystem for AI and robotics in India. “Our problem primarily lies with the inability to scale these solutions [up] and manufacture them. That is a sector where we need massive support.” He said India has eight percent of the global talent in the AI sector.Soni said India needs a cluster approach that countries such as China and Israel have adopted. “AI is going to create $15.7 trillion of new economic value by 2035, according to PWC research. The AI revolution has the potential to create 133 million jobs, with a net gain of 58 million jobs.”Chirag Sharma of HubbleFly, a drone manufacturer, said there is great scope for domestic production. “...incentives would be needed. That way at least we can start research and development,” Sharma said. Experts pointed out that India’s regulatory drone policy is still in the draft stage and it will need to finalised to boost production and export of drones. The civil aviation ministry is working on the policy that will decide who can fly a drone, to where, and with what kind of payload.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-plans-to-boost-robotics-manufacturing-export-of-drones-101610526381634.html

Owners of the diesel autos have been asked to install compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion kits or replace their vehicles with electric operated vans within the revised deadline.The state cabinet on Tuesday at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar gave its nod for the transport department’s proposal to extend the deadline for ban on plying of diesel autos under Patna municipal corporation, Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwari Sharif city council limits.As per the earlier cabinet decision, diesel autos were to be banned in Danapur, Khagaul and Phulwari Sharif areas with effect from March 31, 2021. An officer of the transport department said that the deadline for plying of diesel autos was extended in keeping with the public interest, as the local transport sector was hit hard due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the state elections.This was among the 16 policy matters that the cabinet approved after discussions with the ministers and officials concerned. The unions of diesel auto drivers had also threatened to observe the government ban in breach if the deadline was not extended and appropriate facility was not developed for conversion of their autos for retrofitting with CNG kits.The cabinet also decided to hand the management and maintenance of newly created or developed public water bodies under Jal-Jivan-Haryali mission to the self-help groups of Bihar State Rural Livelihoods Mission (Jiveeka). Jiveeka volunteers have also been authorised to run community kitchens for indoor patients at all district and sub-divisional hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-to-ban-diesel-autos-in-patna-townships-extended-to-september-30-101610525714516.html

13-01-2021||India||Resort comes up in animal corridor near Assam’s Kaziranga in violation of SC order||A resort is being constructed near Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) in Assam in violation of a Supreme Court order banning construction in animal corridors. Despite the ban, work in Green Ashiyana Resort is taking place in the Haldhibari animal corridor of KNPTR amid a blame game between the state forest department and local administration. This is the second instance of construction activity near KNPTR. In July last year, HT had reported about the construction of a building in Kanchanjuri animal corridor of the park, a UNESCO world heritage site known for being the largest habitat of one-horned rhinos. Also Read: In April, 2019, acting on an application by animal activist Rohit Choudhury, the Supreme Court had “restrained” all mining activities along the southern boundary of KNPTR and in the entire catchment area of rivers/streams and rivulets originating in Karbi Anglong hill ranges and flowing into the park. “No new construction shall be permitted on private lands which form part of the nine identified animal corridors,” the order stated. But despite the Supreme Court order, constructions on private land on the animal corridors in and around KNPTR are taking place. In September last year, the centrally empowered committee of Supreme Court had written to Assam chief secretary as well as chief wildlife warden terming the violations as a “serious issue” as they amounted to contempt of the apex court. On January 4 this year, P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR, wrote to Golaghat deputy commissioner mentioning the construction of Green Ashiyana Resort in the animal corridor and urging the district administration to take action. “A boundary wall over the stream in the southern side of the resort has been constructed. During October, 2019, a wild elephant, while returning from the Karbi Anglong area to the park had got stuck inside the boundary wall enclosures of the resort,” the letter said. Despite instructions by the forest department to remove the boundary wall over the stream and allow smooth movement of wild animals, the resort authorities didn’t do anything. “There is new construction work on the eastern side. They are not allowing forest personnel to carry out road/highland work and are trying to control the temple and fishery pond which they have constructed inside,” the letter added. Golaghat deputy commissioner Bibhash Chandra Modi stated that they came to know about the construction just two days ago from the forest department. He assured that action would be taken against the resort soon.“This is a mockery and contempt of the Supreme Court order and neither forest department nor civil administration are serious in implementing the order. While the blame game continues, it is the wildlife and the environment which is getting affected. The Supreme Court should take action against the KNPTR director as well as the Golaghat DC for clear violation of its order,” said wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury. Owner of Green Ashiyana Resort, Kishore Hazarika, mentioned that he has been in occupation of the property since 2003 and till 2019 he was not informed by either forest officials or the district administration that the area is part of an animal corridor. “All this is part of a vindictive campaign against me. There is no notification yet mentioning that the area is in an animal corridor. And even if that is the case, there should be a comprehensive compensation package if action is taken against me or others who have been staying in the area,” said Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resort-comes-up-in-animal-corridor-near-assam-s-kaziranga-n-violation-of-sc-order-101610525662391.html

13-01-2021||India||NGT raps govt over delay in report on import of hazardous waste||The NGT has rapped the Environment Ministry over delay in a report by the committee which was set up to review imports of hazardous waste including tyres, lead and PCBs.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said mere constituting a committee does not serve any purpose unless the matter is taken to a logical end.The National Green Tribunal said that even though a committee is said to have been constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) more than a year ago, no reason is given why no report has been submitted.The MoEF had constituted a committee on November 29, 2019, to review import and export policy of hazardous and other waste such as tyre, textile, lead, oil, paper, glass and printed circuit board and given recommendations to the ministry.The Committee is yet to submit its report on import of paper waste, the tribunal noted."Thus, the MoEF needs to follow up so as to ensure that the requisite report becomes available at the earliest and as far as possible by April 30, 2021, so that based on such report and other material, the MoEF may take a further policy decision in the matter in the interest of the environment and public health," the bench said.The NGT had earlier directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to ensure that no plastic bag less than 50 microns of thickness be manufactured, stocked, sold and used in the country.The green panel also asked the CPCB to ensure that no unregistered plastic manufacturing and recycling unit is in operation and no unit is running in non-conforming or residential areas.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Amit Jain, who alleged that cheap waste paper and road sweep waste is imported from the US, Europe, and other places for burning in brick kilns, causing land and air pollution.“Large plastic waste yards can be seen near recycled paper mills. Import of cheap waste paper is hazardous and is affecting the environment. The import is to the extent of 9,00,000 tons of waste which generates hazardous plastic,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ngt-raps-govt-over-delay-in-report-on-import-of-hazardous-waste-101610522968756.html

The vaccines are being stored appropriately by the authorities, and would be distributed to all centres 24 hours prior to vaccination day,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant tweeted. The vaccines were shipped in from Pune via Mumbai.“The first lot of Covid-19 vaccine for Goa has reached today early morning at 0622 hrs. The two boxes received were expeditiously cleared by TEAM GOA and handed over to Health Service officials,” the Airports Authority of India Goa Airport, said in a tweet. The Goa government has said it is all set to vaccinate around 19,000 health workers initially with those among them who are above 50 years of age being given first priority. “There will be eight locations where vaccination will be done -- five government establishments and three private. Around 19,000 health workers from the government and the private sector have been identified to be vaccinated in the first phase, but on the first day, around 100 vaccines will be given from each centre so around 800 persons will be vaccinated,” Sawant had said.“Health workers are first in line followed by other frontline workers, the vaccines will be voluntary and those above 50 will be given first preference. The others will receive in subsequent phases depending on the availability of the vaccine,” Sawant said.“Our health systems are geared up and ready to issue the doses. We have had two trial runs and no substantial issues were noticed,” he added.The Goa government has identified five government health facilities, including the apex Goa Medical College, two district hospitals and two others besides three private hospitals -- Manipal Hospital, Victor Apollo hospital and the Healthway Hospital -- for the first phase of the vaccination drive.The state has conducted two trial runs for the vaccine roll-out on January 2 and January 8 to help identify issues that could crop up during the actual vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/23500-doses-of-covishield-vaccine-arrive-in-goa-101610523862233.html
13-01-2021||India||Centre seeks Supreme Court nod to make adultery punishable for armed forces||The Supreme Court on Wednesday admitted a plea by the Centre seeking clarification to prosecute armed forces personnel for adulterous acts. The Supreme Court had, in September 2018, declared the offence of adultery under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) unconstitutional. An application filed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) seeking clarification to this effect was taken up by a three-judge bench headed by Justice RF Nariman on Wednesday.Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for MoD, told the court that the September 27, 2018 judgment of the court in the Joseph Shine v Union of India case, striking down adultery as an offence could come in the way of armed forces personnel being convicted for adulterous acts under the Army Act, Navy Act and Air Force Act.Also Watch: ‘Farmers won’t participate’: Protestors reject SC order for talks with panelVenugopal said, “The Army, Navy and Air Force have provisions under which those caught in adulterous acts are liable to be punished for unbecoming conduct by which they can be court-martialed.”The application by Centre said, “The aforesaid judgment passed by this court may cause instability within the applicants services, as defence personnel are expected to function in peculiar conditions, during the course of which many a time they have to stay separated from their families for long durations, when they are posted on borders or other far-flung areas or in areas with inhospitable weather and terrain.”The plea also stated, “In view of the aforesaid judgment, there will always be a concern in the minds of the army personnel who are operating far away from their families under challenging conditions about the family indulging in untoward activity.”The bench issued notice on the application and said, “This stands on a different footing as it amounts to unbecoming conduct.”AG Venugopal said that the same needs to be clarified as in view of the Supreme Court judgment, an argument may be raised that what could not be done directly in view of aforesaid judgment is being done indirectly.The bench, also comprising justices Navin Sinha and KM Joseph, said, ‘We cannot clarify since it’s a decision by Constitution Bench.” The court issued notice and sent the matter to Chief Justice of India for constituting a five-judge bench to consider the Centre’s application.The application stated that unlike IPC Section 497, the Armed Forces do not differentiate between a man and a woman, who is subject to the Army Act, if they are guilty of an offence. In other words, the Army would equally proceed against a woman as per the Act, if she enters into an adulterous/illicit relationship. Also, Constitution’s Article 33 specifically allows Parliament to restrict or modify operation of fundamental rights with regard to armed forces. The 2018 judgment had been passed on the premise that it discriminated against women as it considered them as chattel or property of a man and only the husband of a married woman could bring a complaint against the third person involved in adulterous act. The law did not likewise punish women involved in similar relationships. However, Supreme Court held that though adultery may not be an offence, it will continue to be a ground for seeking divorce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-supreme-court-nod-to-make-adultery-punishable-for-armed-forces-101610523441889.html

Neither is KD Singh with the TMC anymore nor he is a MP now."The ED probe against Singh and a firm linked to him (Ms Alchemist Infra Realty Limited) dates back to September, 2016 when it filed a criminal case under the PMLA taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed against the company, its directors and others by market regulator SEBI.“Investigation revealed that the proceeds of crime generated by Alchemist Infra Realty Ltd were laundered through the web of companies. Investigations also revealed that the funds mobilised by the firm from various investors were never utilised for the purpose for which they were collected and the same were transferred to bank accounts of other group companies which were mainly paper companies from where they were systematically siphoned off by the accused and used to purchase properties at various locations in the country. All such assets in Punjab, Haryana , Shimla and bank accounts in HDFC Bank worth ₹239.39 crore identified during the course of investigations have been provisionally attached,” the ED said in a statement in January 2019.It has been alleged by the probe agencies that the company launched an illegal collective investment scheme, also called a ponzi or chit fund scheme, and mobilised funds of about ₹1,916 crore from the public in the years preceding 2015.The firm allegedly launched the scheme “without the approval” of the SEBI and led to cheating of gullible investors.In 2015, the firm had informed the SEBI that it had refunded ₹1,077 crore after the market regulators investigation and had sought more time to restore the rest of the amount, which was turned down by the SEBI. Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed by the SEBI in March, 2016.Singh was questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Narada sting probe as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-mp-kd-singh-arrested-by-ed-in-connection-with-money-laundering-case-101610523120877.html

On Monday, the number was 96.Flights from the UK have resumed from January 8. To contain the spread of the virus, the Delhi government has imposed additional restrictions on people coming from the UK to Delhi. Every passenger — irrespective of their test result — will have to undergo a seven-day institutional quarantine in Delhi. No other city has imposed such restrictions so far.People who are testing positive of the new virus, known to be a far more contagious strain, viare kept in single-room isolation at designated healthcare facilities by the respective state governments, the department said earlier.Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine and a comprehensive contact-tracing exercise has been initiated for the co-travellers, family members and others, the ministry said, adding that the genome sequencing of other specimens is going on.The situation is being monitored and regular advice is being given to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG laboratories.The presence of the new UK variant of the coronavirus has been reported by several countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/102-cases-of-uk-mutant-strain-in-india-so-far-confirms-health-minister-101610521717398.html

We do not want that to be repeated. There maybe a short delay of certain services where we might have to reschedule certain government programmes but no service will be completely shut in future when Covid-19 vaccination drive is on...” Bhushan said during the press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-defers-national-polio-immunisation-programme-101610521462450.html

13-01-2021||India||Bird flu impacts 3 migratory water birds, apart from poultry and crows: Centre||Bird flu has impacted the bar-headed geese, black and brown headed gulls and the Eurasian teal among migratory birds, and crows and poultry among domestic birds till now, according to the Union environment ministry.The ministry had constituted a committee comprising the inspector general, deputy inspector general of forests and wildlife and a project scientist to monitor the handling of the avian flu situation by states. The committee held a meeting with all state chief wildlife wardens on Tuesday to take stock of the situation and ensure that Centre’s advisory is being followed.“Increasing surveillance and monitoring of wild birds, particularly waterfowls, including ducks, geese, and waders in natural habitats, are therefore essential to check disease transmission. Coordination between the forest department, wetlands authority and the animal husbandry and veterinary departments at the state level is critical to ensure that transmission from wild to domestic birds and vice versa is curbed.The wildlife division of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change has also been sending advisories to the states, which need to be followed in letter and spirit. NGOs with a vast network of bird watchers and ornithologists could also be approached for their expertise and resources to monitor vulnerable areas in states, which could then be shared with the government agencies for further action,” said Dipankar Ghose, director, wildlife and habitats programme, WWF India.Also Read: Bird flu spreads to forests, triggers concerns about safety of endangered species“The wildlife wardens have been asked to coordinate with state governments and the ministry of animal husbandry and fisheries everyday. They have also been asked to ensure states are complying with the advisory issued to them and that any bird deaths or suspicious cases have to be reported to us,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general (wildlife).“We are keeping a watch on any new species contracting the virus. As of now cases have been reported from protected and forest areas of Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat.According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), bar-headed geese are in abundance hence they are of “least concern” but their numbers are declining. They breed in Afghanistan,Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation (Central Asian Russia) and Tajikistan, and have a very large range.“Most migratory waterfowl species are known to be carriers of the H5N1 virus. After the infection surfaced in Himachal Pradesh, it has been reported in six to seven states. Most recently reports of red junglefowls have come in. They are a relatively rugged species so its very surprising that they contracted the virus. The avian influenza virus normally doesn’t jump over to humans but can be easily transmitted from migratory species to domestic birds and has great potential to completely damage our poultry—birds and even pigs,” said Bivash Pandav, director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), who has specialised in research of water birds.He cautioned that the possibility of endangered bird species contracting the virus cannot be ruled out. “We have to be extremely watchful and monitor wetlands and other wintering grounds. You cannot catch migratory birds and vaccinate them. All you can do is protect other species like vultures etc. A lot of precaution must be exercised in zoos. This epidemic cannot be taken lightly as the virus mutates and evolves very quickly,” he added. Birders and nature lovers can help in reporting cases of dead or sick birds, but Pandav cautioned that they avoid going close to the birds.According to an advisory by the environment ministry, affected birds display symptoms such as tremors, diarrhoea, head tilt and paralysis. The disease spreads quickly, causing paralysis and staggering. The advisory to state chief wildlife wardens says an action plan should be prepared for monitoring the migratory birds and dealing with any emergency. Dead birds should be handled with utmost caution and scientific supervision and surveillance should not be restricted to the protected areas alone, but to all such wetlands and habitats that provide grounds to the migrating birds and to areas where there is a possibility of interaction of migratory birds and poultry such as backyard poultry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-impacts-3-migratory-water-birds-apart-from-poultry-and-crows-centre-101610518281890.html

13-01-2021||India||Bolster India’s rise to counter China challenge: Secret US strategy for Indo-Pacific||A secret US strategy for the Indo-Pacific framed in 2018 envisaged bolstering India’s capacities so that it could work with other like-minded countries to act as “a counterbalance to China” and maintain the capacity to counter challenges from Beijing such as “border provocations” and access to cross-border rivers. The strategy, framed more than two years before the India-China military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), makes more than 20 mentions of India and sees the country as “preeminent in South Asia” and taking on “the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security” while increasing engagement with Southeast Asia and expanding economic and defence cooperation with other US allies and partners. Also Read: Will stand ground at LAC, says army chiefOn the other hand, the document, classified “secret” and “not for foreign nationals”, sees China as a strategic competitor to the US intent on dissolving American alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and circumventing “international rules and norms to gain an advantage”. It also states China will use its dominance in cutting edge technologies to “pose profound challenges to free societies”. Under the US system, such documents usually remain secret for up to three decades but the Trump administration’s National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien declassified the 10-page strategy with slight redactions on January 5. Experts believe this was done to signal continuity of the US’s Indo-Pacific strategy to key partners such as India, Australia and Japan amid the change in administration in Washington. The strategy is based on the assumption that a “strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China”, and that New Delhi’s “preferred partner on security issues” is Washington. Among the “desired end states” or goals of the strategy is India-US cooperation to “preserve maritime security and counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia and other regions of mutual concern”, and India maintaining “the capacity to counter border provocations by China”. The strategy also sets the goal of ensuring that India remains “preeminent in South Asia and takes the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security, increases engagement with Southeast Asia, and expands its economic, defense, and diplomatic cooperation with other US allies and partners in the region”. The strategy states that the US will take action on several fronts, including diplomatic, military and intelligence, to “accelerate India’s rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security and Major Defense Partner” and to address challenges emanating from China, including the border dispute. Among the actions the US will take in this regard is offering “support to India – through diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels – to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China and access to water, including the Brahmaputra and other rivers facing diversion by China”. The US will also “solidify an enduring strategic partnership with India underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the United States and our partners in the region to address shared interests”. According to the document, the US will build a “stronger foundation for defense cooperation and interoperability; expand our defense trade and ability to transfer defense technology to enhance India’s status as a Major Defense Partner; increase our cooperation on shared regional security concerns and encourage India’s engagement beyond the Indian Ocean Region”. The US will also support India’s bid for membership of the Nuclear Supplier’s Group, and work “with India toward domestic economic reform and an increased leadership role in the East Asia Summit (EAS) and ADMM+ (Asean Defence Ministers Meeting” Over the past three years, the US has signed three key defence agreements, one at each of the 2+2 ministerial meetings, to facilitate the real-time sharing of sensitive military information and transfer of sophisticated technology. These agreements are the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), the Industrial Security Annex to the General Security of Military Information Agreement, and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). In a recent farewell address, outgoing US ambassador Kenneth Juster had specifically referred to these agreements and said concluding them had elevated the bilateral defence partnership. During the same event, Juster had said the US was “very supportive” amid the India-China border standoff but declined to go into details. “We both share a vision of the Indo-Pacific region...and that is an inclusive vision that provides opportunities for all countries to grow and prosper but also wants to avoid incursions of any type, intimidations and predatory financing, and when there’s a situation that is along those lines, we cooperate to try to resist it,” he had said. The four members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – elevated the body to the ministerial level in 2019 and the second ministerial meeting was held in Tokyo last year. Ahead of that meeting, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo had spoken about plans to formalise the Quad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bolster-india-s-rise-to-counter-china-challenge-secret-us-strategy-for-indopacific-101610512761615.html

A division bench of Chief Justice TB Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee directed the state’s chief secretary on Friday to file an affidavit on Tuesday on the measures for the dip in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This [affidavit] will enable the Court to assess the situation and decide whether or not the Ganga Sagar Mela should be permitted to be held this year keeping in mind the pandemic situation and the paramount interest of public health at large,” the bench said.The Mela is held on the Sagar Island in West Bengal in mid-January every year. It is the second-largest congregation of pilgrims in India after the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. Around five million pilgrims from across India took the holy dip to celebrate Makar Sankranti, the first major Hindu festival in the Gregorian calendar, last year.The state government has for the first time made provisions for pilgrims to watch the Mela live on the internet. Pilgrims can book an online pilgrimage package comprising Ganga Jal in a container, prasad, and the holy tika for e-snan (e-holy dip).The court earlier directed the state government to inform the pilgrims about the risks of taking the holy dip during the pandemic. Sabysachi Chatterjee, the lawyer who filed a petition over the Mela, said the court was primarily satisfied with the state government’s arrangements but said it was susceptible about how the effectuation of the measures could be achieved.In October, the court banned the entry of visitors into Durga Puja pandals amid muted celebrations because of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-to-decide-today-whether-ganga-sagar-mela-can-be-held-101610511741857.html

13-01-2021||India||Take precautions even after Covid vaccine: Bihar govt tells health workers||The Bihar government has cautioned healthcare workers to continue taking precautions against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) even after taking vaccine shots, as it braced up to inoculate over 467,000 healthcare workers in the state during the first phase of vaccination from January 16. Precautions are necessary as it takes 14 days after the second shot of the vaccine to develop protective antibody, said top health officials. The gap between the two shots of vaccine is 28 days. “One has to maintain social distancing, use hand sanitiser and mask even after taking Covid-19 vaccine. It takes at least 14 days after the second shot of vaccine to develop antibody against coronavirus,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH). “The first shot is a priming dose, then the booster dose is given after 28 days that completes the vaccination process. It will take 14 days from the second shot to develop protective antibody level in an individual. So, those taking the vaccine should not immediately become complacent after taking the first or the second shot,” he added. In order to dispel any myth surrounding around the vaccine, Singh has decided to take the first shot of the vaccine at the NMCH, which is one of the 16 session sites or vaccination centres in Patna and among 300 in Bihar selected for vaccination on the inaugural day of vaccination on January 16. The first batch of 54,900 vials of Covishield vaccine that will suffice for 549,000 doses, reached Patna by air from Pune on Tuesday. The second consignment of vaccines is expected to arrive either later this month or early next month, said a senior state health officer.Some Opposition leaders have raised doubts about the efficacy of the indigenous vaccines after the drug controller general of India, earlier this month, gave its nod for restricted emergency use of two vaccines — Covaxin of the Bharat Biotech and Covishield of Serum Institute of India. The ministry of health and family welfare also emphasises on social distancing, use of hand sanitiser and mask and regular hand-washing in its frequently asked questions section on vaccination. Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit, also dwelt on this fact while making a presentation on state’s vaccination preparedness to the chief secretary Deepak Kumar. The video conference on Monday was attended by district magistrates (DMs) and civil surgeons of all 38 districts as well as principals and superintendents of nine government and five private medical colleges in the state. The health department, in keeping with the Centre’s guidelines, has asked DMs, civil surgeons, principals and superintendents of government and private medical colleges to make arrangements for video-webcasting at session sites for monitoring and surveillance purpose. It has also asked the officials to arrange for Anaphylaxis kit (to treat an acute and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction after vaccination) and adverse effect following immunisation (AEFI) kit at all session sites. It also asked them to ensure training of vaccinators and medical officers in each vaccination team on use of these kits. AEFI committees, comprising doctors from different disciplines, have also been notified in medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-precautions-even-after-covid-vaccine-bihar-govt-tells-health-workers-101610511321578.html

He added the launch of the vaccination drive did not mean the end of the pandemic. Prasad warned the people against lowering their guard and asked them to follow Covid protocol strictly.“In the last 24 hours, 511 cases have been reported from across Uttar Pradesh...vaccination of all will take time. Till the vaccination, people should remain alert and cover their faces with masks, wash hands regularly, and maintain social distancing.

We do not want that to be repeated. There maybe a short delay of certain services where we might have to reschedule certain programmes but no service will be shut in future when Covid-19 vaccination drive is on. And since governments are guided by scientific norms and standard operating procedures, and therefore, transparent, we would expect that everyone would scrupulously follow these SOPs while the vaccination rolls out in the country. Also, the entire process is technology driven,” he said.Also read | ‘When every moment counted’, tweets minister Hardeep Puri on vaccine driveBhushan also reiterated that there will be a sequential roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine, depending on the availability of the vaccine.The roll-out of Covid-19 vaccine will provide priority to the healthcare workers and the frontline workers who are estimated to be around 30 million, followed by those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities numbering around 270 million. The vaccination drive will begin with 10 million healthcare workers from across the country on January 16. Three phases of dry runs have already been conducted across the country, with the third dry run having been conducted on Friday across 615 districts covering 4,895 session sites in 33 States/UTs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-could-take-a-year-or-more-health-ministry-101610508380626.html

13-01-2021||India||NW India records very poor AQI; dense fog also likely: IMD||Many towns and cities in northwest India recorded very poor quality air on Wednesday morning. This includes Delhi with an air quality index (AQI) of 341, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Noida, Rohtak etc.This in spite of strong winds of 15 to 25 kmph blowing during the day. Higher air pollution levels are likely to be due to reduced wind speed in the morning and moisture in the air which tends to make pollution particles heavy and cling together. Dense fog is also likely in many parts of NW India on Wednesday morning.Many stations recorded cold day/severe cold day and cold wave on Tuesday. “There is uplifted fog and cloud cover in many parts of NW India because of which the day temperatures are falling, nights are also very cold. This is because an intense Western Disturbance has passed on January 8 and northwesterly winds are blowing from the direction of the snow-clad Himalayas. The feels-like temperature in many parts of northwest India is at least 2 degrees lower because of chilly winds and cold days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the regional weather forecasting Centre.The feels-like temperature takes into account wind speeds and humidity to assess how the human body actually perceives the temperature. In winter, a strong wind can make a day feel much colder than what the measured temperature would indicate.Shrivastava added, “The minimum and maximum temperatures may fall by 1 or 2 degrees in the next three days and both a cold day and cold wave may be recorded over many places including Delhi.”There is no likelihood of a Western Disturbance affecting the Western Himalayan region for four to five days during which period, the temperatures are likely to be lower than normal and winds are likely to be northwesterly. Some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Rajasthan recorded cold wave and severe cold wave conditions on Monday and Tuesday according to the Regional Meteorological Centre.IMD has warned of minimum and maximum temperatures falling further in the coming days. Amid the prevalence of north/northwesterly winds, minimum temperatures are likely to be below normal over most parts of northwest India during Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Dense or very dense fog is expected to envelop parts of the regionCold Wave/ Severe Cold Wave conditions are also likely over some parts over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and in isolated parts over Uttar Pradesh, north Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan during the next three days. Ground frost is likely in isolated pockets over south Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and north Rajasthan during the next two days. Dense to very dense fog conditions are likely in some places.Cold day conditions intensified on Tuesday with Delhi’s Palam recording 14.8 degrees C, 5.7 degrees C below normal; Chandigarh 11.1 degrees C, 9.6 degrees C below normal; Ambala 12.6 degrees C, 6.7 degrees C below normal; Gorakhpur 15.2 degrees C, 7.3 degrees C below normal; and Rohtak 14.9 degrees C, 5.7 degrees C below normal.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degrees C or 6.4 degrees C below normal, respectively.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees C in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nwindia-records-very-poor-aqi-dense-fog-also-likelyimd-101610507061057.html

First we need to listen to farmers, if they have any misconception about Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), we will clear it, they need to be assured that whatever is happening is in their interest," Ghanwat told news agency ANI.Also Read: Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws, forms 4-member committeeSC on Tuesday, after putting a stay on the farm laws' implementation, formed a four-member panel to listen to grievances of the protesting farmers and the point of view of the government on the issue. The committee is to submit its report to the court on the same within two months."Several farmer leaders and unions want freedom from the monopoly of APMC, this need to be stopped and farmers should be given the freedom to sell their crop. This has been a demand for the last 40 years. Farmers who want MSP should get it and those who want freedom from it should also have an option," Ghanwat further said.Also Read: Farmers say copies of new laws will be burnt on LohriMeanwhile, farmers' leaders rejected the committee formed by the SC on the grounds that all its members were 'pro-farm laws'. According to the farmers' leaders, the committee has been formed by the government through SC and all its members have supported the new legislation at one point or another.However, according to Ghanwat, farmers' fears are not justified. "It is a total misconception. Ashok Gulati is not a political leader or even part of any group, he is an agricultural economist. I have been neutral on this, I have never worked for any political party but only in favour of farmers, and whatever happens in the coming days, we will try our best to get the issue resolved in favour of all farmers of the nation, not just for farmers of Maharashtra or Punjab," he said.The other three members of the committee appointed by the top court are Bhupinder Singh Mann, President of Bharatiya Kisan Union's Mann faction, Pramod Kumar Joshi Director of International Food Policy Research Institute and agricultural economist Ashok Gulati.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-will-get-justice-says-anil-ghanwat-member-of-sc-panel-on-farm-laws-101610501185536.html
13-01-2021||India||Opposition welcomes top court order, urges Centre to repeal laws||The opposition parties on Tuesday welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to stay the implementation of the three farm laws with the Congress flagging concerns over the composition of the four-member panel formed to end the impasse between farm unions and the central government.Calling the formation of the committee “well-intentioned”, senior Congress leader P Chidambram tweeted: “The decision to form a committee to help find a solution is well-intentioned. However, the composition of the four-member committee is puzzling and sends contradictory signals.”The committee comprises Bhupinder Singh Mann, president of Bharatiya Kisan Union; Anil Ghanwat, president of the Shetkari Sangathana; Pramod Kumar Joshi, former director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; and economist Ashok Gulati.Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the members of the committee have expressed support for the new laws. “So, the question arises in our minds that how justice will be done to farmers by them. How can anyone trust a committee whose members have already spoken so loudly in favour of Modi government’s draconian farm laws,” he said.Thousands of farmers have massed Delhi’s borders in protest against the new laws that they say will leave them vulnerable to the big agribusinesses. The government has maintained that the laws will open up agricultural markets and help in increasing farm incomes.Welcoming the Supreme Court stay on the laws, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar tweeted, “It is a big relief for farmers and I hope that a concrete dialogue between the Central government and farmers will be initiated now, keeping the farmers interests and well-being in mind.”Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin said, “I once again urge the Union government to commit to repealing the farm laws in the next Parliament session.” Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “It is clear that these farm laws are not for the welfare of our farmers but for the corporate only.”Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, however, were cautious in their response to the apex court’s order.“There are some people who feel there was no or not good enough grounds for staying the laws, but now that the honourable court has made a decision, it now rests on the farmers to come to the discussion table,” said a senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli attacked the Congress for its criticism of the court-appointed committee. The Congress’s stand is a “classic testimony towards its duplicity and opportunistic politics practised since 2005”, he was quoted as saying by PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-welcomes-top-court-order-urges-centre-to-repeal-laws-101610498487989.html
13-01-2021||India||Khalistanis have infiltrated farmers’ protest: Govt in SC||The central government on Tuesday said in the Supreme Court that “Khalistani” secessionists had infiltrated the farmers’ protest on Delhi borders and were trying to influence participants.Attorney general KK Venugopal made this claim before a bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde that enquired about statements in this regard made by some other lawyers during the hearing on the farm laws. Senior advocates Harish Salve and PS Narasimha, appearing for different parties in the matter, had raised the issue of those with “vested interests” taking advantage of the protests to further their “oblique motives”.Salve contended that there were banners of the Canada-based banned outfit Sikhs for Justice that had come up at the protest sites. “This is a banned outfit which is advertising to pay ₹25,000 to anyone who joins these protests. They are furthering their oblique motive under the garb of the farmers’ protest,” he said.Narasimha supported Salve in his submission. He said there was a formal application in this regard, with pictures of such banners and Facebook messages about money for joining the protest. “These kinds of protests can be dangerous,” he said. At this, the bench asked the AG if the assertion made before it was true and the law officer replied in the affirmative. “We have been informed there is Khalistani infiltration in the protests,” said Venugopal, adding that he would file an affidavit along with necessary inputs from the Intelligence Bureau.The bench asked Venugopal to file the affidavit by Wednesday. Later, when the bench released its order of the day, it recorded these apprehensions: “Laudably, the farmers have so far carried on the agitation peacefully and without any untoward incident. But it was pointed out in the course of hearing that a few persons who are not farmers have also joined, with a view to show solidarity with the farmers.”“A specific averment is made in an intervention application filed by one Indian Kisan Union, in... that an organisation by name ‘Sikhs for Justice’, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. This averment is supported by the learned Attorney General also,” the order added.The court will take up this plea on January 18 along with Delhi Police’s request to stop the farmers from taking out a tractor rally or procession in any other form on or around Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khalistanis-have-infiltrated-farmers-protest-govt-in-sc-101610498277866.html

The vaccines will dispatched on Wednesday to 10 regional vaccine stores in districts such as East Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga.Punjab received its first consignment of 20,004 vials of the Covishield vaccine, which would be distributed to district headquarters in special vans, said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajeev Bhaskar. Chandigarh received 1,200 vials.Odisha kept its first consignment in a cold room at the airport before the vials were sent to state vaccine centres. Insulated vaccine vans from every district will be stationed at the centre to carry the vials to district vaccine stores, said Bijay Panigrahi, state nodal officer for the Covid-19 vaccination drive.Assam and Meghalaya were the first states in the northeast to receive the Covid-19 vaccineAfter receiving its first batch of the Serum Institute vaccine, Tamil Nadu is expecting a second batch, from Bharat Biotech, on Wednesday, said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. He said the vaccines were dispatched from Chennai to 10 regional centres including Coimbatore, Trichy and Madurai. “The vaccination is entirely voluntary,” Radhakrishnan told reporters, adding that 2,000 vaccination centres had been readied in the state.As the vaccine arrived, Tamil Nadu and the Union territory of Puducherry announced that immunisation would be free fore everyone.The Bihar government has already made a similar announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-mega-inoculation-drive-vaccines-reach-14-cities-101610495773505.html
13-01-2021||India||House panel may summon FB on WhatsApp privacy policy||The Parliamentary Panel on Information Technology is likely to summon Facebook officials in the wake of privacy concerns about WhatsApp, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.“The issue was discussed, but not as a matter of formalised discussion,” a person aware of the proceedings of the meeting held on Tuesday said. “You can expect the panel to take up the matter.”The new privacy policy, which was rolled out by WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, last week, includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists.The move has faced massive backlash globally, with users en masse defecting to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.The panel, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, may also plan to summon Twitter. “The companies will have to come in and clarify whether they are intermediaries or publishers,” said a second person familiar with the matter. “The issue of taking down of people’s accounts arbitrarily may also be raised. The exact date of the meeting has not yet been set, but it will happen in the coming weeks.”A third person familiar with the matter said that issue of Twitter’s “arbitrary” ban of US President Donal Trump, in the aftermath of an armed insurrection by his supporters on the Capitol building in Washington, was raised by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey and Congress MP Karti Chidambaram. “If they are intermediaries, how can they ban someone. Today, its Donald Trump, tomorrow it will be someone else,” said the third person.The issue of data privacy was raised by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, and supported by other MPs, the third person mentioned above said. “If WhatsApp says its data is end-to-end encrypted, how can it be shared with someone else? This raises serious concerns about data privacy. Moreover, in this case, why can’t they share the data with the government of India,” the third person added.The panel met on Tuesday to hear from the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the nodal agency for Aadhaar. The second person quoted above said UIDAI told the panel that it had managed to completely universalise the Aadhaar services, except in the states of Assam and Meghalaya. Facebook’s handling of data has already been an issue, which has been raised by a joint parliamentary committee and the IT panel in the past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-may-summon-fb-on-whatsapp-privacy-policy-101610487234421.html
13-01-2021||India||Will stand ground at LAC, says army chief||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China to reduce tensions in the sensitive sector are “prolonged,” even as he described a joint threat from China and Pakistan as “very potent”.He said India should not read too much into the recent withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no reduction of troops by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector, where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.Hindustan Times reported on Monday that the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but the PLA’s frontline deployments remain unchanged.Gen Naravane told reporters at his customary annual press conference ahead of Army Day on January 15 that he was hopeful the ongoing dialogue with China would yield an “amicable solution,” but stressed that the operational preparedness of the army was of high order and the force was ready to deal with any eventuality. The two armies are due to hold the ninth round of talks between their senior commanders to resolve the lingering border dispute that has brought chill to ties.“Eight rounds of talks have taken place between military commanders and each of these rounds has either been preceded or followed by diplomatic level engagement. We will ensure that through the medium of these talks we reach a solution which is acceptable and not detrimental to our interests. And if the talks get prolonged, so be it. We are prepared to hold our ground for as long as it takes to achieve our national goals and interests,” the army chief said.His remarks convey two important things, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “First, it is a declaration of resolve and intent to continue with a strong posture along the LAC till the time the matter is resolved to India’s satisfaction and that time is not of paramount importance. Secondly, it also shows that an early resolution appears unlikely, most probably due to the positions of both sides being quite different on the terms of disengagement and de-escalation,” Hooda said.Naravane said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.“On the situation at the northern borders, we are carrying out certain studies.We carry out a periodic review of our operational plans and our strategies to deal with various threats — both external (one front or two fronts) and internal. And based on these reviews, a certain amount of rebalancing does happen...,” the army chief said. He said the army was focused not only on eastern Ladakh but along the border with China — stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand to Arunachal Pradesh.“There is no eyeball-to-eyeball deployment in the central and eastern sectors but friction points are there. In these areas, China has built a lot of infrastructure on its side, including roads and barracks. We monitor all these developments and factor them in when we devise a new strategy,” he said.He said various Chinese army units and formations come to the Tibetan plateau for their summer training and go back when the winter sets in.“We should not read too much into their presence or absence in these training areas.These areas are well in depth and are as much as 500 km to 1,500 km away from the border. All the same, we keep an eye on their deployments on the Tibetan plateau because these are the forces that could be mobilised and sent to the borders in 24 to 48 hours…However, what is more important is that in the border areas where there is eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation,there has been no reduction of troops.That is where we have to be more concerned and careful,” Gen Naravane said.On the origin of the border row with China, Naravane said the army had full details of where the PLA was training in the Ladakh theatre last summer but the latter had the “first-mover advantage” that can never be predicted.He said the Indian Army exploited the same advantage last August when it moved swiftly and occupied strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.“They (PLA) come for training every year and we had full details of the areas they were present in. We were regularly monitoring the situation. But suddenly they had the first-mover advantage. This first-mover advantage will always remain, like we had in the month of August. Even though we were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact,China had no clue that we would surprise them,” he said.The Indian Army swiftly occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The army chief said that there was no doubt that India faced a collusive threat from China and Pakistan.“This is not just something that was part of some strategic paper or loud thought process.It is very much manifesting itself on the ground. There is indeed increased cooperation between China and Pakistan in both military and non-military fields. And a two-front threat is something that we have to be prepared for. And in dealing with such a threat, we have to see which threat is more serious, prioritise it and deal with it first,” he said.The two countries together pose a very potent threat that cannot be wished away and the army keeps that element in mind during its strategic planning, he said.The army chief said that the force was reducing its footprint in the North-east with the security situation there improving manifold in recent years. He said one brigade had been relieved of counter-insurgency duties and two more would follow suit. “We are drawing down in the North-east.It will help us focus more on our primary task, which is dealing with external threats,” he said.On a recent controversial one-man study — published by a think tank — that said half of the army was under stress, Naravane said it was based on a highly inadequate sample size of just 400 people. “For 99% accuracy, the sample size should have been 19,000.”On a lighter note, he said maybe there is stress in the army and “I am also stressed”.Stress is not always bad as it can also get work done, he said, adding that measures were in place to deal with the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-stand-ground-at-lac-says-army-chief-101610484171684.html
13-01-2021||India||SC stays farm laws, sets up committee to hear all sides||The Supreme Court on Tuesday took the unprecedented step of staying the three contentious farm laws that have brought tens of thousands of protesting farmers to Delhi’s doorstep, and formed a four-member committee to discuss the legislation with both farmers and the government and make recommendations to the court, though the move left protesting farm unions unimpressed.The unions insisted that the protest would continue, and pointed out that all members of the court-appointed committee, Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi (agricultural economist, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati (agriculture economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices), Bhupinder Singh Mann (national president, Bhartiya Kisan Union and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), and Anil Ghanwat (president, Shetkari Sanghatana), have previously indicated their support for the laws.The court’s decision, which buys the government time — the committee is to hold its first sitting within 10 days, and the court will next hear the case after eight weeks — comes after eight rounds of talks with farmers failed to resolve the deadlock. The court also agreed to hear the government’s application seeking an injunction against a proposed tractor march that could disrupt celebrations of the Republic Day on January 26. The Centre, in an application filed through Delhi Police, said any such march would cause “embarrassment to the nation”. The unions said they would go ahead with the next round of talks with the government on January 15.While putting the laws on hold amid massive protests at Delhi’s borders, the court held that suspension of the legislation “may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith”.The court also directed that the minimum support price (MSP) system, in existence before the enactment of the new laws, shall be maintained until further orders. “In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws,” ordered the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.At the same time, the court also urged the farmers to consider calling off their protests in view of the “extraordinary order” issued to suspend the laws.T he bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, expressed hope that the stay order will be perceived by the farmers as an “achievement” and will prompt them “to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others”.It observed that all those interested in solving the problem should go to the four-member panel that will look into problem areas and report within two months. While the farm unions have said they will continue to push for a complete repeal of the laws, several opposition politicians saw the court’s order as a victory for them, though some others pointed out that the farmers are unlikely to get justice from the committee.“I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court to stay the #FarmLaws in the cases filed by various parties including DMK. This is a victory for farmers protesting across India. I once again urge the Union Govt to commit to repealing the farm laws in the next Parliament Session,” Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin said on Twitter.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “All four members (of the panel) are known to have taken a public stand in favour of the laws.They have said that the farmers are being misled. How can such a committee do justice to the farmers?”The court order added that representatives of all the farmers’ bodies “shall participate in the deliberations of the committee”. In the 11-page order, it said the panel was constituted to listen to the grievances of farmers and the views of the government and to make recommendations to be considered by the bench.During Tuesday’s hearing, the court took note that senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who appeared on behalf of the farmers’ unions a day ago and had sought time to convey the willingness of the union leaders to join the deliberations before the committee, was absent. The CJI, however, remarked that his absence should not deter the bench from passing an order to constitute a committee, which, he said, was only for the purposes of assisting the court and would be a part of the judicial proceedings.“We want to solve this problem.That is why we want to form this committee. Members of the bar must show some loyalty to the judicial process.This is not politics. There is a difference between politics and a judicial process. You cannot come here and tell us all negative things. Members of the bar must cooperate,” said the bench as advocates ML Sharma and AP Singh contended that farmers did not want to go before any committee.It added: “No power can stop us from setting up a committee to evaluate the pros and cons of the farm laws and it will be part of the judicial process.”Attorney general KK Venugopal, representing the government, supported the court’s view to have a committee for resolution of disputes.On his part, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for a Delhi resident, told the bench that the order should be worded in a manner that it should not sound like a victory to any one side.“It will be a victory of fair play. But we are also making it clear that suspension of the laws will not be indefinitely and it will not be an empty formality. There cannot be empty suspension of the legislations without any purpose. Everyone interested in solving the problem should go to the committee. The committee will not punish you but will only listen to you and will give us a report. Everyone will have to cooperate,” emphasised the CJI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-farm-laws-sets-up-committee-to-hear-all-sides-101610483262758.html
13-01-2021||India||People won’t be given vaccine choice: Govt||Vaccine recipients will not get to choose which shot they take, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc., or Bharat Biotech International’s Covaxin, which it has developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), for protection against Covid-19.Both vaccine candidates have won approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) although Covaxin is still in Phase 3 trials.“Several countries in the world are using more than one Covid-19 vaccine to inoculate their citizens. In none of these countries are beneficiaries being offered an option of choosing which vaccine to take,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday.Recipients will get two doses of a vaccine four weeks apart.“The current recommendations are very clear that it will be given at day zero and at day 28, four weeks apart, and as has been pointed out, the effect will come after two weeks. At the moment we are just considering 0 to 28 days, and we would like to focus on that,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of ICMR.“There is some literature in the world which is showing that you can give up to six weeks {apart}, and some countries are also discussing whether it can be given at a bigger gap but at the moment we would like to stick to four weeks, and would like our first phase {of vaccination} to be at four weeks till more knowledge is attained,” he added.The government is looking at staggering the procurement of vaccine doses rather than placing a bulk order even as both the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech have stockpiled enough vials to meet initial demand in the country, which will immunise 30 million health-care and front-line workers at the vanguard of the fight against Covid-19 before turning its attention to 270 million people aged above 50 and those with comorbidities.“We would be staggering our supply orders. We are aware of this, and people who are manufacturing and supplying the vaccine are also aware of it,” said Bhushan.The Indian government has procured 11 million doses of Covishield from Serum Institute at a cost of ₹200 per dose, exclusive of taxes. Of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, the number is 5.5 million doses, of which 1.65 million doses are being procured free of cost, and the remaining 3.85 million doses are being purchased at a cost of ₹295 per dose, exclusive of taxes, making the net cost of a Covaxin dose ₹206 per dose.“We wanted to share the prices so that the less than adequately informed discussions on the topic should end,” said Bhushan.Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the launch of the vaccination drive across the country on January 16. Close to 30 virtual meetings have been held between the Centre and states to review preparations.“The Centre is very closely collaborating with the states and Union territories for rolling out the vaccination on January 16, 2021. Since different individuals will be discharging different duties they need to be trained as per the best of their ability,” said Bhushan.The government has trained 2,360 master trainers, who in turn have trained 61,000 programme managers, 200,000 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members so far.“Each vaccination team will have five members, of which there will be one vaccinator. The four other team members also need to be adequately trained which is why so many people had to be trained for the launch… this exercise will last may be for beyond one year..,” Bhushan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-won-t-be-given-vaccine-choice-govt-101610481689050.html
13-01-2021||India||Vaccine vials land in city, Serum moves 6.4m doses||Marking a milestone about 10 months after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) gripped the country, India on Tuesday dispatched about 6.44 million doses of the Covishield vaccine to 14 cities from its manufacturer’s Pune headquarters, setting in motion a massive inoculation drive that will begin this weekend.At 4:53am, three temperature-controlled trucks escorted by police vehicles left the Serum Institute of India (SII)’s building on the outskirts of Pune for the airport, carrying vials of the vaccine that, along with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, has been okayed by the drug controller for restricted emergency use.Pune deputy commissioner of police Namrata Patil, accompanied by SII staff, cracked open a coconut — believed to be auspicious — to flag off the vehicles that left the premises.“Our trucks left the SII facility early morning and now the vaccine is being distributed in the entire country. This is a proud and historic moment as scientists, experts and all other stakeholders took great efforts while making this vaccine in less than a year,” said SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla, whose organisation is conducting clinical trials and manufacturing the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine.The first consignment of 264,000 doses of Covishield reached Delhi’s central storage facility at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital (RGSSH) in the afternoon around high security, according to officials aware of the developments.Twenty-two boxes containing 1,200 vials each of the vaccine was brought to the hospital’s utility block that has been retrofitted with 90 deep freezers, which can store 4.1 million doses of the vaccine.“Each of the vials (5 millilitres) contains 10 doses (0.5ml each) of the vaccine. So far, Delhi has received 264,000 vaccine doses that will be almost enough for the health care workers in the city,” said a senior government official who asked not to be named.At the start of the vaccination drive beginning this Saturday, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 million health care and frontline workers (employees across government departments, the police and civic bodies). Next on the priority list are an estimated 270 million people (those above 50 years of age, and people with serious comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension). This exercise, according to some estimates, could take at least seven months.A SpiceJet flight carrying the vials landed at the Delhi airport around 10am. The Delhi Police formed a “green corridor” to safely transport the vaccines to the hospital, which received the consignment around 3pm.“There are three levels of security that will be in place (in the hospital).There are CCTV cameras installed within and outside the building. There are hospital guards stationed at the vaccine store round the clock, and police personnel deployed outside the store,” said Dr Chhavi Gupta, a spokesperson for RGSSH.In the national capital, the vaccination drive will be launched at 89 centres (49 private and 40 public health care facilities) that are part of the 5,000 sites approved by the Centre across the country. Delhi has pegged the number of health care workers at 300,000, of which around 225,000 have already been registered with the government.“Delhi is fully prepared and all preparations are in place,” health minister Satyendar Jain said.Apart from Delhi, vials of the vaccine were flown to Chennai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Shillong, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Chandigarh. On Tuesday, four airlines (Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir) operated nine flights to transport 5.47 million doses of the vaccine to these cities across the country.Separately, Maharashtra minister Rajesh Tope said his state, too, received the first consignment of 963,000 doses by road and that the vaccine will be distributed among 511 camps covering all districts. “We have also developed 3,135 cold chains to be used for storing the vaccines,” he said in Mumbai.The Indian government has procured 11 million doses of Covishield from SII — the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume — at a cost of ₹200 per dose, exclusive of taxes.For Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin (it is still in Phase 3 trials), the number is 5.5 million doses, of which 1.65 million doses are being procured free of cost, and the remaining 3.85 million doses are being purchased at a cost of ₹295 per dose, exclusive of taxes, making the net cost of a Covaxin dose ₹206.In case of both vaccines, recipients will get two doses four weeks apart and the effects will start showing 14 days after the second dose.“The Centre is very closely collaborating with the states and Union Territories for rolling out the vaccination on January 16, 2021. Since different individuals will be discharging different duties they need to be trained as per the best of their ability,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a briefing.The government has trained 2,360 master trainers, who in turn have trained 61,000 programme managers, 200,000 vaccinators and 370,000 other vaccination team members so far.Health authorities in states have said they would make use of experience gained from running regular child immunisation programmes for polio to ensure full coverage in what they called the world’s biggest vaccination drive. “The vaccine is here even then that doesn’t take away the fact that people will still have to observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour such wearing a mask, maintaining hand hygiene and ensuring physical distancing,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of premier scientific body Indian Council of Medical Research.As of Tuesday, India has reported 10,495,813 cases of the viral infection while 1,51,581 people have died in the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-vials-land-in-city-serum-moves-6-4m-doses-101610480872820.html
13-01-2021||India||Panellists have been in favour of new laws||A committee of four formed by the Supreme Court to examine three contentious agricultural laws has people who mostly believe in freer markets and economic reforms, analyses of their publicly held positions on agricultural issues show.All four members proposed for the committee — economists Ashok Gulati and PK Joshi as well as farm activists Anil Ghanwat and Bhupinder Singh Mann — have either publicly endorsed the laws or want them amended.That is a gripe among farm unions protesting the laws they say will hurt their livelihoods.The protesting farmers on Tuesday said they didn’t want to be part of the committee because its views in favour of the laws were well-documented. The farmers, in any case, have held that their opposition was not to the validity of the laws but to how they were “anti-farmer”, and therefore they needed to be repealed, not amended.A key figure in the committee, economist Ashok Gulati, has been arguing for decades for a market-led, enterprise-driven agricultural economy, which supports half of all Indians but is largely an antiquated sector.Gulati is an agricultural economist who knows policymaking firsthand, has held public positions and headed non-profits in the farm-rural-food sectors, apart from writing copious amounts of original economic research in prestigious journals.He is currently the Infosys chair professor of agriculture at the New Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (Icrier). He has served the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council and led the International Food Research Institute in South Asia (IFPRI).Gulati had a direct role in policymaking during the previous Congress-led regime when he headed the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices, the federal body that recommends minimum support prices or MSP for farm produce.Gulati has praised the pro-reform laws currently being opposed by tens of thousands of farmers as a “1991 moment”, a reference to India’s first major economic reforms that saw the opening of markets, privatisation and currency devaluations but which left agriculture untouched.He has also been a harsh critic of many policies of the Narendra Modi government, his main argument being that the shackles around agriculture and statist policies can’t lift farm incomes. He had dismissed the possibility, for example, of farmers’ incomes being doubled in six years as the Modi government has promised to do by 2022.But the recent laws came in for abject praise from Gulati. “The Narendra Modi government deserves compliments for finally introducing reforms in the country’s agri-marketing system,” he wrote on May 10 in a column he writes in The Indian Express.Gulati has consistently opposed the government’s obsession with keeping domestic food prices low by frequently imposing food-export bans, which he argues keeps Indian farmers poor. “That’s an implicit tax on farmers,” he had told HT a year ago.“I don’t think any economist will lose sight of rationality but yes, he has been an advocate of agri reforms. That doesn’t suit the farmers’ positions,” a former colleague of Gulati said, not wanting to be named.Economist PK Joshi is a former chief of IFRI in South Asia and a food policy specialist who, too, advocates reforms of his own. His research has contended, much like Gulati’s, that the MSP system of fixing floor rates that is effective only for wheat and rice has devastated the environment by incentivising over-extraction of water.He has often argued that MSP reaches a small percentage of farmers, distorts market prices and does little to help a majority of farmers who don’t have marketable surpluses, meaning small farmers who can’t grow enough to sell.“There is an ongoing debate on whether minimum support prices for various agricultural commodities can be replaced by a system of price deficiency payments to farmers,” Joshi wrote in the journal EPW in May 2018. In it, he argued that price deficiency payment — a model where farmers are paid the difference between open-market prices and MSP — is a more efficient way of supporting farmers.Anil Ghanwat, the third member named for the committee, belongs to Shetkari Sangathana, one of India’s main pro-technology and pro-reforms farmer organisations founded by the late Sharad Joshi, a well-known farm organiser.In an earlier comment to HT, he had said: “The government should consult farmers to examine the laws taking our suggestions, but the laws must not be repealed.”Bhupinder Singh Mann is a former Rajya Sabha member and a farm leader who currently chairs the All India Kisan Coordination Committee, a platform of farmers that is not part of the protests and whose members recently met agriculture minister Narendra Tomar recently, urging him not to repeal the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panellists-have-been-in-favour-of-new-laws-101610475858380.html
13-01-2021||India||If protected, Aravallis can support rich biodiversity: Study||New Delhi: A new study has found that the Aravalli hills in Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi can support rich biodiversity and wildlife if protected from further habitat fragmentation. The study found a total of 1,327 signs of 13 mammal species during two seasons—winter and summer -- of the survey conducted in 2019.Two species of large carnivores-- leopard and striped hyena -- as well as four species of herbivores, two primate species and seven species of meso-carnivores (eg fox, civets, mongoose etc) -- were found by the survey in the habitat.Sunil Harsana, a resident of Mangar village in Faridabad who has informally surveyed the Aravalli stretches in the region for years, and has recently taken up formal research to document biodiversity in the region, conducted the study under the Worldwide Fund for Nature’s small grants programme. The study was supported by the non-profit Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR).The findings of the study, a summary of which HT has seen, are significant because the region is threatened by massive infrastructure-led land use change and real estate projects. Haryana, where Gurugram and Faridabad are located, is among states with the lowest forest cover (3.62%) and yet rich wildlife areas in the region do not have legal protection.“Part of the Aravallis on the Haryana side are notified under section 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act, and treated as legal forest as per Supreme Court orders ... The remaining portion, which includes the Mangar Bani sacred grove, are awaiting formal recognition as forest as per the dictionary meaning,” said Chetan Agarwal, an environment analyst and senior fellow at CEDAR. “Haryana needs a protected area under the Wild Life (Protection) Act adjacent to the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary so that the entire contiguous stretch can be protected.”This study is significant because it proves there is a critical wildlife area in the middle of a deeply urbanised region, said Ghazala Shahabuddin, senior fellow at CEDAR. We have had camera-trapped images of leopards from 2017, of striped hyenas and mongoose more recently all in the Gurugram Aravallis,” Shahabuddin added.Surprisingly, the Aravallis in both Faridabad and Gurugram were found to harbour a larger variety of mammals compared to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary on the Delhi-Haryana border, which is classified as a protected area and enjoys legal protection under the Wild Life (Protection) Act.The largest number of species was recorded in the Faridabad Aravallis (14), followed by the Gurugram Aravallis (11), Mangar Bani (10) and least in Asola Bhatti (9). Mangar Bani and the Gurugram Aravallis threw up a 30% higher encounter rates with animal signs per kilometre in comparison to Asola Bhatti and the Faridabad Aravallis.Two species---the leopard and the honey badger-- are classified as endangered under Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act while three of the meso-carnivore species found in the region are thought to be declining in the northern Aravallis, and in other parts of India. These are the golden jackal, jungle cat and ruddy mongoose, according to the study.The Aravaljis in Gurugram and Faridabad, along with the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in southeastern Delhi, form a contiguous block of forest habitat. A survey by the Wildlife Institute of India in the Haryana Aravalis, in 2017 had also shown significant presence of wildlife, including leopards, in the region.The findings of the present study covering over 200 sq.km of Aravallis underlines that this is the largest contiguous remnant of native dry deciduous forest and thorn scrub in the Delhi-Haryana National Capital Region.Harsana carried out the survey of mammals along 19 line transects, adding up to a total length of 81 km across the region. In addition, a single transect of 9.8 km was also surveyed separately in order to assess the potential impact of a proposed tarred road from the Bandhwari waste management plant to the Damdama lake via Mangar Bani. The road project was later abandoned.He documented both indirect signs (scat, dung, pugmarks, scratch marks and tracks) as well as direct sightings of all mammal species along the transects. Camera traps were also placed in a few locations where possible.“Among direct sightings there were lots of nilgai, jackals, mongoose, blue-naped hare and northern plains grey langur. I saw a lot of leopard signs including pugmarks and scat,” said Harsana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-protected-aravallis-can-support-rich-biodiversity-study-101610475857842.html
13-01-2021||India||Experts surprised by stay before validity test||Former Supreme Court (SC) judges and legal scholars have expressed surprise at the apex court’s order staying the implementation of the three farm laws and pointed to the absence of judicial precedents where a law was stayed without the legislation, prima facie, declared as having flouted constitutional norm or violated fundamental rights. This, they also warned, can become a precedent for other courts.On Tuesday, a three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, had said: “We are of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) KG Balakrishnan said, “Courts do not stay any legislation before deciding upon its constitutionality. Here, instead of first going into the constitutionality of the laws in question, the Court has stayed the three laws and delegated a committee with the task of making recommendations on it after hearing farmers. To my memory, this has never happened.”The former CJI recalled instances where consequences of a law are stayed, which is distinct from staying the law itself. “In the past, the Court has stayed the consequences of a legislation where it if of the view that allowing the same will lead to irreparable damage. But to stay a law, its constitutionality has to be tested, arguments heard and then declared to be null or void. Here the Court is yet to examine the constitutionality of the laws under challenge.”Former Supreme Court judge Justice Deepak Gupta agreed, and said, “The Court is right in saying that it is not powerless. It has power to stay a law upfront where it finds that a particular law could not be passed by a state or Centre on grounds of legislative competence. Also, a law can be ex-facie legal or unconstitutional. But in these circumstances, the Court has to give reasons for granting stay on a law. I did not find any reasons after reading the order passed by Court on Tuesday.”The only reason cited by the three-judge bench for staying the laws was to encourage farmers to come to the talking table. Asked about whether this was a suitable ground to stay a law, Justice Gupta said, “I do not think this can be the basis for staying a law. We do not make policies. Court is entrusted to decide the validity of a law based on Constitution and judicial precedents. Courts should not become a platform for political warfare. There are instances when Courts have stepped into legislative turf in public interest as in the Vishaka case. This is because we have powers to do complete justice under Article 142. This order does not make any reference to Article 142 nor does it state that the same should not be treated as precedent in future cases.”Legal scholar and advocate Gautam Bhatia said the task of the Supreme Court is to resolve legal disputes before it. “It is not to act as a super-mediator or a family elder. In particular, the SC — going by its own precedent — is only supposed to ‘stay’ a law if it finds that prima facie that law is unconstitutional. In the past, the SC has refused to stay laws where not only serious challenges were mounted to their constitutionality, but also where allowing status quo to continue directly benefited the government, which was able to change facts on the ground. Examples include Aadhaar, J&K Reorganisation, and electoral bonds, the latter two of which still remain in cold storage.” Bhatia added that while comparing the Court’s behaviour in those cases with its behaviour now, the “inconsistency is glaring”. “It leaves the Court open to credible accusations that it is acting more like a participant in political conflict rather than an adjudicator.”Alok Prasanna Kumar, senior resident fellow at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy said, “The Court has not applied any reason to stay the laws and the reason cited has no bearing with any established legal principles. In the process, what it has created is more confusion and chaos. With today’s order, the legal effect of the three laws has been thrown into doubt since the laws haven’t been rubbed off. In such a situation, what happens to transactions which took place under the new laws and the decisions taken by state governments pursuant to adopting them? The order is silent on these aspects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-surprised-by-stay-before-validity-test-101610475257794.html
13-01-2021||India||Farm leaders refuse to appear before panel, stick to hard line||Farm unions protesting a set of agricultural laws on Tuesday spurned the Supreme Court’s proposed committee of four to scrutinise the three contentious legislation, saying they would not participate in its consultations because farmers wanted the laws repealed, not changed.The farm unions, who have been rigid about their stand despite several amendments proposed by the government to address some of their objections to the new legislation, said they unanimously decided to stay off the proposed panel on Monday as a “precautionary step” when the Supreme Court first proposed it.The top court named members to panel, all of who were “pro-reforms” and “pro-government”, all the more reason not to take part in its consultations, leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform for the protesting farm unions, told reporters.The Supreme Court on Tuesday put the implementation of the three farm laws approved by Parliament in September on hold, and set up a committee of experts to examine the laws “threadbare”.“During the course of the agitation, it became clear that the court wanted a committee. Our lawyers told the court that they would get back after taking instructions from us,” farm leader Darshan Pal told HT.“We wanted to steer clear of the panel because that is a way of diverting the main issue, which is a repeal of the laws. That’s why our lawyers were not present today in court,” he added.The decision of protesting farm unions not to cooperate with the SC-proposed panel only deepens the stalemate.Balbir Singh Rajewal, another farm leader, said the unions would go ahead with their planned tractor parade on Republic Day inside the national capital in a “peaceful way”.“A lot of lies are being spread that we will lay siege to Parliament or take over the Red Fort on Republic Day. Our programme will be peaceful. We will announce the complete modalities after January 15,” Rajewal said.The leaders said their Republic Day parade would commence after the official celebrations at the Capital Rajpath vista conclude.The farmers’ leaders, however, said they would participate in the next round of talks with the government slated for January 15.The court on Tuesday issued a notice to the farm leaders after a Delhi Police petition asked that they be restrained from marching into Delhi on January 26.Tens of thousands of farmers are camping on Delhi’s borders, protesting a set of laws to ease restrictions on farm trade, which they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Eight rounds of negotiations between the farmers and the Union government have failed to break the impasse.Rajewal said the four-members named for the committee were “pro-reforms and pro-government”.Jagmohan Singh, another farm leader, said: “The government is trying to end our movement. We want to tell the government that this is an indefinite movement and we will not go anywhere till the three new farm laws are repealed.”The Supreme Court could help farmers by taking suo moto cognisance and repealing the laws, said another farmer leader Raminder Singh Patiala.The farm leaders said they favoured direct negotiations with the government and not with an “external committee”.The agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered its 48th day on Tuesday.“The Supreme Court’s formation of a committee and farmers’ refusal to take part in it not only exposes the trust deficit between the government and farmers but also the limitation of the judiciary’s role in arbitrating an essentially political and economic issue,” said Sudhir Panwar, a farm economist and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-leaders-refuse-to-appear-before-panel-stick-to-hard-line-101610475197828.html
13-01-2021||India||Serum will provide 50-60 million vials to India by February: Poonawalla||Serum Institute of India (SII) chief executive Adar Poonawalla on Tuesday said that even as his firm is providing 11 million doses of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca produced Covishield vaccine in India in the first phase, there are plans to provide 50-60 million vials either by January or February.Early Tuesday, the first consignment of the vaccines in three trucks rolled out of the SII facility at Hadapsar in eastern part of city for transportation to various locations across the country. The doses were taken to 12 cities through flights in the day and later to Mumbai via road.“Currently, 11 million doses of the vaccine are being rolled out across the country and there are plans to provide 50 to 60 more doses by January-February. We have given priority to India. We will provide as many doses as the nation demands. Rest of the vaccines, we will export. We are getting request from Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Africa, and there are COVAX partners also,” said Poonawalla, a 39-year-old businessman who joined the world’s largest vaccine manufacturing firm that his father founded in 2001.As per the purchase order released by the government of India, another 45 million doses are scheduled to be bought by the government by April this year.Poonawalla while interacting with reporters at his facility said that the real challenge lies in taking the vaccine to the “common man, to the vulnerable groups of people and to healthcare workers”.“Our trucks left the SII facility early morning and now the vaccine is being distributed in the entire country. This is a proud and historic moment as scientists, experts and all other stakeholders took great efforts while making this vaccine in less than a year,” he said.Poonawalla said that the SII has offered the vaccine to the Centre at a special price of ₹200. “This is one of the most affordable vaccines in the world and we are offering it to the government at a special price just to support the Prime Minister’s vision and to support the aam aadami (common man) of our country,” he added.He also said that once SII gets the requisite permission, the vaccine will be made available in the private market at the cost ₹1,000. Poonawalla further said that SII is not only providing the vaccine in India, “but it is also committed to providing it to other countries who are looking at India at this point”.Covishield is developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca and manufactured by the SII.A puja was performed before the three temperature controlled trucks rolled out of the Serum Institute gates shortly before 5am and moved towards the Pune airport, about 15 km away, from where the vaccines were flown across India.Poonawalla further said, “The government of India will buy the vaccine at the rate of ₹200 per dose for 10 crore doses, and thereafter, the cost of the vaccine will go up. The vaccine we are offering to the government will be given to the common man, the poor, vulnerable groups and healthcare workers free of cost.”He also added that the SII’s production capacity is bigger than the world and that is why the company is under the maximum pressure (to manufacture) it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/serum-will-provide-50-60-million-vials-to-india-by-february-poonawalla-101610468056812.html
13-01-2021||India||Young blood needed to uproot dynasty politics, says PM Modi||Calling dynasty politics the “new tyranny” in democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked young Indians to join politics in large numbers to uproot this “tyranny” and “help reshape the country’s destiny”.Modi’s comments, renewing his attack on political dynasties, also come months before assembly elections in four states in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is pitted against the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) . All three parties, particularly the Congress, have been accused of harbouring family interests in their politics by the BJP.Addressing the National Youth Parliament 2021 here on Tuesday, the prime minister said, “There are some changes still pending. Political dynasty is the biggest enemy of democracy. It’s a challenge that needs to be uprooted. The days of people winning elections on the basis of their surnames are over.”Also Read: National Youth Day 2021: History and significance of the dayTo be sure, this is not the first time the prime minister or his party has spoken against dynasty politics. It’s been a key plank to confront the Gandhi family’s leadership in the Congress and accuse another key rival, Trinamool Congress, of favouritism over the role of Abhishek Banerjee, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew.“This political dynasty is a new tyranny that increases the burden of incompetence on the country. It also promotes family and self interests instead of nation first. Dynasty politics is also a major reason behind political and social corruptions. They think if their ancestors are not caught, they too can breathe easily. They see such examples in their own houses. So, these people have no respect or fear of law,” the prime minister said as he virtually addressed participants, mostly students, at the youth parliament.This is the first time the event was organised in the iconic Central Hall of the Parliament.Modi called upon young Indians to become agents of change. “The responsibility to change this situation is of the youth.Join politics in large numbers with the idea to work for India.” He also said that as long as common people don’t join politics, the culture of dynastic politics will continue.The prime minister maintained that people of this country have now started supporting those who are honest and performing—seen by many as an oblique reference to his own government. “Performance and honesty have become necessary conditions for Indian politics. Those with a legacy of corruption now bear the burden of corruption. They are unable to come out of it. The country supports honest people. Now, lawmakers also understand that their CVs need to be strong and balance sheets of work should be foolproof.”He said in earlier days, family members looked down upon someone if he or she wanted to join politics but things have changed now. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, the prime minister said, “Your next 25-26 years are also important for India. Young people should come forward and become India’s destiny-makers. Politics needs young people. New ideas, new energy, new enthusiasm, new ambition is needed.”Modi also said he will tweet some of the speeches made during the youth parliament from his own Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-asks-young-indians-to-join-politics-to-uproot-dynasty-politics-101610447747286.html
13-01-2021||India||Mumbai: Sena youth wing stage protests against BJP MLA for ‘shielding’ those who attacked policeman||Shiv Sena youth wing, Yuva Sena, staged an agitation outside Sena Bhavan on Tuesday against BJP legislator Ram Kadam for allegedly shielding party workers who assaulted a police constable. Three BJP workers were travelling on one bike on Monday when they collided with other vehicle at Powai. When constable Nitin Khairmode tried to take them to the police station, they allegedly assaulted him. Of the trio, two managed to escape while one has been arrested and booked for assaulting a public servant.Later, Kadam reportedly intervened and through a phone call, told the police that the accused were young and police action might ruin their future. An audio clip of the purported conversation has gone viral on social media.According to Yuva Sena core committee member Samadhan Sarvankar, their agitation is to express support to the police fraternity. “We want to send a message that such attacks will not be tolerated. The state government needs to take action against Ram Kadam as he is demanding their release. He is sending a message that you can bash up policemen and he will secure your release,” said Sarvankar.However, Kadam has condemned the incident. “I have no connection with the attack...I was not even in Mumbai during the incident and the Yuva Sena is politicising the matter by dragging my name into it. In fact, I would have slapped the attackers myself,” he said, while talking to media.The Congress has called the legislator a habitual offender. “He has attacked policemen twice... This reflects the BJP culture,” said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Kadam is a spokesperson of the BJP and has been critical of the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. Kadam started his political career in Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) as a legislator in 2009 and joined BJP in 2014. He has been elected twice on BJP ticket from Ghatkopar (West) constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-sena-youth-wing-to-stage-protests-against-bjp-mla-for-shielding-those-who-attacked-policeman-101610432925661.html
13-01-2021||India||'Do I need to download Co-WIN app if I am a healthcare worker?' FAQs answered||From January 16, vaccination of all healthcare workers will begin across the country. This will be the world's biggest vaccination drive, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said. Here are some of the frequently asked questions answered.Why has the government chosen you?The government has chosen healthcare workers first because they are at high risk of contracting the infection. Also, the government wants healthcare workers to continue with their essential services. The vaccination of frontline workers will help in reducing the societal and economic impact by reducing Covid-19 mortalities.What about your family?If your family members are not frontline workers, then they do not belong to priority groups. If you have family members who are at a higher risk because of age or other ailments, then they will be vaccinated in due process.What are the side effects of Covid-19 vaccine?The vaccine may have minor side effects like fever, pain etc at the injection site. These effects can happen in any vaccine, the health ministry has said.Is vaccination mandatory?No, the ministry has clarified that getting vaccinated is voluntary but it has urged people who are eligible for the first phase of vaccine to not opt out.Shall I take the vaccine if I already have been infected by Covid-19?Yes, according to the health ministry, it is advisable to receive a complete schedule of Covid-19 vaccine irrespective of a past history of Covid-19 infection.Shall I take the vaccine if I am presently infected with Covid-19?No, as persons with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to others at the vaccination site. Infected individuals should inform their authorities and defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution.Do I need Co-WIN app?No. healthcare workers don't need to register themselves as their details are already being registered by departments concerned. Also, the app is not yet available for download, thoDo I need to carry an identity card at vaccination booth?Yes. Verification will be done at vaccination booth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-i-need-to-download-co-win-app-if-i-am-a-healthcare-worker-faqs-answered-101610264306928.html
13-01-2021||Today's||To truly become self-reliant, invest in research and development||India has long had a reputation about its ability to thrive on “jugaad technology” which can be loosely translated as innovative solutions which get around the rules. This needs to become a story of the past now. For India to evolve into a self-reliant economy, the importance of investment in research and development (R&D) is critical in this new decade.Despite all efforts, the gross domestic expenditure on R&D as a fraction of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has declined from 0.8% in 2010 to 0.6% in 2018. It has been hovering around this level for more than two decades. This pales in comparison to R&D investment in developed countries such as Japan (3.2%), Germany (3.0%), the United States (2.8%) and developing ones such as South Korea (4.8%) and China (2.2%) in 2018. Most R&D expenditure in India comes from the government and this is unfortunate.A higher expenditure on R&D usually correlates with high technology exports. India’s share in high technology exports stands at 9.1%, while for China and South Korea, it is 31.4% and 36.3% respectively. To move up the manufacturing value chain and enhance competitiveness, there is a need to increase R&D expenditure in sectors which are import-dependent.Though hundreds of international companies having set up R&D shops, utilising the talent pool at lower cost, Indian corporates have failed to keep pace.The heightened need for R&D creates opportunities for financing its expansion. This will not only lead to augmenting exports but also reduce the country’s dependence on R&D-related product imports — something which can make the trade deficit more manageable. In fact, according to the government’s Invest India report, each $1 million invested in R&D in India per year by multinational corporations (MNCs) is likely to generate a demand for around eight to ten researchers.In this context, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government may possibly consider setting up a credit facility solely for investments in R&D in industries in which India requires import substitution. The initiative would provide lending at rates lower than the prevailing repo rate, for 10 to 12 years, to finance investments that create technological and production capacity in R&D-intensive sectors.To further ensure greater access for the R&D sector, the government can consider a sub-category under the priority sector lending (PSL) which will boost access to finance. However, there should be clarity on the list of industries to be covered in order to ensure that benefits are not skewed to select ones only.India has always been found lacking in terms of academia-industry linkages. This is a bedrock in developed economies. In fact, private-public partnerships aligned with national innovation and industrial strategies such as China’s Industry-Research Strategic Alliances, Canada´s Strategic Network Grants, the Netherlands´ Top Sectors, Germany´s Innovation Alliances, Israel´s Magnet Consortium, and France´s Strategic Industrial Innovation Programme are all worth looking into.The government should set up a mechanism wherein the grants received by Central Universities and technology and management institutes are linked to their collaboration with the public and private sectors and designed to produce concrete outcomes, not just cooperation agreements on paper. Economies worldwide have graduated in the production chain from low and middle technology exports and have been focusing on R&D-related high technology exports which bring in greater foreign exchange earnings. In fact, Samsung’s global R&D spending in the first nine months of 2020 hit a record high of $14.3 billion and was equivalent to 9.1% of its sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This clearly demonstrates the importance such firms give to R&D.India needs to show flexibility and offer differential treatment to Indian companies in the form of tax incentives, uninterrupted support, and stringent supervision. The upcoming Budget in 2021 could possibly be just the right moment to support R&D in the backdrop of the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Rahul Mazumdar is an economist with EXIM Bank, IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-truly-become-self-reliant-invest-in-research-and-development-101610550023496.html
13-01-2021||Today's||Champaran to Singhu: A tale of two satyagrahas||Satyagraha has won. And the Supreme Court (SC) has acquired a trust dividend. Never before in the history of India has a protest involving so many lasted so long without flinching, without slackening, without diluting the three crucial ingredients of that mode of struggle. First, it must be about a principle or a programme, not against any individual. Second, it must include self-suffering. And third, it must be non-violent.In staying the three farm laws, the apex court has acknowledged the satygaraha’s moral voltage without saying as much. And it has given to the protesters a moment of satyagrahic epiphany. But, as we all know by now, the protesters have thanked SC; they have not declared their battle over.For it is not over.Satyagraha has won its battle on Delhi’s outskirts; it has not yet triumphed. It would have, if SC had struck the three laws down. It would have, if the government, responding to the stay, had said it was repealing the laws. It would have if the government had said it was going to discuss the demands in a specially convened meeting of the Inter-State Council with all chief ministers, and then, of Parliament — to enact a new legislation that fulfils the aspirations of farmers and acts on the neglected recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee.The court forming committees to go into the matter has not reassured the protesters. As they are constituted, it could not have. Besides, other committees set up by earlier SC orders have tended to uphold the government’s position on the issues in question. A great example of a successful committee needs to be recalled. After the brave and principled satyagraha launched by Mahatma Gandhi in Champaran, Bihar, in 1917, against the tinkathiya system, operating on indigo plantations in that district, the British government set up a Champaran agrarian committee. It worked diligently, finding the satyagraha’s objectives justified. And it recommended the scrapping of the system. With all the demands of the peasant protesters met, the satyagraha ended in success. And it gave ground-level experience of struggle and success to a future President of India — Rajendra Prasad.How does that committee differ from the ones just constituted? Gandhi was a member of the committee. There are farm union representatives on the three committees, sure. But are they representative of the aspirations of the protesters? We know they are not.So, what now? The protesters have said they will not move an inch. This is dangerous. The massing of thousands of un-budging protesters around the national capital at the time of a pandemic poses a dire health hazard. The protesters have so far been impervious to the clear threat of the virus. Unmindful of the risk, they have converged and stayed put in the thousands, in close proximity, right where the virus has been virulent. They seem now to be no less unmindful of the risk. Can the government be equally unmindful of the risk to the protesters and to others in contact with them?And beyond the virus risk, can the government afford to alienate the farming community ad infinitum, without unimaginably serious consequences to the nation’s economy and its social integrity? And without the stalemate resulting in a flare-up? Responding to the court’s orders and its chastisement, the government needs to do what it may otherwise not have done. It can do the following: One, announce a revocation or at the very least, an indefinite suspension of the Acts. Two, remit them and all the demands of the farmers to the Inter-State Council for a discussion. And three, call an exclusive session of Parliament to discuss a new law with farmers — not “experts” but farmers who have been hurt — being given an opportunity to be heard by parliamentarians on the margins of the session.And with these three steps being announced, the leaders of the protesters must rise to the occasion too and announce their dispersal from the sites of protest and adopt a constructive response to the promised discussions.The SC has shown its independence and a sensitivity to the public weal by doing as it has. Let there be no mistake here. It could well have said that this is a matter for the executive to handle. It has not. It has been bold. The protesting farmers have, without invoking Gandhi, followed the basics of his satyagrahic procedures, though differing from these in some details. They will be showing another kind of courage in accepting the offer of such a discussion, if made thus by the government. But the toughest gesture has to come from the government. It has to match the court’s wisdom and announce the steps detailed here. The British Raj responded as it did in Champaran 104 years ago. Swaraj must do likewise and enter its 75th year with the glow of the health and happiness of farmers on its forehead. This is its “indigo moment”.

13-01-2021||Today's||At the mercy of big tech billionaires||The United States (US) technology industry has shown us that it is more powerful than world leaders. Not only were social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook able to muzzle the US president, with the help of Amazon, they were able to shut down an emerging competitor. I am not saying that this was not justified. President Donald Trump did incite violence and cause an insurrection — while the social media platform, Parler, fanned the flames of hatred and facilitated the planning of atrocities by white nationalists. What is concerning is that the same companies now claiming to act in the interest of public safety were the ones that enabled the rise of Trump and divided America in the first place. The monopolistic powers of these companies enabled them to demand that we accept their terms and conditions or be locked out of online social discourse. They made themselves the judge and jury and refused to accept responsibility for the damage they caused.Facebook has been at it for years, facilitating the spread of misinformation on a global scale, and denying responsibility for its actions. In 2018, it ignored the United Nations, which accused the company of having a “determining role” in stirring up hatred and genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. Before this, it enabled data firm Cambridge Analytica to acquire 50 million user profiles, thereby facilitating the spread of fear and misinformation by Trump and his 2016 election victory. Facebook data was also used to influence the Brexit vote in Britain, and, possibly, regional elections in India. But the damage didn’t just stop at data. WhatsApp, in particular, has enabled the fermentation of hatred and civil unrest in almost all of the countries where it is popular because it lacks moderation and other critical checks and balances.Social media companies have been reaping huge profits from the spread of disinformation. They perfected the art of manipulating the news we read so that we spend time on their platforms — and become more opinionated. They watch everything we do and keep track of who we interact with. Until the political winds shifted and the Democrats won control of all three branches of government, they refused to change their ways or take responsibility for what transpired on their platforms. There are important lessons to be learned. Just as the Americans did, India is placing itself at the mercy of billionaires who don’t seem to care for anything but money. India should know better, though, because it wasn’t that long ago that it was subjugated by the East India Company, which started as a money-obsessed but benevolent trading group and became more powerful — and evil — than governments. WhatsApp is now the dominant mobile communication platform in India. The government made a serious mistake when it allowed the platform’s parent company, Facebook, to add payment services — because this will enable it to also monopolise Indian commerce. Facebook will gain data on an unprecedented scale — and have the ability to create economic shocks greater than that of demonetisation. So far, there was a Chinese wall between WhatsApp and Facebook. Undeterred by commitments it had made to keep the data private, WhatsApp is now demanding that users accept its right to share extensive personal mobile data with Facebook. If users don’t comply with its demands by February 8, they will get kicked off its platform. This is just the start. When Facebook expands its monopoly and gains the data on a billion Indians that it is seeking, it will be able to hold the government hostage too. Note that Facebook didn’t dare to pull this stunt in Europe because the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulations expressly prohibited social media companies from sharing such data. It feared the types of fines that the Europeans have been imposing on rogue tech companies. India needs data protection laws that are at least as stringent as those in Europe. It also needs to encourage its tech industry to develop competitive social media products — and provide them the protections and support they need. That is what China did — it saw no advantages in letting foreign companies dominate its technology industry so it blocked Facebook, Google, Twitter and Netflix, and raised enough obstacles to force Uber out. Chinese technology protectionism created a fertile ground for local startups by eliminating the fear of foreign predators. This led to the creation of companies that are the most valuable and successful in the world — and adhere to Chinese culture and values. Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu recently announced, over Twitter, that his company is creating an alternative to WhatsApp called Arattai (which means chat in Tamil). This could provide the alternative to WhatsApp that users fleeing to Telegram and Signal are desperately looking for. And it could become a platform for Indian mobile-app innovation. India could also take a page from Trump’s book and demand that Facebook India be sold to one of its tech tycoons. Trump forced Tik Tok US to enter divesture negotiations with Oracle, Microsoft, and Walmart because he was worried about China gaining access to the personal data of more than 100 million Americans — and ability to influence public opinion and culture. Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg decided that he did not like Narendra Modi’s farm laws or Shashi Tharoor’s tirades against the East India Company — and shut them off. This is what could lie ahead unless the country takes immediate action. Vivek Wadhwa is a distinguished fellow at the Labor and Worklife Program of Harvard Law School.
