Sources said security arrangements are being beefed up at the UP Gate protest site and the estimated number of security personnel there may reach about 5,000-6,000 in coming days.Protesting farmers at UP Gate have held several rounds of talks with the government over their demand for repeal of the three farm laws. In its latest proposal, the government had offered to suspend the implementation of the three farm laws for a period of one-and-a-half to two years. However, farmers are still adamant on their demand of repeal of the farm laws and are now preparing to go ahead with their proposed tractor parade, in which they are estimating inclusion of about 4,000-5,000 tractors, with more expected to join, from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“We are in touch with the farmers’ leaders at UP Gate and communication is on. In the coming days, the Delhi-Meerut Road and NH-9 will face some traffic issues, but we are planning for diversions which will be only for a few hours and not prolonged. The diversion plans are being fine-tuned and farmers are also in touch with the Delhi Police,” said Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range). “On our part, we will not stop farmers from entering Delhi if the Delhi police allow them to move in. We are showing restraint and there will be no use of force. Police personnel have been roped in from different districts in western UP, besides deployment of rapid action force and other security personnel. At UP Gate, we are working with the volunteers of the farmers’ unions to ensure that there is no movement of outsiders at the site,” he added. The farmers’ leaders said that tractors have already begun their journey from different areas in UP and Uttarakhand and are expected to reach the site by January 24 or 25. “We are also holding discussions with the Delhi Police to finalise the route of our tractor parade and also to go over arrangements. The routes are likely to be finalised by Sunday. Further, the tractors have started coming in at UP Gate,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of farmers’ committee at UP Gate.The incoming tractors have started lining up on the NH-9 and also at the UP Gate to Dabur Crossing road in Vaishali. “We have identified different places for parking the almost 2,500-3,000 vehicles and volunteers of farmers will also help us out in ensuring that their tractors pose no hindrance to traffic. We are not stopping their tractors from coming to UP Gate but requesting them not to go ahead due to the pandemic and adverse weather conditions. Many returned back willingly while others moved ahead to UP Gate,” the IG added. The entire UP Gate area is divided into sectors and zones and is being monitored through the control room with the help of CCTVs. The police have also roped in local intelligence units to ensure that the protest remains peaceful and anti-social elements are kept at bay. A senior Delhi police officer in the know of the meeting details said that in-principle, the farmers and police officers reached an agreement on carrying out a peaceful “Kisan Republic Parade” on January 26. They added that the police have asked the farmer leaders to move a written application along with their undertaking, proposed routes, number of tractors and farmers participating in the rally, and the timings on Sunday for getting the official permission for the rally. “We will go through their route maps and other planning and give the permission accordingly,” said the officer, who did not want to be named, adding that the Delhi Police will take care of the traffic and security arrangements apart from safety, medical and other emergencies of the farmers participating in the tractor rally. According to the officer quoted above, the tractor rally will not disrupt the official Republic Day Parade and the farmers’ rally will begin after it gets completed. “We have reached a consensus that the tractor parade will only be in areas around the borders where the farmers are on sit-in protest. They wouldn’t be coming to central Delhi via Ring Road,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. Officials in the Ghaziabad district administration, who are in the know of the tractor parade route, said that farmers may be allowed to move to Ghazipur, Anand Vihar and up to Apsara and Bhopra borders near Ghaziabad.“The final route map is likely to be finalised by Sunday,” the officer added.

The DM also suggested that a branch of the registrar’s Meerut office be opened in Ghaziabad.DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said Saturday that he has asked the deputy registrar, DK Gupta, to ensure that all details of RWAs/AOAs be updated online, along with details of office bearers, date of last election, registration, next date of election, due date of audit and any complaints, if any.The AOAs and RWAs have to be registered with the deputy registrar’s office at Meerut. “The residents become the worst sufferers due to inconsistent information available and also due to delayed elections. If the information is made available online, it will bring more transparency. We can also display such information over the district portal. It has also been observed that elections have not been held by several RWAs/AOAs. So, once the details are made online, there will be transparency,” Pandey said.“Further, we have sent a proposal in which we have requested the state government to allow a branch of the deputy registrar’s office in Ghaziabad as there are many RWAs/AOAs here and it will be easy for these associations to approach officials if they are within the city. Also, to see if any designated officer can be delegated powers for functioning at the branch office,” he added. Members of AOAs said that making details available online and setting up a branch office in Ghaziabad would be a welcome step.“We have been writing to make these details available online for long. Besides, there are many AOAs/RWAs whose elections have not been held for as long as three-four years. This is to be held within a span of one year otherwise they are deemed as debarred and the district administration has to designate an executive officer to get the elections done,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of the federation of AOAs. “We have approached the district administration time and again, but elections could not be conducted on some pretext or the other,” he added. DK Gupta, deputy registrar (Meerut), said that his office has identified about 28 cases in Ghaziabad where elections of residents’ associations were pending. “It is the responsibility of the respective RWA/AOA to take up elections. My office had earlier issued orders for not holding elections till June 30, 2020 in wake of the pandemic. When such instances (delayed elections) come to light, we declare societies as debarred and then write to the district admin to designate an officer for holding polls. We have taken up correspondence with the Ghaziabad DM in this regard and they have to get the elections done,” Gupta said. “As regards the branch office at Ghaziabad, the issue has been taken up with the state government and the process has been initiated. Digitising the records will take another two-three months in which we will digitize all manual files, which include files related to societies,” he added.Pandey responded by saying that the election was held up due to the pandemic and that the process has been re-initiated. “We now have initiated the process for holding pending elections and also appointed officers to get this done. The elections were not held due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The process is on now,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-admin-bats-for-digitising-records-of-all-residents-associations-setting-up-deputy-registrar-office-in-district-101611426111833.html

On the radar of officials for the next round are health care workers who were reluctant in taking the shots and anganwadi workers who refused to participate in the drive on Friday. The next round of vaccination across UP, including Ghaziabad, is planned for January 28 and 29. Uttar Pradesh, officials said, on Friday had vaccinated 101,006 health care workers out of a target of 155270, working to an overall coverage of about 65%. Of the 75 districts, 19 — including Ghaziabad on the eleventh spot — reported vaccination coverage of over 75%. Apart from the 19 districts mentioned above, 29 others have had a coverage between 60% and 75%, while 27 districts, including Gautam Budh Nagar, could cover only 60% of their assigned target for January 22. “We held an experience-sharing session with the beneficiaries on Saturday and also with those who faced issues during the 20 adverse event following immunization (AEFI) events on Friday. All the AEFI cases were minor, and all have fully recovered. We have formed batches of health care workers who have received the jabs and will now be our brand ambassadors for future vaccination rounds,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “They have also been assigned targets to motivate and spread information about vaccination among the proposed beneficiaries. Their task will be to counsel them that the vaccines pose no health issues and they should come forward,” he, added. The officials said that health care workers, including female doctors, have been asked to contact anganwadi workers and motivate them. According to official estimates, there are about 1,000-1,200 anganwadi workers in the district who have been under the 21,800 health care workers to get the Covid-vaccination in the first phase. “The groups of health care workers who have been vaccinated so far have been asked to take rounds on vaccination day and take proposed beneficiaries to the vaccination session room at their respective centres. So, people who have been vaccinated will play a major role in motivating others ,” Pandey, added. On Friday, Shanti Gopal Hospital at Indirapuram, Yashoda Hospital branches at Nehru Nagar and Kaushambi, the community health centre at Loni, Sarvodaya Hospital in Kavi Nagar and Columbia Asia Hospital near NH-9 achieved 100% vaccination. The officials said that those centres whose officials achieved 100% of their target will be felicitated. The officials have also instructed two centres, whose target remained below 50%, to put in more efforts and ensure that the pending health care workers come forward and participate in the next round . Of the 31 centres, where vaccination was taken up on Friday, 19 centres contributed with coverage of over 75%. Three of the four previous centres where vaccination was taken up on January 16, improved their coverage on January 22. These included community health centre at Dasna with 98%, Santosh Medical College at Pratap Vihar with 97% and Yashoda Hospital at Kaushambi which achieved 100%. The coverage of the district women’ hospital on Friday went down to 83% as against 97% on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-ropes-in-inoculated-beneficiaries-to-counsel-others-to-take-covid-jabs-101611426055167.html

23-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad civic agency re-certified as ODF++ after cleanliness inspection||Ghaziabad: The officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation said Saturday that the corporation area has been re-certified as Open Defecation Free++ (ODF++) after a recent third-party inspection taken up by the Quality Council of India (QCI). They added that unlike the previous year, more public toilets this time were termed under the “aspirational” category during the survey. Officials said the inspection was carried out in the city on January 14 and 15, when sewage treatment plants (STPs) as well as randomly selected toilets in the city were inspected. There are a total of seven STPs in Ghaziabad. “During the survey, seven of the STPs were found running and properly treating sewage. All STPs in the city are functional but under-utilised. Also, total of 39 public toilets and urinals were inspected and 33 of these were categorised under the highest, the “aspirational” category, with one categorised as “excellent” and five categorised as “very clean”. During the last inspection in 2020, only 13 public toilets were termed ”aspirational” and this year we achieved better results,” said Arun Kumar Mishra, the civic body’s accounts officer and nodal officer for the Swachh Survekshan. The 33 public toilets termed “aspirational” are located in urban slums, residential and commercial areas in Ghaziabad city, besides public parks, transport hubs and at other public places. The officials said that a city/ward/work-circle can be notified ODF++ if at any point of the day not a single person is found defecating or urinating in the open, and all community and public toilets are functional and well maintained. “There are about 28 parameters on the basis of which the assessment is made. The ODF++ rating will help us in getting more points during the upcoming Swachh Survekshan – 2021, which will start in March. The competition carries 500 out of the total 6,000 points assigned for the ODF++ status. So, our ODF++ re-certification will help us in the upcoming competition,” Mishra added. Environmentalists said that sustainability is a major challenge. “Upkeep of STPs and maintaining toilets is a tough task and such sites must be maintained throughout the year. The overall outlook of the city has improved with facilities, but sustainability is a major challenge,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. Mishra said that the corporation is planning that all public toilets, about 136 in the corporation area, will be maintained by an outsourced agency. “To tackle the sustainability challenge, we have decided that all maintenance and upkeep work for the toilets will be given to an expert agency under the ‘one city, one operator’ scheme. On our part we have taken up renovation of 54 toilets so far. Although we have lesser budget available, we are trying to keep up with other bigger cities,” he added. For the financial year 2020-21, the civic agency had recently proposed in its revised budget an expenditure of about ₹983 crore against income of about ₹1,011 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-civic-agency-re-certified-as-odf-after-cleanliness-inspection-101611426053937.html

The victim Savita, 24, a resident of Haibatpur in Aligarh, had married Mohit Kumar, 26, of Jafargardh in Jewar in 2018. The couple has three daughters. Savita’s brother Ravindra Kumar said that her husband had been torturing her for dowry since marriage. “My sister had informed us about the harassment in the past. Mohit had been demanding ₹1 lakh as dowry. We believed the matter will be resolved on its own in some time, but it didn’t.

We rushed Greater Noida but Mohit or his family members were not found in the house,” Ravindra, who lives in Aligarh, said. Ravindra said that the local people informed him that Savita’s in-laws had quietly cremated the body at the local crematorium and then fled.

23-01-2021||Delhi||AAP MLA Somnath Bharti disqualified after court sentences him to two years in jail in 2016 assault case||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Somnath Bharti stood disqualified on Saturday after a city court sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment in a 2016 case for assaulting All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) security staff and destroying public property.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey also imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh on Bharti, the MLA from Malviya Nagar. The judge, however, granted Bharti bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against the conviction and jail term.Under the Representation of the People Act, a legislator stands disqualified upon being sentenced to jail for a minimum of two years. The membership of the House is lost with immediate effect. Former ASG and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, citing a 2013 judgment by the Supreme Court, said a legislator is disqualified immediately after he has been convicted and sentenced to a minimum two years of imprisonment.“Any MP/MLA or MLC, who gets a minimum imprisonment of two years, stands immediately disqualified according to the Lily Thomas vs Union of India judgment of the apex court. The legislator will have to take a stay on the conviction to remain in the fray. Mere suspension of sentence or the jail term will not suffice,” Luthra said.Reacting to the judgment, AAP said, “We respect the judiciary and have full faith in it. However, we feel an injustice has happened to Somnath Bharti in this case. Somnath is a very popular leader and is loved by everyone in his constituency. He works 24 hours for his people. People in his constituency are quite saddened to hear the news of his conviction.”“Somnath is filing an appeal. We are confident that justice will be done to him at the appellate level,” the party added.Bharti said he believes in the judiciary and would file an appeal against the judgment in the higher court. “I have complete belief in the judiciary. I am preparing an appeal and will file it as soon as it’s ready.”Delhi assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel said Somnath Bharti has not been disqualified as yet. “I am out of Delhi and will return by Sunday evening. I will seek legal opinion for the next step... In any case, as per the tenth schedule, the Speaker gets a time of three months to decide on a disqualification petition for any MLA of the legislative assembly,” said Goel. The court, however, acquitted Bharti’s associates and co-accused Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey for want of evidence. The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from RS Rawat, the chief security officer of AIIMS.According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down a portion of the boundary wall and fencing at AIIMS, using an earth mover. “The court is of the considered view that the prosecution has duly proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt against accused Somnath Bharti,” the magistrate said in the judgment passed on January 22.The court also said the mindset to cause damage to public property and infrastructure is an attack on the common man.“The infrastructure and public property of the country are not of any leader, party or government but these are national assets. The infrastructure is built up with the contribution of every poor, every tax payer, middle class and every section of society. While exercising the democratic rights, people must not forget about national duty to preserve the national assets and resources meant for each and every citizen,” the judge said in the sentencing order.The court convicted Bharti of various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 147 (rioting).It also held the AAP MLA guilty under Section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The offences carry a maximum punishment of five years in jail.In its judgment, the court said the prosecution had duly proved that the mob which had gathered on September 9, 2016, around 9.45am at the drain behind AIIMS, was intent on demolishing the wall and fencing put up by the hospital.The judge also noted the testimony of Rawat that the mob was led by Bharti where he and some of the unknown members of the unlawful assembly were instructing the earthmover operator to not stop the demolition work despite the complainant requesting them to desist.It also said no document regarding the order of demolition of the wall and fence was produced, nor was any government machinery official accompanying the MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-mla-somnath-bharti-disqualified-after-court-sentences-him-to-two-years-in-jail-in-2016-assault-case-101611425991224.html
23-01-2021||Chandigarh||Sector-33 firing: High court denies bail to three accused||The Punjab and Haryana high court has denied bail to three accused in the firing outside the bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla in Sector 33 on May 31, last year. Rakesh is the brother of liquor baron Arvind Singla.According to police, the shooting was conspired by gangster Lawrence Bishnoi to spread fear among the business community. Taking up the petitions of accused Harinder Singh, Bahadur Singh and Sewak, the high court bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan observed that the firing incident happened in Chandigarh and recovery of 17 empty cartridges were an indicator of the magnitude of the incident. “It was by chance that no one was injured, but that itself will not undermine the happening. The fact remains that in spite of passing of almost seven months, five of the nominated accused have not been arrested, which resulted in hampering the investigation,” the bench observed.In the plea, the trio had argued that till date, apart from their disclosure statement, there was no other evidence. The challan had been presented in court and hence, bail should be granted. The bench noted that the presentation of challans for the arrested persons may not indicate finalisation of their roles, so long as investigation was being carried out. There were at least five co-accused who were at large and investigation was not concluded.It observed that the trio might not have been named by any witnesses, but the fact remained that as per the allegations levelled, they would be in a position to influence the co-accused and witnesses. “In the facts of the present case, custodial interrogation of the petitioners may be necessary to take investigation to its logical end,” the bench said, dismissing the plea.As per prosecution, the shooting incident was a deep-rooted conspiracy to spread fear among the business community in Chandigarh and Punjab to ensure protection money from businessmen. Bishnoi was the mastermind, who in spite of being in a Rajasthan jail, carried out the crime with the help of others. The court observed that in spite of the fact that certain persons were confined in jail, they were able to get mobile phones and use WhatsApp to conspire and carry out such attack. “The alleged roles of the petitioners of providing help for carrying out the attack cannot be underestimated by their non-presence. Without the support, the attack may not have been possible,” the bench said, adding that to complete the chain and to have a deeper probe, custodial interrogation of the accused was necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sector33-firing-high-court-denies-bail-to-three-accused-101611425753853.html

It has led to waterlogging rendering the road unusable. I am getting married on February 27 and if the road and the lane are not repaired how will my baarat, that will be coming from Ramghat road in Aligarh, reach my house in Nagla Chura village of tehsil Iglas?" said Karishma Kumar. Karishma has done her BEd and is one amongst six brothers and sisters.The patch of the half-kilometre-long road, connecting Nagla Chura alongside a pond, has been in a bad shape and due to lack of maintenance, water from the pond overflows on to the road leading to waterlogging.Also read: 'Let's have a duel' - Amit Shah slams Covid-19 vaccine criticsSources said due to lack of connectivity, many villagers prefer moving to other places for functions like marriage."Villagers find it tough to move as lanes are in a pathetic condition. I had informed the Block Development Officer (BDO) twice, raised the issue in Tehsil Diwas and had even filed an RTI but nothing was done," said Karishma after meeting the DM."The DM took the matter seriously and instructed officials to get the road repaired, else face the music," she said.When contacted, district magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said, "there is a lot of awareness among people and as a result, girls are reaching out with their problems. The concerned officials have been directed to get the road repaired in time."Mahesh Kumar Madhav, Karishma's brother, said, "It is indeed good to see how girls are getting confident and raising issues at whatever platform possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/girl-urges-dm-to-get-road-to-her-village-repaired-before-her-wedding-101611424862002.html

Senior police officers claimed that the security was increased in the backdrop of the full dress rehearsal for the Republic Day.A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said that until Republic Day, the security at the interstate borders will continue to stay tight in the backdrop of the farmers’ protest. The farmers had in November tried to enter Delhi but had been stopped at the borders in different parts of the city. They have been camping at there ever since, while their representatives and the government hold talks related to the three contentious farm laws. “Unlike previous years, the security is more this year because of the protests. There are chances that criminal elements may try to disrupt Republic Day preparations by posing as protesting farmers. The idea was to ensure that such groups do not get to mobilise and disrupt the dress rehearsal or the preparations in Delhi. the extra security will stay until the completion of the Republic Day celebrations,” one senior officer, privy to the arrangements, said.The increased reinforcements is also significant because on Friday night, the farmers had hurriedly held a press conference to allege that the Haryana Police had planted some men among the protesters to fuel violence during the tractor rally on January 26. Also, on Friday afternoon, a farmer who had come to Vigyan Bhawan, got violent and vandalised his own vehicle when police refused to allow him entry since his name was not mentioned in the list of farmer representatives. There was no complaint filed or action taken against anyone in the incident.In the other part of the city too, police have increased security ahead of January 26. Delhi Police spokesperson, Eish Singhal said, “ A multi-layered security cover is being put in place for Republic Day celebrations, where six thousand security personnel are securing the streets and keeping a vigil on suspicious elements and their activities. Checking of vehicles at all the border points has been intensified. All beat police personnel have been carrying out tenant and servant verification drive. The members of resident as well as market welfare associations, shopkeepers, street vendors, and volunteers of our eyes and ears scheme have also been sensitised. Surveillance is also being kept through CCTV cameras. A full-proof security arrangement will be in place in and around the parade route. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/security-stepped-up-police-extra-cautious-as-r-day-nears-101611425692399.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Police give ‘in principle’ nod for tractor rally in Delhi||Delhi Police on Saturday gave an ‘in principle’ nod to farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders to carry out their proposed “tractor march” on Republic Day, covering a distance of around 100km within the national capital. Delhi Police officers did not officially share details of the conditions that were laid down for granting permission for the tractor rally. A police officer, privy to the details of the meeting between police and farmers, said, “The approval was given in principle for now. The farmers will have to give a signed undertaking that they will not enter the New Delhi and central Delhi areas on Republic Day. The proposed routes will be in the vicinity of places where the farmers are already protesting, but within the national capital. They will also have to give an undertaking that the rally will not disrupt the Republic Day arrangements. We will speak to them again tomorrow.” Police teams will escort the tractors on the day of the rally to maintain law and order. In the undertaking, the farmers will have to share details of the number of tractors, timing of their rally, number of protesters and their day’s plan, among other details. Police will then verify the undertaking and issue a “written permission.”According to farmer leaders, police have allowed them to enter the national capital from five different routes that will be decided by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — a group of several farmer organisations protesting against the three new farm laws across the country— by Sunday. Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan said farmers will enter Delhi from all the existing protesting sites — Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Shahjahanpur, and Palwal. “The farmers will enter the national capital on January 26 and take out a parade on Republic Day for the first time. It will be historic… There won’t be any fixed duration for the parade since all tractors coming from different parts of the country will participate in it,” he said. Yadav said the farmers will cover a distance of over 100km in Delhi during the parade. “All farmers will return to their protest sites afterwards. There is no plan to stay in Delhi. We will take out a peaceful march. It will not have any effect on the Republic Day parade or security arrangements,” he said, adding that the Sanyunk Kisan Morcha will finalise the route and make it public on Sunday. Another farmer leader, Rajinder Singh Bir Singh Wala, said there won’t be any cap on the number of tractors entering Delhi on Tuesday. “We have asked the farmers to prepare tableaux on their tractors and trolleys but their height should not be too much, for safety purposes. All tractors, including those already there at the borders and those coming from different parts of the country, will participate in the march,” he said. But president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Darshan Pal, said the march may continue for two days. “The number of tractors participating in the march is huge. It will take time to finish the march if all tractors participate. It might take two days to complete it,” he said. Police officers who attended the meeting said they reached a consensus with the farmers following several rounds of meetings since January 18. “ In principle, we have agreed that the tractor rally will only be in areas around the borders where the farmers are on sit-in protests. They won’t come to central Delhi via Ring Road. For example, the tractor rally from Singhu border will enter Delhi and will move around areas such as Alipur, Bawana, Narela, and other adjoining areas. The rally starting from Tikri border will cut through Nangloi, Mundka, Sultanpuri. Similarly, farmers present at the Ghazipur border will be allowed to take their rally out in Ghazipur, Anand Vihar, and towards the Apsara and Bhopra borders,” a second police officer said.Meanwhile, another senior police officer said that the farmer leaders late on Saturday evening in writing accepted the proposals given by the police regarding the tractor rally. However, it was not clear whether the written acceptance was just about the proposed rally or all the routes that the ’ tractor rally would cover.On Saturday, the protesting farmers said they had increased security at protest sites, a day after a man, after being caught by farmers at Singhu border, alleged that efforts were being made to incite violence during their ongoing movement and upcoming tractor parade on Republic Day.At the Singhu border, volunteers were seen checking bags and packets of visitors near the main gate area. “Our leaders have asked us to remain vigilant. We are checking the handbags of women visitors also because the man who was caught yesterday told us that there are two women in his group, who are roaming around the protest site in an effort to incite violence. What if they plant some weapon in the tractors or tents here?” said a farmer volunteer.On Saturday, volunteers at Tikri border were also seen asking protesters to remain vigilant. Harinder Bindu, head of the women wing of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said, “Efforts are being made to disrupt our protest. All the volunteers have been asked to remain extra careful and keep an eye on visitors. The protesters living in trollies and tents have also been asked to keep a check on their surroundings. Volunteers are also checking bags and frisking people.”Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said that the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has decided to form a team of 2,000 volunteers to keep a vigil during their Republic Day tractor rally. “These volunteers will also be provided uniforms and they will keep an eye out to prevent any untoward incident during the march,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-give-in-principle-nod-for-tractor-rally-indelhi-101611425691235.html
23-01-2021||Other||AAP says DDA owes civic bodies ₹2,000 crore; BJP says pursuing matter with Centre||New DelhiThe Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday alleged that the Delhi Development Authority( DDA), which comes under the Centre, owes more than ₹2,000 crore to the BJP-led north and south corporations.AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj questioned the BJP as to why the corporations had not initiated the process to get the funds back from the DDA.Bhardwaj said, “The DDA, which comes under the BJP-ruled Central government, owes more than ₹2,000 crores to north and south corporations. According to the data, the DDA owed around ₹857 crore to the north corporation till March 31, 2018. Based on this figure, if we calculate, the amount comes to ₹1200 crore today.”He said that the DDA owes close to ₹535 crore to the south corporation.The civic bodies in Delhi — north, east and south — have been run by the BJP for the last 14 years. Bhardwaj said, “The BJP should immediately disclose why they have not taken initiative to get this money from the DDA, despite both the agencies being under them. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta should tell what are the steps that have been taken to bring this money back from the DDA.”The BJP has been blaming the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi for not releasing funds to the corporations due to which they are unable to pay salaries to employees.But Bhardwaj said, “From the time Gupta has become the Delhi BJP chief, he has maintained only one line which is that the Kejriwal government should give some amount to the BJP-ruled corporations. We have witnessed that the corporations have stopped all their revenue garnering ways like collection of property tax, advertisements, toll tax and others. Today, the revenue from these sources is not coming to the corporations but going to the leaders of the BJP.“DDA officials did not respond to HT’s query seeking a response on the AAP’s allegations. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said, “There is no doubt that several government bodies, including Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Transport Corporation, power Discoms and the DDA owe money to the corporations. But that doesn’t free the Delhi government from paying the funds it owes to the corporations. The corporations are pursuing with all agencies to get their dues and MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj should also ask the Delhi government to release municipal funds and to make Delhi Jal Board, DTC and power discoms pay their dues.”Malhotra added, “We want the Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to tell us when he will pay RS 13000 crore due to the corporations? Where is the ₹26,000 crore of Delhi Jal Board?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-says-dda-owes-civic-bodies-rs-2-000-crore-bjp-says-pursuing-matter-with-centre-101611425631237.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||25-year-old woman kidnapped by two men in a car, strangled to death||A 25-year-old woman, who worked as an accountant at a medicine wholesale shop in Chandni Chowk, was abducted in a car allegedly by two men -- one of them was a friend of hers -- and driven around the city for nearly four hours before being strangled to death and her body dumped at an isolated spot in outer Delhi’s Alipur area on January 19, police said.On Saturday, the police claimed to have solved the kidnapping and murder case after arresting the two suspects and recovering the Santro car in which the murder allegedly took place. The entire crime was planned by the woman’s 24-year-old friend, Ankit (single name), because of a financial dispute he had with her, the police said. The police have no revealed the identity of the woman.According to the police, she wanted to avail of a loan of ₹2 lakh for some personal work and asked Ankit to help her. Around two months ago, Ankit took ₹47,000 from her for helping her get the loan. However, he neither got her the loan nor returned the money, despite her repeated demands, a senior police officer said.“As the woman was pressuring Ankit to return her money and was threatening to file a police case, he planned to kill her and included his friend, Nitesh (single name) in his plan,” the officer said, adding that the woman knew Ankit for the past four years as they worked in the same wholesale shop.Around a year ago, Ankit started working for a different firm, in Chandni Chowk itself, where Nitesh was also employed. Both men belong to Holambi Kalan near Narela in outer Delhi.On January 19, the woman left her workplace for her home in Jahangirpuri. But when she did not reach home and her cellphone remained switched off, her family members filed a missing person complaint. A kidnapping case was registered at north Delhi’s Kotwali police station, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.While the Kotwali police team was conducting searches, her body was found on January 20 by the Alipur police after they were informed about an unidentified body by a passerby. The body was preserved at the Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospial mortuary for identification purposes.On January 22, the Kotwali police learnt about the body in the mortuary and showed it to the missing woman’s parents, who identified it as that of their daughter.“We added Indian Penal Code’s Section 302 (murder) in the case and began our probe. The call details of the woman’s cellphone were analysed. Through technical surveillance and human intelligence, we caught her friend Ankit who confessed to the crime. His interrogation led to the arrest of Nitesh,” said the officer.About the sequence of the events, the officer said Ankit urged the woman to meet him near the Peeragarhi Metro station on the pretext of resolving their dispute.“Ankit was waiting in the car with Nitesh. He asked her to get in and drove around for around four hours on the pretext of discussing their issue. Around 10pm, the duo strangled her using her phone charger wire and threw the body in Alipur. They took away her phone and purse containing her ID papers and ₹3,400 cash. All items have been recovered,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25yearold-woman-kidnapped-by-two-men-in-a-car-strangled-to-death-101611425511272.html

23-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers camping at Haryana-Rajasthan border gear up to reach Delhi for tractor rally||Farmers camping at Shahjahanpur, Dharuhera and Punhana on the Haryana-Rajasthan border are gearing up to take part in the tractor march scheduled to take place on the Outer Ring Road in the national Capital on Republic Day. Farmers from different states have started arriving at the protest sites with their tractors and a rehearsal was also conducted in Punhana on Saturday. Protestors at Shahjahanpur said that the heads of various villages in Alwar have pledged support for the tractor march. At least 500 tractors are expected to join the rally. The Delhi Police on Saturday allowed the protesters to hold the proposed tractor rally after days of deliberation. Farmer leaders have been allowed to enter Delhi and travel up to 100km distance on each route. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, and Maharashtra have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district since December last year. Another group of farmers is camping at Dharuhera while farmers from Mewat are agitating at Sunehra-Junehra on the Haryana-Rajasthan border. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sanjay Madhav, state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers from different states would be taking part in the march scheduled for January 26 with at least 500 tractors. “We will take part in the farmers march on Republic Day with our tractors and return back to the protest site at Shahjahanpur. Our protest will continue till the farm laws are repealed,” said Madhav. He said that farmers would be taking part in the march in large numbers amid a growing sentiment that the government was not taking their concerns seriously. “The government should understand that the farmers will not back down. As the impasse over the farm laws gets prolonged, farmers’ disappointment with the government is also on the rise,” said Madhav. He added that managing a large number of farmers on January 26 would be a challenge and that farmers would stay vigilant in the light of recent incidents. In a late-night press conference on Friday, farmer union leaders in Delhi had presented a masked man who claimed that he, along with another 10 people, including two girls, had been sent to the protest site at Singhu to incite violence. “Farmers are keeping a check on suspicious people and handing them over to the police if required,” he said. Farmers camping at Dharuhera will also be taking part in the march on Republic Day. Farmers from Rajasthan are reaching the protest site on a daily basis. Harvinder Singh Gill, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar, said that the goal is to march on the Outer Ring Road with tractors on January 26. “We are not planning to proceed ahead for now but will take part in the march. On a daily basis, 20-30 trolleys from Ganganagar are reaching Dharuhera,” said Gill. He said that there are nearly 150 tractors at Dharuhera currently and the number of tractors is expected to touch 300 by January 26. Farmers from Mewat are also participating in a sit-in protest at Sunhera-Jurehra, near Punhana, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border. On Saturday, a rehearsal was conducted at the site ahead of the tractor march on Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-camping-at-haryana-rajasthan-border-gear-up-to-reach-delhi-for-tractor-rally-101611425391220.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid vaccine coverage hits a record low of 58% in district||The district recorded the lowest turnout for Covid-19 vaccination at 58% on Saturday — almost a week after the vaccine launch. As many as 3,055 front-line health care workers took the jab as against the target of inoculating 5,230 workers, as per the district health department data.Despite vaccination being held at as many as 86 session sites, the coverage stood at 58% — far lower than Friday’s coverage rate of 91%.The plunge in vaccination comes a day after 56-year-old health care worker suffered a sudden death on Friday after taking the jab on January 16. Lack of motivation in government health staff, reluctance among doctors and staff of small clinics and distance to the vaccination site, also contributed to the low footfall on Saturday, said health officials and private doctors.At least 2,987 health care staff took the Covishield jab, of the 4,925 workers targeted for the day. The response for Covaxin reached the lowest turnout of 22%, with 68 people out of 305, taking the jab at four sites. From January 16, this has been sharpest decline in Covaxin inoculation as the coverage in the last four drives stood at almost 33%. To allay apprehensions, members of Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Saturday took the Covaxin shot.Till now, over 13,823 healthcare workers in the district have taken the Covid vaccine jab. Since the first vaccination drive on January 16 when the two vaccines were launched, the coverage rate has been continuously fluctuating. With 101% coverage on the first day, which was originally 60% and had to be extended considering lower footfall, the numbers decreased to almost 59% in the second drive held on January 18. It grew to almost 79% on January 21, and further to 91% on January 22.Citing the reason for Saturday’s poor coverage, Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “Clearly, there has been no issues with the Co-WIN platform. Maximum sites were planned for Saturday, which required mobilisation of the health care staff. Likely, staff from nursing homes and clinics also did not turn up. For Monday, we are planning to further mobilise and motivate our teams.”Since Friday onwards staff from nursing homes and small clinics have been added to the vaccine beneficiary list. Some doctors have cited distance to the vaccination a major issue. A physician in Old Gurugram preferring anonymity, said, “Although I received an SMS regarding the vaccination on Saturday but the designated site was Medeor Hospital, Manesar which is far off from place. Therefore, I dropped the visit.” Several other doctors have reported the similar issues with the IMA, according to Dr Ajay Gupta, vice president, IMA-Gurugram.“Distance to the vaccination sites has been creating challenges for many health staff. It is easy for the staff to take the vaccine if the session site is within the hospital. For others walk-in has been not so easy as the session sites have list of limited beneficiaries. The district health department has assured that the issue will be resolved as any registered staff can freely walk in to the nearby vaccination site without much hassle,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccine-coverage-hits-a-record-low-of-58-in-district-101611425271275.html

The final confirmation, however, will be given after the viscera autopsy report is issued by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS- Rohtak), said health officials privy to the matter.Officials added that none of the other healthcare workers who took the vaccine from the same vial reported of any side effects. The victim, Rajwanti died on the night of January 22 — six days after taking the vaccine jab. The 15-member committee comprising health officials, senior specialist doctors and forensic experts met on Saturday to discuss at length about the issue. According to them, the health worker was on medication. “The woman took medication for an ailment which might had led to QT prolongation (irregular heartbeat) and increased the risk of sudden cardiac death,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, in a statement issued by the health department.Rajwanti’s autopsy report prepared by Gurugram mortuary does not come to any conclusion, according to officials. Therefore, the viscera samples have been sent for histopathology to PGIMS-Rohtak and the final report is awaited. According to the Covid-19 vaccine guidelines, in case of a death following vaccination,when the patient is not hospitalised or clinical records are unavailable, the family of the victim has to be motivated to give consent for post-mortem examination to identify the pathological cause of death.“The final opinion can only be given after the complete information regarding the pre-existing medical history and post-mortem viscera reports are available,” said Yadav. As per the official statement, the health worker attended her duties till Friday and reported no side effects due to vaccine during the observation period on the vaccination day and thereafter. She was found to be unresponsive on Friday morning. She was taken to a private hospital where she was declared dead on arrival.On Saturday, three people reported minor side effects like fever, nausea and anxiety after being inoculated with Covishield. Till now, 24 cases of minor events due to vaccine have been reported, with 21 reported on Monday alone. “Three private healthcare workers who took the jab on Friday reported fever and nausea. None of them had to be hospitalised and have been asked to take paracetamol,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/death-of-health-worker-unrelated-to-covid-19-vaccine-aefi-committee-101611425211195.html

As per HSVP rules, permission can only be granted for stilt plus four floors. In addition, the houses where the third floor has been has been constructed without the stilt will also face actions as these have been constructed in violation of Haryana Building Code 2017, said HSVP officials. A direction by issued by HSVP states that as per the Haryana Building Code 2017, buildings constructed on HSVP plots are allowed only stilt and four storeys. Where, the stilts are not constructed, plots are only allowed ground floor and two storeys. Officials said that it has been observed that many plot owners are making unauthorised constructions on the roof of the second floor in case of plots without stilts and on the roof of third floor in case of structures with stilts. Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP, Gurugram, said that these constructions are illegal and action would be taken against such plot owners. “Residents can also lodge complaint if they witness such violations and can also approach the police in this regard,” said Kalia, who said action would be taken on all such complaints on priority. HSVP officials said that the government had allowed construction of stilts and four storeys to allow residents build more housing space and also prevent illegal constructions. “The entire purpose of allowing the fourth floor will fail if illegal constructions are carried out,” said a HSVP official. The department also said that encroachments made alongside roads and on HSVP land would also be removed on priority. It is to be noted that civic agencies like DTCP, GMDA, MCG and others have already embarked upon a drive to clear encroachments on green belts under their jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-take-action-against-illegal-constructions-beyond-four-floors-101611425151210.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Bill to improve RWAs’ functioning to be introduced soon||In order to improve the functioning of city’s residents’ welfare association (RWAs), which control and manage over 1,000 group housing societies and other residential colonies in the district, Rakesh Daulatabad, MLA, Badshahpur, has decided to introduce a private member’s bill in the upcoming state assembly session to amend the Haryana Registration and Regulation of Societies Act. This act deals with the functioning and operations of the RWAs. Addressing a press conference at the PWD guest house in the city, Daultabad said that in the past one year, he has come across a large number of issues faced by housing societies, pertaining to mismanagement of RWAs, inability to hold elections, corruption and inefficiency in the office of the district registrar. “We realised that this problem required reform and changes in the legislation. I have worked with government officials and discussed the proposed amendment in the bill to ensure that these problems are resolved,” he said. The draft act proposes a number of changes: District registrars should be classified as Class-l officers. It also proposes to remove indemnity and bar of the jurisdiction clause in the present act, and make officials accountable for their actions. The proposed amendment also allows only a single RWA in a gated housing complex, membership to all flat owners and joint owners without any corresponding membership fees. It also proposes to give the right to vote and contest elections to joint owners. The proposed amendment also provides for stricter compliances for RWAs and penalties for failing to follow rules. Daulatabad also said that the residents’ associations will be required to set up a website where details of rules, regulations, by-laws and details of expenditure would have to be shared with the society residents. “The elections would be held in a time-bound manner and a person can be a RWA president for only two consecutive terms,” he said. The amendment also proposes to consider the RWA executives as public servants, whose acts of omission and commission shall be brought under the Prevention of Corruption Act. Praveen Malik, president, Sare Homes RWA, said that RWAs, by the virtue of being recognised as a public office, will come under the Right to Information Act 2005, through the appointment of public information officer (PIO) and First Appellate Authority. They shall be liable to supply the requisite information to its members against the fee prescribed under the Haryana Right to Information Rules amended from time to time, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bill-to-improve-rwas-functioning-to-be-introduced-soon-101611425091217.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG divides restricted area near IAF depot into three pockets||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has divided the restricted area located within the 900-metre radius of Indian Air Force (IAF) ammunition depot in Sector 14 into three pockets in order to maintain greater supervision over the area. Earlier, complying with the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the district administration had banned new constructions in the area in February 2011 because of its proximity to the IAF depot. An order regarding the division of the area into three pockets was passed by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh on Wednesday. Pocket 1 of this area includes colonies near Maruti Udyog, Sector 22 A, Sector 23A, Carterpuri, and Dharam Colony. Areas falling near Old DLF, Sector 14, Sector 18, Sukhrali Enclave, Ashok Vihar 3, Sector 5, Sector 12 A, Sanjay Gram, and Rajiv Nagar are some of the locations that the civic body has kept in pocket 2. Finally, areas near Sheetla Colony, Sheetla Mata Mandir and Amanpura village are some of the areas included in pocket 3.MCG has also set up checkpoints to monitor the movement of construction vehicles, constituted teams of 15 officials in each zone to identify and demolish illegal constructions, initiate a drone survey to spot illegal buildings, register FIRs against violators, and erected boards cautioning people against purchasing any property or land in the area.“Each team has officials from the MCG’s engineering and enforcement wings. They all have been provided with necessary equipment, such as earthmovers, cranes, and tractor trolley, for demolishing illegal constructions. We have also set up barricades at multiple entry and exit points in the 900-metre area to look out for any vehicles carrying construction materials,” said Jitender Kumar, joint commissioner, MCG.Kumar said, so far, the MCG has found around 10 construction vehicles and multiple illegal constructions in the area. The civic body has also registered FIRs against more than 15 violators.“The rationale behind dividing the 900-metre restricted area into three pockets is to have greater surveillance and check on illegal constructions in the area. All concerned officials have been assigned their respective duties. We are also holding awareness drives in the locality to ensure that people do not purchase any property in the area and are made aware of the reasons behind it,” said Kumar. As per MCG officials, there are around 19,000 properties in the 900-metre restricted area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-divides-restricted-area-near-iaf-depot-into-three-pockets-101611425031283.html

Students from schools, colleges and other people will get a chance to visit these historical places," he told reporters at Police Gymkhana here."Under the British rule, several freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Motilal Nehru, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, Subhas Chandra Bose had been imprisoned in Yerawada jail and their memories have been preserved there," he said.Deshmukh said that guides will be provided to the visitors and ticket prices will range from ₹5 to ₹50."In view of the coronavirus pandemic, only 50 visitors will be allowed daily," he said.The prisons in Thane, Nashik and Ratnagiri will also be part of the jail tourism initiative, the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-start-jail-tourism-from-jan-26-state-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101611420023848.html
23-01-2021||Kolkata||'Have some dignity': Sloganeering at Netaji event with PM angers Mamata Banerjee||The Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India project, which focuses on indigenous production, would have made Subhas Chandra Bose proud had he been around, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday evening at a programme held at the Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata to mark the 125 birth anniversary of the iconic freedom fighter.“The nation is following the path Netaji showed,” PM Modi said.“Netaji said if you are true to yourself you cannot be wrong to the world. We have to make zero-defect products for the world… I often think how Netaji would feel seeing India surging ahead, its army getting modern weapons, planes like Rafale guarding the nation, vaccines being produced in India. How proud he must have felt seeing India giving vaccines to other nations,” the prime minister said.The government programme marked the launch of the year-long celebrations to be held across India till Bose’s 125th birthday next year. The cultural event was however not spared by the rising tension between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) ahead of the assembly polls due in March-April.When chief minister Mamata Banerjee rose to address the audience before PM Modi, BJP workers, who had gathered on the sprawling campus of the Victoria Memorial Hall in the Maidans, raised the slogans of Jai Sri Ram, at which Banerjee had reacted in the past, while several even booed at her.The compère of the show had to ask the crowd to calm down and let Banerjee, who was allotted five minutes, to speak.Also read: 'Won't speak at this platform' - Mamata feels 'insulted' at Centre's Netaji eventA peeved Banerjee walked up to the dais and said, “I feel a government programme must have some dignity. This is not a political programme but a government programme and it is for the public and all political parties.”“I am grateful to the prime minister that this event is being held in Kolkata. But you have no right to invite someone to a government programme and insult that person. In protest, I am not saying anything. Jai Hind, Jai Bangla,” said Banerjee. The chief minister, however, stayed till the end of the event and took her seat before PM Modi. They were also seen talking.All political parties, including the CPI(M), and eminent intellectuals of Kolkata condemned the raising of the Jai Sri Ram slogan at the event. Some BJP leaders tried to play down the incident while others supported the party supporters.At the event, Modi released a collection of Bose’s letters, two commemorative coins and a stamp. He also felicitated veterans of the Indian National Army that Bose led against the British Indian army. The veterans included Nayek Lalti Ram, Dr BN Pandey and INA Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon’s daughter-in-law.In his 30-minute speech in Hindi, PM Modi paid homage to Bose. He also said a few lines in Bengali.“Today I bow before the sacred land of Bengal that brought up little Subhas and taught him to grow through sacrifice. This land gave the country its national song and anthem,” said Modi who was on a one-day visit to the city.He named eminent social reformers, scientists and educationists and even former President Pranab Mukherjee, who was honoured with the Bharat Ratna, the nation’s highest civilian award by the BJP government.“Netaji’s sacrifice and perseverance is the source of the energy for today’s youth. We want generations to remember him. We have decided that programmes will be held across the nation. Every year, his birthday will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas (day of valour),” said Modi.“When the country is surging ahead in the spirit of 'Make in India', the teachings of Netaji become important because he travelled across the world to create awareness about the nation and to raise an army. He set up the Rani Jhansi Regiment when women did not enjoy such rights. Netaji showed that the British empire, where the sun never set, could be defeated,” said Modi.Also read: 'If China gets aggressive, so will India' - IAF chief on eve of talks with PLA“Netaji said no power in the world can put India in chains as long as it is independent. Netaji used to treat poverty, illiteracy, disease and lack of scientific innovation as the main problems. Today, our nation is striving to make women and farmers self-reliant and strengthening education infrastructure. We are introducing a new national education policy,” said Modi.Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel was also present at the Victoria Memorial Hall. “Netaji probably did not get the honour he deserves. Today, events are also being held at Cuttack in Odisha where Netaji was born and at Haripura in Gujarat, where he was elected president of the Congress party for the first time,” Patel said.The prime minister's plane landed at Kolkata airport around 3 pm. He reached the RCTC ground in the Maidan area in a chopper and his motorcade reached Netaji Bhawan around 3.30 pm. Crowds had gathered at several places to have a glimpse of the prime minister.After visiting Netaji Bhawan, Bose's residence which is now a museum, PM Modi went to the National Library where an international seminar will be held. After spending around 30 minutes at the library campus, the PM Modi's motorcade left for the Victoria Memorial Hall where musical programmes and a son et lumiere on Bose was organised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/have-some-dignity-sloganeering-at-netaji-event-with-pm-angers-mamata-banerjee-101611414900419.html
23-01-2021||Pune||Instil confidence in Covid vaccines||Instil confidence in Covid vaccines The nationwide Covid vaccination drive launched from January 16 saw technical glitches in Co-WIN app —an online platform for monitoring vaccine delivery, a few healthcare and frontline workers refusing to be inoculated and instances of mild adverse effect post jab. Share steps that authorities should take to build confidence in Covid-19 vaccines. Everyone should get vaccinated I recommend everyone to take the vaccine. In our family, my mother, father and wife are doctors. We have decided to get vaccinated. It is not true that everyone gets side effects. It is safe as the company conducts several trials and after that, a vaccine comes into the market. In India, only 0.8 per cent of people who took the jab have showed side effects. That is very normal for any other vaccine. Vaccines, like any medication, can cause side effect. In order to end the pandemic, we have to take vaccines. It is safe and trusted. Dr Ashish Tapadiya Vaccine will boost immunity Covid-19 is a contagion and new disease. To boost immunity, vaccination is the only solution. Vaccines will show different effects on everyone, reactions will be different on each one. It is a new vaccine. There is no need to panic due to side effects. There are two reasons to get vaccinated, one to protect ourselves and second to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be vaccinated – including young babies, those who are seriously ill or have certain allergies. They depend on others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from vaccine-preventable diseases. Dr Siddharth Dhende More awareness needed Government has begun the vaccination of frontline workers. At present, the government is giving vaccines to health workers. However, some health workers are not keen to take vaccines. If frontline workers are showing doubts, how can common man trust in vaccination? The government should create more public awareness and faith among the general public. I will think twice before taking the vaccine. Does one really need to get a vaccine or following precautions are okay? Ashish Adsul Vaccine is safe and needed Being health workers, there is no harm in taking a vaccine. Like any medicine, vaccines can cause mild side effects, such as a low-grade fever, or pain or redness at the injection site. Mild reactions go away within a few days. Severe or long-lasting side effects are extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for safety, to detect rare adverse events. Most of the doctors have taken vaccines and they are feeling good. I spoke to a couple of doctors who took vaccines in the first government phase. I appeal to health care workers who refuse or hesitate to take vaccines, it is safe, and we have to take it to save our family members as we are always close to patients. Leena Gaikwad Don’t make vaccination compulsory The media hype regarding vaccination programme is not needed. The government should focus on providing basic facilities instead of concentrating on vaccines. Our country is out of danger as per government data which is released every day. The Covid cases have drastically come down and normalcy has returned. We shouldn’t force vaccination. Let people decide to vaccinate or not. If the government and companies are saying the vaccines are safe, why are some frontline workers showing hesitancy to take the jab? Pravin Gedam Counselling people to take vaccine There is no reason to worry about vaccination. It is safe and the government is doing a good job to vaccinate frontline workers. There is some issue of reactions, but I don’t think they are serious. In order to live fearlessly, we should have to take the vaccination. We give vaccines to our children for their better health; likewise, we should take a vaccine to keep us fit and fine. Being a government employee and responsible citizen, we are counselling people to take vaccines. We are waiting for a vaccine for family members. Jayant Bhosekar Natural immunity better than vaccines I think natural immunity is better than immunity derived from a vaccine. When pandemic was at a high, there were no vaccines in the market. Now, it has arrived when the spread of Covid has slowed down. I think there is no need to take a vaccine, except those at high-risk. People are aware and taking precautions. The government should not mandate vaccines. Indians have good immunity power. Government figures show less death count as compared to other countries. We should overcome the fear of Covid-19 and return to normal life. Santosh Raut Awaiting vaccine eagerly I recovered from Covid-19 disease and am waiting to get vaccinated. I don’t want anyone to go through this virus trauma. To avoid infection of Covid-19 disease, vaccination is a must. Everyone must take a vaccine. I have made up my mind to vaccinate my family to secure them from Covid-19 side effects. The side effects are minor as compared to the actual infection. I request the government to provide the vaccine for free to children, senior citizens and the poor. Yogesh Dhudhal Vaccine will develop immunity With painstaking effort, researchers have developed vaccines in record time to save mankind. We are grateful to them and are not afraid to take vaccines as it will develop immunity to fight the coronavirus. For many diseases, immunity acquired naturally often lasts longer than from a vaccine, but that means you have to suffer and survive. Therefore, vaccines are the only solution to develop immunity in our body. People will have to get vaccinated to acquire herd immunity. I am positive to take the vaccine along with family members. Saila Shelar Not confident about vaccine There is fear in the minds of people about the vaccines. My doctor friends have advised to wait and watch. Why are some frontline workers not taking the jab? If they are not showing a positive response, how will the common man come forward for vaccination? Though government has created a buzz of vaccination, they are not getting satisfactory responses from frontline workers. It is not in Pune, but across the country. So, I am not confident to take a vaccine at this stage. Chaitanya Machale Wait and watch With some frontline workers showing hesitancy to take vaccines, people have decided to wait and watch. I am also one of them. The government should generate more public awareness like in the case of polio and other vaccination programmes. Co-WIN application glitches showed mismanagement among government machinery. More transparency is needed to develop trust among the common people. We are not against vaccines as researchers have taken a lot of efforts to develop it. So, everyone should respect and appreciate their work, and ensure that their efforts should not be wasted.

Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders waited outside on the request of Netaji’s family members.PM Modi was escorted inside Netaji Bhawan by Netaji's grandnephews Sugata Bose and Sumantra Bose.“I had requested the Prime Minister’s Office that PM Modi should visit as the Prime Minister of India as it was the question of Netaji’s honour on his birthday. Our request was considered and we made arrangements inside the Bhawan accordingly. Everything was done in a dignified manner,” said Sugata Bose, chairman of the Netaji Research Bureau and a former Trinamool Congress MP.The Prime Minister was taken on a short tour of the museum inside the house and was shown the black German Wanderer sedan that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose rode for his great escape in January 16, 1941. He also saw Netaji’s bedroom, his study room and the room of Sarat Chandra Bose, Netaji’s elder brother.Also read: 'Netaji would have been proud to see India's export of Covid vaccine' PM Modi“Almost every Prime Minister of India - from Jawaharlal Nehru to Manmohan Singh - had visited the Netaji Bhawan in the past. They all came here as the Prime Ministers and not the leader of any political party. So, we maintained that even Modi should come as the Prime Minister and not as any political leader,” said Bose.Senior leaders of the BJP including Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP’s national general secretary and BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta waited outside. BJP workers could be heard raising slogans of Jai Shri Ram outside the house on the road.Another of Netaji’s grandnephew and BJP leader, Chandra Kumar Bose, however, said, "Modi was taken inside alone as it is the pandemic time and we decided not to allow a huge gathering inside."PM Modi is, however, not the first prime minister to have visited the Netaji’s ancestral house on January 23. Earlier, Lal Bahadur Shastri and PV Narasimha Rao had visited on Netaji’s birth anniversary. Other prime ministers have also visited but on different occasions.Members of the Bose-family also expressed their reservations on the Centre’s decision to celebrate the icon’s birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas' (day of valour) and not by the names they had proposed. The West Bengal government has named the day as 'Deshnayak Divas'.Chandra Kumar Bose had earlier said the day should be observed as Desh Prem Diwas (day of patriotism).“I personally prefer 'Deshnayak Divas' because that was the name given to Netaji by Rabindranath Tagore. I don’t link 'Parakram Divas' because Netaji was not just a soldier. He won the hearts of India with his love,” said Sugata Bose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/on-bose-s-125th-birth-anniversary-pm-modi-visits-netaji-s-ancestral-house-101611408272556.html

23-01-2021||Pune||Pune’s startup ecosystem: past, present and future||While we look at the ‘startup ecosystem’ as a fairly new phenomenon — technology-driven startups have been around for much longer; for many generations. Technologies change over the decades. In Pune as well, we can trace the activity of some early technology-driven manufacturing/automation ventures (‘startups’), all the way back to the late 19th century. Pune has been a seat of learning for centuries. Pune also has the 2nd oldest engineering college in the country — College of Engineering, Pune — established in 1853. This college has helped the tech and manufacturing startup ecosystem in the city, for over 150 years. There is an interesting piece of history recounted by Prof Ross Bassett in his book ‘The Technological Indian’ about Lokmanya Tilak and Pune. Tilak wrote extensively about modern technology and science in his editorials in Kesari and Mahratta. He highlighted how the ‘West’ was able to lead and colonise the world because of science and technology, and why it was important for Indians to get actively into this domain. Inspired by his writings a young Pune student Keshav Malhar Bhat headed to MIT in the US in the 1880s and became the first Indian to study there. He came back and set up a small engineering venture in Pune. The early 20th century saw the birth of small manufacturing related companies in and around the Pune region. These were the early “manufacturing startups”. One great example of this is the venture set up by Laxmanrao Kirloskar in Kirloskarwadi, which initially focused on farm equipment. Post-independence, in the 1950s and 60s, Pune started becoming the preferred manufacturing destination for the large automotive OEMs like Tata and Bajaj and other engineering companies. This helped in the creation of a big manufacturing supplier ecosystem and resulted in the birth of many small manufacturing units. The Auto-OEM suppliers’ startup network continued to expand and the 1970s/80s saw some small startup companies get into high-end manufacturing automation for a variety of processes like packaging, process manufacturing, assembly automation, material handling, etc. These companies did some non-trivial R&D as well as reverse engineering in addressing the customer requirements and created good import substitutes. (Note — the imported machines back then attracted a steep import duty and hence, there was a push to localise this technology). The 1980s/90s saw the advent of many ‘electronics’ startups — taking advantage of the new trends in control systems and microprocessors. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the birth of smaller companies in the chemical processing and manufacturing area as well. The 1980s also saw the beginning of the “software era” in Pune. Though some computing work was happening earlier as well in some government labs and research institutions here. Not many people know that Infosys actually started in Model Colony in Pune in the early 1980s! Even today, it can be considered as the biggest and most successful software startup out of Pune. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the birth of many new software startups, focusing on IT services and related areas. Some of these have gone onto becoming Pune icons of the present like Persistent Systems and KPIT. The top global startup ecosystem — the Silicon Valley, saw big activity from the 1970s onward. The well-known Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist Paul Graham has written extensively about the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem. He has discussed many factors for its multi-decade success. Key ones being — the presence of a top academic and research ecosystem (driven by universities like Stanford and Berkeley, and many top research labs), presence of large tech companies, ample venture funding, excellent availability of talent, good climate and quality of life, overall infrastructure and more. It is worthwhile to look at some of these factors from a Pune perspective. Pune does tick the boxes for many of these. The city has excellent academic and research institutions. As discussed earlier, the large manufacturing companies initially provided the starting point for a manufacturing start-up ecosystem. Today, Pune has many large Software & IT Services companies. There is excellent talent availability. The city has an excellent year-round climate and quality of life — compared to some of the bigger cities in India. Pune has consistently ranked among the top-5 cities in software & IT startups. The 2000s saw many new startups in the software services and products space. Some of the early software services startups of the 1990s saw good IPO exits as well. The 2000s also saw the formation of a good software startup ecosystem, driven by initiatives and organisations such as TiE Pune, Pune Open Coffee Club, PuneTech, and others. They have provided good networking and mentoring platform for new startups. Angel Investment activity also picked up in the 2000s and 2010s. Many new startup Incubators and Accelerators were set up in the past decade. The 2010s saw some of the leading software startups in Pune hit the ‘Unicorn’ status (valuation over one billion US dollars). This list will continue to grow as we enter the new decade of the 2020s. The 2000s also saw good development in healthcare, energy, and materials areas as well. One of the key catalysts in this process has been the Venture Centre incubator at NCL. This is one of the top startup incubators in the country and provides excellent support, funding, mentoring, and other services for startups. Thanks to the presence of top research and education institutions like NCL, IISER Pune, NIV, NCCS, and others — we have seen good startup activity in the healthcare, energy, and materials space. During the 2020 pandemic, the Venture Centre startup ecosystem helped many startups launch important products and solutions around ventilators, masks, test-kits, diagnostics, and more. As we begin 2021, amidst the unprecedented year-old pandemic, — virus testing and vaccines have become the top focus areas for the world. The biotech & healthcare ecosystem in Pune is well-positioned with large companies (like Serum Institute of India — which is manufacturing the ‘Oxford Vaccine’ for the global market), mid-sized pharma companies, and small startups. One of these small startups ‘MyLab Solutions’ became the first one to develop a domestic test-kit for the Covid-19 virus. Another company, Gennova Biopharmaceuticals is developing India’s first mRNA vaccine for Covid-19.

The police said the suspects broke into the house in the early hours of Friday, stabbed the woman and escaped with cash, jewellery and valuables. Her tenant and a 15-year-old boy were later caught by the police for their alleged involvement.The tenant, who is in late twenties, knew that the deceased, Veena Devi, had jewellery and cash in her bedroom’s almirah, said the police.The police received information about the murder on Friday morning around 10am. “A woman who worked at her house tried to open the door but despite repeated attempts and ringing of door bell no one answered. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the help informed the neighbours and the police were called in. “The police teams broke open the door and found the woman lying in a pool of blood in her bedroom. She was lying on the floor,” he said. She was rushed to a private hospital where doctors declared her brought dead, said police. A forensic team, dog squad and crime team reached the spot and took samples from the room, following which the two were arrested, said police. Sangwan said the woman lived alone in her two-storey independent house in Sonha. Her husband died a few years ago. Her son lives in London with his family while daughter lives in Australia. “The police station teams have been directed to visit senior citizens regularly and to check their well-being,” he said. A case of murder and robbery was registered at Sohna police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/65yearold-woman-found-murdered-in-sohna-101611402590873.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Three, including two advocates, held for land fraud||Haryana crime police has arrested three persons, including two advocates, for fraudulently selling two acres of land in village Islampur in Sector 38, acquired by Haryana Sahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) in the district, to a private company, thereby causing loss worth crores of rupees to the state exchequer, said the police on Friday. Muhammad Akil, director-general of police (crime), Panchkula, said that the land in question was acquired by HSVP in 1993 and was sold by the suspects to a private company for ₹2 crore on the basis of forged documents and witnesses. “Two of the suspects, Rohit Thakaran of village Jharsa and Ajay Chaudhary, a resident of village Islampur, hatched a plan and got the land transferred in the name of the latter by showing fake witnesses, impersonating the original owners of the property,” Akil said. Akil said they arrested Rohit Thakran and advocates Chaman Lal Arora and Subhash Chand Arora, who were witnesses in the sale deed registration, from different parts of the city on January 18. Ajay Choudhary is still untraceable, said the police. They will be produced before the court on Saturday after the end of police remand. The police said the matter came to their notice when one of the victims, Murti Devi, a resident of Gupta Colony in Gurugram, filed a complaint in this regard. Based on the complaint, state crime branch (Gurugram unit) arrested the suspects. The victim had approached the police after a SK Sharma, a Sector 39 resident, highlighted the alleged fraud in 2020 through an RTI. Akil said the notification for acquisition of around 2.5-acre land owned by a person named Mauji Lal of Islampur was issued in March 1990 and the acquisition by HSVP was completed in March 1993. But mutation of the land was not carried out and the land continued to be in the name of Mauji Lal in the revenue records. “In 1998, Mauji Lal died. He was survived by wife Pasto Devi and three daughters – Murti, Bala and Laxmi. The family got a compensation of ₹24 lakh from HSVP in different installments,” he said. In 2014, the suspects with the help of revenue officials illegally replaced the name of Mauji Lal with his wife Pasto Devi and her three daughters. The police said Ajay Chaudhary then appeared before the Punjab and Haryana High Court as Ajay Thakran, impersonating the non-existent grandson of Mauji, and managed to release a portion of the land in June 2014 through a release deed. The deed was then allegedly executed by a woman impersonating Mauji’s daughter, Laxmi. The alleged impersonator then transferred the land in the name of Ajay Chaudhary.Akil said Chaudhary transferred ₹29 lakh out of ₹2 crore to the account of Rohit Thakran, the suspected mastermind of the case. Dharamvir Singh, deputy superintendent of police (state crime), said that Murti Devi, the daughter of the deceased, in her statement said that she along with her two sisters, Laxmi Devi and Bala Devi, had taken compensation for their father’s land in Islampur village. “They had not signed any release deed in favour of anyone. They came to know that Ajay Chaudhary with the help of an impersonator had transferred the land in her name. The signature and the photograph on the registry belonged to someone else,” he said. On the basis of her complaint, a case has been registered at Sadar police station under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery) and 471 (forged document) and 120B (conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code. Singh said mastermind Thakran has been involved in other cases including liquor smuggling. His accomplice Ajay Chaudhary has been allegedly involved in shooting and murder of a Rajasthan Police constable in 2006. Further probe in the case is underway. Estate officer-2 of HSVP (Gurugram) Vivek Kalia said, “They had given the copy of all relevant documents to police for their investigation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-including-two-advocates-held-for-land-fraud-101611402589941.html
23-01-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Collective experience of theatre is the only “normal”||In my previous article, I had disregarded the theory that the theatre experience will now evolve. I am not sure if “evolve” is the correct term here. Because I definitely do not consider watching shows online as an improvement over the live theatre experience. Let me use “change” instead. To be honest, I did begin doubting the existence of the collective experience in the future. These strong doubts were, ironically, given a rather insipid term – “the new normal”. Somewhere around June, after being away from any kind of performance for nearly 100 days, the void started playing on my mind. I was aware that I was one of the privileged ones. Many theatre artistes, actors and technicians, were going through financial issues. We were trying to do our bit by setting up a fund for them. Many artists around me had adapted themselves to another new normal – performances using Zoom! I genuinely envied them and their resilience. I finally gave in and performed online too. Everything about it was pretty similar to our live show. Announcing it online, getting people to buy the tickets, getting ready to perform, the goosebumps before the actual performance, meditating 10 minutes before curtain, watching the audience fill up – every experience was similar to a show in the theatre. Everything, except the actual performance! Something was missing. I could feel it while performing. But I dismissed it immediately because not being present in the moment while performing is one of the biggest mistakes an artist can commit! A few friends started a gathering of theatre practitioners from across the country (online, of course!) and rightly named it “Theatre Adda”. The idea was to have an informal dialogue between the theatre community in India, understand what the counterparts in different parts of the country are currently doing and just help each other cope with the long pause in live performances. It was very exciting to interact with nearly two hundred people from all over the country! The discussion quickly shifted to online theatre performances and its pros and cons. We also discussed the new initiatives, many of the online ticket booking software had started and how to use them to perform. Some were looking forward to using this new medium in a high data consuming and content hungry country like ours. Most of the people discussing were either actors or directors. While this discussion was on, one of the theatrewallahs interjected. He introduced himself as a light designer and operator, working for the past 30 years. He said one simple thing – “I cannot be a part of the online theatre performances and I miss the touch of my light operating board”. That was a moment of reckoning for me. That right there was the difference between a performance and a theatre experience! There was no give and take between the artists and the audience. It was like performing in front of a mirror. Where you are watching yourself perform. Techies will now tell me about the “gallery view” in Zoom. But not everybody in the audience has their cameras switched on, even if we request them to keep them on. In contrast, most people don’t switch off their microphones. Honestly, I do have a fundamental problem with asking people to switch off their microphones. Do we ask them to put themselves on mute when they come to the theatre? (Their phones, yes!) We expect them to watch, listen and react! I know that not every performance needs an applause, laughter or any audience reaction. Some pieces work best in silence. But there is no denying the fact that even that silence has to be collective, voluntarily. Not by pressing a button! It was right at that moment in the “Theatre Adda” that I stopped brooding about the future of theatre. I knew that it was secure. There was no substitute to this collective experience. And as John Steinbeck puts it: The theatre is the only institution in the world which has been dying for four thousand years and has never succumbed. It requires tough and devoted people to keep it alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-collective-experience-of-theatre-is-the-only-normal-101611401389874.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Injustice with Somnath Bharti in AIIMS security staff assault case: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday expressed resentment over its MLA Somnath Bharti's jail for assaulting a security staff of AIIMSand said it feels injustice has been done to him."We respect and have full faith in judiciary. However, we feel injustice has happened to Somnath Bharti in this case. Somnath is a very popular leader and is loved by everyone in his constituency. People are quite sad in his constituency as the news of his conviction is spreading," the AAP said.Earlier in the day, a Delhi court sentenced Bharti to two years in jail in a case registered in 2016.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey also imposed a fine of ₹one lakh on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader.Bharti, however, was granted bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against his conviction in the case and jail term.According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down the fence of a boundary wall at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here with a JCB operator."The court is of the considered view that the prosecution has duly proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt against accused Somnath Bharti," the magistrate said.The court convicted Bharti for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 147 (rioting).It also held the AAP MLA guilty under section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.The offences carry a maximum punishment of five years in jail.The court, however, acquitted Bharti's associates and co-accused -- Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey -- citing a lack of evidence against them.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from R S Rawat, Chief Security Officer, AIIMS.Bharti had told the court that police officials and other witnesses had deposed against him in order to falsely implicate him in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/injustice-with-somnath-bharti-in-aiims-security-staff-assault-case-aap-101611400225506.html
23-01-2021||Other||Amarinder unquestioned leader of Punjab: Rawat||Punjab Congress affairs in-charge Harish Rawat has said that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh remains the unquestioned leader of the state. “Captain Amarinder Singh is already in command in Punjab and no one has objected to it,” Rawat, an All-India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary, said on Friday when asked about who will lead the party in the Punjab assembly elections next year.Rawat was in Jalandhar to attend a function organised by a media house to help families hit by terrorism. Later, he visited Dera Sachkhand Ballan of the Ravidassia community. On former state minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, who has been consigned to the margins of state politics due to his differences with Amarinder, Rawat said the state unit must involve him in its activities. Rawat, who is also a former Uttarakhand chief minister, said, “The process of resolution of differences (between Sidhu and the CM) has started. Now, it is up to both of them on when they complete the process.” He added, “If you keep such a capable person (Sidhu) in the party without any responsibility (whether in the government or the party) then what will people ask us. Responsibility will be given to Sidhu, but with every responsibility, there is some human issue. We have to see how these issues are resolved.” He added that the setting up a new organisational structure of the party in Punjab had been delayed as he does not want to divert the attention from the farmers’ agitation on the borders of Delhi. “For the new set-up, we have to hold talks with workers. This will divert their attention from farmer protests and it is not the appropriate time,” Rawat said. On grievances of local Congress leaders with the state bureaucracy, he said Punjab MLAs have more power than MLAs in other states as the CM has delegated more powers, in the interest of governance. “There were delays in action in important cases such as sacrilege or drugs. The government’s actions have also remained under judicial scrutiny. The government works at the pace of a cricket test match and not T20. If it works like T20, there will be cracks,” he said. He said that even the common man had now understood that the new farm laws were against them and had started opposing the Narendra Modi government. “The Centre’s use of the NIA to silence farmers is condemnable. It must realise that Punjab is a border state,” Rawat added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amarinder-unquestioned-leader-of-punjab-rawat-101611400670558.html
23-01-2021||Patna||Bihar’s Congress in charge’s task cut out amid murmurs of split||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Mohammad Zama Khan is all set to join the JD(U) a few days after meeting the ruling party’s former state president and Rajya Sabha member, Vashishtha Narayan Singh, on January 18. Congress legislator from Chenari, Murari Kumar Gautam, had also met Singh the same day.The Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, however, does not attach much significance to Murari’s meeting with Singh, saying there was nothing objectionable in such meetings.A section of Congress leaders, on the other hand, believe that Murari’s meeting with the JD(U) leader could be viewed in the light of growing dissensions in the party. A former MLA Bharat Singh had recently claimed that 11 out of Congress’ 19 MLAs were ready to join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).Jha, however, strongly denied any fear of a spilt in the party, claiming that only ‘weak’ minds could think about it. Ironically, several Congress MLAs had quit the party and joined the JD(U) just before the assembly elections a couple of months ago.Many party leaders believed that the new All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for Bihar, Bhakta Charan Das, would have a difficult time revitalising the organisation in the face of factional feuds in the party and a fear of split.“As many as seven legislators out of the 19 did not turn up at the BPCC office when Das visited it for the first time as the in-charge. There were only four MLAs, who took part in the Raj Bhawan march, taken out in support of agitating farmers on January 15, despite instructions from Das,” said a leader, who didn’t wish to be named.Many senior Congress leaders like former Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar and former governor Nikhil Kumar hardly visit Sadaquat Ashram—the BPCC headquarter—even on important occasions. Former BPCC presidents Anil Sharma and Chandan Bagchi are often in news for their reservations.Senior leader and AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha said that the appointment of Das had bolstered the workers’ hope for the organisation’s rejuvenation.“Only elected leaders don’t make the organisation. Senior leaders, who couldn’t get a chance to fight election or failed in electoral politics, shall also be given due importance for their role in strengthening the party’s roots. Trusted leaders with credentials shall also be recognised and used in the organisation,” said Jha.Also Read: Bihar govt puts classified files related to Subash Chandra Bose on internetReferring to the district level programme being undertaken by Das, another party veteran said it would have been better if the AICC in charge opted to work with a new team. “Continuing with the old set of leaders, whose inefficiency led to reduction of the party’s tally in the assembly, would not help,” he added.The AICC in-charge has proposed to undertake padyatra in several districts, including Vaishali, Muzaffarpur, Chapra, Siwan, East and West Champaran, Ara, Buxar, Gaya, Jehanabad, Arwal, etc, during his 12-day stay in the state. Das is arriving in Patna on January 25 and will launch his campaign from January 27 after presiding over the Republic Day celebrations in the BPCC office. He would wind up his first campaign in the state on February 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-congress-in-charge-s-task-cut-out-amid-murmurs-of-split-101611399910858.html

AAP legislator and leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said party workers took out two-wheeler rallies across the state to mobilise people for the tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day. The rallies were organised in Sangrur, Mohali and Faridkot. The AAP workers taking part in the rallies carried placards with slogans such as No Farmer No Food and Kisan Mazdoor Ekta Zindabad. The AAP has already announced that it will join the farmers’ tractor parade in Delhi but “not as a political party”. MLAs and office-bearers from the party’s Punjab unit would take part in the tractor parade on January 26. The farmer unions protesting against the three farm laws of the Centre plan to hold the tractor parade on the busy Outer Ring Road in the national capital. Scores of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-holds-motorcycle-rallies-in-punjab-to-mobilise-people-for-r-day-tractor-parade-101611398750377.html

23-01-2021||Kolkata||Will celebrate Netaji's birthday as Desh Nayak Diwas: Mamata Banerjee||On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on Saturday, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee pointed out that Netaji did not get his due respect and asserted that the state will celebrate the event as 'Desh Nayak Diwas'.Banerjee said, "There has been no patriot like Netaji. He endorsed Tagore's 'Jana Gana Mana' for the National Anthem. He gave the 'Jai Hind' slogan. Netaji was a great philosopher. He envisioned the Planning Commission and the Indian National Army before Independence. But Netaji did not get his due respect."Criticising the central government in a vieled manner, Banerjee said, "They claim to revere Netaji but scrapped the Planning Commission. I do not know why?"The chief minister said, "We will celebrate the birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose as 'Desh Nayak Diwas'. It is based on a great history. Rabindranath Tagore addressed Netaji as Desha Nayak. We formed a committee for Netaji's 125th birth anniversary celebration. Amartya Sen, Abhijeet Banerjee and eminent personalities are part of the committee for the year-long celebration."She also announced to introduce Netaji Subhas University and Jai Hind Vahini. "We know about the birthday but do not know about his death. This is very painful," she added.While there is controversy over Bose's death in a plane crash in Taipei on August 18, 1945, the Central government had in an RTI in 2017 confirmed that he had died in the incident.Mamata Banerjee further led a march from Shyam Bazaar to Red Road in Kolkata.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Kolkata's Netaji Bhawan at Elgin Road today. The Prime Minister will preside over the inaugural function of the 'Parakram Diwas' celebrations at Victoria Memorial in Kolkata.In order to honour and remember Netaji's indomitable spirit and selfless service to the nation, the Government of India has decided to celebrate his birthday on January 23 every year as 'Parakram Diwas' to inspire people of the country, especially the youth, to act with fortitude in the face of adversity as Netaji did, and to infuse in them a spirit of patriotic fervour.Born to advocate Janakinath Bose in Odisha's Cuttack on January 23, 1897, Netaji went on to play a key role in the freedom movement. He is also known for establishing the Azad Hind Fauj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/will-celebrate-netaji-s-birthday-as-desh-nayak-diwas-mamata-banerjee-101611388876713.html
23-01-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan BJP’s core group underlines efforts to bridge differences||Rajasthan BJP’s core group comprising 12 members and four special invitees has been formed, putting an end to speculations over former chief minister and national vice-president Vasundhara Raje’s political future in the state. BJP national general secretary and state in-charge Arun Singh notified the core group on Thursday night.Surprisingly, no Meena leader has been included in the group from east Rajasthan, where BJP performed poorly in the local body elections held in December 2020. Also, no former state president has been included in the group.Other prominent leaders in the group include state BJP president Satish Poonia, leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria, Rajya Sabha MP Om Prakash Mathur, state general secretary Chandra Shekhar, deputy leader of the Opposition Rajendra Rathore, Union ministers Gajendra Singh, Arjun Meghwal, Kailash Chaudhary, state vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP Rajendra Gehlot, Lok Sabha MP CP Joshi and Kanakamal Katara.The four special invites are BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, Rajya Sabha MP Bhupendra Yadav, national vice-president Bharti Ben Shial and national secretary Alka Singh Gurjar.A senior BJP leader said that attempts have been made to include almost all the major communities in the core group. “The core group includes three Rajput leaders, two Jats, one Vaishya, one Brahmin, one Gurjar, one Yadav, and one each from Mali, dalit and adivasi communities,” he said.Kirodi Lal Meena and Jaskaur Meena from eastern Rajasthan, where the BJP performed poorly in the local body elections, have been excluded from the core group. Instead, tribal leader Kanakmal Katara has been given a place, the BJP leader added.“Former MLA from Bandikui and now national secretary Alka Singh has been made a special invitee. East Rajasthan is still a weak link and yet the party has surprised us by not giving any Meena leader a place. Jaskaur Meena and Kirodi Lal Meena were the contenders from eastern Rajasthan but political differences have arisen between the two,” said another BJP leader, who didn’t wish to be named.Also Read: Man behind extortion, death threats to Rajasthan BJP leader idolises DawoodBy giving place to opposing camps in the core group, an exercise has been made to maintain a political balance. The group is also mandated to meet every month to prevent any communication gap and serious differences, the leader quoted above added.Senior journalist and political analyst Tribhuvan said all the leaders who are potential chief minister candidates have been given a place in the core group.“The national leadership has tried to stop the infighting between the senior leaders which threatened to damage the party in the future. Results of the last three elections indicate there is a high chance that the BJP will form the government after the 2023 state assembly elections that’s why the national leadership is leaving no stone unturned to bring every faction together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-bjp-s-core-group-underlines-efforts-to-bridge-differences-101611385472152.html

The minimum temperature rose to eight degrees Celsius as a result of easterly winds and a cloud cover over the national capital, an IMD official said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said easterly winds are not as cold as the northwesterly winds coming in from the snow-clad western Himalayas, while clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, pushing the minimum temperature up.However, the minimum temperature in Delhi will again drop to four degrees Celsius by Monday, Srivastava said."The WD will lead to widespread snowfall in the upper hills of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Cold, dry winds from the snow-capped mountains will bring the mercury down to four degrees Celsius by Monday," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-minimum-temperature-rises-to-8-degree-celsius-101611377822263.html
23-01-2021||Chandigarh||Controversy over sale of Dhirendra Brahmachari’s ashram land in Haryana’s Gurugram||Twenty-four acres of prime land in Gurugram, owned by yoga guru Dhirendra Brahmachari’s Aparna Ashram Society, is at the centre of a controversy following the sale of the plot at throwaway price to three private companies.A sale deed for 24 acres at Silokhra village in Gurugram was registered by the naib tehsildar of Wazirabad in December 2020 for a mere ₹55 crore.UNDERVALUED SALE, SKIPPED E-REGISTRATION The red flag was raised by Surya Prakash, the legal representative of the ashram, following which, an inquiry was ordered by the Haryana government.During the inquiry, it was found that not only was the land sold by members of the society to three companies at a grossly undervalued price, but the sale deed was also executed manually by skipping the electronic appointment process.The inquiry being conducted by the Gurugram divisional commissioner is also examining the implication of a 2016 order of a civil judge restraining the members of the society from interfering in the ownership and possession of the society.Officials said that after the death of Dhirendra Brahmachari, a dispute broke out between members of the society and is continuing in different courts for the past two decades.WILL CANCEL SALE DEED IF UNDERVALUED: DUSHYANTState revenue minister Dushyant Chautala said that under the Indian Registration Act, the state government has the power to cancel the sale deed. “We will cancel the registration of the sale deed if there is an evasion of stamp duty due to under valuation of the property and execution of the sale agreement despite orders of the civil court,” Chautala said.Top officials said that the district authorities have been asked to take prompt action and remedial measures.“On the basis of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for reaching at an agreed price, it is beyond doubt that the agreed price of the land of Aparna Ashram was ₹12 crore per acre, which works out to be ₹288 crore for 24 acres. Hence, the sale deed of ₹55 crore is grossly undervalued,” said a communication sent by the revenue department to the Gurugram deputy commissioner.FORMER DC’S ORDER CHALLENGED IN COURT After the controversy broke out, the then Gurugram deputy commissioner set aside the registration deed after first allowing manual registration of the same.The order of the deputy commissioner has been challenged by one of the private buyers of the ashram land in the Punjab and Haryana high court on grounds that the order lacked jurisdiction.The case is listed for hearing on February 15.Asked about the controversial order of his predecessor to set aside the registration deed and actions recommended by the state government, present deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that the DC being the registrar had passed the order to set aside the registration.“We will follow the directions of the state government and the court,’’ Garg said.Officials said there were more issues in the deed that needed scrutiny . “How was the sum of ₹55 crore arrived at for sale of a prime piece of land? Did the managing committee of the ashram pass a resolution in this regard?’’ an official said.Officials are contemplating the ordering of attachment of the ashram land as there are multiple disputes.FLYING SWAMI AND CONTROVERSIESBrahmachari (1924-94) was a yoga guru to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. He was a known influencer in the decision-making process of the central government under Gandhi. He had opened yoga training institutes in Jammu and Delhi, benefitting from his proximity to the late PM in getting prime land.Brahmachari was accused of smuggling an aircraft from the United States during the imposition of Emergency, without paying custom duty. He was also at the centre of a controversy for importing gun parts illegally from Spain for his arms factory.Known as the Flying Swami, he died in a plane crash in 1994.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/controversy-over-sale-of-dhirendra-brahmachari-s-ashram-land-in-haryana-s-gurugram-101611375769378.html
23-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC minister Rajib Banerjee quits cabinet; party expels another MLA||In a fresh jolt to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) dispensation, West Bengal forest minister Rajib Banerjee on Friday stepped down from his post amid speculation that he may soon quit the ruling party to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the crucial assembly elections due in April-May.Later in the day, in a strong message to rebel leaders, the TMC expelled Vaishali Dalmiya, MLA from Bally in Howrah district, from the party amid speculations that the she, along with Banerjee, may soon join the BJP.Banerjee, the MLA from Domjur who has been airing his grievances against a section of leaders of the ruling party over the past few months, is the second minister from Howrah district and third minister in the state to have resigned from the Mamata Banerjee cabinet. He has skipped at least five consecutive meetings of the cabinet and more than a dozen party programmes since September last year.“For the past one-and-a-half months, I was extremely hurt by the behavior of some of my party colleagues. I never made any personal attack. I feel extremely hurt today. I had no option but to resign. I offer my apology if I have hurt anyone,” a choked Banerjee told reporters in Kolkata, as the former minister tried to hold back his tears.The TMC leader submitted his resignation letter to the CM in the morning and a copy of the same was accepted by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in the afternoon.“I regret to inform you that I hereby tender my resignation from my office as a cabinet minister being in charge of the forest department …..It has been a great honour and privilege to serve the people of West Bengal. I heartily convey my gratitude for getting this opportunity,” the letter read. Avoiding questions on his next move, he said: “I will continue to serve the people from whatever platform I get.”The TMC leader’s former colleague and BJP’s MP from Barrackpore Arjun Singh said that Banerjee was welcomed to join the saffron party. “More legislators and leaders will leave the TMC,” he said. However, TMC MP and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said the party will not be affected by the resignation. “This will not make any difference to the TMC. If people like these leave, our party will get more consolidated,” he said.Meanwhile, Dalmiya drew the ire of the party leadership over her recent remarks that there are “termites in the TMC who are breaking the party from within.” “Does working for people tantamount to breach of party discipline? I spoke against unfair activities in the party. I came to serve the people and will do so in the future. I have not decided what I will do right now,” she said on her expulsion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-minister-rajib-banerjee-quits-cabinet-party-expels-another-mla-101611367791332.html

23-01-2021||Patna||‘Objectionable’ social media posts against Nitish govt, officials now a crime in Bihar||A Bihar administrative order making it a cybercrime to post offensive, objectionable or critical content on social media against the state government, its ministers, officials, members of Parliament and members of the legislative assembly triggered a political row in the state on Friday, with critics describing it as an attempt to muzzle free speech.The order was issued by additional director general (ADG) of the economic offences unit (EOU) Nayyar Husnain Khan on Thursday. Individuals and organisations who post such content will invite “appropriate action” under the law, the order said.Khan said the EOU would lodge a first information report, after conducting an inquiry, under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust) , 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 467 (forgery of valuable security) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections 64 (recovery of compensation), 65 (tampering with computer source documents) and 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act.“The order seems to be an administrative direction which is vague and intended towards intimidation of the press and public that use social media demanding accountability of public administration,” said Apar Gupta, a trustee of the Internet Freedom Foundation.As a political slugfest ensued, the police clarified on Friday that “constructive criticism” wouldn’t fall afoul of the directive.The directive, which was sent to all principal secretaries and secretaries, cited an increasing number of complaints against the trend of posting slanderous and offensive content on social media platforms against government ministers, officials, MPs and MLAs by individuals as well as organised entities.“Such acts are against the law and come under the category of cybercrime. It is imperative that appropriate action is taken against such acts and persons putting posts having offensive/ abusive tenor. So, it is requested to all that on information of any such offensive posts in the social media, the EOU is informed so that an inquiry is made and necessary action as per law is taken,” the order read.Leader of the opposition in the assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday for the edict, comparing the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), leader to Hitler. Yadav challenged the chief minister to arrest him, accusing Kumar of promoting corruption, patronising criminals and also alleging that Bihar Police was involved in the illegal sale of liquor in a dry state. “I dare the chief minister to arrest me for (making) these accusations under the new directive,” he said. Congress leader and member of the legislative council (MLC) Premchand Mishra said the directive showed that the state government was scared of criticism and called it an unacceptable violation of the right to freedom of speech. RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha said the directive illustrated how Bihar had become a “Talibani” state, adding that people of Bihar wouldn’t tolerate what he called a “Tuglaqi farman”, referring to Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, the sultan of Delhi from 1325 to 1351, who was known to act on whims and fancies.“It means that the police would now put anybody in jail or harass a person if he is critical of the government or puts posts highlighting failure of the government. This is nothing but an attempt to suppress free speech and gag the people’s voice. This directive has to be withdrawn immediately,” Jha said.The ruling JD(U) and its partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), defended the decision, claiming it would help in checking abusive social media posts against the government and its officials. “It is a good step as these days one can notice how people put objectionable and offensive posts against government officials and others on social media. This is wrong and needs to be checked,” said deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad of the BJP. JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the directive would deter “unscrupulous elements” from using social media to post offensive content. Khan, the official who issued the directive, called it a routine order.“We will act against any attempt to malign the image of any political leaders or government officials if the department receives a complaint from the victim. The EOU would lodge an FIR [first information report] after a proper inquiry,” he said.Some Indian Police Service officers said the directive should have made the posting of offensive content targeting ordinary people a crime as well. “In a democracy, every person has a right to an opinion and express the same. If action could be taken against criticism of government officials and ministers, why not action be taken against critical posts against common man,” said a senior IPS officer on condition of anonymity.Legal experts also questioned the purpose behind such an order. “This letter is wholly unwarranted and erroneous. It doesn’t clarify under which law it would be an offence justifying legal action,” said senior advocate Sashi Kant of the Patna high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/objectionable-social-media-posts-against-nitish-govt-now-a-crime-in-bihar-101611359215329.html
23-01-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa reshuffles cabinet to contain dissent||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday caved into demands of dissenting ministers and made changes to his cabinet by redistributing portfolios to calm tempers, barely a day after rebellion broke out within his government.The changes were made less than a day after his government distributed and reshuffled several portfolios to newly inducted ministers who were sworn in on January 13 .The move leaves the 77-year old chief minister vulnerable to more such demands from disgruntled leaders within his two-year old government riven by dissent.J.C.Madhuswamy, who was stripped of minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs was given Haj and Wakf department along with his earlier allotted medical education.“Even I do not know the details as I am in Mysuru and have had no contact with the CM. I will wait a few days before taking any decision,” Madhuswamy said on Friday. He, however, refused to reveal what decision he is likely to take.K.Gopalaiah, a former Janata Dal (Secular) leader who helped Yediyurappa to power along with 16 other legislators, was handed the excise department. Gopalaiah said that he was happy with the newly allotted excise portfolio.N.Nagaraju (M.T.B), one of the several people, who had openly lashed out at the choice of portfolios, was made minister for municipal administration and sugarcane development.However, health and family welfare minister K.Sudhakar remains disenchanted after he was stripped of the medical education portfolio, people aware of developments said.Gopalaiah said that the issue of Sudhakar is something that the CM has to take care of.Sudhakar is one of the several legislators within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Karnataka who hone feelings of neglect in the latest cabinet reshuffle exercise.Several legislators overlooked in the cabinet have also started holding meetings among themselves to decide the next course of action to be heard by the party’s central leadership.Yediyurappa divested from his own kitty and handed over planning, programme monitoring and statistics department to K.C.Narayana Gowda, another dissenting minister.Arvind Limbavali, a legislator who helped secure the support of the turncoats, was given the Kannada and culture portfolio in addition to the forest department, he was allocated on Thursday.Yediyurappa’s fire fighting may have prevented an imminent explosion of dissent but simmering tensions are likely to play out in the near future that could make life more difficult for the chief minister.With elections just two years away, any cracks within the BJP is likely to play to the advantage of the Congress, the principal opposition party in the state.Narendar Pani, political analyst and faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), said that this style of functioning is typical of Yediyurappa who is trying to cultivate a section of legislators and others loyal to him.“He is treating the turncoats as one branch within the party by taking from one and giving it to another. As long as he doesn’t have a major faction developing against him, he should be okay and get his job done,” Pani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappa-reshuffles-cabinet-to-contain-dissent-101611357589300.html

The commute was the most creative aspect of her day—it would give her ideas for prose and also for occasional poetry. “Looking at strangers’ faces, I would try to imagine the stories behind them.” Her writing pad was a tablet—husband Gagan’s gift.Today she shares a poem she wrote when brother, Vikas, was starting a new life in Europe. (While posing for a snap, her younger son, Samarth, tiptoes from behind, and photo-bombs the portrait.)The immigrantIf I were you, I wouldn’t have left as soon as I had turned twenty-one,Leaving pale memories at home and its sullen owners comforting themselves,Dusting the dirt off your little belongings, in a hope that you may need them when you return.If I were you, I wouldn’t have chosen a place where sun shines only for a few months in a year,Unlike our own land where the tan is not a statement but a by-product.If I were you I wouldn’t have needed to do currency conversions in my head, every time I had stopped by an unknown roadside joint to have a meal.If I were you, I wouldn’t have had the heart to make space for the immigrants from that hostile neighbouring land of ours.But there, they were as attached to you as if they belonged to the same bloodline.That hard-to-ignore resemblance: of the same colour, of the familiar dialect or that twin expression of brotherhood.If I were you, I wouldn’t have mustered the courage to stand for my dreams: To make big in the world of strangers, miles away from my birthplace.Getting glances, some loathsome, some surprised, others plain indifferent but never familiar.How I wish sometimes that I were you, so that I could have just for onceFelt the pains and joys of leaving the beloved motherland.Left behind but never forgotten, memories etched deep inside my soul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-stories-on-the-move-101611355132995.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers at Singhu border allege bid to infiltrate, spark violence||Farmers gathered at the Singhu border late on Friday alleged attempts to engineer violence at their protest site or during their upcoming tractor rally on Republic Day, with union leaders saying they had detained a man who was moving suspiciously among them.The development came on a day when talks between the farmers and the government broke down, and they said they will go ahead with their January 26 tractor rally inside the national capital – a demonstration that the government is attempting to avert.The farmers presented the man detained by them, who said that he and “dozens of other men and women” were attempting to bring weapons into the site to kill multiple people. The man, who was masked, did not identify at whose behest he was working but said his handlers had told the group “that the protesters were bad people, fighting for the wrong cause and are our enemies”.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said, “It is a matter of probe who was being benefitted by disrupting our movement. Everyone knows ours is a peaceful protest. He (the masked man) says he works for money. We need to know who is funding him”.Soon, the press conference was interrupted with some men seemingly in police uniform taking the masked man away.HT could not verify the identity of the man detained, the personnel who took him away or the allegations made by the unions.Earlier, the Delhi Police proposed a route map to the farmers where they could hold a tractor rally on January 26. Police officers did not share details of the proposed route but the farmers had been told to take out the rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway on the periphery of the capital.The farmer groups confirmed they had received a proposal from the police but said they would respond only after holding a meeting on Saturday. They had planned the rally on the Outer Ring Road and had assured the police that it will be completely peaceful and that the protesters will not try to reach other areas in the city.Police officers have maintained that no official permission has yet been given to the protesters for the rally since it could create a law and order problem on the Republic Day and trigger traffic chaos.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said they are waiting for the farmer’s response and the future course of action would be decided accordingly.In the afternoon, however, there was some ruckus near Vigyan Bhawan when a group of farmers heading to the meeting with the Centre alleged that their car was stopped by the police and the rear windshield of the vehicle was broken by cops.Police officials said that every vehicle carrying farmers, coming to Vigyan Bhawan from Singhu Border, is escorted the police. Senior officials said they did not have any information about the vehicle joining the police escort and it was therefore stopped before Vigyan Bhawan. “On this, the farmers in the car got agitated and themselves damaged the car using a baton. There was no police action in this incident,” a senior officer said, who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-at-singhu-border-allege-bid-to-infiltrate-spark-violence-101611347757069.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram health worker who took Covishield shot dies of heart attack, officials wait for confirmatory report||A 56-year-old health worker at Bhangrola primary health centre, who had received a Covid-19 vaccine shot on January 16, died due to cardiac arrest on Friday. The district health department officials said that preliminary findings showed that the death might be unrelated to vaccination as the woman had shown no adverse reaction to the vaccine in the last five days.“Her viscera have been sent to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, to determine the actual cause of death,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district.“The cause of her death, if due to vaccination, is yet to be confirmed. She had received the Covishield shot. The postmortem done in Gurugram does not give any conclusive cause of death. But based on the examination by doctors of the Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee, the woman died due to cardiac arrest in her sleep,” he said, adding that until the final examination report is declared nothing can be claimed. “The state and central government have been informed about the incident” he said.After confirmation given by the family, the hospital authority called the police to take the woman’s husband Lal Singh’sstatement before a post-mortem examination to know the exact cause of death.The health worker, Rajwanti, was a resident of Krishna Colony.Her husband, Lal Singh, on Friday wrote to the SHO, New Colony police station, seeking to perform the last rites as there was a delay in postmortem report. Citing the entire episode, Singh in his letter said that his wife had slept at around 10pm on Thursday but she did not wake up the next morning. Thereafter, she was rushed to a private hospital in sector 39 where she was declared brought dead.Singh said, “My wife had no health issues. At 8am she was declared dead, and we received the body around 4pm.”In Gurugram, over 21 cases of minor side effects —such as nausea and high fever — had been reported since the Covid-19 vaccination drive started on January 16. None of them had to be admitted in hospital. The AEFI committee has been constituted to study and examine the adverse reactions reported by people after taking the vaccine jab. As per the health department data, no case of AEFI has been reported on Thursday and Friday. Experts say minor symptoms, like pain or swelling at the injection site and fever, are common in all sorts of vaccinations, and people should not be hesitant of taking the jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-health-worker-who-got-jab-dies-vaccine-link-not-established-101611346845235.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Only 35% health care workers in Delhi's Shahdara district have got jab so far||After four rounds of Covid-19 inoculation in the national capital, Shahdara district has seen the lowest number of health care workers immunised so far, with a little more than 1/3rd of all targeted beneficiaries receiving the jab over the past week.While 54.5% of Delhi’s registered health care workers have received a Covid-19 vaccine jab, only 34.8% of beneficiaries in Shahdara district have been administered the jab, as on Friday, even as administration official told HT that several medical employees in the district had contracted the infection, and said they believed that antibodies to the virus negated the need for them to get a vaccine.Three districts in the Capital have so far recorded a coverage rate lower than Delhi’s average — Shahdara, North (43.3%) and New Delhi (47.6%).The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, after which registered health care workers in the Capital have received shots on January 18, 19 and 21 across 81 inoculation centres.“The largest vaccination sites in Shahdara, such as Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and the Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital were both dedicated Covid-19 centres. Most health care workers at the hospital have already been infected with Covid-19. So, they believe that antibodies will protect against the infection, so there is no need to take the vaccine,” said a senior district official who asked not to be named.According to the official, these hospitals have asked their senior staffers and those who have already taken the shot to motivate others to get inoculated.At Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital — which houses Delhi’s central vaccine storage facility — only around 80 staff members have received the shot over the four days — less than one-fourth of the over 400 slated health care workers.“There are two important reasons why the vaccination drive hasn’t picked up pace at the hospital. One, most of the staff members have been exposed to the infection and think they do not need the shot. Two, they worked tirelessly when the hospital received a deluge of patients and now that the numbers have reduced so much, they believe that the pandemic has come to an end and there was no need for a vaccine,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.Other hospitals like Guru Teg Bahadur and the central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia that have seen low turnouts have banked on senior faculty members and staff to raise awareness among others.“If we see what is happening in other countries, there is a likelihood of a surge in infections in the future, and it is essential to protect health care workers, especially if a vaccine is available,” the doctor from Rajiv Gandhi hospital said.The response to the vaccination drive was better at hospitals where either no beds were reserved for Covid-19 patients or only a section of beds were earmarked to treat patients with the illness.“Charak Palika Hospital saw a gradual increase in the turnout for the first three days, but the fourth day witnessed a drop. On the first day of vaccination, 43 of the slated beneficiaries turned up, 52 got jabs on the second, 63 on third and 59 on the fourth. It is evident that there is hesitance among beneficiaries. With time, all concerns will be allayed and the turnout should go up,” said a senior official in the New Delhi Municipal Council which is in charge of the Charak Palika Hospital.At Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya and Delhi State Cancer Institute too, the coverage was about 50% of those targeted.Dr GP Kaushal, additional medical superintendant at Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Delhi, said: “The vaccination coverage rate currently is around 72.5%. We are still well below the target every day. Senior doctors going for the vaccine shots have started encouraging the rest, but it is taking time. We have a long way to go.”Covaxin coverageThe overall turnout in the four days has been low at the four central government-run hospitals that have been administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The vaccine was approved by the apex drug regulator in a “trial mode” where those who receive the shot have to sign a consent form and will be followed up with for three months.On average, 45.5% of the people in these four central government hospitals have received the shot so far as per the data. The highest among them was at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where 95 people received the shot on the day of the roll-out, including the institute’s director Dr Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul.Coverage at the premier facility fell dramatically on the second day, with just eight of the hospital’s registered staffers receiving the shot. It picked up after that, with 55 and 62 people being vaccinated on the third and the fourth day.The lowest turnout so far has been at Safdarjung hospital, where 39% of the beneficiaries have been vaccinated.Doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital had written to their medical superintendent, asking for Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine on the first day of the drive. “We are working to dispel any misconceptions or doubts that people have. The senior doctors and those who have received the vaccine already are motivating the others. We will also put up hoardings with comments from those who have been vaccinated to convince people that the vaccine is absolutely safe,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-35-health-care-workers-in-delhi-s-shahdara-district-have-got-jab-so-far-101611346097759.html

On Friday, 732 more bird deaths, including those of 624 poultry birds, were reported in the state. The toll has reached 14,524 since January 8, when the first set of bird deaths were reported in the state.Bhopal’s ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD), has confirmed bird flu to be the reason behind deaths of poultry birds in 11 districts. Till Friday, the state has culled a total of 39,483 poultry birds and eight ducks and destroyed 35,515 eggs and 53,046 kg of poultry feed.Of the 626 poultry birds found dead, 198 deaths were reported from Jalgaon, 118 at Yavatmal, 115 in Beed, 54 at Palghar, 33 in Amravati, 29 from Gondia, 20 in Nagpur, 17 at Jalna, nine in Hingoli, eight each at Raigad and Nanded, five in Satara, four each at Nashik and Osmanabad, three in Pune and one in Ahmednagar. The state animal husbandry department also found 69 other birds, including herons, sparrows and parrots dead in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Pune, Satara, Beed, Nanded, Akola and Wardha. The samples of these birds are sent to ICAR-NIHSAD to confirm if bird flu is the cause behind the deaths, said animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh.Meanwhile, the state government has approved ₹1.3 crore to provide compensation to poultry farm owners who were affected owing to the avian influenza, state animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar said. “All those who had faced losses owing to culling process will be compensated in phases,” said Kedar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/732-more-bird-deaths-in-maharashtra-toll-touches-14k-101611345771487.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Air quality panel ropes in agencies to develop tool to read nature of emissions||The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas (CAQM) has commissioned several agencies to develop a ‘Decision Support System’ tool to capture the nature and source of emissions in the region, to focus interventions to curb emissions.The panel has entrusted the work of developing the system to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, to forecast air quality using its weather models; The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to develop a fine resolution emission inventory; the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to develop short and long-term control interventions and to identify hot spots. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune has been assigned the job of integrating the physical, chemical and engineering aspects of the tool.“This tool will help capture the static and dynamic features of the emissions from various sources. It will have an integrated framework to handle both primary and secondary pollutants using chemical transport model. The system will also be able to handle the source specific interventions with the framework to estimate benefits of interventions,” a statement from the Commission on Friday said.The sources of emissions covered will include industries, transport, power plants, residential, DG sets, road dust, agricultural burning, refuse burning, construction dust, ammonia, volatile organic compounds, landfills etc.The interventions suggested by the tool can be implemented by the pollution control boards and its implementation can be monitored by citizen watch groups and NGOs, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-quality-panel-ropes-in-agencies-to-develop-tool-to-read-nature-of-emissions-101611345241884.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Arriving soon in Mumbai: Better Bandra Terminus||The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC) will undertake major infrastructure development work at and around Bandra Terminus to improve its accessibility, as part of its plan to redevelop seven railway stations in the city. A development plan on better road connectivity to the terminus is being prepared. The IRSDC is looking at providing road connectivity to the terminus from SV Road. SV Road in Bandra West is one of the arterial roads in the city and connects Santacruz, Vile Parle, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Malad and Borivli. Currently, only one narrow road from the east of the railway station connects to the terminus. “We are looking at increasing the connectivity to the terminus. We are also considering boosting the connectivity to the terminus to SV Road in Bandra. We can also relocate railway facilities at Bandra Terminus,” said SK Lohia, managing director, IRSDC. Apart from connectivity, passenger amenities, including elevated decks connecting to the platforms, multilevel car parkings, creation of passenger waiting areas, cafes and restaurants, are also being planned. “The designs are in the development stage. Multiple agencies including the Western Railway will be contacted for the development work.” said a senior IRSDC official. Apart from Bandra Terminus, the ISRDC plans to revamp Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Kalyan, Andheri, Dadar, Borivli and Thakurli railway stations. The redevelopment plans for terminus and stations include providing shopping complexes and hotels on the premises to increase the non- fare revenue. Earlier, the IRSDC had submitted a proposal for development of LTT, involving creation of separate departure and arrival wings and adding of new railway platforms. Moreover, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) will also be redeveloped. The plan will involve construction of commercial spaces, including restaurants and cafes along with vehicular parking for passengers inside the terminus. Segregation of outstation and local train passenger movements with the help of interconnecting decks has been planned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arriving-soon-in-mumbai-better-bandra-terminus-101611345407185.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees record 92% turnout on Day 4 of Covid vaccination drive||The Covid vaccination drive in Mumbai saw a record high turnout on Friday, with 3,539 (92%) of the 3,852 healthcare workers (HCW) getting the shots. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) also received the second lot of 125,000 Covishield vaccine doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune. These doses will be used as part of the first phase to vaccinate 130,000 HCWs. The second lot was expected to be delivered on Friday, but after the fire at SII, they were unsure of the delivery. Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “We received 125,000 doses of Covishield from SII on Friday. We will use these doses for the first phase where healthcare workers are being vaccinated.” BMC officials said the turnout went up owing to nod for walk-in entries for HCWs and private hospitals requesting their staff to get vaccinated. Dr Pradeep Jadhav, medical superintendent, Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, said, “We had requested private hospitals and nursing homes to educate their staff on taking vaccination as it is completely safe. That helped improve the turnout on Friday.” The vaccination drive began in the city on January 16, with 1,926 HCWs (48%) getting vaccinated. On Tuesday and Wednesday, 50% and 52% of the targets were met. As of Friday, 8,790 HCWs have been vaccinated in Mumbai and 12 minor adverse effects following immunisation have been reported. A few doctors complained of fever, weakness or bodyache. Meanwhile, the second lot is stored at the cold storage in Parel’s F-South ward office. At a later stage, the Kanjurmarg facility will be activated as the central vaccine cold storage facility. On January 13, the BMC received its first lot of 139,500 vaccine doses from the SII.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-record-92-turnout-on-day-4-of-covid-vaccination-drive-101611345167136.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Deadline extended by nine months for phase 1 of Rani Khera business park project||The Delhi government has pushed the deadline for the completion of the first phase of the upcoming business park at Rani Khera by nine months, in view of the delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, said a senior government official on Friday.The business park – spread over an area of 150 acres in Rani Khera village near the Indira Gandhi International Airport – is meant to become a hub for enterprises in the technology and services sectors. The project was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a statement issued after a meeting with the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (DSIIDC) on November 18, 2020.The first of seven phases of the project is now expected to be completed by May 2023. On November 18, 2020, the government has said that the expected date for completion of the first phase would be August 31, 2022.On Friday, Kejriwal chaired a review meeting on the project in which he directed officials of the DSIIDC – a government company with the expertise of infrastructure development in industrial areas – to strictly stick to deadlines. Kejriwal said, “The entire project should be completed within the stipulated timeline. It should be done in a timebound manner.”In a statement issued after Friday’s meeting, Kejriwal’s office said, “The Delhi government will develop this first-of-its-kind business park in seven phases. The first phase of the Rani Khera Business Park expected to be completed by May 2023 and the second phase is expected to be ready by May 2025. The CM was also apprised that all necessary approvals of the government departments concerned have been duly obtained.”It further said the new deadlines have been set by the government in light of disruptions cause to routine work across all departments by the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deadline-extended-by-nine-months-for-phase-1-of-rani-khera-business-park-project-101611344072063.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Law and order state subject: Sharad Pawar on Centre providing Y security to Maharashtra MP Narayan Rane||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Friday took potshots at the Centre for providing security to Rajya Sabha (RS) parliamentarian from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Narayan Rane and said the Centre’s intervention into the issue is surprising as law and order is a state subject.The state government had recently scaled down or completely scrapped the security cover of many leaders. Rane’s security cover was completely removed. He was earlier being provided the Y-plus category. Following the state’s move, the Union home ministry decided to provide the Y-security cover to the former chief minister.“It is the Centre’s right to do so but going by the Constitutional provisions, law and order is a state subject. So after the state took a decision pertaining to law and order, there was no reason for the Centre to intervene,” Pawar said. Justifying the changes in the security cover, the NCP chief said, “Based on threat perception, the state home department officials recommend the Maharashtra government to provide a particular category of security to a person. Even the security of state minister Sanjay Bansode was reduced. During the previous Devendra Fadnavis regime, my security cover was also reduced but we never complained. The Centre’s intervention in the state’s matter is surprising.” The veteran leader also reiterated that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government – comprising Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – would complete its five-year term and attempts to dislodge it won’t succeed. “I have no doubt that the government will complete its five years. Attempts to dislodge the government have been going on since day one from Delhi as well in Mumbai, but it won’t make any impact,” Pawar said. He also confirmed his participation in the farmers’ agitation in Mumbai on Monday. “The farmers’ groups have invited all those who have extended support to their agitation. NCP too, has supported their agitation against the three farm laws. I have accepted their proposal,” Pawar said. The state unit of BJP has criticised the former Union agriculture minister and said Pawar would be agitating against himself. “Pawar was the one who was insisting for reforms in agriculture laws and now he will be holding a protest against the same legislations. This means he will be undertaking an agitation against himself,” said BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/law-and-order-state-subject-sharad-pawar-on-centre-providing-y-security-to-maharashtra-mp-narayan-rane-101611345107059.html

However, after the meeting, Hazare said he was firm on his decision and demanded that the farm laws be repealed. “The BJP delegation led by Fadnavis met me today and handed over a statement by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. But I am firm on my announcement of going on hunger strike in support of the farmers,” he said after the meeting, which was held at Hazare’s village in Ralegan Siddhi, Ahmednagar.Fadnavis was joined by other BJP leaders such as Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil and Girish Mahajan. Fadnavis said he had met Hazare to understand the activist’s opinion on the laws. “Anna is the pride of Maharashtra and nobody wants him to go on hunger strike. He has some reservations about the assurances given to him by the Centre in the past. The Union agriculture minister has personally asked to understand his stand. We’ve spoken to Anna and will convey his demands to the Centre and get back to him. We hope Anna will be satisfied with Centre’s response,” said Fadnavis. On Thursday, Hazare claimed the BJP had failed to fulfil assurances given to him thrice. He said,“There’s no point of verbal communication when they can’t keep the written promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farm-laws-firm-on-indefinite-hunger-strike-from-jan-30-says-anna-hazare-after-meeting-former-devendra-fadnavis-101611344146982.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Six samples from zoo test negative for avian flu||Six samples collected from Delhi zoo earlier this week tested negative for bird flu, officials said on Friday, days after a brown fish owl that was found dead in its enclosure, was diagnosed with a strain of the infection.Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park in Delhi said that while the zoo has not reported any fresh case of the flu, safety protocols have not been relaxed.“All six samples, including those of the four birds whose enclosures were close to the owl that died of the virus, returned negative on Thursday. However, safety, surveillance and sanitation work will continue, and all protocols and guidelines issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) of the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change and the animal husbandry department of the Delhi government, are being followed strictly,” Pandey said.On January 15, samples from a brown fish owl found dead in its enclosure at the zoo, tested positive for H5N8 avian influenza. After this, swabs from birds in the zoo were sent to the state’s animal husbandry unit for serological examination. Samples from water bodies inside the zoo premises frequented by wild and migratory birds, along with bird droppings, were sent to be examined.Officials from the Union environment ministry said they were keeping a close watch to ensure more bird flu cases are not reported from the Delhi zoo or any other part of the Capital.“Zoo staff has been given special drapers and PPE. They are following our advisory, and are in constant touch with the animal husbandry ministry. The zoo is closed, so there is no fear of transmission to people,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, the ministry’s additional director-general.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-six-samples-from-zoo-test-negative-for-avian-flu-101611343782127.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Commuters’ woes to end on Jan 25 as Kalyan’s Patripool ROB is ready to be opened||Here is some good news for commuters of the twin cities of Kalyan and Dombivli. The work of the new Patripool Rail Over Bridge (ROB), which had made travelling a nightmare, has been completed and will be thrown open to public on January 25.It will be inaugurated by CM Uddhav Thackeray through a video conference. The news of its opening has created a buzz in the city with the photos of the new, aesthetically and technically-advanced bridge going viral since Thursday night.The bridge, which is already lauded as a first of its kind in the twin city by netizens for its contemporary looks, has the longest 76m web link girder in the entire Mumbai Metropolitan region, as per the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) officials.The bridge led to major congestion in both Kalyan and Dombivli. It was subjected to many protests and became a favourite topic for memes on social media.Shashikant Sontakke, chief engineer of MSRDC, said, “The bridge will be officially inaugurated and opened for vehicles on January 25 for the vehicles as the work is completed. Apart from the longest web link girder, the bridge also has another girder of 33m. Both these girders were built in Hyderabad.”Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde said that the bridge work faced many hurdles though the structural work was sped up in the last few months. “Usually, it takes eight months to build a girder but here, considering the need of the bridge, the girders were built in two-three months.”The four major reasons that caused the delay were designing the bridge, approvals, opposition from residents and the Covid-19 pandemic.Shinde added, “The 104-year-old Patripool bridge was dismantled in an emergency after it was declared unsafe by IIT Bombay without any plan ready for the new bridge. Later on, the planning and designing were done and approval was sought. When the work began, the authorities realised that a drainage chamber was blocking the work, so the bridge was redesigned leading to a delay.”On Friday, Shinde and MSRDC officials visited the newly-built bridge before its inauguration.The MSRDC took up the work of the new Patripool Bridge in December 2018, two months after it was dismantled by the Central Railway. During the lockdown, work at the site was completely stalled as the labourers deployed for work left for West Bengal. However, around 50 labourers were called back and a flight was arranged for them to come to the city.“The project work gained speed since May after we decided to utilise the lockdown period. The contractor was asked to bring back the labourers and they came to Mumbai by flight on an urgent basis,” said Aniruddha Borde, junior engineer, MSRDC.Apart from the newly-built two-lane bridge, an additional two-lane bridge will be built considering the future requirement of the traffic movement on this route. The work of the girder for the additional bridge has already begun.How was the bridge built?The girder for the bridge was built in Hyderabad with the help of 250 men in less than two months. According to the Global Steel Company, based in Hyderabad, the work of a girder requires at least nine to ten months. However, considering the need of the Patripool ROB, it was built in less than two month.“The Patripool girder was built with the machineries that we got from Germany and Italy. We worked day and night to finish it on time.

23-01-2021||Mumbai||Thane Municipal Transport to get 350 new buses this year||The Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) has promised to ply more than 350 new buses till December 2021 in a budget estimate of ₹458.13Cr for the fiscal year 2021-22 presented on Friday.Apart from the promise of new buses, which will take the total number of buses in Thane city to 700, the budget has nothing new to offer this year. The TMT has also demanded hefty funds of ₹284.63Cr from the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), showing losses in excess of ₹144Cr.The transport body has also planned to survey those routes in the interior areas of the city that at present has no service. Additional mini and midi buses will be added in these narrow routes.The TMT has 364 buses in its fleet at present, of which 333 are operational.Dnyaneshwar Dhere, transport manager, said, “We have planned to add 350 more buses till the end of this year. These include 200 buses from the funds allocated by the state and central government, 50 mini and midi buses and 100 electric buses from the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA). This will take the total number of buses in the city to 700 by early next year.”Last year, the TMT demanded funds of ₹291.4Cr from TMC while this year, the demand is for 284.63Cr. Dhere said, “The year has been a tough one with the pandemic leading to losses as high as ₹80Cr. We also lost 14 of our employees to Covid while 175 were infected. We, however, have plans to increase the ridership this year.”The transport body plans to deploy additional supervisors on the SATIS bridge to guide people to the exact bus routes. The number of digital schedules of buses installed at bus stops will be increased.“There are many areas in the interiors of the city where our buses haven’t reached as the roads are narrow. We will survey such routes where there is a demand for buses and ply midi and mini buses there,” Dhere added.Though the TMT plans to acquire 100 new electric buses, the general body has given directives to cancel the contract of the electric bus contractor earlier this week. The corporation has received only one electric bus in three years, following which the members of the general body demanded action against the contractor. The mayor ruled that the contract for electric buses will be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-transport-to-get-350-new-buses-this-year-101611343367022.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Congress holds protests in Maharashtra, seeks action against Arnab Goswami||Congress workers staged agitation across Maharashtra demanding action against Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami over the alleged leaked WhatsApp chats related to the 2019 Balakot airstrike and other sensitive national issues. The Congress alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its top leaders were shielding Goswami. At Mumbai, the protest was held outside Republic TV’s office in Lower Parel, followed by a rally at Jambori Maidan in Worli. As a part of its nationwide stir over the issue, key party leaders, including district presidents, led the protest marches in their respective districts. “Goswami knew about the Balakot airstrike three days in advance as the information was leaked to him by top BJP leaders. He is a traitor and should be booked for sedition. BJP leaders are shielding him for their political interest by compromising national security. Goswami used the sacrifice of the CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) jawans martyred in the Pulwama attack for financial gains by boosting his channel’s TRP (television rating points),” said Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap. He also questioned why central agencies failed to make the purported chats between Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, the former chief of ratings agency BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) public similar to ones about alleged drug procurement in which actor Deepika Padukone’s name emerged. “If the central agencies failed to take action against him, Mumbai Police should book him for these serious violations,” added Jagtap.At Latur and Parbhani, the protests were led by legislators Dhiraj Deshmukh and Suresh Warpudkar, respectively. Party leaders submitted memorandum to collectors demanding action against Goswami. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said, “It appears that Goswami was in the know about the airstrike as part of the Indian defence forces’ retaliation to the Pulwama attack. Goswami appears to know about the airstrike three days in advance. In one of his chats, he said a big name in the [Narendra] Modi government had revealed about it to him. A thorough investigation into the issue and Goswami’s arrest are a must as this pertains to national security.” In a statement on Tuesday, Goswami said, “It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan after the Pulwama attack was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. I am horrified that the Congress party thinks any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the government is committing a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-holds-protests-in-maharashtra-seeks-action-against-arnab-goswami-101611343247999.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Thane: Take diversion as Kopri bridge will close this weekend for girders||Commuters taking the Kopri bridge after 9pm this weekend will have to take a diversion as it will be closed for laying of six more girders by the central railway over the railway lines.The north-bound route from Airoli junction to Eastern Express Highway (EEH) towards Thane and LBS Marg will be closed for all types of heavy vehicles on January 23 and 24 from 9pm to ease the peak-hour congestion. The light vehicles, on the other hand, can enter Thane through Modella toll plaza via the east-west flyover in Mulund.Balasaheb Patil, DCP, Traffic, said, “We are expecting some congestion for the initial two hours due to the closure of the bridge. We will have to rope in additional staff for two hours. We believe the diversions are sufficient for the light vehicles and we shall be able to manage without any major hurdle.”The Central Railway, too, has imposed a night block and cancelled a few trains.Last weekend, the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Authority (MMRDA) launched seven girders along this route. They have completed almost 70 per cent work in their designated area. The girders that will be launched this weekend are 63m long and 102 tons in weight. As these are very heavy, the railways will make use of a crane that can balance the weight of around 1,000 tons.The Kopri Road Over Bridge is on the EEH. The eight-lane EEH turns into two lanes on this bridge leading to a bottle neck during peak hours. Widening the bridge will resolve the peak-hour congestion, giving relief to people going towards Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai.A shadow block will also take place at Atgaon station for launching of girders for a Foot Over Bridge on down line from 2.20am to 6.20am on January 24. This will impact suburban local services from 12:40am to 5am on January 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-take-diversion-as-kopri-bridge-will-close-this-weekend-for-girders-101611342947013.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets colder: Temperature to fall further from Sunday, IMD predicts||The minimum temperature in the national capital dipped to 4.2 degrees Celsius on Friday, even as calm winds led to a spike in pollution levels, weather experts said on Friday. The India Meteorological Department forecast that the temperature will rise slightly on Saturday, but will fall from Sunday evening.On Friday, the minimum temperature recorded at Delhi’s Safdarjung weather station, considered the official marker for the city, was 4.2°C — three below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature, meanwhile, was 18.6°C — three below normal.IMD scientists said the drop in temperature on Friday was caused because the fog layer in the early hours moved further away from the ground, which did not allow temperatures to rise during the day.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “The first reason for the temperature to fall on Friday was the rising of the fog in the morning. Apart from this, the wind blowing over the city also carried high moisture content, which also kept temperatures low.”Srivastava said that on Saturday, the minimum temperature will rise to around 6°C, but will fall again from Sunday, till January 28.A forecast by the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the IMD said a fresh western disturbance hit the western Himalaya regions on Friday, because of which the wind direction in Delhi will change from north-westerly to easterly, which will cause the probable temperature rise in Delhi on Saturday.“Rise in minimum temperatures by 2-3°C is very likely during next 48 hours (January 23-24). A fall by 3-5°C during subsequent the subsequent three days (January 25-27) over most parts of northwest and central India is also predicted,” the NWDC forecast read.After the western disturbance passes, Delhi will get colder from Monday. “On Monday, the minimum temperature is expected to be around 5°C, but by Tuesday it will fall further and reach around 4°C,” a senior IMD scientist said.The change in the wind direction from north-westerly to easterly on Friday also causing slower winds, which led to a spike in pollution levels.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) on Friday was 364, in the ‘very poor’ zone. On Thursday, the 24-hour average AQI was 296, categorised as ‘poor’ in the CPCB scale.The Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), has forecast that the wind speed and ventilation will improve on Saturday.“Surface winds are set to improve for Saturday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance. Due to better ventilation condition, AQI is forecasted to marginally improve on January 23 and January 24,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-colder-temperature-to-fall-further-from-sunday-imd-predicts-101611342503268.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||At 76%, Maharashtra sees its highest turnout for Covid vaccine so far||Maharashtra on Friday inoculated 21,610 healthcare workers (HCWs) across 282 centres in the state’s fourth vaccination drive so far. The state achieved its highest percentage of turnout on Friday at 76%, owing to the decision to allow walk-ins for HCWs at the centres to get the vaccine. Mumbai recorded 92% turnout on Friday and vaccinated 3,539 HCWs against the expected 3,852, Mumbai civic body said.Dr Pradeep Vyas, state health secretary, said since the vaccination drive commenced on January 16, 74,000 HCWs in Maharashtra have been inoculated. Of the shots given on Friday, 318 were Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, Vyas said. With the next vaccination session scheduled for Saturday, the state could get close to the landmark of vaccinating 100,000 HCWs.Maharashtra’s Beed, Hingoli, Amravati and Wardha districts saw more HCWs trickling at the vaccine centres than targeted. According to a state health department official, the decision to allow all registered HCWs to voluntarily come at centres without prior appointment has helped the state boost its numbers. Beed district, according to a statement from the health department, recorded 151% turnout with 757 people being vaccinated, while Hingoli saw a 117% turnout with 234 HCWs being inoculated. Centres in Amravati saw inoculation of 557 HCWs and registered a turnout of 111%. Wardha saw inoculation of 657 HCWs which was a 110% turnout, the statement added. Meanwhile, Osmanabad district saw a turnout of 103% with 309 HCWs getting the shot.“We had anticipated an increase in numbers. The entire jump in numbers cannot be attributed to just allowing walk-ins. Some percentage of doctors and HCWs are gradually coming on their scheduled day as well. There is a hesitance (among people), but it will go with time; with them seeing little or no adverse effects to their colleagues,” said a senior health department official who did not wish to be named.Buldhana and Pune districts, meanwhile, were at the bottom in terms of turnout against target. Buldhana saw a 43% turnout with 256 HCWs getting the vaccine. Pune, which has 28% of the state’s active caseload with 12,926 cases, reported 44% turnout with 1,275 HCWs being vaccinated on Friday. CoWIN app, meanwhile, continued to have issues including slow performance and erratic functioning, officials said. “We have had complaints from some districts, but these are teething issues. The app is being updated by the Centre. The districts are recording data offline and have been instructed to upload them when the app works,” an official said requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Friday reported 2,779 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s tally to 2,003,657. The active caseload in the state stood at 44,926. Mumbai reported 483 new cases, pushing the tally to 305,136.The state also reported 50 fatalities on Friday, taking the death toll to 50,684. Of the 50 deaths reported, 28 occurred in the past 48 hours and eight in the past week. The remaining 14 deaths are from the period before last week, a health department bulletin said. The case fatality rate in the state is 2.53%. Maharashtra also recorded 3,419 discharges, taking the tally of recovered patients to 1,906,827. The state’s recovery rate has improved to 95.17%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-76-maharashtra-sees-its-highest-turnout-for-covid-vaccine-so-far-101611342766973.html

23-01-2021||Mumbai||PMC Bank case: ED raids MLA Hitendra Thakur’s office, premises of Viva Group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials conducted raids at five locations including the office of Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) president and MLA Hirendra Thakur and premises of the directors of Viva Group in Vasai-Virar and Palghar areas in connection with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam case. ED officials confirmed the development. Five premises belonging to Viva Group, owned by Thakur’s family, and its associates that were searched on Friday included registered office of Viva Group in Virar, residential premise of concerned person of Viva Group in Virar, one associated office premise of Viva Group in Andheri, and two residential premises of two financial consultants of Viva Group in Juhu and Chembur. During search, ₹73 lakh cash, incriminating digital and documentary evidences have been recovered.The anti-money laundering agency is carrying out searches as part of their probe in the alleged diversion of funds to Viva Group from Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and its subsidiary companies. HDIL is accused of defrauding PMC Bank of over ₹6,670 crore by fraudulently obtaining nearly 70% of the bank’s overall loans.One of the HDIL subsidiaries controlled by Pravin Raut is suspected to have diverted funds to Viva Groups. ED has already provisionally attached properties worth ₹ 72 crore belonging to Pravin Raut under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the PMC Bank fraud case. Raut is former director of Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, a subsidiary of HDIL group.Commenting on the development, Hitendra Thakur said, “We were prepared for ED’s visit after the action on Raut. Around 35-40 personnel from ED in seven big vehicles arrived at our Virar office at 9.30am and they are still present. We are cooperating with ED as we have nothing to hide. All our dealings are through cheques and are in black and white. Regarding political vendetta I can only say, wait and watch. We are prepared to answer all their queries and are even willing to visit ED office. We have nothing to hide.”ED had begun money laundering probe in the PMC Bank case after Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) registered a criminal case in September 2019 against HDIL, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, former chairman Waryam Singh, former chairman and managing director Joy Thomas, and others for causing loss in thousands of crores to PMC Bank and corresponding gain to themselves.Prosecution complaint has been filed against Rakesh Wadhawan and others under PMLA. Investigation also revealed that Wadhawans, in connivance with Viva Group, have diverted more than ₹ 160 crore from HDIL to many companies/entities belonging to Viva Group in the garb of commission. Source of these funds from HDIL to Viva group is apparently the illegal fund diversion from PMC Bank.ED has also initiated investigation in another case against Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan and others for siphoning ₹200 crore sanctioned by Yes Bank to one Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd. This loan was siphoned by Wadhawans by showing it for fictitious purpose. During investigation under PMLA, it is revealed that Wadhawans illegally and fraudulently transferred two commercial properties of Mack Star in Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), Mumbai valued at ₹34.36 crore to Viva Holding, a company of Viva Group. For the transfer of the said two properties, two separate sale agreements dated June 26, 2017 were prepared wherein sale value for both the subject commercial properties were shown as 34.36 crore in total. In the said sale agreement, the purchase amount were shown to be paid vide 37 cheques by Viva Holding to Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd against the purchase of the said properties.Investigation has revealed that these cheques were never encashed in the account of Mack Star, and Viva Holding never made payments for the purchase of the said property. Wadhawans had illegally transferred these properties to Viva Group in violation to the article of association of Mack Star. Further, Viva Holding never showed these properties in its Balance Sheets.ED has earlier stated that the investigation under PMLA has revealed that ₹95 crore has been siphoned through HDIL by Raut, one of the accused, in active conspiracy and connivance with various persons. The sources of the funds were illegally availed loans or advances etc by HDIL from PMC Bank. There was no document or agreement in support of these payments made to Raut. Further, as per the ledger of HDIL, the funds were given to Raut for acquiring land in Palghar area.ED’s investigation also revealed that Raut paid ₹1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri from the Proceeds of crime. Of the said money, Madhuri transferred ₹55 lakh ( ₹50 lakh on December 23, 2010 and ₹5 lakh on March 15, 2011) as interest-free loan to Varsha Raut, wife of Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. The amount was further utilised for purchase of flat in Dadar (East), Mumbai, ED said.Investigation further revealed that Varsha Raut and Madhuri Raut are partners in Avani Construction. Varsha Raut has received ₹ 12 lakh from this entity as overdrawn capital converted to loan, on a contribution of mere ₹ 5,625. The loan amount still remains outstanding, ED stated.ED had earlier questioned Varsha Raut in this connection and has summoned her again for second round of questioning.The central agency had earlier attached several properties of Rakesh Wadhawan, Wadhawan Family trust and others amounting to ₹293 crore in the PMC Bank fraud case. Jewellery worth ₹63 crore was also seized. A prosecution complaint has been filed by ED against Rakesh Wadhawan and others for money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-case-ed-raids-mla-hitendra-thakur-s-office-premises-of-viva-group-101611342347357.html

Dasgupta moved a praecipe for urgent hearing of his bail application after the session court rejected his bail plea in the alleged television rating point (TRP) manipulation case on Wednesday. A single-judge bench of justice Prakash D Naik heard Dasgupta’s application, moved through advocate Arjun Singh Thakur, in his chambers on Friday evening after regular court hours.In the application, Dasgupta sought interim bail for two weeks as well as directions to transfer him to Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai citing that he was not fit to be discharged from Sir JJ Hospital but was being moved to Taloja jail. Thakur submitted that the family of the applicant were informed late that Dasgupta has been discharged from the hospital at 6pm on Friday and that he was shifted to Taloja jail. It is submitted that on account of ill health, the applicant may be directed to be admitted to private hospital.The state government, however, opposed the plea submitting that Dasgupta would be kept under observation in Taloja jail hospital before he was moved into the barracks. Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare for the state opposed the application seeking interim relief and submitted that there was no urgent need for Dasgupta to be shifted to a private hospital. Thakare submitted that in accordance with procedure, the medical officer of the jail would examine the applicant and if the officer finds it necessary at any point of time that the applicant is required to be admitted to Sir JJ Hospital again, they would take appropriate steps.The court, while refusing to grant any urgent relief, directed the state government to place the Dasgupta’s discharge papers of Sir JJ Hospital and the medical report of the jail hospital before it on Monday. It also permitted the interim plea to be heard urgently on Monday. Dasgupta was arrested on December 24 in connection with the TRP manipulation case on charges of criminal breach of trust and cheating. He had filed a bail application before the metropolitan magistrate’s court which was rejected. Following this, he had moved sessions court which has also rejected the application on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-interim-relief-to-ex-barc-ceo-partho-dasgupta-to-hear-bail-plea-on-monday-101611342166892.html

23-01-2021||Chandigarh||Striking garbage collectors to return to work in Chandigarh||The garbage woes of Chandigarh residents are expected to get over for now, as different groups of door-to-door waste collectors on Friday decided to resume work from Saturday.The decision came after a meeting between garbage collectors and municipal officials on Friday. However, the relief might be temporary as a section is still opposing the civic body’s takeover of waste collection and has threatened to go on strike again from next week if their demands are not met.The municipal corporation last month took over garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30, with the launch of segregated waste project, which has not gone down well with informal cart-based collectors, especially those affiliated to Akhil Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangathan (ABMS). They stopped picking up garbage from houses in other sectors (where the MC has not yet extended the project), causing the waste to pile up at homes and on the streets.Om Prakash Saini, chairman, Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society that claims to represent 80% of the informal sector, said: “MC officials have accepted all our key demands. The civic body will deposit user charges collected from people in garbage collectors’ accounts every month. We will also be allowed to pick reusable items from garbage.”However, Shamsher Lohatiya, president of the local unit of ABMS, said: “The meeting with MC officials was inconclusive and fruitless. Our principle demand still stands. Door-to-door garbage collectors should be allowed to continue with their work, and the MC should roll back the takeover.” 11-member panel to discuss demands: MayorA delegation, including ABMS representatives, also met mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and handed over a memorandum of their demands.The mayor said that an 11-member committee will be constituted, comprising six MC officials and five representatives of waste collectors.

Following that the NCB took over the case. “In the follow up investigations, we could establish links of the drug trafficking to Chennai,” said Bruno. “We questioned the two men and they confessed on Thursday night. They were the masterminds in organising and transporting the contraband that was seized from the fishing boat which was owned by a Lankan national. During initial investigations the six detained people said that the drugs were transferred to them from Pakistan.” Officials said that the duo was living illegally in the country and that Sri Lankan authorities had issued a red corner notice against Nawas.NCB sleuths picked up Nawas and Afnas on Thursday from their home in Chennai’s suburb Karapakkam where they lived with their families. “Both the Sri Lankan nationals were residing in Chennai by concealing their nationality without valid passports in India,” said Bruno. Nawas has been in the city for the past 10 years while Afnas joined him three years ago.They were booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act 1985 on Friday and the process for their remand is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sri-lankan-drug-kingpin-associate-held-in-chennai-s-karapakkam-101611341046108.html

As many as 53,000 poultry birds are to be culled at the two farms in Behra village: Alpha and Royal. The operations began at Alpha farm on Friday. The Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, had confirmed bird flu on January 15, but the final report from Bhopal arrived on January 20, a day after it had also confirmed flu in a migratory bird found dead at the Siswan reserve in the district.Meanwhile, one more suspected case has been reported at Evergreen Poultry Farm in the same village. After receiving the report from the Jalandhar lab, the department has sent the sample to Bhopal for confirmation, said VK Janjua, additional chief secretary, animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy development, Punjab.Dera Bassi has around 50 poultry farms. As per the protocol, all poultry birds within the radius of 1 kilometre of the infected farms are to be culled. However, there is no other farm within the given radius. The two farms in question are layer farms, which means birds are reared only for laying eggs and not for their meat, as in broiler farms. “Hundred people have been deployed for culling, which is likely to continue for a week. Requisite safety gear, including PPE kits and face shields, and JCB machines have been provided to the teams,” said Janjua, adding that teams are carrying out humane culling, wherein the birds are “either killed instantly or rendered insensible until death ensues, without pain, suffering or distress”. Surveillance and sampling has also been stepped up and two rapid response teams have been deployed to keep a tab on any death of birds in the district. “The virus involved in avian influenza is zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals to humans, as per preliminary reports. To detect symptoms of plausible infection in humans, the bird handlers in the affected poultry farms will be examined by doctors,” said an official.4 dead birds found in ChandigarhIn Chandigarh, where no case of bird flu has been confirmed so far, a dead crow and three pigeons were recovered on Friday. The number has risen to 176 in the past couple of weeks, but only 21 samples have been sent for testing. All tested negative. “Samples of bird carcasses found in isolation are not being sent. Only suspicious cases are sent,” said chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai.Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director, animal husbandry and fisheries department, Chandigarh, said: “We have been keeping a check on poultry birds in the city, but nothing irregular has been reported.”In the neighbouring Panchkula district, which was the first to confirm bird flu at two farms in Barwala on January 8, the administration is still awaiting reports of around 40 other samples sent to the Bhopal lab. As many as 81,000 birds were culled at the two farms besides another one in the infected zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11000-poultry-birds-culled-in-dera-bassi-on-day-1-101611341447625.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||‘Presumption of innocence’ should not be destroyed, court says while hearing riots case||A city court on Friday said the “presumption of innocence” should not be destroyed at the threshold of the justice process through a media trial, while hearing a plea moved by former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid alleging a “vicious media campaign” against him in a Delhi riots case. The court said it hoped that the media would follow “self regulation techniques” while reporting on a case pending investigation or trial. “Self regulation is the best mode of regulation,” chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar said. It said the news reports have only highlighted that accused Khalid had confessed his involvement in the riots but none of the news items made a clarification to its readers/viewers that such a statement, even if actually made, could not be used by the prosecution as evidence. During another hearing in a riots case on Friday, another sessions court in the Capital asked the Enforcement Directorate to respond to a plea by former suspended municipal councillor Tahir Hussain, alleging “trial by media” against him in a money-laundering case related to the violence in northeast Delhi last year.The plea also sought roll-back of the alleged defamatory content published against him in the media. Meanwhile, another city court directed the superintendent of Tihar Jail to appear before it on a plea moved by JNU student and Pinjra Tod member Devangana Kalita seeking permission to send notes to her counsel, which she made from the charge sheet filed against her in a riots case, in a sealed cover from prison. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat issued a notice to the superintendent to appear along with the legal officer before the court on January 23. The directions came after the jail authorities submitted in the reply filed to the application, that as per the Delhi prison rules, the concerned officials have to approve the notes before they are sent to her lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/presumption-of-innocence-should-not-be-destroyed-court-says-while-hearing-riots-case-101611341448034.html
23-01-2021||Delhi||Only 35% health care workers in Shahdara district have got Covid jab so far, lowest in Delhi||After four rounds of Covid-19 inoculation in the national capital, Shahdara district has seen the lowest number of health care workers immunised so far, with a little more than 1/3rd of all targeted beneficiaries receiving the jab over the past week.While 54.5% of Delhi’s registered health care workers have received a Covid-19 vaccine jab, only 34.8% of beneficiaries in Shahdara district have been administered the jab, as on Friday, even as administration official told HT that several medical employees in the district had contracted the infection, and said they believed that antibodies to the virus negated the need for them to get a vaccine.Three districts in the Capital have so far recorded a coverage rate lower than Delhi’s average — Shahdara, North (43.3%) and New Delhi (47.6%).The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, after which registered health care workers in the Capital have received shots on January 18, 19 and 21 across 81 inoculation centres.“The largest vaccination sites in Shahdara, such as Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and the Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital were both dedicated Covid-19 centres. Most health care workers at the hospital have already been infected with Covid-19. So, they believe that antibodies will protect against the infection, so there is no need to take the vaccine,” said a senior district official who asked not to be named.According to the official, these hospitals have asked their senior staffers and those who have already taken the shot to motivate others to get inoculated. At Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital — which houses Delhi’s central vaccine storage facility — only around 80 staff members have received the shot over the four days — less than one-fourth of the over 400 slated health care workers. “There are two important reasons why the vaccination drive hasn’t picked up pace at the hospital. One, most of the staff members have been exposed to the infection and think they do not need the shot. Two, they worked tirelessly when the hospital received a deluge of patients and now that the numbers have reduced so much, they believe that the pandemic has come to an end and there was no need for a vaccine,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. Other hospitals like Guru Teg Bahadur and the central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia that have seen low turnouts have banked on senior faculty members and staff to raise awareness among others. “If we see what is happening in other countries, there is a likelihood of a surge in infections in the future, and it is essential to protect health care workers, especially if a vaccine is available,” the doctor from Rajiv Gandhi hospital said. The response to the vaccination drive was better at hospitals where either no beds were reserved for Covid-19 patients or only a section of beds were earmarked to treat patients with the illness.“Charak Palika Hospital saw a gradual increase in the turnout for the first three days, but the fourth day witnessed a drop. On the first day of vaccination, 43 of the slated beneficiaries turned up, 52 got jabs on the second, 63 on third and 59 on the fourth. It is evident that there is hesitance among beneficiaries. With time, all concerns will be allayed and the turnout should go up,” said a senior official in the New Delhi Municipal Council which is in charge of the Charak Palika Hospital. At Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya and Delhi State Cancer Institute too, the coverage was about 50% of those targeted. Dr GP Kaushal, additional medical superintendant at Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Delhi, said: “The vaccination coverage rate currently is around 72.5%. We are still well below the target every day. Senior doctors going for the vaccine shots have started encouraging the rest, but it is taking time. We have a long way to go.” Covaxin coverage The overall turnout in the four days has been low at the four central government-run hospitals that have been administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The vaccine was approved by the apex drug regulator in a “trial mode” where those who receive the shot have to sign a consent form and will be followed up with for three months. On average, 45.5% of the people in these four central government hospitals have received the shot so far as per the data. The highest among them was at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where 95 people received the shot on the day of the roll-out, including the institute’s director Dr Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul. Coverage at the premier facility fell dramatically on the second day, with just eight of the hospital’s registered staffers receiving the shot. It picked up after that, with 55 and 62 people being vaccinated on the third and the fourth day. The lowest turnout so far has been at Safdarjung hospital, where 39% of the beneficiaries have been vaccinated. Doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital had written to their medical superintendent, asking for Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine on the first day of the drive. “We are working to dispel any misconceptions or doubts that people have. The senior doctors and those who have received the vaccine already are motivating the others. We will also put up hoardings with comments from those who have been vaccinated to convince people that the vaccine is absolutely safe,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-35-health-care-workers-in-shahdara-district-have-got-covid-jab-so-far-lowest-in-delhi-101611341446239.html
23-01-2021||Other||Police proposes route map for tractor rally, farmers to respond today||New Delhi: The Delhi police on Friday proposed a route map to the farmers where they could hold a tractor rally on January 26. Police officers did not share details of the proposed route but earlier the farmers had been told to take out the rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway on the periphery of the capital. The farmer groups confirmed they had received a proposal from the police but said they would respond only after holding a meeting on Saturday. They had planned the rally on the Outer Ring Road and had assured the police that it will be completely peaceful and that the protesters will not try to reach other areas in the city. Until Friday night, it was not clear if the police had proposed a route inside the national Capital or on the highways connecting Delhi. Senior police officers are holding talks with the farmers protesting against the three contentious farm laws over their planned tractor rally. Talks are being held daily since January 18. Police officers have maintained that no official permission has yet been given to the protesters for the rally since it could create a law and order problem on the Republic Day and trigger traffic chaos. Darshan Pal of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of the Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said the officers have proposed a “road map” to the farm leaders. “We will give our reply to their proposal after holding a meeting of the farm unions tomorrow,” Pal said. On talks with the government, the farmer leader said, “The deadlock continued as the government came with the proposal to suspend these laws for 18 months, while the farmers demanded the repeal of the laws,” he said. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said they are waiting for the farmer’s response and the future course of action would be decided accordingly. Meanwhile after the 11th round of meeting between the farmers and the government, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said that the government has told them that it will stick to its initial proposal. “They said if the farmers agree to it there can be further talks between the government and the farmers. We have told them that we will respond to the offer made,” he said outside Vigyan Bhawan. The farmers said that the date of next meeting with the government has not been decided yet. At the Singhu, Tikri and other borders where the farmers are camping, protests remained peaceful throughout the day even as police maintained adequate deployment. The farmers at Singhu border spent the day mostly marching, shouting slogans against the farm laws, delivering speeches from the stage, and cooking and distributing food at langars. In the afternoon, however, there was some ruckus near Vigyan Bhawan when a group of farmers heading to the meeting venue in a car alleged that they were stopped by the police and the rear windshield of their car was broken by policemen. Police officials said that every vehicle carrying farmers, coming to Vigyan Bhawan from Singhu Border, is escorted the police.Senior officials said they did not have any information about the vehicle joining the police escort and it was therefore stopped before Vigyan Bhawan. “On this, the farmers in the car got agitated and themselves damaged the car using a baton. There was no police action in this incident,” a senior officer said, who wished not to be named. Additional deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Ghanshyam Bansal said situation at Singhu Border on Friday remained peaceful as farmers continued their agitation. “We had sufficient deployment in place and the situation is being continuously monitored,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-proposes-route-map-for-tractor-rally-farmers-to-respond-today-101611341387004.html

The other two arrested persons were identified as Sushil Kumar and Raghu Nandan, who together ran the call centre.An officer attached to the investigation said, on condition of anonymity, that whenever any customer contacted Hasim to purchase a SIM card, he would activate two SIM cards on the customer’s ID and photograph. “Hasim used to give one SIM card to its rightful owner while the second SIM card was delivered to Kumar and Nandan for use in the call centre,” the officer added.Additional deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Sanjay Kumar Sain said on Thursday, the GTB Enclave police station team received information that a fake call centre was operating from a rented house in Dilshad Garden. Accordingly, a search was conducted and two men along with 15 women tele callers employed by them were found running the call centre.“They were calling job aspirants and taking money from them in the name of providing them jobs with an automobile company. The two men, Sushil Kumar and Raghu Nandan, were arrested. A total of 24 cellphones, 20 SIM cards, one landline phone, a laptop with Wi-Fi router, two debit cards, and 17 registers having details of potential victims were seized from the call centre,” said additional DCP Sain.During the interrogation, Sain said the two men were asked about the source through which they had procured the SIM cards. They told police about Hasim and that he was a promoter of a service provider company. Hasim was arrested and seven more SIM cards were recovered from him.An investigator who did not want to be named said Kumar and Nandan disclosed that they were running the fake call centre for the past three months and had duped hundreds of job seekers. They were paying ₹35,000 rent for the property from where the call centre was being run.“They procured details of job aspirants from a jobs portal. They mostly contacted candidates living outside Delhi. They charged ₹850 as registration fee and took ₹8,000 from each candidate while issuing them fake appointment letters,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-held-for-running-fake-call-centre-duping-job-aspirants-of-money-101611341326818.html

However, safety, surveillance and sanitation work will continue, and all protocols and guidelines issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) of the Union ministry of environment forests and climate change and the animal husbandry department of the Delhi government, are being followed strictly,” Pandey said. On January 15, samples from a brown fish owl found dead in its enclosure at the zoo, tested positive for H5N8 avian influenza. After this, cloacal, tracheal, and ocular swabs from birds in the zoo were sent to the Delhi government’s animal husbandry unit for serological examination. Samples from water bodies inside the zoo premises frequented by wild and migratory birds, along with bird droppings, were sent to be examined. Senior officials from the Union environment ministry said they were keeping a close watch to ensure more bird flu cases are not reported from the Delhi zoo or any other part of the Capital. “Zoo staff has been given special drapers and personal protective equipment (PPE). They are following our advisory, and are in constant touch with the ministry of animal husbandry. The zoo is closed, so there is no fear of transmission to people,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, the environment ministry’s additional director-general. In a list of guidelines issued by the ministry, zoo authorities have been directed to use a disinfectant spray of lime juice, Virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite, and foot bath of potassium permanganate, at regular intervals. “Chicken feed to raptors and entry of vehicles inside the zoo had already been stopped... Movement of staff and workers in the zoo is being restricted and regulated, keeping in view the animal influenza threats,” ministry guidelines read. Officials said managing the infection this time has been easier because unlike the 2016 outbreak, the zoo is already closed for the general public due to the threat of Covid-19, officials said. “Monitoring is being done and e-Bird mobile application, which is popularly used by bird watchers across the world, is being used to keep a record of monitoring tracks,” Pandey said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/days-after-dead-owl-tested-positive-for-bird-flu-six-samples-sent-from-delhi-zoo-return-negative-for-avian-infection-101611341267257.html
23-01-2021||Other||Snatching of ₹200 leads to murder in Rohini, seven arrested||New DelhiA 21-year-old man’s blind murder case —that happened in outer Delhi’s Rohini three weeks ago — turned out to be the result of a snatching, Delhi Police said on Friday, after arresting the seven alleged killers. The police’s probe in the case began on December 30, when a call reporting a murder was received at Begumpur police station in Rohini. The victim was identified as Subhash alias Bahadur (referred by his single name in police records), said PK Mishra, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini). Police said they had earlier arrested two men after looking at the CCTV footage of the incident. But those arrested men told the police that they had just helped the prime suspect, without knowing the motive. Earlier this week, the police then arrested Gaurav alias Himanshu and Sawan Sharma – the duo who were among a group of seven men that had carried out the killing. What emerged later was a tale of snatching that had ultimately led to Subhash’s murder. “Twenty days before his murder, Subhash had snatched ₹200 from Gaurav’s uncle,” said the DCP, adding that the snatching victim had not reported the matter to the police. The alleged snatcher had fled on foot after the crime. Gaurav, 27, has eight previous criminal cases against him and would proclaim himself as the next Neeraj Bawana of Delhi, the DCP said. Bawana, until his arrest in 2015, was one of the most wanted gangsters in Delhi with many cases of murder, robbery, extortion, and other such crimes against him in police records. “So, while being targeted by Subhash, the man had warned him that he was the uncle of Gaurav who would seek revenge later,” Mishra said. Subhash still went ahead with the snatching. He also took the threat on his ego, police said. Subhash and Gaurav lived in the same neighborhood of Begumpur and knew each other, but they were practically rivals in the crime world, the DCP said. “Subhash himself aspired to be a big criminal someday. He couldn’t come to terms with the fact that one of his victims tried to intimidate him by taking the name of his rival,” the DCP said. So, Subhash uploaded a video on Facebook in which he ‘openly challenged and threatened’ Gaurav. Soon after, Gaurav got to know of the video and decided to teach Subhash a lesson. On December 30, Gaurav, his friend Sawan along with five others caught Subhash and beat him till he died. The police said that Subhash had been lured to Sharma’s house on some pretext and beaten to death over there. They also recorded a video of the killing to send a “message” to anyone challenging Gaurav in the future, the DCP said. The police said that they got to know of Gaurav’s hideout by interrogating his wife and Sawan’s hideout by questioning his friend. Sawan also has six previous criminal cases against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/snatching-of-rs-200-leads-to-murder-in-rohini-seven-arrested-101611341266166.html

The weather department said that fog on Saturday and Sunday is likely to be moderate in most places in Noida and areas around it, however, open areas such as expressways will continue to see dense fog towards the morning hours.Mercury will drop again from January 25 onwards, bringing icy cold northern winds back, leading to the minimum temperature dropping to around 4°C, weather analysts added.“A western disturbance has arrived, leading to snowing on the mountains and a temporary change in wind directions from Friday. Due to this the mercury will rise by 2°C over the next two days, but will soon drop and be back to 4°C from January 25, also bringing back very dense fog,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).On Friday, the max and minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 16.3°C and 6.6 °C, respectively, against 21.9 °C and 10.1°C a day earlier.Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida and neighbouring cities deteriorated within the “very poor” level. It is, however, likely to improve again due to better wind speed expected over Saturday and Sunday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Friday was 361 against 306 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 322 against 298 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 371 against 326 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, between 201 and 300 is “poor”, between 301 and 400 is “very poor” and above 400 is considered “severe”. According to the weather department, the winds will pace up on Saturday leading to better ventilation conditions. “The wind speed became almost stagnant because of the western disturbance, as it leads to change in wind direction and a brief drop in speed. So pollutants accumulated and the air quality dropped. However, the wind speed will increase to around 20-25 kmph over Saturday and Sunday which will improve ventilation conditions,” said Srivstava.On Tuesday, the major pollutant particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in the region spiked to four times the safety standards, against three times the standard on Tuesday. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Friday was 218 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3). The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 218.60µg/m3. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 251.24µg/m3. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the air quality is likely to improve.“Surface winds easterly and moderate. Surface winds are forecasted to improve for Saturday under the influence of a fresh western disturbance. Due to better ventilation conditions, AQI is forecasted to marginally improve on January 23 and 24 but within the “very poor” category. The middle end of the “very poor” category is forecasted for January 25,” said SAFAR on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-and-air-quality-drop-in-noida-respite-likely-today-101611341206776.html

Upon investigation, it was found that Shareef had come to Noida recently and submitted relevant documents regarding a kidney transplant, in which fake papers were allegedly given to show that he was related to the recipient.“They had submitted fake documents to the Bangladesh High Commission and transplant committees in Delhi and Bangalore. Shareef had been brought to India for his kidney in exchange for almost five lakh in Bangladesh currency. However, he later said that was being pressured to do so, after which he informed the police,” said a senior police officer.When the information was shared with the Noida Health department, it was found that they had been deceived as well and a complaint was filed by the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office at Phase 3 police station against five people, including the organ recipient, his brother, an agent in Bangladesh and the two arrested suspects under sections 420, 468, 471, 474 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Transplant of Human Organs Act and Foreigners Act.The CMO could not be reached for a comment.Shareef was arrested along with Bazul Hak, who is from Bihar and currently lived in Delhi, who was allegedly the liaison between the donor and the recipient.

23-01-2021||Noida||Thousands of tractors head to UP Gate from as farmers prepare for ‘tractor parade’ on Republic Day||Monu Singh, a farmer from Nangal Bhagwanpur village in Baghpat, is back at the UP Gate protest site and has been arranging tractors for the proposed “parade” which the agitators are planning to take out on the outer Ring Road in Delhi on Republic Day. Monu lost his father, Galtan Singh, 57, on January 1 this year at the UP Gate protest site. That loss has only made his resolve stronger. After performing the required rituals, Monu returned to UP Gate on January 7 and is now busy with his team to rope in tractors from Baghpat region. He said that six tractors have already come and about a 1,000 more are expected before January 26. The tractors which have come have been welded with additional sheets of iron in front which generally provide added protection to the vehicle. They can now barge through barricades if required. “I never wanted to leave the protest site, but the last rituals of my father had to be performed. I rushed back after finishing them. Our group has purchased 1000 tricolours and 1000 other flags of our farmers’ union. Since, many farmers did not get the sugarcane payment we dumped our stock at crushers at low rates and purchased flags,” he, said. The tractor parade this time is expected to see arrival of thousands of tractors from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and will be a much bigger event than the tractor march which was held on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on January 7. The farmers said that all the tractors will be fitted with the tricolour as well as the flags of the respective farmers’ unions. Besides this, the farmers are also preparing tableaux. “Our group is preparing a tableau which will show exploitation of farmers and will also have farmers dressed up like our freedom fighters. Our tractors will arrive here by January 25 and will be lined up on the main road leading from UP Gate to Vaishali,” Monu added. The farmer leaders said that hundreds of tractors have started their journey from areas like Lucknow, Pilibhit and nearby areas on Friday morning and are likely to reach UP Gate by January 23/24. “Groups of tractors from Uttarakhand will start on Saturday and will reach here the next day. They will remain parked over the Delhi-Meerut Expressway before proceeding for the tractor parade on January 26. We have decided to rope in 500 volunteers who will ensure discipline during the tractor parade,” Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of UP Gate farmers’ committee and a farmer leader from Uttarakhand said, adding that “appropriate action” will be taken if the tractors are stopped midway. During previous instances, the protesters at UP Gate had resorted to blockade of Delhi-Ghaziabad carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway when their tractors were held up midway by authorities. “During the parade, we will rope in ambulances as well as couple of trolleys carrying food, water and other items. Even mechanics will be a part of rally so that they can immediately take up repairs if any tractor breaks down,” he, added. The UP Gate protest site has a majority of farmers who have come from different regions of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and are camping since November 28. Groups of protestes are also camping at the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway since December 3. “During the previous tractor march, we had apprised the district officials that tractors were not being allowed over the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, but the farmers took out their rally. Even this time if their tractors arrive on the Delhi Meerut Expressway, it will be up to the district officials to look into the matter. We are already facing issues with our work which is getting delayed due to their protest,” said Mudit Garg, project director of National Highways Authority of India. The UP Gate protest site now stretches up to outside the Khoda Colony from UP-Gate, which is over a kilometre away and the occupancy is likely to be extended further once more farmers arrive with their tractors. “The tractors will have no space at UP-Gate so they will be lined up on the expressway. They will come in hundreds from different regions in UP and Uttarakhand and will occupy the expressway,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. “As of now the farmers have told us that they will hold the tractor parade. On our part, we have deployed police personnel by dividing the UP-Gate into several sectors. We will also make arrangement and ensure that tractors get parked in vacant spaces and do not pose any hindrance to the traffic on the expressway,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/thousands-of-tractors-head-to-up-gate-from-as-farmers-prepare-for-tractor-parade-on-republic-day-101611341147796.html

After the inclusion of these 27 villages in the KDMC, ₹700Cr of the boundary extension grant from the government has not yet been received. So far, KDMC has spent a huge amount of money on development works in these 18 villages. In the last five years, 18 villages have had arrears of property tax and water bills of over ₹300Cr.“As the entire burden falls on the taxpayers of Kalyan-Dombivli, we also want to exclude these 18 villages from KDMC, however we all demanded that the state government should pay the expenses incurred by KDMC in 18 villages so far through this intervention petition,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-accepts-intervention-petition-by-kalyan-dombivli-citizens-on-18-villages-101611341147364.html

23-01-2021||Noida||‘Bomb-like devices’ put cops on toes in Noida, Ghaziabad||Police in the twin cities of Noida and Ghaziabad have gone on a high alert after three ‘bomb-like devices’ were recovered in the past couple of days.Police said all the three recoveries were made from both the districts after the police control room was tipped off by residents. Probes have been launched in all the three cases.On Friday, a bomb-like device created panic in Noida’s Sector 63 after which the area was cordoned off and traffic diverted. The incident was reported around 7.15am, when a call was made to the police helpline by an auto-rickshaw driver about the device. “We activated the necessary protocols in place as soon as the call came in. The area was cordoned off and traffic was diverted. Teams from the bomb disposal squad and sniffer dog units were rushed to the spot,” said Alok Singh, commissioner of police (CP). The CP said that no explosives or detonator was found in the device, which was made to look like a bomb . A forensic team also examined it before the device was taken away for further examination. The device was found on the divider of the road going from SJM hospital to Chhajarsi colon. The cops said that the device in question had been fashioned from two painted plastic bottles which contained water and a digital watch had been strapped on o make it seem like a timer. Locals said that the device caused panic in the area in the morning. “We realized that something was going on when all of a sudden there were many police vehicles and then someone said that a bomb has been found. It was scary. Traffic in the area was stopped, and people were being asked to stay away from the divider,” said Mohanti Lal, a tea vendor in the nearby Chhajarsi village. A senior police officer from Noida said that eyewitnesses and locals in the area are being questioned and there are a few leads that are being worked on. Police suspect that this was a prank and have denied any connection to threats related to Republic Day. An FIR was registered at the Phase 3 police station against unknown suspects under section 290 (public nuisance) of the Indian Penal Code and section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment act based on suo motu cognizance taken by the Noida police. The area is adjacent to Delhi Meerut Expressway and is located a few kilometres away from the UP-Gate site where thousands of farmers are camping as part of their demands for repeal of the three farm laws. Meanwhile another incident was reported from near the Delhi Meerut Road in Ghaziabad where a similar crude ‘bomb-like’ device was found by the police on January 20 and an FIR was registered in this connection at Madhuban Bapudham police station in Ghaziabad. The FIR states that the device was a 5 kilogram LPG cylinder which was covered with a black sheet of paper and a “watch-like” timer attached to it. Further, the cops also found a letter attached to the cylinder which had three demands written on it – capital punishment for a politician, penalty of ₹7 crore on seven people and to flash a signal if the “bomb” was discovered. The cops said that it was a prank played by some unidentified person and they are investigating the matter. The site was an empty plot near “Hum Tum” hotels adjacent to Delhi Meerut Road. It is also expected that hundreds of farmers in tractors will also arrive from the same route for their proposed tractor parade before January 26. “We are taking every precaution following the discovery of the said device and all security arrangements are in place, besides routine checks and patrolling. The local intelligence unit is also keeping an eye and also part of the investigation,” said Awaneesh Kumar, circle officer (city 2) at Ghaziabad. On Thursday, a prank call had been made to Kailash hospital, sector 27 in Noida, about the presence of a bomb in the building, which was later found to be hoax. No arrests have been made in any of the cases so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bomblike-devices-put-cops-on-toes-in-noida-ghaziabad-101611340907157.html
23-01-2021||Noida||Gonda medical student rescued from kidnappers in Noida, five arrested||Noida: Five suspects, including a doctor, were arrested by the Noida Special Task Force (Noida STF) and the Gonda police Thursday night from the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway for allegedly kidnapping an 18-year-old medical student from Gonda and demanding ₹70 lakh from his family.Officers said the gang members had allegedly brought the victim to Delhi on January 18, and on Thursday they were shifting him to Agra in a car when the STF team nabbed three suspects and rescued the victim, from the Expressway police station area. Two other suspects were arrested from Gonda. Police said the student was allegedly lured by a Delhi-based ayurvedic doctor, who is absconding.Shailesh Kumar Pandey, superintendent of police, Gonda, reached Greater Noida Friday morning. In a joint press conference with the Noida STF, Pandey said that the Gonda police received information about the abduction a day later. “The victim, Gaurav Haldar, is from Bahraich and studies BAMS (Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) at a private college in Gonda. Gaurav’s father Nikhil Haldar informed the police on January 19 that Gaurav had gone missing from his college at 3pm on January 18. The family had received two ransom calls from a mobile number demanding ₹70 lakh,” Pandey said. The kidnappers had demanded the money by Friday and threatened consequences, officers said.A case of abduction was registered against unknown persons under Section 364-A of IPC at Nagar Kotwali. The police launched an investigation and Gaurav’s roommate told the police that he had allegedly recently been in touch with a woman through the phone, and that the woman had called him before he went missing. “We put the mobile number on electronic surveillance and traced their movement in Delhi. We also informed the Noida-STF for a joint operation,” he said. Raj Kumar Mishra, additional superintendent of police, Noida STF, said that the police found that the suspects were allegedly planning to shift to Agra Thursday night. “A joint team reached the Greater Noida Expressway and stopped a suspected Maruti Swift Dzire car for checking. The police arrested three suspects – Dr Abhishek Singh, 32, a BAMS doctor and resident of Wazirganj in Gonda; Nitesh Vihari, 28, a resident of Dholpur in Rajasthan; and Mohit Singh, 30, a resident of Gonda – and rescued the victim. Police recovered a countrymade gun, four live cartridges, and sedatives.”Officers said Abhishek, the alleged mastermind, revealed that he works in a hospital in Nangloi, Delhi. He allegedly told police his cousin Rohit, who lives in Bahraich, was friends with Mohit. Officers said Mohit attended a gym where he met Nitesh who was allegedly involved in fraudulent activities. They said Rohit had allegedly informed Abhishek that abducting Gaurav could yield a good amount of money.Additional SP Mishra said that Abhishek then allegedly roped in all these members as well his colleague, Preeti Mehra, 25, also a BAMS doctor. “The first call was made on January 15. In the next three days, the woman convinced the student to meet her outside his college. On January 18, Preeti, along with the other suspects reached his college and picked him up in a car.“On the way, Abhishek forcibly administered me sedatives to make me unconscious. I do not know what happened after that and I was brought to Delhi. During the captivity they gave me sedatives multiple times so that I do not resist,” Gaurav alleged after he was rescued. Rohit and his accomplice Satish, who allegedly helped them get a SIM card on a forged identity, were nabbed by the Gonda police. Police have launched a search for Preeti who is absconding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gonda-medical-student-rescued-from-kidnappers-in-noida-five-arrested-101611340906155.html
23-01-2021||Noida||Less than 50% health workers turn up for second session of Covid-19 vaccination drive in Noida district||NOIDA: In what comes as a major setback to the coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccination drive, less than 50% of the listed health workers could be administered the shots on Friday in Gautam Budh Nagar district during the second session of the first phase of vaccination. Aimed to vaccinate as many as 4,200 health workers, Covishield could be administered to only 2,059 persons, the officials said. According to the official figures, due to the low turnout of corona warriors at centres, 51 doses of vaccines became useless. District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that while the vaccination portal was not running properly at most of the centres, in many areas the accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers didn’t turn up for their shots.“The rural health workers are reported to be a bit apprehensive about the accuracy and efficiency of the vaccines. Their lukewarm response will certainly defeat the purpose of vaccination. However, we have been repeatedly requesting them to be vaccinated, without being afraid. Though all of them were informed about Friday’s drive on Wednesday, we can’t compel someone to be vaccinated” he said. The CMO further said that problems in the vaccination portal were reported from almost all hospitals.“Similar CO-WIN portal-related issues were identified during the inaugural day of vaccination. We have already informed higher officials about this problem. I hope that in the coming sessions of this drive, such problems will not occur,” he said. He also said that as many as 51 doses of vaccines were destroyed as they could not be administered on time. “Each vial of vaccine has 0.5 ml of dose, sufficient for 10 beneficiaries. If it is not used within four hours of opening the vial, we have no option other than to destroy it. We had to destroy 17 doses on the inaugural session on January 16,” he said.Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), agreed that portal related issues slowed the vaccination. “Due to this, we couldn’t administer vaccines to as many as 30 people. Had it been functioning properly, we could have achieved 100% of our stipulated target of 200 vaccinations on Friday,” he said. However, many health workers took the vaccine shots enthusiastically, despite the low turnout. Margret Warner, the assistant nursing superintendent of Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospital at Basai Darapur in New Delhi, said she saw a ray of hope when she received a message for vaccination from the district health department.“Since I’ve been working in the Covid-dedicated ward of my hospital since last 10 months, I had no fear of the vaccine. I came to my allotted centre at the ESIC hospital, Noida, driving nearly 36 km. I am fine and am feeling no complications after the shot,” she said.Echoing similar views, Dr Mrinal Sircar, the head of pulmonology and critical care department at Fortis Hospital, said after being vaccinated that after an eventful year of struggle with Covid-19, the vaccination can now script the end of the pandemic story. “It is wonderful that the vaccination drive has come in just when Covid-19 numbers are falling, which will be a double barrel attack on the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/less-than-50-health-workers-turn-up-for-second-session-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-in-noida-district-101611340846712.html
23-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad achieves 81.27% vaccination coverage, many centres achieve 100% target||The Ghaziabad district on Friday, for the second round of vaccination, set a target of vaccinating 4,000 health care workers and managed to inoculate 3251 of them. This, officials said, adds up to a coverage of 81.27%, with major hindrance in turnout only being due to ‘Anganwadi’ workers, who were hesitant about taking the jabs. The district had started the second round of vaccination on Friday at 31 centres where 40 sessions were taken up by as many teams, with projected coverage of 100 beneficiaries by each team. During the first round of vaccination of health care workers on January 16, the district had a target of 400 health care workers and vaccinated 379 of them. “A total of 3251 of the 4000 listed health care workers were vaccinated on Friday. There were some centres where some health care workers panicked while some others refused to join. The coverage was low at primary health care centre at Vijay Nagar. Those who did not turn up were mostly Anganwadi workers. We have about 500-600 of them and a majority of them did not turn up due to reluctance about the vaccine,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Some of the centres also had issues with slow speed of the Co-Win app and the district health department officials had to take up entries even after the vaccinations got over at 5pm. “There were some issues with the Co-Win portal, so we made entries even after the vaccination drive got over for the day. There were several centres where 100% vaccination was achieved and these include Shanti Gopal Hospital at Indirapuram and government health centre at Loni,” Dr Gupta added. The highest target of 500 vaccinations in the district was at Max Hospital at Vaishali, with officials there stating that they had managed to vaccinate 477 of the beneficiaries in five sessions. “The 23 health care workers who did not take the shots included some doctors (who got the vaccine at our Delhi hospital) and some others who had recently recovered from Covid infection. So, overall, the vaccination coverage was high (about 95.4%). There was no adverse events following immunization (AEFI) reported at our centre,” said DR Nidhi M Dev, medical superintendent of the hospital. Further, both branches of Yashoda Hospital at Nehru Nagar and Kaushambi achieved 100% vaccination with each given a target of 200 and 300, respectively. “Our staff cooperated and there was no AEFI event reported. I also took the shot after our vice-chairperson, Dr Shashi Arora, opted to take the first shot,” said Dr Sangeeta Garg, medical superintendent of the hospital. The officials from hospital’s Kaushambi branch also said that there were no AEFI events reported from the 300 vaccination, which were taken up. “We held regular training of our staff and also conducted regular awareness sessions about the vaccination. So, we were able to achieve 100% vaccination with full cooperation of our staff,” said a spokesperson from the hospital. Officials of Columbia Asia Hospital near NH-9 said that they also achieved 100% vaccination of the 100 beneficiaries which were listed for Friday. “The beneficiaries who received the SMS call were registered and vaccinated successfully. All were satisfied with the arrangement and cooperated with government officials. The vaccinations started at 10am and was done till 5pm and a total 100 people were inoculated,” Dr Sudhir Verma from Centre for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Columbia Asia Hospital, said in a statement. At the government’s Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, the turnout was 91 of 100 beneficiaries. “Nine of our staff members were either on leave or had health complications due to which they were not found fit for vaccination. I took the first shot in the morning. None of our staff suffered any AEFI event,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital. In Ghaziabad, all the beneficiaries were given the Covishield vaccine. Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), said that “vaccination across the state was taken up at 1537 booths and 61,585 health care workers were vaccinated till 3pm on Friday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-achieves-81-27-vaccination-coverage-many-centres-achieve-100-target-101611340847254.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid vaccination coverage reaches 91%||The district recorded the highest turnout for Covid-19 vaccination on Friday, with almost 91% coverage of the targeted healthcare workers. Focusing on private healthcare workers, who make up for the majority of the district’s total workforce, the health department inoculated at least 3,278 out of 3,600 beneficiaries at the vaccination sites set up in various private hospitals of the city. On Thursday, when both private and government healthcare workers received the vaccine, the turnout was 79%.At 32 sites, at least 3,138 took the Covishield jab as against the set target of 3,200, whereas the turnout for Covaxin for the fourth time remained slow. Only 140 took the Covaxin jab out of the 400 targeted for the day, according to the district health department data. Health workers from government set up were not inoculated on Friday. The next session for them will be held on Saturday. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “The footfall remained high throughout the day due to walk in. For Saturday, the department has planned to cover the maximum workforce by having more than 53 vaccination sites.” Although the numbers stood high, some doctors from small clinics and nursing homes found their names missing from the list. A member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said that due to miscommunication, a couple of doctors who reached the vaccination site based on the beneficiary list could not take the shot as they were asked to show the text message for vaccination. Dr Ajay Gupta, vice president, Indian Medical Association, Gurugram chapter, said, “On Thursday, IMA received a list of doctors and health staff who had to be given vaccine at different sites, primarily private hospitals. It was the same list of workforce, which was registered before the vaccine was launched. A couple of doctors faced challenges like their names were missing from the list at the site, while in some places vaccination officers said they can give the jab only if the doctor or staff could show the text message regarding date and location of vaccination.”He said that the issue can be resolved once they receive the extended list of beneficiaries who will be covered by January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccination-coverage-reaches-91-101611340846211.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Haryana govt to build low-cost apartments for slum dwellers||Haryana government has decided to build low-cost flats for those living in slum clusters in the state. Gurugram and Faridabad have been chosen as the first two districts in the state in which this project will be implemented. Government officials said that slum dwellers in these two districts will be identified and flats at affordable prices would be developed and allotted to them. The cost of these centrally located apartments would be worked out in the coming months, said officials on Friday. The scheme was announced on Thursday by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who issued directions to officials that a comprehensive scheme should be prepared for the rehabilitation of residents living in urban slums by providing residential flats at affordable prices. The project, which shall be developed by the department of housing for all will first focus on Gurugram and Faridabad, said the chief minister. The flats to be constructed under the scheme would be given to the slum dwellers at affordable prices which could be paid by them in installments. The government could also arrange loans through banks so as to facilitate payment by beneficiaries, he added. As per the plan of the state government, the objective is to provide affordable housing facilities to urban slum dwellers. Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, confirmed the development and said that they have already started the process of identifying the slum areas, which can be rehabilitated. “There are around four lakh slum dwellers in Faridabad alone and the plan is to get government lands free from encroachments and build flats on them. The survey for this purpose has already began and a report will be finalised next week. The price of these flats would be very reasonable so that slum dwellers can afford them” said Yadav, who also has the charge of commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Faridabad. Yadav also said that both in Faridabad and Gurugram, the projects will be developed at centrally located sites within the city and inputs would be taken from slum dwellers. They will be alloted flats with their consent. “Government land in both the cities which is encroached would be cleared and slum dwellers accommodated ,” he said. In Gurugram, the department of town and country planning(DTCP) and other civic agencies would be conducting the survey to identify the land for prospective projects for slum rehabilitation and development of flats, said officials. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that sites would be identified for feasibility as per the directions of the government as this project has the potential to clear the slums and provide quality housing. “All efforts would be made to rehabilitate slum dwellers,” he added. Sanjay Sharma, a city-based real estate consultant, when asked about the feasibility of this plan said that such projects become more successful if the flats are given free of cost to slum dwellers. “The government should take lessons from what happened in Delhi as slum dwellers sold their flats and returned to.slums. The need is to learn from these mistakes,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-govt-to-build-low-cost-apartments-for-slum-dwellers-101611340788496.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Health worker who took Covishield shot dies of heart attack, officials wait for confirmatory report||A 56-year-old health worker at Bhangrola primary health centre, who had received a Covid-19 vaccine shot on January 16, died due to cardiac arrest on Friday. The district health department officials said that preliminary findings showed that the death might be unrelated to vaccination as the woman had shown no adverse reaction to the vaccine in the last five days. “Her viscera have been sent to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, to determine the actual cause of death,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district. “The cause of her death, if due to vaccination, is yet to be confirmed. She had received the Covishield shot. The postmortem done in Gurugram does not give any conclusive cause of death. But based on the examination by doctors of the Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee, the woman died due to cardiac arrest in her sleep,” he said, adding that until the final examination report is declared nothing can be claimed. “The state and central government have been informed about the incident” he said. After confirmation given by the family, the hospital authority called the police to take the woman’s husband Lal Singh’sstatement before a post-mortem examination to know the exact cause of death. The health worker, Rajwanti, was a resident of Krishna Colony.Her husband, Lal Singh, on Friday wrote to the SHO, New Colony police station, seeking to perform the last rites as there was a delay in postmortem report. Citing the entire episode, Singh in his letter said that his wife had slept at around 10pm on Thursday but she did not wake up the next morning. Thereafter, she was rushed to a private hospital in sector 39 where she was declared brought dead.Singh said, “My wife had no health issues. At 8am she was declared dead, and we received the body around 4pm.” In Gurugram, over 21 cases of minor side effects —such as nausea and high fever — had been reported since the Covid-19 vaccination drive started on January 16. None of them had to be admitted in hospital. The AEFI committee has been constituted to study and examine the adverse reactions reported by people after taking the vaccine jab. As per the health department data, no case of AEFI has been reported on Thursday and Friday. Experts say minor symptoms, like pain or swelling at the injection site and fever, are common in all sorts of vaccinations, and people should not be hesitant of taking the jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-worker-who-took-covishield-shot-dies-of-heart-attack-officials-wait-for-confirmatory-report-101611340787923.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Illegal mobile towers to face action, four towers sealed||Illegal mobile towers installed in private residential colonies and group housing projects are likely to be sealed in the coming days as the enforcement wing of department of town and country planning has decided to conduct a crackdown against such towers from next week onwards. The department said that it has received a number of complaints in this regard, particularly on CM window, and consequently it was decided that junior engineers in their respective areas would issue notices and seal the towers, which are not regularised. On Friday, a team of the enforcement wing of DTCP sealed four mobile towers installed in the EWS block of a group housing society in sector 79. “A complaint was lodged on the CM window but action was pending since long, so an inspection was conducted on Friday and it was found that these towers were illegal. It was also found that the roof of the EWS block was very dirty, so we ensured that the roof was also cleaned on the spot,” said RS Bhath, district town planner. He further said that mobile operators and the site owners should get mobile towers regularised, otherwise action will be initiated by the department. “The norms are very clear and these should be followed, else action will be taken,” he said. In a related development, a team of MCG officials led by Bhath, removed encroachments from a large plot in U Block of DLF Phase 3 as commercial activities were being carried out illegally. “Construction material was being sold from the plot and there were other small vends built on the plot without permission. This complaint was also lodged with CM Window,” he said, adding that in coming weeks all such complaints pertaining to encroachments and violations would be dealt with on a priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-mobile-towers-to-face-action-four-towers-sealed-101611340787353.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Cold wave likely to make a return to the city, says MeT dept||The city woke up to a relatively warmer morning on Friday, when the minimum temperature was recorded at 7.7 degrees Celsius — up from 7.2 degrees Celsius a day before. However, isolated cold pockets were observed across the National Capital Region(NCR), including in Delhi, where the Safdarjung observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 4.2 degrees Celsius, indicating a ‘cold day’. Officials in the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that cold day conditions occur either when the maximum temperature remains under 10 degrees or the minimum temperature remains less than 4.5 degrees Celsius or 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal. Such cold day conditions are likely to spread to other parts of Delhi-NCR, including Gurugram, over the next two days. This dip, they said, is due to a fresh western disturbance currently affecting Himalayan regions in the north, causing heavy snowfall in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting centre at the IMD, said, “We had originally predicted that cold drafts would start blowing over north India around January 25, but some parts have already begun to feel the influence of the weather system. Gurugram will also experience a dip in the minimum temperature over the weekend.” Cooler conditions were more prominent during the day on Friday, when the maximum temperature dipped to 17.1 degrees Celsius — down from 20.2 degrees Celsius on the previous day. As per the IMD’s seven-day forecast for Gurugram, the minimum temperature is likely to dip to as little as four degrees Celsius by Monday, while the maximum temperature may dip to 16 degrees Celsius. Srivastava added that the IMD has sounded a cold wave alert for north India for the next few days. Unlike a cold day, a cold wave is characterised by a simultaneous dip in both minimum and maximum temperature readings. “After the weather system passes, there will be a lot of residual moisture in the atmosphere and this will bring down the daytime temperature as well. In the mornings, there will be dense fog,” Srivastava said. The dip in daytime temperature on Friday was accompanied by calmer winds, which, in turn, led to a significant deterioration in Gurugram’s air quality. The city recorded an AQI of 315 (very poor) on the CPCB’s daily air quality index bulletin (up from 234 the previous day, indicating poor air). As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to... remain in very Poor category on 23.01.2021 and lower end of very Poor to Poor category on 24.01.2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cold-wave-likely-to-make-a-return-to-the-city-says-met-dept-101611340786860.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||Four members of a gang held for 20 robbery, snatching cases||Four members of a gang — allegedly involved in over 20 cases of robberies, snatching, and giving lift and looting cases in the city — have been arrested, the police said on Friday. On January 11, police had received a complaint from one Deepak Pandey, a resident of Delhi, who works in a private company in Udyog Vihar, wherein he alleged that he had gone to Sector 14 to withdraw ₹10 lakh from his company’s account. While he was returning with the cash, three men took him hostage at gunpoint and snatched his bag and other valuables near Sector 14 crossing. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they formed teams and handed over the investigation to the crime investigation agency of Sector 17. “We had received multiple complaints of robbery and loot. The gang members used to stand outside private banks and kept a close watch on people coming out with bags. They had robbed more than 20 victims and at least 10 of them were robbed on the pretext of giving them a lift,” he said The suspects were arrested from Bank Market in Sector 14 on Thursday while they were tailing another victim who was carrying ₹4 lakh cash, said police. The suspects were identified as Shravan Kumar (34) of Hisar, Sandeep Kumar (28) of Bahadurgarh, Suresh Singh (38) of Jhajjar and Surender Singh alias Sonu (35) of Jhajjar. Sangwan said the suspects have confessed and have revealed that there were eight members in their gang. “We have identified the remaining suspects and they will be arrested very soon,” he said. The suspects allegedly used to share the task — one of them remained inside the bank and passed on information to other gang members and many times sent pictures to identify the victim — following which four others on two different motorbikes followed and robbed them. Four such incidents have been reported in the last one month from Sector 14, said police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, rewarded Sector 17 crime investigation agency for their speedy work and cracking most of the crime cases handed over to them. “The team has arrested more than 20 criminals in the last one year and has been active throughout. They have set an example for other teams,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-members-of-a-gang-held-for-20-robbery-snatching-cases-101611340786150.html
23-01-2021||Gurugram||First time in eight months, Gurugram has fewer than 10 Covid patients on life support||The occupancy rate of reserved hospital beds (and ventilators) has also fallen to its lowest in eight months in Gurugram, health department officials confirmed on Friday, as the number of fresh Covid-19 cases continue to dwindle. At present, only three percent of all reserved ventilators for Covid patients are currently in use (down from 25 percent at the height of the epidemic’s third wave in mid-November). Similarly, only 10 percent of reserved ICU beds for Covid are currently occupied (down from 70 percent in mid-November). In absolute numbers, there were only nine active Covid-19 patients on life support in the district on Friday. “The last time we had less than 10 patients on the ventilator was in late May or early June last year. Since then, we have consistently had at least 30 patients on life support at any given point. When the third wave of cases was peaking in early November, we had between 50 to 60 people on ventilator, and we even had to allocate additional units on November 15 in case the surge continued. Fortunately it did not, and the situation has really improved this month,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, Integrated Disease Surveillance Program’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram. “It would be a real morale booster if we can get to a stage where there are no more patients on ventilator, which would mean even fewer patients in intensive care,” Sharma said, confirming that the occupancy rates for ICU beds has also dipped significantly. “There are only 29 more patients in the ICU who are under treatment without ventilator support. In mid-November, there were about 120 to 130 such patients,” he said. Among general hospital beds with oxygen facilities, too, there has been an improvement in the occupancy rate, with only three percent of reserved beds currently in use (as against 31 percent in mid-November). The ongoing slowdown in new cases, which is now into it’s tenth week in Gurugram, has provided a much needed breather to medical officers, ASHA workers and midwives who have been involved in the epidemic response since March last year. A senior medical officer working at a health care sub-centre in Wazirabad, seeking anonymity, said, “We have a total of 75 medical officers in the district. From March to November, all of us were working on monitoring patients, doing their contract tracing with the help of ASHA workers, supervising testing camps and so on.”Now, department officials said, a third of all medical officers have been exclusively allocated to the vaccine roll out. “The remaining medical officers are able to manage their routine work as well as addressing new cases of Covid-19 which are still emerging. This would have been very difficult in November. Now, at a few PHCs, cases are low enough that ANMs and ASHA workers are not required for contact tracing and surveillance. It is being managed by the health department internally. ASHA workers will be roped in again for community engagement when the vaccine drive is scaled up,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/first-time-in-eight-months-gurugram-has-fewer-than-10-covid-patients-on-life-support-101611340726205.html

It has been found that doctors and students have been inoculated in good numbers, but there is a need to educate and inform groups like nurses, sanitation and clerical staff about the need for vaccination. A few awareness sessions have been conducted and the response is good so far,” said Dr Jasbinder Kaur, GMCH director- principal.The hospital is organising physical doubt clearing sessions for the workers to pose questions directly to the experts so that confidence can be built for the exercise.“Employees suffering from hypertension and diabetes are the most sceptical about getting vaccinated. So, we inform them accordingly and encourage them to take the shot. We have already started seeing the impact of our drive as many staffers after these sessions report directly to the vaccination sites,” said Prof Deepak Chawla, GMCH nodal officer for Covid vaccination.He added that the health workers at the hospital want to get certain about their safety post-vaccination. “Most of the employees just want to see whether there is any side effect by observing those who have taken the shot.”Not only this, the director-principal has asked the seniors in some departments to post messages in their local WhatsApp groups to encourage others for taking the shots.“Seniors in the departments have a certain role to play as they interact with the employees on a daily basis. For example, if nursing superintendents and their assistants receive the jab, we ask them to post their experience in the WhatsApp groups to motivate their peers for the same. Also, phone numbers of the doctors concerned have been shared with the staff for addressing vaccine-related queries,” Dr Jasbinder Kaur said.She added that although no serious side effects of the Covid vaccine are expected, arrangements have been made to detect and manage any symptoms arising within the observation period.“As beneficiaries will receive the vaccine, naturally occurring health events will surface. Most of these events will not be related to the vaccine and are likely to be symptoms of commonly occurring morbidities only,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-gmch-32-starts-awareness-drive-to-counter-vaccine-hesitancy-101611340606975.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks details of levying penalty on illegal constructions in MMR||The Bombay high court (HC) last week directed all municipal corporations within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), to furnish details as regards statutory levying of penalties on illegal constructions.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni has directed the civic bodies – BMC and municipal corporations for Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar and Bhiwandi-Nizampur – to furnish, by March 3, 2021, details of compliance of section 152A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, and section 267A of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949, both of which provide for levying annual penalty of an amount equal to twice the property tax leviable on the building, if the structure is unauthorised and constructed without necessary planning permission. The court also directed the civic bodies to furnish ward-wise details of unauthorised constructions within their respective limits, with the break-up of completely illegal buildings –constructed without planning permissions, part-illegal structures – buildings with some illegal floors, and constructions with major deviations from sanctioned plans.The civic bodies have also been directed to furnish details of actions taken by them against these three categories of illegal constructions.The directives came on a suo-motu proceeding taken up after a dilapidated building collapsed in Bhiwandi on September 23, 2020, resulting in the loss of 16 lives, including eight children, prompting HC to take suo-motu note of dilapidated buildings and mushrooming of illegal constructions in MMR.In its order, the bench observed, “There can be no two opinions that proper planning of the municipal areas can never be achieved if the persons, who by law are vested to govern the affairs of the corporation either by virtue of their employment or election as corporators, have no will to weed out such lawlessness of illegal constructions, dilapidated buildings and perpetration of encroachments.”The bench said that there were ideal laws to administer and maintain cities with high standards of municipal governance, but the reasons why there is gross failure to achieve such goals and ideals, reflecting very poorly on the municipal administration, are not too far to be noticed.“It can certainly be said that there is a failure of long-long years in preventing illegal constructions, encroachments and having such buildings as are dilapidated and which may lead to collapse, resulting in loss of innocent human lives,” the bench added.The bench also questioned why municipal councillors besides civic officials, should also not be held accountable for the menace of illegal constructions and encroachments. The judges wondered as to why municipal councillors should not be held responsible and accountable on the principle that every public position a person holds is accompanied by duties, obligations and responsibilities.“On every occasion, it cannot be that officers are to be held responsible for lawlessness and loss of human lives,” said the bench. “Any dereliction of such basic municipal duties by all stakeholders needs to be deprecated and recourse to the process of law, civil and criminal, is required to be taken to its logical conclusion in the event such illegalities are noticed,” the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-details-of-levying-penalty-on-illegal-constructions-in-mmr-101611340546963.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC seeks explanation from collectors on non-transfer of mangrove areas to Maharashtra forest department||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed collectors of all coastal districts, City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to submit affidavits explaining why they have not complied with the September 2018 order of the HC, directing to declare all mangrove areas as forests, and transfer the areas to the forest department.A public interest litigation (PIL) filed by NGO Vanashakti claimed that there was willful negligence, and sought directions to immediately initiate transfer and handover of nearly 1,600 hectare of mangrove land under the jurisdictions of the said authorities to the forest department. The NGO sought to place the mangrove forests under the control of the chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).A division bench of justice Amjad Sayed and justice Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the PIL, was informed by advocate Zaman Ali for Vanshakti that on September 18, 2018, the HC had reiterated its previous directions to declare mangrove areas as forests and transfer them to the forest department.In light of this, Ali submitted that the order applied to collectors of the coastal districts which included Mumbai city, Mumbai suburban, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, as well as the three authorities namely Cidco, JNPT and MMRDA. The PIL submitted that while 15,311.7087 hectare of mangrove land came under the purview of the order, only a total of 13,716.7321 hectare was transferred to the revenue and forest department, while 1,594.9766 hectare was pending transfer. Ali submitted that pursuant to the 2018 HC order, the chief conservator of forests had reminded the collectors and the three authorities of non-compliance, but none of them complied, and hence, the NGO was compelled to approach the court.Apart from seeking directions to the authorities to transfer the mangrove land to the forest department and the chief conservator of forests, the PIL also sought initiation of contempt proceedings against the errant authorities as well as directions to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) to refrain from processing any coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance applications for development purposes proposed in mangrove forest areas and buffer zones till completion of the transfer of mangrove lands to the forest department. The PIL also sought direction to restore the mangrove areas degraded since 2005. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the respondent authorities to file their replies within three weeks and is expected to hear the matter in the second week of February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-seeks-explanation-from-collectors-on-non-transfer-of-mangrove-areas-to-maharashtra-forest-department-101611340426942.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Parent write to NCPCR over fee hike issues||Parents from across the state have written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) over issues pertaining to fee hike in private schools in the state. In their letter, Indiawide Parents Association has asked the commission to look at issues concerning fee hike, harassment in case parents complain regarding hikes and the state education department’s failure to act against such schools. “Many schools in Maharashtra have been targeting students over fee disputes. We have complained to the state government on behalf of parents, but have not got any response. Despite sending a list of schools to the state government, the education department has not audited any schools and we thus hope that the commission directs the government to do so,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association. Sahai said that the state government should also work on appointing a chairperson for the Maharashtra State Child Rights Commission, a post which is currently vacant. Parents have also attached a list of schools where issues concerning fees are yet to be resolved. “Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown, parents faced a lot of financial issues with job losses and pay cuts. Despite that, many private schools have hiked fees and have taken action against children whose parents have dues pending,” said a parent whose son was recently removed from the online school group for non-payment of dues, in Kalyan. Officials from the state education department said that since the subject of fee concerning private schools is sub judice, they cannot comment on the matter. A government resolution (GR) released on May 8, stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26, in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools, as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-parent-write-to-ncpcr-over-fee-hike-issues-101611340367065.html
23-01-2021||Mumbai||Zero daily Covid-19 cases in Mumbai’s slum area of Dharavi for second time since pandemic started||For the second time since the first Covid-19 case was reported in Dharavi in April last year, no case was reported in the area on Friday. Before this, on December 25 zero cases were reported in a day. Dharavi, one of Asia’s largest slums, was once known as a prime hotspot, with hundreds of cases being recorded daily.The first case of Covid-19 in Dharavi was recorded on April 1 last year when a 56-year-old man tested positive. He succumbed to the virus within a few days. The total death toll in Dharavi has reached 312. Since June, there has been a sharp decline in daily Covid cases. The area’s average daily case count had come down from 47 in May 2020 to 18 in June 2020. The count had peaked at the start of May, with 94 cases recorded in a day on May 3. The number started plunging since June 1. The highest number of cases in June did not go beyond 34, as recorded on June 1.BMC officials say that Dharavi has come full circle in its fight against Covid-19. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G-North ward (Dharavi), said, “A lot of hard work has been put in by the frontline workers since the first Covid case in Dharavi. There has been a sharp drop in cases since June. There was a small spike following the Ganesh festival, which was concerning, but it dipped later.” For the past several weeks, Dharavi has been recording only single-digit Covid cases daily.Active cases at present in Dharavi are at an all-time low, with just 10 at present. The total count in Dharavi has reached 3,904, while 3,582 patients have already been discharged.The Dharavi slum, spread over 2.4sqkm, has 850,000 residents and a population density of 354,167 per sqkm, making it one of the most cramped spaces in Mumbai, itself the world’s fifth most densely populated city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/zero-daily-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-s-slum-area-of-dharavi-for-second-time-since-pandemic-started-101611340308095.html

23-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai airport exports Covishield vaccines to international destinations||Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) on Friday became the first airport in the country to export the vaccine to international destinations. CSMIA has initiated the international shipment of Covishield vaccine to Brazil and Morocco. The Covishield vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, departed from CSMIA carrying two million doses to Brazil via Emirates Sky Cargo and two million doses to Morocco on Royal Air Maroc. Overall, CSMIA has facilitated the movement of over 14.17 million doses of the Covishield vaccine across various international and domestic destinations. As a premier pharma hub of the country, CSMIA has placed a process for faster turnaround of Covid-19 vaccine export-import (EXIM) and transhipment movements. “Given the requirement for timely and temperature-controlled movement of the vaccine, the existing infrastructure at CSMIA enables the airport to offer a continuous temperature-controlled movement and seamless processing of pharma goods through the airport. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) implemented by the airport in anticipation of the vaccine distribution saw the terminal register a cargo processing time of just 23 minutes, right from goods acceptance to dispatch at the ramp,” said the airport spokesperson. CSMIA handles the largest portion of EXIM pharmaceutical air cargo movements in the country. The airport has handled 40 to 50 tons of vaccines per day and is home to Asia’s largest temperature-controlled export pharma excellence centre, a facility that has a one-time holding capacity of 800 tons for 2-8 degrees. It can cater to cargo meant for seven freighters at a time, as well as a Pharma-dedicated import cold zone offering 860 tons of 15 to 25 degrees storage and cold chambers offering 300 tons of 2 to 8 degrees storage.CSMIA is also India’s largest hub for ‘Envirotainer’ movements with over 60 power outlets for processing pharma active containers; CSMIA’s “Envirotainer Station” has processed over 2500 active containers within the airport and distribution to major pharma gateway airports across the country.Currently CSMIA witnesses around 14 to 15 cargo flights daily and handles an average of 800 tons of export and 700 tons of import cargo in a day. CSMIA caters to over 500 destinations, with 27% of its overall exports to Europe, 20% to America and 20% to African countries.

23-01-2021||Mumbai||Kanjurmarg better than Aarey for Mumbai Metro-3 car shed, says govt panel||A nine-member committee appointed by the Maharashtra government has recommended that the car shed for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) be built at the plot in Kanjurmarg and not in Aarey Milk Colony. The committee was appointed on January 6 was given a month to submit its report, which it has submitted to the chief minister’s office in a record 15 days.State chief secretary Sanjay Kumar confirmed on Thursday that the report had been submitted to the chief minister’s office. “We were given a mandate and we have submitted the report,” Kumar said.While details from the report are yet to be released by the state, it is known that the panel has recommended the 102-acre Kanjurmarg plot, citing future expansion and integration of the Metro-3 and Metro-6 with a common car shed. A state official on condition of anonymity said, “The two committees appointed earlier had not examined future expansion. Considering Aarey is a 30-hectare (ha) plot, expansion will be tough in the future.”Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an address from last December, had also stated expansion would be difficult in Aarey. In November 2019, Thackeray had appointed a committee under additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik, which had said in its report that the Aarey plot was the only viable option for the car depot.Another official from the state government said, “The Saunik committee report did not look at several aspects while recommending Aarey. Kanjurmarg is the only option for future expansion. If not today, the government will have to allocate land at Kanjurmarg in the future. In such a scenario, it is better to integrate Metro lines at one plot, for optimal utilisation of land and finances.”However, with the Bombay High Court (HC)’s stay over the land transfer, building a car shed at Kanjurmarg will be a tough battle for the state. Also, in a letter sent to Thackeray on Thursday, former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis had said his government approved the site in Aarey for the car depot after considering population estimates till 2053. “Between 2031-53, 13 trains of eight cars each will be dispatched in phases based on travel demand. For this, 1.5ha of the remaining 5ha will be utilised. This area has around 160 trees which will be transplanted in phases,” wrote Fadnavis in the letter. The state had said that the five-hectare plot has around 1000 trees. Fadnavis had also alleged that the recently-appointed committee was “a farce” and its report would recommend the Kanjurmarg plot.Activist and member of the Save Aarey group Zoru Bhathena said, “The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation had stated that eventually it would require 61 hectares in Aarey for the depot. This means that more trees will have to be cut in the forest area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kanjurmarg-better-than-aarey-for-mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-says-maharashtra-government-s-panel-101611339527523.html

Police arrested more than 2,100 people, some of whom took to the streets in temperatures as frigid as minus-50 Celsius (minus-58 Fahrenheit).In Moscow, thousands of demonstrators filled Pushkin Square in the city center, where clashes with police broke out and demonstrators were roughly dragged off by helmeted riot officers to police buses and detention trucks, some beaten with batons.Navalny’s wife Yulia was among those arrested.Police eventually pushed demonstrators out of the square. Thousands then regrouped along a wide boulevard about a kilometer (half-mile) away, many of them throwing snowballs at the police before dispersing.The protests stretched across Russia’s vast territory, from the island city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk north of Japan and the eastern Siberian city of Yakutsk, where temperatures plunged to minus-50 Celsius, to Russia’s more populous European cities. The range demonstrated how Navalny and his anti-corruption campaign have built an extensive network of support despite official government repression and being routinely ignored by state media.“The situation is getting worse and worse, it’s total lawlessness," said Andrei Gorkyov, a protester in Moscow. "And if we stay silent, it will go on forever.”The OVD-Info group that monitors political arrests said at least 795 people were detained in Moscow and more than 300 at another large demonstration in St. Petersburg. Overall, it said 2,131 people had been arrested in some 90 cities.Undeterred, Navalny's supporters called for protests again next weekend.Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and which Russian authorities deny. Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a 2014 criminal conviction, while Navalny says the conviction was for made-up charges.The 44-year-old activist is well known nationally for his reports on the corruption that has flourished under President Vladimir Putin's government.His wide support puts the Kremlin in a strategic bind — risking more protests and criticism from the West if it keeps him in custody but apparently unwilling to back down by letting him go free.Navalny faces a court hearing in early February to determine whether his sentence in the criminal case for fraud and money-laundering — which Navalny says was politically motivated — is converted to 3 1/2 years behind bars.Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. Russia refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin’s side for a decade, unusually durable in an opposition movement often demoralized by repressions.He has been jailed repeatedly in connection with protests and twice was convicted of financial misdeeds in cases that he said were politically motivated. He suffered significant eye damage when an assailant threw disinfectant into his face. He was taken from jail to a hospital in 2019 with an illness that authorities said was an allergic reaction but which many suspected was a poisoning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2100-arrested-at-protests-demanding-alexei-navalny-s-release-101611425364680.html

23-01-2021||World||‘Dark Money’ helped pave Joe Biden’s path to the White House||President Joe Biden benefited from a record-breaking amount of donations from anonymous donors to outside groups backing him, meaning the public will never have a full accounting of who helped him win the White House.Biden’s winning campaign was backed by $145 million in so-called dark money donations, a type of fundraising Democrats have decried for years. Those fundraising streams augmented Biden’s $1.5 billion haul, in itself a record for a challenger to an incumbent president.That amount of dark money dwarfs the $28.4 million spent on behalf of his rival, former President Donald Trump. And it tops the previous record of $113 million in anonymous donations backing Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.Democrats have said they want to ban dark money as uniquely corrupting since it allows supporters to quietly back a candidate without scrutiny. Yet in their effort to defeat Trump in 2020, they embraced it.For example, Priorities USA Action Fund, the super political action committee that Biden designated as his preferred vehicle for outside spending, used $26 million in funds originally donated to its nonprofit arm, called Priorities USA, to back Biden. The donors of that money do not have to be disclosed.Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, was unapologetic. “We weren’t going to unilaterally disarm against Trump and the right- wing forces that enabled him,” he said in a statement.Campaign finance laws, in theory, are supposed to limit the influence big money has over politicians. But the system has gaping loopholes, which groups backing Biden and other candidates, have exploited.“He benefited from it,” said Larry Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission.A Biden spokesman did not immediately respond to attempts to seek comment.His campaign called for banning some types of nonprofits from spending money to influence elections and requiring that any organization spending more than $10,000 to influence elections to register with the FEC and disclose its donors.Biden raised more than $1 billion for his campaign, which can accept donations of up to $2,800 per election from individuals. That included $318.6 million from donors who gave less than $200 each. The rest of the money Biden raised came from donors with pockets deep enough to give as much as $825,000, with that money being divided among the Democratic National Committee and 47 state parties.Dark money is not the biggest source of cash to campaigns. Wealthy donors can write eight-figure checks to super-PACs, Noble pointed out. Joint fundraising committees that raise money for campaigns and parties can bring in chunks of $830,500.Donors who want to avoid disclosure can give to political nonprofits, like Defending Democracy Together, which spent $15.6 million backing Biden, and aren’t required to disclose their contributors to the FEC. Donors can also give money to a nonprofit that in turn gives the money to a super-PAC, like Priorities USA did. Candidates and their campaigns can’t coordinate spending with such groups under federal law.And that lack of disclosure worries reform groups.Big donors -- individuals or corporations -- who contributed anonymously will have the same access to decision makers as those whose names were disclosed, but without public awareness of who they are or what influence they might wield.“The whole point of dark money is to avoid public disclosure while getting private credit,” said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, which advocates for reducing the influence of money on politics. “It’s only dark money to the public.”Battleground Attack AdsOverall, Democrats in this election cycle benefited from $326 million in dark money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That was more than twice the $148 million that supported Republican groups. Some of the Democratic groups that relied on dark money in whole or in part spent heavily on early ads attacking Trump in critical battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The groups started spending while Biden’s relatively cash-poor campaign was struggling to raise money for the primaries.Future Forward PAC, a super-PAC that spent $104 million backing Biden, got $46.9 million from Facebook Inc. co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, $3 million from Twilio Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lawson and $2.6 million from Eric Schmidt of Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google. But its biggest source of funds was its sister nonprofit, Future Forward USA Action, which contributed $61 million. The names of those who put up the $61 million don’t have to be disclosed.The Sixteen Thirty Fund, a nonprofit that sponsors progressive advocacy, donated a total of $55 million in the 2020 election cycle to Democratic super-PACs, including Priorities USA Action Fund and Future Forward PAC, FEC records show. That total was much more than the $3 million it gave in 2018.Amy Kurtz, executive director of the Sixteen Thirty Fund, said the surge of money to the group, which doesn’t disclose the names of its donors, included people who previously gave to Republicans or had not been engaged in politics.The flood of dark money to Democrats and progressive groups has complicated their effort to reform the system.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, has blamed dark money for persuading Republicans to block legislation to address climate change and assuring judges who share their views are appointed to the courts.“Dark money is toxic to democracy – period,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “The fact that progressive groups have learned to fight back using similar tactics is no excuse for continuing the plague of dark money in America.”Kurtz says her group would prefer rules that eliminated dark money.“We have lobbied in favor of reform to the current campaign finance system,” she said, referring to H.R. 1, an election reform measure Democrats have proposed that includes more rigorous disclosure of donors to political nonprofits, “but we remain equally committed to following the current laws to level the playing field for progressives.”Even Cecil, who runs the super-PAC supporting Biden, said the group supports reform.“We still look forward to the day when unlimited money and super- PACs are a thing of the past,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dark-money-helped-pave-joe-biden-s-path-to-the-white-house-101611422995175.html
23-01-2021||World||Oil industry reels as Joe Biden targets fossil fuels in first days||Hours after taking office, President Joe Biden made good on a campaign promise to cancel the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Later that day his Interior Department mandated that only top agency leaders could approve new drilling permits over the next two months.Next week, according to people familiar with the plans, Biden will go even further: suspending the sale of oil and gas leases on federal land, where the US gets 10% of its supplies.The actions sent oil producers’ stocks tumbling and raised blood pressure across the industry.“In the first couple of days of the new administration, they are taking actions that will harm the economy and cost Americans their jobs,” said Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president of policy for the American Petroleum Institute. “We’re concerned, and everyone in the country should be concerned.”The Interior Department’s order, signed late Wednesday, changes procedures for 60 days while the agency’s new leadership gets into place. It requires top brass to sign off on oil leases and permits as well as decisions about hiring, mining operations and environmental reviews.The industry took it as a bad omen. Officials are worried that technical permitting decisions are being placed in the hands of political appointees, rather than expert regulators in the field. And they’re concerned permits -- or simply changes to them -- will be delayed for existing drilling operations.Moreover, many interpreted it as a prelude to broader actions, including the administration’s plan to next week impose a moratorium on all oil, gas and coal leasing across some 700 million acres (2.8 million hectares) of federal land.This “announcement is intended as a temporary ban on leasing and permitting but is also a precursor to a longer-term ban,” said Kathleen Sgamma, head of the Western Energy Alliance, which has threatened to go to court to battle any such blockade.While Biden’s campaign promises - and his initial moves to fulfill them - are a threat to some US oil producers, the actions could be a boon for crude prices by restraining supply.The administration’s early moves mark a dramatic shift from the course under former President Donald Trump, who sought to accelerate drilling permits and open up more places to oil exploration.And the change in direction is already apparent in early staffing decisions. Under Trump, the top offshore drilling regulator at Interior was Scott Angelle, a longtime oil industry ally and former Louisiana official who pushed for rapid permitting of Gulf of Mexico oil projects after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.By contrast, one of Biden’s first hires at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management that oversees offshore oil leasing and wind farms is Marissa Knodel, a former activist with Friends of the Earth. Knodel was one of about 150 people whose rowdy protest of a bureau auction of oil drilling rights in March 2016 prompted the agency to shift subsequent oil and gas lease sales online.On the campaign trail, Biden called for phasing out fossil fuels and promised to halt new oil and gas permitting on federal land. Worried oil producers stockpiled leases and drilling permits last year in anticipation of more restrictions under Biden.But the suddenness of this week’s moves still took many in the industry by surprise, prompting frantic phone calls as lobbyists and lawyers sought to plan their next moves. They are strategizing their options, including litigation, and looking at any political levers they can pull to forestall a broader leasing ban.Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, said permitting changes threaten operations in his state during the current winter season, when companies such as ConocoPhillips rely on ice roads and ice pads to support drilling and other activity in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.“If you put a 60-day moratorium on drilling in the NPR-A, guess what? You lose the whole season,” Sullivan said Friday on the Senate floor.Environmentalists are delighted. They say throttling fossil fuel development on federal land is necessary to pare the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. The oil, gas and coal extracted from federal lands and waters is responsible for about 24% of US carbon dioxide emissions, according to a US Geological Survey report.“Pausing new fossil fuel decisions brings us closer to healthier communities, a healthier climate and healthier wild places,” said Dan Ritzman, director of Sierra Club’s Lands, Waters and Wildlife campaign. “Public lands can and must be part of the climate solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-industry-reels-as-joe-biden-targets-fossil-fuels-in-first-days-101611421916719.html

23-01-2021||World||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's support falls sharply, but a majority reject impeachment, polls show||Support for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has overseen the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak, has fallen sharply, a Datafolha poll shows, as a brutal second wave and a lack of vaccines sours views of his far-right government.However, despite his declining support, a majority of Brazilians are now against him being impeached, a second Datafolha poll found. Both were released late on Friday.According to one of the polls, Bolsonaro's administration was rated as bad or terrible by 40% of respondents, up from 32% in an early-December survey. Just under a third of respondents rated Bolsonaro's government as good or excellent, versus 37% in the previous poll.The poll results are a blow for the president. The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said they represent the biggest drop in approval since the beginning of his government in 2019.Brazilians have grown increasingly irate at the slow pace of Brazil's vaccine rollout, which began last weekend but remains blighted with few vaccines to inoculate the country's 210 million people and stall a snowballing second wave.Pot-banging protests, a hallmark of the early days of the pandemic, even erupted in some cities earlier this month, and both left- and right-wing groups convened pro-impeachment marches across the country this weekend.To make matters worse, a new virus variant has appeared in the north of the country that researchers believe has higher levels of transmissibility. Some countries have even barred entry for Brazilian travelers.Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is already under pressure for his handling of an outbreak that has so far killed 215,243 people. He has sought to minimize the gravity of the virus and even said he won't take any Covid-19 shot, stoking growing anti-vaccine sentiment.Nonetheless, another Datafolha poll found that 53% of respondents are against Congress opening impeachment proceedings against the president for his handling of the pandemic, compared with 50% in a previous survey. Those favoring impeachment fell to 43% from 46% previously.Both polls were conducted on Jan 20-21, interviewing 2,030 Brazilians, with a 2 percentage point margin of error.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-s-support-falls-but-a-majority-reject-impeachment-polls-show-101611418508527.html
23-01-2021||World||Russia accuses US embassy of publishing Navalny supporters' 'protest routes'||Russia on Saturday accused the US embassy in Moscow of publishing routes of planned demonstrations in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and demanded an explanation from American diplomats."Yesterday the US embassy in Moscow published 'protest routes' in Russian cities and tossed around information about a 'march on the Kremlin,'" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook."US colleagues will have to explain themselves," she added.The embassy had distributed a "demonstration alert" to US citizens in Russia recommending they avoid protests in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities.Police on Saturday detained over 1,300 protesters, including Navalny's wife, according to protest monitor OVD Info, as tens of thousands took to the streets to denounce President Vladimir Putin's rule.The US embassy in Moscow said Saturday it was following the rallies, adding that Washington supported "the right of all people to peaceful protest, freedom of expression.""Steps being taken by Russian authorities are suppressing those rights," embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-accuses-us-embassy-of-publishing-navalny-supporters-protest-routes-101611417128047.html
23-01-2021||World||Italy health official warns of change in Covid-19 vaccine roll out plan if supply problems continue||Italy will have to rethink its Covid-19 vaccination plans if supply problems persist, a senior health official said on Saturday.The country had already had to cut its daily inoculations by more than two thirds because of delays in deliveries of shots from US drugmaker Pfizer Inc, Franco Locatelli, the head of Italy's higher health council, told a press conference.Now that AstraZeneca Plc has also warned of cuts in deliveries to its doses - even as they await clearance for use in the bloc - Italy might have to redraw its national roll out at the end fo the month, he said.Vaccinations in Italy have slowed to 20,000-25,000 a day from peaks of more than 90,000 around two weeks ago, Locatelli said.Rome has threatened to sue the Pfizer which said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output.Pfizer's vaccination deliveries to Italy were 29% lower this week and would be down 20% next week, though they should return to agreed levels from Feb. 1, Locatelli said.On Friday, a senior official told Reuters AstraZeneca had also informed the European Union it will cut deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine to the bloc by 60% because of production problems.The European Medicines Agency will rule on whether to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the bloc on Jan. 29 and Rome will have to reassess immunisation plans after that, Locatelli said."The reduction calls for a rethinking of the vaccine rollout we had initially envisaged. We'll have to consider matters towards the end of January," Locatelli said.So far 1.312 million doses of vaccine had been injected in Italy, corresponding to around 70% of deliveries, placing Italy second in Europe after Germany, Locatelli said.Nearly 40,300 people have completed the vaccination cycle after receiving the second dose, he added.

Discussions have moved online, starting Monday, and Covid-19 restrictions are also keeping regular tourists away."Look around, it's empty. Normally, all hotels would be fully booked at this time," Reto Branschi, head of Davos Klosters tourism, told Reuters in an interview this week.He said the fact that outdoor activities like skiing were still possible had helped cushion the blow, but the share of foreign tourists was expected to be under 10% versus 35% in normal years.Svea Meyer, owner of cafe KaffeeKlatsch in Davos, said she had to lay off some staff and was now preparing for the possibility that the World Economic Forum might not come back to Davos at all."I cannot see anything good (in the cancellation), we've built so many relationships over the years, made friends," she said with a look of regret.This year, there are no helicopters patrolling the skies, no protesters trying to outwit security forces sealing off the Alpine resort, no Greta Thunberg stealing the show from former US president Donald Trump.But not everybody is sad about the lack of buzz."Complete peace and quiet," a local woman wearing a mask said. "I don't miss it at all."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/davos-ski-resort-eerily-quiet-without-economic-talkfest-this-year-101611415990629.html
23-01-2021||World||UK doctors seek 'urgent review' of 12-week gap between vaccine doses||A major British doctors' group says the UK government should “urgently review” its decision to give people a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine up to 12 weeks after the first, rather than the shorter gap recommended by the manufacturer and the World Health Organization.The UK, which has Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, adopted the policy in order to give as many people as possible a first dose of vaccine quickly. So far almost 5.5 million people have received a shot of either a vaccine made by US drugmaker Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech or one developed by UK-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and Oxford University.AstraZeneca has said it believes a first dose of its vaccine offers protection after 12 weeks, but Pfizer says it has not tested the efficacy of its jab after such a long gap.The British Medical Association on Saturday urged England’s chief medical officer to “urgently review the UK’s current position of second doses after 12 weeks.”In a statement, the association said there was “growing concern from the medical profession regarding the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as Britain's strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries.”“No other nation has adopted the UK's approach,” Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA council, told the BBC.He said the WHO had recommended that the second Pfizer vaccine shot could be given up to six weeks after the first but only “in exceptional circumstances.”“I do understand the trade-off and the rationale, but if that was the right thing to do then we would see other nations following suit,” Nagpaul said.Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England, defended the decision as “a reasonable scientific balance on the basis of both supply and also protecting the most people.”Researchers in Britain have begun collecting blood samples from newly vaccinated people in order to study how many antibodies they are producing at different intervals, from 3 weeks to 24 months, to get an answer to the question of what timing is best for the shots.The doctors’ concerns came a day after government medical advisers said there was evidence that a new variant of the virus first identified in southeast England carries a greater risk of death than the original strain.Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said Friday “that there is evidence that there is an increased risk for those who have the new variant,” which is also more transmissible than the original virus. He said the new strain might be about 30% more deadly, but stressed that “the evidence is not yet strong” and more research is needed.Research by British scientists advising the government said although initial analyses suggested that the strain did not cause more severe disease, several more recent ones suggest it might. However, the number of deaths is relatively small, and fatality rates are affected by many things, including the care that patients get and their age and health, beyond having Covid-19.Britain has recorded 95,981 deaths among people who tested positive, the highest confirmed virus toll in Europe.The UK is in a lockdown to try to slow the latest surge of the virus, and the government says an end to the restrictions will not come soon. Pubs, restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues and many shops are closed, and people are required to stay largely at home.The British government is considering tightening quarantine requirements for people arriving from abroad. Already travelers must self-isolate for 10 days, but enforcement is patchy. Authorities are considering requiring arrivals to stay in quarantine hotels, a practice adopted in other countries, including Australia.“We may need to go further to protect our borders,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-doctors-seek-urgent-review-of-12-week-gap-between-vaccine-doses-101611416437357.html

We are working closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure a smooth implementation of the vaccine roll-out programme,” Mkhize said.South Africa is battling a second wave of the Covid-19 as well as a new variant of the deadly virus.The country reported 11,761 new Covid-19 cases and 575 deaths in the last 24 hours. With this, the total number of fatalities in the country has reached 40,076.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, the country has 1,392,568 Covid-19 cases.The minister said that his department had also been offered vaccines from private agents.“As a department we have resolved and wish to advise the public that it is critical that any such agent and vaccine authenticity must be verified directly with manufacturers. This is the only way, in our view, to guarantee the quality of the vaccines that may be acquired through third parties,” Mkhize said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-s-regulatory-body-approves-serum-institute-of-india-s-covid-19-vaccine-101611413412047.html
23-01-2021||World||Cancelled Keystone XL Pipeline may yield 48,000 tons of scrap||The scrapping of Keystone XL not only means the end of multibillion-dollar pipe dream for TC Energy Corp. -- it also leaves behind 48,000 tons of steel.US President Joe Biden revoked permits for the oil pipeline on his first day in office, killing a cross-border project that had won a four-year reprieve under his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump. The pipeline would have spanned almost 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles). TC Energy anticipated needing about 660,000 tons of steel just for the US portion.About 150 kilometers of pipe had been installed and an additional 2.2 kilometers had been completed at the Canada-US border as of the end of 2020, the Canada Energy Regulator said in a Jan. 22 email. That would amount to nearly 48,000 tons of steel, assuming standard dimensions of line pipe, according to Bloomberg calculations based on industry criteria.The benchmark steel price is about $1,060 a ton, which would value the haul at almost $51 million -- though as scrap it would be sold for less. Secondary metal, which is any scrap that is already past use for its original purpose, sells at a discount to new forms of the raw material. Once sold, the scrap metal is remelted by the buyer and formed into new steel products.TC Energy may to have to sell already delivered metal to secondary markets. While unclear exactly how much steel the Calgary-based firm owns that’s tied to Keystone -- some may also be in storage -- industry observers say it likely isn’t enough to make a dent on the market. The amount that could be sold would be a fraction of the total US steel market demand of around 100 million tons a year.TC Energy couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for the Canada Energy Regulator, which oversees the Canadian portion of the project, said no decisions have been made on the steel.The regulator “continues to engage with TC Energy since the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Project was revoked,” the Canadian agency said in the statement, adding that it will “continue its regulatory oversight, focusing on ensuring safety and environmental protection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cancelled-keystone-xl-pipeline-may-yield-48-000-tons-of-scrap-101611407376941.html

Saudi Arabia has built solid, historical relations where it worked with different administrations. We will continue to do that as well with President Biden," Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said in an interview with Arabiya TV.Biden pledged on the election campaign trail to reassess ties with Saudi Arabia, a state he described as a "pariah" in 2019. Biden has said he will take a firmer stand on Saudi’s human rights record and the devastating Yemen war.Prince Faisal said that Riyadh will continue to consult with Washington with regards to the Iran nuclear deal. The United States pulled out in 2018 of the 2015 deal between major powers and Iran, under which Iran restrained its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions."I believe basically the consultations will be around reaching a solid and strong agreement that takes into account Iran's failure to comply. ..with strong monitoring factors to ensure the implementation of the agreement," Prince Faisal said.Biden has said that if Tehran resumed strict compliance with the agreement Washington would too.Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies including the United Arab Emirates, concerned about Iran’s ballistic missiles and regional network of proxies, supported Trump’s maximum pressure campaign on Tehran and welcomed his decision to quit the nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran.They have said that this time around they should be included in any potential negotiations between the Biden administration and Iran on a new nuclear deal, to ensure it addresses Iran’s missile capabilities and “malign activity”.The minister reiterated the kingdom's stance that having a peace agreement with Israel is conditional on implementing the Arab Peace Initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-optimistic-expects-excellent-relations-with-biden-administration-101611409609703.html

He was 87.King died Saturday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement on his official Twitter account. The cause of death wasn’t provided but he had spent time recently undergoing treatment for Covid-19. He had bypass surgery following a heart attack in 1987 and later was treated twice for cancer.King, the host of a popular nighttime radio call-in show in the 1970s and 1980s, vaulted into nationwide prominence after CNN owner Ted Turner persuaded him to join his fledgling network in 1985. His show, “Larry King Live,” became a popular TV interview program whose fans included President George H.W. Bush. King interviewed every sitting president from Gerald Ford to Barack Obama.After 25 years on cable, King announced in 2010 that he would retire, having slipped behind Sean Hannity at Fox News and Rachel Maddow at MSNBC in cable ratings. By the time he left, he estimated he’d done about 50,000 interviews during more than a half century on radio and television. He won an Emmy award for lifetime achievement in 2011.Informal approach“His brand of informality has become common in the age of podcasting,” Los Angeles Times TV critic Robert Lloyd said in 2018 after King’s new show, seen on Hulu, was nominated for two daytime Emmys. “No one has done this job better, or with more gusto.”In his CNN program, King got a ratings spike from Ross Perot, who announced on air in 1992 that he would run for the president as an independent. In 1993, Vice President Al Gore and Perot debated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on King’s show, the highest-rated cable program for more than a decade.King interviewed world leaders. including Russian President Vladimir Putin, performers such as Lady Gaga, and an assortment of athletes, actors, national heroes and unknown individuals suddenly tossed into the limelight. Marlon Brando famously kissed King on the lips on air — as did his onetime girlfriend Angie Dickinson, the sultry TV actress.King said he left it to this producers to pick his guests and did not prepare much, preferring to ask simple questions and listen carefully to the answers.King, who pitched a variety of products on radio and TV, used his show to raise funds for disaster relief after natural disasters hit New Orleans and Haiti.Legal scandalHis rise to prominence involved an epic comeback after he was charged in 1971 with grand larceny for taking $5,000 from financier Louis Wolfson and using it to pay back taxes rather than giving it to the intended recipient.Though never prosecuted, he was fired from his various broadcast and newspaper-column jobs in Florida. By the late 1970s, the incident had blown over, and he was able to return to Miami broadcasting.In 1978, he started a nightly coast-to-coast radio talk show on the Mutual Radio Network, called “The Larry King Show.” It featured guest interviews and call-ins from an audience listening to more than 500 affiliate stations.After joining CNN, King published several best-selling books, including his autobiography, ”My Remarkable Journey” in 2009. He also wrote a book on heart disease after suffering a heart attack.He was inducted into the Radio, Cable and Broadcasters Halls of Fame and won 10 Cable ACE awards.Carlos slim partnershipKing and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim started Ora.TV, a digital entertainment network and production company in 2012. Its programs include “Larry King Now,” “Off the Grid With Jesse Ventura” and “Brown Bag Wine Tasting With William Shatner.”Larry King was born Lawrence Zeiger on Nov. 19, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrant Jewish parents. He got his start in broadcasting in the Florida market, where a friend had told him there was a shortage of on-air talent. He started at WAHR (now WMBM) in Miami Beach, initially as a cleaner. When an announcer suddenly quit, King was put on air.He was married eight times — including twice to the same woman -- and had five children, two of whom died in 2020.King won a Peabody award for live election coverage in 1992 “for providing a unique insight into democracy for viewers everywhere CNN can be seen.” The judges said that “while at one extreme the campaign was analyzed ad infinitum by political pundits, and at the other trivialized by a seemingly endless array of national and local talk-show hosts, ‘Larry King Live’ took an important middle ground. As an interviewer, Mr. King let the candidates speak for themselves and let his national and international viewers ask the questions that reveal the character of the people who would lead our nation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-television-host-larry-king-dies-at-87-101611408033818.html

23-01-2021||World||At 78 and the oldest president, Joe Biden sees a world changed||When Joe Biden took the oath of office as the 46th president, he became not only the oldest newly inaugurated U.S. chief executive in history but also the oldest sitting president ever.Biden was born Nov. 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He was 78 years, two months and one day old when he was sworn in on Wednesday. That’s 78 days older than President Ronald Reagan was when he left office in 1989.A look at how the country Biden now leads has changed over his lifetime and how his presidency might reflect that.BIGGER, MORE DIVERSE PIEThe U.S. population is approaching 330 million people, dwarfing the 135 million at Biden's birth and nearly 60% greater than when he was first elected to the Senate in 1972. The world population in Biden’s lifetime has grown from about 2.3 billion to 7.8 billion.More striking is the diversity in Biden’s America. The descendant of Irish immigrants, Biden was born during a period of relative stagnant immigration after U.S. limitations on new entries in the 1920s, followed by a worldwide depression in the 1930s. But a wave of European immigration followed World War II, when Biden was young, and more recently an influx of Hispanic and nonwhite immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Africa has altered the melting pot again.In 1950, the first census after Biden’s birth counted the country as 89% white. Heading into 2020, the country was 60% non-Hispanic white and 76% white, including Hispanic whites.So, it’s no surprise that a politician who joined an all-male, nearly all-white Senate as a 30-year-old used his inaugural address 48 years later to promise a reckoning on racial justice and, later that afternoon, signed several immigrant-friendly executive orders.BIDEN, HARRIS AND HISTORYBiden took special note of Vice President Kamala Harris as the first woman elected to national office, and the first Black woman and south Asian woman to reach the vice presidency. “Don’t tell me things can’t change,” he said of Harris, who was a student in the still-mostly segregated Oakland public elementary school when Biden became a senator.The first time Biden addresses a joint session of Congress, there will be two women behind a president, another first: Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. But change comes slowly. Harris was just the second Black woman ever to serve in the Senate. When she resigned Monday, the Senate was left with none -- and just three Black men out of 100 seats. Black Americans account for about 13% of the population.MONEY MATTERSMinimum wage in 1942 was 30 cents an hour. Median income for men according to the 1940 census, the last before Biden's birth, was $956, with women earning about 62 cents for every dollar a man earned. Today, the minimum wage is $7.25. The federal government's most recent weekly wage statistics reflect a median annual income of about $51,100 for full-time workers. But the question is buying power, and that varies. The month Biden was born, a dozen eggs averaged about 60 cents in U.S. cities -- two hours of minimum wage work. A loaf of bread was 9 cents, about 20 minutes of work. Today, eggs can go for about $1.50 (12 minutes of minimum-wage work); a loaf of bread averages $2 (16 minutes).College tuition is another story. Pre-war tuition at Harvard Business School was about $600 a year -- roughly two-thirds of the median American worker’s yearly wages. Today, the current Harvard MBA class is charged annual tuition of more than $73,000, or a year and almost five months of the median U.S. salary (and that’s before taxes).Biden proposes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour -- a move already drawing opposition from Republicans. He’s called for tuition-free two-year community and technical college and tuition waivers for four-year public schools (so, not Harvard) for students from households with $125,000 or less in annual income.DEBTNational debt has soared in Biden’s lifetime, from $72 billion to $27 trillion. But it’s a recent phenomenon. Biden finished 36 years in the Senate and became vice president amid the fallout from the 2008 financial crash, when the debt was about $10 trillion. Now he takes office amid another economic calamity: the coronavirus pandemic.To some degree, this is a biographical bookend for Biden. He was born when borrowing to finance the war effort generated budget deficits that, when measured as percentage of the overall economy, were the largest in U.S. history until 2020, when emergency Covid spending, the 2017 tax cuts and loss of revenue from a lagging economy added trillions of debt in a single year.Reflecting how President Franklin Roosevelt approached the Great Depression and World War II, Biden is nonetheless calling for an additional $1.9 trillion in immediate deficit spending to prevent a long-term economic slide.PLANES, TRANES AND AUTOMOBILESAs part of his proposed overhaul of the energy grid, Biden wants to install 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2030, a move analysts project could spur the sale of 25 million electric vehicles. For context, federal statistics counted 33 million cars in the U.S. altogether in 1948, as Biden began grammar school.A FIRST FOR THE SILENT GENERATIONBiden is part of the Silent Generation, so named because it falls between the “Greatest Generation” that endured the Depression and won World War II, and their children, the Baby Boomers, who made their mark through the sweeping social and economic changes of the civil rights era, Vietnam and the Cold War.True to the stereotypes, Biden’s generation looked for decades as if it would never see one of its own in the Oval Office. The Greatest Generation produced John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Then Boomers took over. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald Trump were born in a span of 67 days in 1946, the first of the Boomer years. Barack Obama, born in 1961, bookended their generation as a young Boomer.If his inaugural address is any indication, Biden seems eager to embrace the characteristics of his flanking generations. He ticked through the “cascading crises” -- a pandemic and economic fallout reminiscent of the Depression and subsequent war effort, a reckoning on race that’s an extension of the civil rights era -- and summoned the nation “to the tasks of our time.”PLENTY OF FIRST-HAND LEARNINGBiden lived through 14 presidencies before beginning his own, nearly one-third of all presidents. No previous White House occupant had lived through so many administrations before taking office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-78-and-the-oldest-president-joe-biden-sees-a-world-changed-101611406766286.html

The strengthening of rules came after a 10-year-old girl died of asphyxiation in Palermo, Sicily, while taking part in a so-called blackout challenge on TikTok, the news agency cited her parents as saying.TikTok has come under increased scrutiny by European Union regulators over data on children. Ireland’s data-privacy watchdog recently took over related probes from the French and Danish authorities.The EU’s data-protection chiefs in June pledged to coordinate potential investigations into the Chinese company, establishing a taskforce to get a better understanding of Tiktok’s processing and practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-reviews-italian-data-watchdog-s-order-to-block-accounts-101611400430774.html

Amateur sports and leisure activities won’t be allowed.“This is a very serious situation, and we must do what we can to stop the outbreak,” Hoie said. “If the virus mutation spreads in Oslo, it will be very difficult to prevent it from spreading to the rest of the country.”Having withstood the pandemic better than most in 2020, Norway managed to put a cap on higher infection rates after the Christmas holidays and has so far avoided the level of contagion seen in neighboring Sweden and Denmark. The new variant was detected on Friday in two nursing home residents in Nordre Follo bordering Oslo, with no known route of transmission.Under the new rules to take effect from midday on Saturday, grocery stores, chemists and gas stations will be allowed to remain open and funerals will be permitted. The measures are based on the assumption that the new variant is more infectious, but not necessarily more dangerous, the health minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-locks-down-oslo-area-to-fight-spread-of-new-covid-19-variant-101611399147131.html

And YouTube. That's how she spent her time," the girl's father Angelo Sicomero was quoted as saying in Saturday's Corriere della Sera newspaper.INVESTIGATIONProsecutors have opened an investigation into possible incitement to suicide and are looking to see whether someone invited the girl to take part in the challenge."The watchdog decided to intervene as a matter of urgency following the terrible case of the 10-year-old girl from Palermo," the authority said.It said TikTok was banned from "further processing user data for which there is no absolute certainty of age and, consequently, of compliance with the provisions related to the age requirement".An official said this meant that users of unverified accounts would no longer be able to upload videos or interact with other people on the platform.The watchdog said it had raised concerns with TikTok in December over what it called a series of violations, including allegations the firm had failed to protect minors.It added that it had told the authorities in Ireland about its decision because TikTok has announced that it would run its European operations out of Dublin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-tells-tiktok-to-block-users-after-death-of-young-girl-101611393661949.html

According to Canadian media outlets, Biden’s team has made it clear that the decision is “final”. CBC News reported that Biden stood by the decision and pointed out that he was fulfilling a campaign promise. A Canadian readout said Trudeau “underscored the important economic and energy security benefits of our bilateral energy relationship as well as his support for energy workers”.The readout added that the conversation, lasting nearly 30 minutes, was amicable and positive, and the two leaders have agreed to meet in person in February “in order to advance the important work of renewing the deep and enduring friendship between Canada and the United States”.Also on the agenda was the fate of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who have been in captivity for over two years in China in retaliation to the arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in 2018. The pandemic featured in the dialogue as they discussed working closely to defeat Covid-19 by responding to new variants and following expert advice, and “collaboration on vaccines”.There was also agreement on the environmental agenda as they agreed on the “urgent need for ambitious action on climate change”, reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement, and on working together on “net-zero emissions, zero-emissions vehicles, cross-border clean electricity transmission, and the Arctic”.Expanding cooperation with regard to continental defence and promoting diversity and inclusion also featured in the conversation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-phone-call-with-biden-trudeau-expresses-disappointment-over-us-stance-on-keystone-xl-pipeline-101611394130021.html
23-01-2021||World||UK doctors call for shorter gap between Pfizer vaccine doses||A group of British doctors have written to England's chief medical officer to tell him to cut the gap between doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine to six weeks from up to 12.Britain is prioritising giving first doses of Covid-19 vaccine, allowing up to 12 weeks before a second dose, to give the maximum number of people some initial protection.But Pfizer and BioNTech have warned they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose is given more than 21 days after the first.The British Medical Association (BMA) said in a statement emailed on Saturday that it has written to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England Chris Whitty.The BMA said it supports giving a second dose up to 42 days after the first dose, but that a longer gap is not in line with World Health Organization guidance.It therefore urged the CMO to "urgently review the UK's current position of second doses after 12 weeks"."The UK’s strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries," the BMA said."BMA members are also concerned that, given the unpredictability of supplies, there may not be any guarantees that second doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in 12 weeks’ time."Whitty told a media conference on Friday that the longer gap between doses was a "public health decision" aimed at vaccinating many more people and based on a belief that the great majority of protection comes from the first jab.Britain is using two vaccines, one from Pfizer and the other from AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca has supported the gap between its jabs, saying data showed an 8-12 week gap was a "sweet spot" for efficacy.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said in an emailed statement that its priority was to protect as many people as possible as quickly as possible."The decision...to change vaccine dosage intervals followed a thorough review of the data and was in line with the recommendations of the UK’s four chief medical officers," a DHSC spokeswoman said.Some 5.38 million people have been given a first dose of vaccine in the UK, government data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-doctors-call-for-shorter-gap-between-pfizer-vaccine-doses-101611392244909.html
23-01-2021||World||Russia arrests protesters demanding Alexei Navalny's release||Russian police are arresting protesters demanding the release of top Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at demonstrations in the country’s east and larger unsanctioned rallies are expected later Saturday in Moscow and other major cities.Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent and durable foe, was arrested on Jan. 17 when he returned to Moscow from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin.Authorities say his stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence in a criminal conviction in a case that Navalny says was illegitimate. He is to appear in court in early February to determine if he will serve the 3 1/2-year sentence in prison.The OVD-Info organization that monitors political detentions said at least 48 people were detained in cities including Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. Organizers in Vladivostok said about 3,000 people turned out for the protest there.Turnout is likely to be much larger for the afternoon protest planned in Moscow, which the city's mayor and other authorities have warned people against attending.Moscow police on Thursday arrested three top Navalny associates, two of whom were later jailed for periods of nine and 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-arrests-protesters-demanding-alexei-navalny-s-release-101611391206881.html

Rosen with a Justice Department lawyer who would help him force Georgia officials to overturn the state's election result, US media reported late Friday.The New York Times said Trump only decided against the move when told that all remaining top officials at the Justice Department would resign en masse if the plan went ahead.The news, also reported in the Washington Post, comes as Trump is set to face a Senate trial for "incitement of insurrection" over his role in whipping up supporters with unfounded claims of election fraud before they stormed the US Capitol in early January.Trump narrowly lost Georgia to Joe Biden in the November presidential election, in a vote he baselessly claimed was rigged.The reports describe Trump's increasing frustration with Rosen's refusal to wield the power of the Justice Department to interfere in the count.He and Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department lawyer who supported Trump's assertions that the election was stolen, allegedly came up with a plan to replace Rosen with Clark.But at a three-hour showdown involving the three men, which officials cited in the New York Times compared to an episode of Trump's reality show "The Apprentice," the then-president backed down after being told the move would prompt mass resignations.Clark categorically denied that he devised any plan to oust Rosen and said there were inaccuracies in the reporting.Trump, Rosen and the US Justice Department have not publicly responded to the allegations.In early January, a leaked audio tape in which Trump pressured Georgia's secretary of state to "find" enough votes to overturn the defeat sent shockwaves across Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-mulled-replacing-attorney-general-over-election-results-report-101611390879622.html
23-01-2021||World||Top Iran leader posts Trump-like image with drone, vows revenge||The website of Iran's Supreme Leader on Friday carried the image of a golfer resembling former President Donald Trump apparently being targeted by a drone alongside a threat of revenge over last year's killing of a top Iranian general in a U.S. drone attack.The image first appeared on a Persian-language Twitter feed that carried a link to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's website. Twitter took down that feed on Friday, saying it was fake.Underneath the website picture were remarks by Khamenei in December ahead of the first anniversary this month of the killing of military commander General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, which was ordered by Trump."Both the murderers and those who ordered it should know that revenge may come at any time," said the comments on top of the image, which showed the shadow of a drone looming over the lone golfer. Trump, who regularly plays golf, was not named.U.S.-Iran tensions grew rapidly after 2018, when Trump exited a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.Tehran retaliated for Soleimani's killing with missile strikes against U.S. targets in Iraq but the two sides backed away from further confrontation.High tension and risk of war appeared to subside with the end of Trump's term. His successor President Joe Biden, sworn in on Wednesday, has said Washington seeks to lengthen and strengthen the nuclear constraints on Iran through diplomacy.Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the Biden White House National Security Council, said "these kinds of threats from Iran are unacceptable.""We strongly condemn this provocative action. We will continue to work with our friends and partners to counter Iran’s malign influence," she said in response to a request for comment.The top Republican on the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, earlier urged the Biden administration "to respond quickly and forcefully to this provocative threat against a former president" and called on Twitter to immediately and permanently suspend Khamenei's account.An official close to Khamenei’s inner circle said: "The aim (of the tweet) was to remind the gambler (Trump) that leaving office does not mean he will be safe and the assassination of our martyr Soleimani will be forgotten.""And now, American troops cannot protect him,” the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters without elaborating.POWERFUL GENERALSoleimani, the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, was responsible for clandestine overseas operations and was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Khamenei.Iran's military and clerical rulers have said Tehran would choose the time and place of Soleimani's revenge.A Tehran-based analyst said the threat could be an end in itself: "The intention of the tweet seems to be keeping alive the spectre of revenge, which perhaps by itself is a kind of revenge."A Twitter spokeswoman said the @khamenei_site account was suspended for violating the company's platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically against the creation of fake accounts. Asked if the @khamenei_site account was fake, she said it was.Iranian officials were not immediately available to comment.The golfer image tweet was retweeted by Khamenei's main Persian-language account @Khamenei-fa, although it appeared to have been deleted later. The text and graphic of the tweet later carried by Khamenei's official website (farsi.khamenei.ir) was also widely quoted by Iranian media.Khamenei's @Khamenei_fa account and his main Twitter account in English, which did not carry the golfer image tweet, were still operational.Earlier this month, Twitter removed a tweet by Khamenei in which he said U.S.- and British-made vaccines were unreliable and may be intended to "contaminate other nations" for violating its rules against misinformation.Exiled rights activists renewed calls for Twitter to ban Khamenei. "I hope the world can see how they (Iranian officials) can use social media to promote violence," U.S.-based activist Massih Alinejad told Reuters.Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-iran-leader-posts-trump-like-image-with-drone-vows-revenge-101611389536864.html

The Chinese side never wrote such letters,” the Chinese embassy said in a statement posted on its website Saturday that cited an unnamed spokesperson. “We hope the media concerned respect the facts and report on Sino-US relations in an objective and responsible manner.”Both China and the US should focus on cooperation and manage their disputes in order to facilitate healthy and stable relations, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-embassy-refutes-report-it-s-seeking-meeting-with-the-us-101611390102986.html
23-01-2021||World||Joe Biden signs executive orders to boost economic relief for Americans||US President Joe Biden has signed a slew of executive orders, including a one to fix the country's economy which has been battered by the once-in-a-century public health crisis that has also left some 18 million Americans unemployed.On day three of his presidency, Biden announced 'The American Rescue Plan' that includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need and to boost economic relief for the people struggling during the coronavirus pandemic.“We are going to finish the job of getting a total of USD 2,000 in direct payments to folks, USD 600 which was already passed is simply not enough if you still have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table,” he said.“We cannot, will not let people go hungry. We cannot let people be evicted because of nothing they did themselves. … We have to act,” he said in remarks at the White House.Biden said under his rescue plan, the economy would return to full employment a year faster than without the plan.On January 15, while announcing the USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan to revive the US economy, Biden said that millions of Americans through no fault of their own have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck.Some 18 million Americans are still relying on unemployment insurance and nearly 400,000 small businesses have permanently closed their doors.“It's not just to meet the moral obligation to treat our fellow Americans with the dignity and respect they deserve, this is an economic imperative, a growing economic consensus that we must act decisively and boldly to grow the economy for all Americans not just for tomorrow but in the future,” Biden said.He also said that unemployment insurance benefits will be extended for millions of workers beyond the deadline that is now set. It means that millions of Americans who are currently relying on unemployment benefits while they look for work can count on these checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis.Biden said his plan also addresses the growing housing crisis in America.Approximately 14 million Americans have fallen behind on rent, and many risk eviction.“If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,” he said.Biden said that he has directed his administration to extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures. These crises are straining the budgets of states and cities, and tribal communities that are forced to consider layoffs and service reductions among essential workers, police officers, firefighters, first responders, nurses are all at the risk of losing their jobs.Over the last year, more than 600,000 educators have lost their jobs in cities and towns, he said.The American Rescue Plan would provide emergency funding to keep these essential workers on the job and maintain essential services. It will also help small businesses that are the engines of economic growth.“When you say small business, most people think the major corporate entities are the ones that hire everybody. These small businesses are the glue that holds, and they are important, but the small businesses hold the community the glue that holds these communities together,” he said.The recovery plan also calls for an increase in the minimum wage at least USD 15 an hour.“No one in America should work 40 hours a week, making below the poverty line; USD 15 gets people above the poverty line,” he said adding that the American Rescue Plan would lift 12 million Americans out of poverty and cut child poverty in half.“That is five million children lifted out of poverty. Our plan would reduce poverty in the black community by one-third and reduce poverty in the Hispanic community by almost 40 per cent,” he said.As a result of the pandemic, more than 10 million Americans are unemployed, 14 million renters are behind on payments, and 29 million adults - and at least 8 million children - are struggling with food insecurity, the White House said in a fact sheet. The US is the worst affected country from the pandemic with over 24,818,779 people hit with the coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signs-executive-orders-to-boost-economic-relief-for-americans-101611389011763.html
23-01-2021||World||Joe Biden administration to review US-Taliban agreement||The Joe Biden administration said on Saturday that it will review the US-Taliban agreement signed last year to assess whether the Taliban is delivering on its commitments to cut ties with terror groups and reduce violence in Afghanistan.The commitment, made by new US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan during a phone call to his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib, comes against the backdrop of concern across the region over a surge in violence and targeted assassinations blamed on the Taliban.Over the past few weeks, Afghan government officials, civil society activists and journalists have been targeted in bombings and attacks in Kabul and other cities across Afghanistan. On January 14, India had called for an immediate stop to the targeted attacks in Afghanistan and sought a comprehensive ceasefire to take forward efforts to usher in peace.Sullivan “underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort, which will aim to help the two sides achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent ceasefire,” said a readout from the US national security council.He also “made clear the United States’ intention to review the February 2020 US-Taliban agreement, including to assess whether the Taliban was living up to its commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders”, the readout said.Among the terror groups active in Afghanistan and having links with the Taliban are al-Qaeda and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). According to a UN report, there are some 6,500 Pakistani fighters active in Afghanistan.Sullivan told Mohib that the US is committed to the partnership with Afghanistan and to peace for all the people of the country. “He expressed America’s desire that all Afghan leaders embrace this historic opportunity for peace and stability,” the readout said.The two national security advisors also discussed US support for protecting the “extraordinary gains made by Afghan women, girls, and minority groups as part of the peace process”.India, the largest donor to Afghanistan in the region with pledges worth about $3 billion, has for long said it backs an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-supported peace process that leads to a solution which preserves the gains made over the past two decades.Sullivan also said the US is committed to consulting closely with the Afghan government, NATO allies and regional partners on a “collective strategy to support a stable, sovereign, and secure future for Afghanistan”.Mohin said on Twitter that he and Sullivan agreed to work for a “permanent ceasefire and a just and durable peace in a democratic Afghanistan, capable of preserving the gains of the past two decades, protecting the rights of all Afghans, and continuing the reforms”. The two sides, he said, will work closely on security, counter-terrorism and regional engagement.Also Read: US Prez Joe Biden respects successful ties with India: White HouseHe also cited Sullivan as saying that the US partnership with the Afghan government remains essential to US national security objectives.There was no word from the US and Afghan sides on the drawdown of American forces from Afghanistan. In keeping with former president Donald Trump’s directives, US force levels in Afghanistan are currently down to 2,500, a 19-year low.There were about 13,000 US troops in Afghanistan when the agreement with the Taliban was inked in Qatar on February 29 last year. The deal called for all American forces to leave the country by May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-to-review-us-taliban-agreement-101611388424857.html
23-01-2021||World||Biden administration launches inter-agency review of domestic extremism||The Biden administration has announced an inter-agency review of domestic extremism in the wake of the January 6 Capitol Hill attack by supporters of former president Donald Trump."The January 6 assault on the Capitol and the tragic deaths and destruction that occurred underscored what we have long known: The rise of domestic violent extremism is a serious and growing national security threat,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference on Friday. The Biden administration will confront this threat with the necessary resources and resolve, she said.The Capitol Hill riot, which temporarily halted the counting of Electoral College votes, left five people dead and led to Trump's second impeachment. Law enforcement agencies are under scrutiny for their preparations for January 6.“We are committed to developing policies and strategies based on facts, on objective and rigorous analysis, and on a respect for constitutionally protected free speech and political activities," Psaki said.The initial work on Domestic Violent Extremism (DVE) will broadly fall into three areas, she said.The first is a tasking from President Joe Biden sent to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) office requesting a comprehensive threat assessment, coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on domestic violent extremism.This assessment will draw on the analysis from across the government and, as appropriate, non-governmental organisations, Psaki said."The key point here is that we want fact-based analysis upon which we can shape policy. So this is really the first step in the process, and we'll rely on our appropriate law enforcement and intelligence officials to provide that analysis,” she said.The second will be the building of an National Security Council capability to focus on countering domestic violent extremism. As a part of this, the NSC will undertake a policy review effort to determine how the government can share information better about this threat, support efforts to prevent radicalisation, disrupt violent extremist networks, and more, she said.“There's important work already underway across the interagency in countering DVE, and we need to understand better its current extent and where there may be gaps to address, so we can determine the best path forward,” the White House press secretary said.Psaki said the third will be coordinating relevant parts of the federal government to enhance and accelerate efforts to address DVE."This considered, an NSC-convened process will focus on addressing evolving threats, radicalisation, the role of social media, opportunities to improve information sharing, operational responses, and more," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-launches-inter-agency-review-of-domestic-extremism-101611386508182.html
23-01-2021||World||North Korea sees talks as way to advance nuclear program, says US intel official||The top US intelligence officer for North Korea warned on Friday the country sees diplomacy only as a means to advance its nuclear weapons development, even as the new Biden administration says it will look for ways to bring Pyongyang back to talks.President Joe Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday the new administration planned a full review of the U.S. approach to North Korea to look at ways to increase pressure on it to return to the negotiating table.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated this on Friday, saying North Korea's nuclear weapons were a serious threat to peace and Washington had a vital interest in deterring Pyongyang.Sydney Seiler, the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank earlier that Pyongyang's weapons development had been a consistent policy for 30 years."Every engagement in diplomacy has been designed to further the nuclear program, not to find a way out... I just urge people not to let the tactical ambiguity obstruct the strategic clarity about North Korea that we have," he said."So we should not be overly encouraged if suddenly (North Korea leader Kim Jong Un) proposes dialogue tomorrow, nor should we be overly surprised, or discouraged, if there's an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launch by Sunday."Seiler also said humanitarian aid - which Blinken said the United States should look at providing to North Korea if needed - was not something of interest to Pyongyang.The force North Korea seeks to develop, while part aspirational and part years away, was far more than that needed by a country that simply wanted to be left alone, Seiler said, adding: "That is where the real risk of inaction comes in."On Tuesday, Blinken had spoken of the review plan in response to a question by Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who asked whether Blinken would, with the ultimate aim of North Korea denuclearizing, support a "phased agreement" that offered tailored sanctions relief to Pyongyang in return for a freeze in its weapons programs.Biden's top Asia official, Kurt Campbell, has said the administration must decide its approach quickly and not repeat an Obama-era delay that led to "provocative" steps by Pyongyang that prevented engagement.Campbell also had some praise for former President Donald Trump's unprecedented summits with Kim, although these made no progress in curtailing a North Korean nuclear weapons program that expanded in the meantime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-sees-talks-as-way-to-advance-nuclear-program-says-us-intel-official-101611384860133.html
23-01-2021||World||Wuhan returns to normal as world still battling pandemic||A year ago, a notice sent to smartphones in Wuhan at 2 a.m. announced the world's first coronavirus lockdown that would last 76 days.Early Saturday morning, residents in the central Chinese city where the virus was first detected were jogging and practicing tai chi in a fog-shrouded park beside the mighty Yangtze River.Life has largely returned to normal in the city of 11 million, even as the rest of the world grapples with the spread of the virus' more contagious variants.Efforts to vaccinate people for Covid-19 have been frustrated by disarray and limited supplies in some places. The scourge has killed over 2 million people worldwide.Traffic was light in Wuhan but there was no sign of the barriers that a year ago isolated neighborhoods, prevented movement around the city and confined people to their housing compounds and even apartments.Wuhan accounted for the bulk of China's 4,635 deaths from COVID-19, a number that has largely stayed static for months. The city has been largely free of further outbreaks since the lockdown was lifted on April 8, but questions persist as to where the virus originated and whether Wuhan and Chinese authorities acted fast enough and with sufficient transparency to allow the world to prepare for a pandemic that has sickened more than 98 million.China on Saturday announced another 107 cases, bringing its total to 88,911. Of those, the northern province of Heilongjiang accounted for the largest number at 56.Beijing and the eastern financial hub of Shanghai both reported three new cases amid mass testing and lockdowns of hospitals and housing units linked to recent outbreaks.Authorities are wary of a new surge surrounding next month's Lunar New Year holiday and are telling people not to travel and to avoid gatherings as much as possible. Schools are being let out a week early and many have already shifted to online classes.Mask wearing remains virtually universal indoors and on public transport. Mobile phone apps are used to trace people's movements and prove they are both virus-free and have not been to areas where suspected cases have been found.Wuhan has been praised for its sacrifice in the service of the nation, turning it into a sort of Stalingrad in China's war against the virus, commemorated in books, documentaries, TV shows and florid panegyrics from officials including head of state and leader of the Communist Party Xi Jinping.China has doggedly defended its actions in the early days of the outbreak, saying it helped buy time for the rest of the world while pushing fringe theories that the virus was brought to the city from outside China, possibly from a laboratory in the US.After months of negotiations, China finally gave permission last week for the World Health Organization to send a team of international experts to begin investigating the virus' origins. They are currently undergoing two weeks of quarantine.A panel of experts commissioned by the WHO criticized China and other countries this week for not moving to stem the initial outbreak earlier, prompting Beijing to concede it could have done better.Meanwhile, in Hong Kong in southern China, thousands of residents were locked down Saturday in an unprecedented move to contain a worsening outbreak in the city.Hong Kong has been grappling to contain a fresh wave of the coronavirus since November. Over 4,300 cases have been recorded in the last two months, making up nearly 40% of the city's total.Authorities said in a statement that an area comprising 16 buildings in the working-class Yau Tsim Mong district will be locked down until all residents have been tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-returns-to-normal-as-world-still-battling-pandemic-101611384373199.html
23-01-2021||World||Trump administration's lack of honesty in handling Covid-19 'very likely' cost lives: Fauci||Chief Medical Advisor to the US President, Anthony Fauci said that the lack of truthfulness from the previous President Donald Trump's administration pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic "very likely" cost American lives."Particularly when you're in the situation of almost being in a crisis with the number of cases and hospitalizations and deaths that we have -- when you start talking about things that make no sense medically and no sense scientifically, that clearly is not helpful," Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said in an interview to CNN.When asked if the lack of candour over the last year and lack of facts, in some cases, lead to over 400,000 people dead from Covid-19, Fauci said, "You know, it very likely did."Fauci said that it's "not helpful" when "you're starting to go down paths that are not based on any science at all," adding that he doesn't wish to rehash the ways in which the Trump administration steered away from science.The Biden administration's approach to handling the Covid-19 pandemic will be "completely transparent, open and honest" with the American people, said Fauci on Thursday."If things go wrong, not point fingers but to correct them. And to make everything we do be based on science and evidence," he told reportersCNN reported that Fauci said that it was "uncomfortable" when things like hydroxychloroquine were promoted as treatments for Covid-19 when they weren't based on fact and that he takes "no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the President."The medical advisor to Biden said that it is a "liberating feeling" to now be able to "talk about what you know, what the evidence, what the science is," without fear of repercussions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-s-lack-of-honesty-in-handling-covid-19-very-likely-cost-lives-fauci-101611383572186.html
23-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s impeachment trial to start on February 9||The US Senate will put former President Donald Trump on impeachment trial on February 9 after a two-week delay agreed upon by Democratic and Republican leaders on Friday.The Democratic-led House of Representatives will convey the article of impeachment to the Senate, also controlled by Democrats now, on Monday at 7pm, as announced earlier on Friday. Impeachment managers, members of the House selected to argue for Trump’s conviction by the Senate, will be sworn in on Tuesday as prosecutors, as will be all the 100 Senators in their role as jurors.The delay will allow the Senate to confirm President Joe Biden’s cabinet nominees, something that he publicly called for on Friday. “The more time we have to get up and running to meet these crises, the better,” Biden told reporters. Republicans had wanted more time as well - three weeks, actually - for Trump to put together his defence team, which he has just started by hiring a lawyer.“The January 6th insurrection at the Capitol incited by Donald J. Trump was a day none of us will ever forget,” Chuck Schumer, the Democrat who heads the Senate as majority leader, said on the floor of the upper chamber. “We all want to put this awful chapter in our nation’s history behind us. But healing and unity will only come if there is truth and accountability, and that is what this trial will provide.”Republicans welcomed the deal as a “win for due process and fairness”.Trump was impeached on the charge of “incitement of insurrection” by the House of Representatives last week in a bipartisan vote. Ten Republicans had joined Democrats to deliver him a historic rebuke over a riot at the US Capitol. On January 6, Trump’s supporters had stormed the Capitol building to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election win.Trump became thus the first American president to be impeached twice - the first was in December 2019. He is also the first US president to face impeachment trial after leaving office.Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate in February 2020 after he was first impeachment in 2019. This time, however, Republicans feel less inclined to protect him. They are appalled by the attack he incited on the seat of US democracy and want to use the outrage to cleanse the party of his toxic influence.“Mitch said to me he wants Trump gone,” a Republican member of Congress told CNN, referring to Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a one-time Trump ally. “It is in his political interest to have him gone. It is in the GOP’s interest to have him gone. The question is, do we get there?”Republicans hold the key to Trump’s conviction or acquittal. In an evenly divided Senate, 17 of them will have to vote with the 50 Democrats to convict Trump. Only a majority of two-third in the Senate can convict a president - or a former president, as it is in this case.If Trump were still in office, a conviction in the impeachment trial would have terminated his presidency and led to his ouster from the White House.

23-01-2021||World||Thousands of Hong Kongers locked down to contain coronavirus||Thousands of Hong Kong residents were locked down Saturday in an unprecedented move to contain a worsening outbreak in the city, authorities said.Hong Kong has been grappling to contain a fresh wave of the coronavirus since November. Over 4,300 cases have been recorded in the last two months, making up nearly 40% of the city’s total.Coronavirus cases in Hong Kong’s Yau Tsim Mong district – a working-class neighborhood with old buildings and subdivided flats – made up about half of the infections in the past week.Sewage testing in the area picked up more concentrated traces of the Covid-19 virus, prompting concerns that poorly built plumbing systems and a lack of ventilation in subdivided units may present a possible path for the virus to spread.Authorities said in a statement Saturday that an area comprising 16 buildings in Yau Tsim Mong will be locked down until all residents have undergone tests. Residents will not be allowed to leave their homes until they have received their test results to prevent cross-infection.“Persons subject to compulsory testing are required to stay in their premises until all such persons identified in the area have undergone testing and the test results are mostly ascertained,” the government said in a statement.Hong Kong has previously avoided lockdowns in the city during the pandemic, with leader Carrie Lam stating in July last year that authorities will avoid taking such “extreme measures” unless it had no other choice.The restrictions, which were announced at 4 a.m. in Hong Kong, are expected to end within 48 hours, the government said.It appealed to employers to exercise discretion and avoid docking the salary of employees who have been affected by the restrictions and may not be able to go to work.Hong Kong has seen a total of 9,929 infections in the city, with 168 deaths recorded as of Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-hong-kongers-locked-down-to-contain-coronavirus-101611366193444.html
23-01-2021||World||China adopts law letting coast guard fire on foreign vessels||China’s passed a controversial law that gives the coast guard more freedom to fire on foreign vessels, a move that could fuel the risk of military miscalculation in the Western Pacific.The law is aimed at “safeguarding national sovereignty, security and maritime rights,” the official Xinhua News Agency said in a report early Saturday. The law will take effect from Feb. 1.The China Coast Guard would be allowed to take “all necessary means,” including the use of weapons, to stop or prevent threats from foreign vessels, according to the text released by Xinhua. Coast guard personnel will be permitted to board and inspect foreign ships operating in China’s “jurisdictional waters,” a term covering areas claimed by other countries.The move could raise the risk of miscalculation in the vast areas of disputed waters that stretch out from China’s coast. Chinese coast guard ships often come into close contact -- sometimes engaging in tense standoffs -- with foreign vessels, as they assert Beijing’s claims to much of the South and East China seas.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing Friday in Beijing that the move was a “normal legislative activity of the NPC” and that China “will remain committed to upholding peace and stability in the sea.”Claims to the resource-rich waters of the South China Sea have put China at odds with Southeast Asia neighbors including Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In East China Sea, Chinese and Japanese government vessels routinely tail each other on patrols near uninhabited islands claimed by both sides.Earlier this week, Japanese diplomats in a conference call with Chinese counterparts expressed strong opposition to repeated incursions the country’s vessels near the disputed Senkaku Islands, which are known as the Diaoyus in China. The Chinese delegates urged the two sides to work to make the area a “sea of peace, cooperation and friendship,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said.The law is China’s latest step to empower its coast guard, which was created in 2013 by merging several maritime agencies and incorporated in the People’s Armed Police in 2018. The fleet has increased its presence in disputed waters recently, including a stand-off with Vietnam in the South China Sea’s Vanguard Bank in 2019.The move could also prompt other nations to bolster their military presence in the waters, including the U.S. Then-National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said last year that the U.S. Coast Guard was looking to expand its presence in the Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adopts-law-letting-coast-guard-fire-on-foreign-vessels-101611366206382.html
23-01-2021||World||Biden, Trudeau to meet next month, collaborate on vaccines, medical supplies||Canada's Justin Trudeau and US President Joe Biden agreed to meet next month, the prime minister's office said on Friday, following a call between the two leaders in which they vowed to join forces to combat coronavirus in North America.Trudeau, who has been keen to embrace the new president and move on from the often tumultuous Donald Trump years, was the first foreign leader to speak with Biden since Wednesday's inauguration.The two "recognized that both countries’ fundamental priority is to end the global Covid-19 pandemic," Trudeau's office said in a statement. They also discussed collaboration on vaccines.It is not clear whether the meeting next month will be face to face or virtual, said a Canadian government source who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.The White House said the two leaders highlighted the "strategic importance of the U.S.-Canada relationship" and discussed cooperation on a wide-ranging agenda including combating Covid-19."It was a very positive call," the Canadian source said. "Biden really has a fondness for Canada. He understands that we are a partner and ally of the United States, which is a marked change from the last four years."Trudeau and Biden have stressed the need to do more to fight climate change and "they spent quite a about of time talking about that," the source added.Trudeau, the source said, raised two contentious topics - Biden's move to scrap a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the United States and his proposal to introduce a "Buy America" policy that would shut out Canadian firms from lucrative U.S. government projects.The two neighbors, with one of the world's largest bilateral trading relationships, have highly integrated economies, and Canada fears "Buy America" could hurt badly.Trudeau "made the point that we should avoid unintended consequences that can hurt both countries," said the source.Trudeau reiterated Canada's disappointment about the pipeline but did not try to change Biden's mind, the source said. Scrapping the project had been one of the Democrat's campaign commitments.The White House statement said Biden acknowledged Trudeau’s disappointment. Pipeline builder TC Energy Corp said it would eliminate more than 1,000 construction jobs in coming weeks due to the cancellation.The two leaders also agreed to expand cooperation on continental defense and in the Arctic, and said their respective top defense and foreign affairs would be meet at the earliest opportunity, the Canadian statement said.Trudeau urged Biden to remove duties against Canadian exports of softwood lumber, which U.S. industry has long protested are excessively subsidized. The two nations have been arguing over the exports for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-trudeau-to-meet-next-month-collaborate-on-vaccines-medical-supplies-101611376232106.html
23-01-2021||World||Denmark suspends Dubai flights amid doubts over virus tests||Denmark has temporarily suspended all flights from the United Arab Emirates for five days after suspicion arose that the coronavirus tests that can be obtained before leaving Dubai are not reliable, authorities announced Friday.The development, which comes amid a surge of infections in the UAE, poses a direct challenge to the mass testing regime that had been the pillar of the country's coronavirus response and economic reopening. Dubai was one of the world’s first destinations to open up to tourists, welcoming visitors from anywhere with only a coronavirus test.Danish Transport Minister Benny Engelbrecht said the decision was made to allow the matter to be thoroughly investigated and ensure that the testing are being carried out properly.“We can’t ignore such a suspicion,” Engelbrecht said, adding that the ban entered into force on Thursday night.Danish authorities faced a “concrete and serious citizen inquiry into" how the tests are carried out at Dubai entry and exit points, he said, and “therefore we need to be absolutely sure that there are no problems.”Engelbrecht said at least “one citizen” brought the South African variant of the virus “back from Dubai." He did not identify further that person. Dubai has seen an increase in the number of South African residents as the country's economy deteriorated in recent years.Danish tabloid Ekstra Bladet said Friday there has been a second report of allegedly sloppy virus testing in Dubai, and cited Engelbrecht as saying “the information seem precise and valid.”Since Jan. 9, Denmark has required that all passengers arriving in the Scandinavian country have a negative coronavirus test or proof that they have recently had Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, to limit the spread of the virus.In response to the move, UAE’s state-run WAM news agency carried a statement from a Foreign Ministry official stressing “that all accredited UAE testing centers are regularly subject to strict quality checks.”Emirati authorities were currently communicating with their Danish counterparts to clarify the reasons behind suspicions surrounding the virus testing, the statement added, noting the government imposed tough penalties for violations of international testing standards.On Jan. 8, Denmark’s Foreign Ministry advised against all travel abroad, including business travel. On Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told local media that “there is a reason why we really ask everyone not to travel. It’s really important that everyone listens."“There is a risk of bringing (virus) mutations to Denmark," she said. “It can undermine our epidemic control and thus infect others and what is worse.”In recent days, several Danish celebrities, socialites and influencers — such as former boxer Mikkel Kessler, former football international Nicklas Bendtner and table tennis ace Michael Maze — have traveled to Dubai and posted photos of themselves on social media.Lea Hvidt Kessler, the wife of the former super-middleweight world champion, wrote on Instagram that no one in their family that traveled to Dubai before Christmas was infected. According to media in Denmark, there are currently 85 Danish nationals there and about 800 permanent Danish residents in Dubai.On Friday, as the UAE shattered its 11th consecutive daily infection record with 3,552 new cases, Dubai's state-run media office announced strict new limits on weddings, social events and private parties beginning next Wednesday, restricting all gatherings to 10 immediate family members. Wedding parties at hotels and other venues previously had been capped at 200.The same day, Dubai ordered all gyms and restaurants to increase the physical space between trainees and diners. The city also put an immediate halt to all “entertainment activities” on boats and floating restaurants — a popular pastime in the city. Tourists and celebrities often flaunt their vacations on social media, posting photos of raucous, Champagne-soaked yacht parties that have splashed across tabloids in recent weeks. A day earlier, Dubai suspended all live bands and performances at nightclubs and bars in the city after hospitals were forced to pause non-urgent surgeries to deal with an influx of new Covid-19 patients.Tourists have flocked to Dubai in recent weeks despite the raging pandemic, escaping lockdowns back home. The glimmering city-state, with an economy largely built on tourism, aviation and retail, has promoted itself as an ideal pandemic vacation spot. Aside from the ubiquitous masks and hand sanitizer dispensers, a sense of pre-pandemic normalcy prevails in the crowded bars, massive malls and luxury hotels.Skyrocketing daily infections, which nearly tripled since November, failed to dent the normalcy even as more contagious variants of the coronavirus raced around the globe. The United Kingdom, which like Denmark sent droves of reality TV and sports stars to Dubai, closed its travel corridor with the UAE earlier this month.Since the start of the pandemic, the UAE has built its coronavirus response on an “early detection strategy," using Chinese-made coronavirus test kits to embark on one of the world's best testing campaigns at a time when other countries were struggling to obtain and administer PCR tests. As of Friday, the country of roughly 9 million had conducted some 24.2 million coronavirus tests.The U.S. State Department previously raised concerns that Chinese testing material was not accurate, without providing evidence about the allegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-suspends-dubai-flights-amid-doubts-over-virus-tests-101611375578791.html
23-01-2021||World||Trial ahead, Trump turns to ethics lawyer for his defense||Butch Bowers is used to defending public officials in ethics cases. But he's never faced anything quite like this.It's up to Bowers, a South Carolina elections and ethics lawyer, to rise and defend Donald Trump as the Senate soon plunges into an impeachment trial unlike any other, centered on accusations that the former president incited the mob that rampaged through the US Capitol on Jan. 6. For Trump, the first president twice impeached, the stakes are enormous: If convicted, he could be barred from holding public office again, ending any hopes of mounting another White House bid in 2024.Trump turned to Bowers, a familiar figure in Republican legal circles, after other legal allies passed on the case. That's a notable departure from his first impeachment trial in 2020, when he had a stable of prominent attorneys — including Alan Dershowitz, Jay Sekulow, who represented him in the Russia investigation, and Kenneth Starr — standing in his corner.The first impeachment trial turned on charges that Trump improperly solicited Ukraine’s help for his reelection campaign. The Senate acquitted him of those charges. The new trial could hinge on broader issues of law, including “whether the Constitution even allows a post-impeachment action in the Senate,” said Sekulow, who is not participating in Trump’s legal defense.Sekulow said he did not expect Bowers, who has years of experience representing elected officials and political candidates — including former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford against a failed impeachment effort that morphed into an ethics probe — to be hindered by having never defended a current or former president in a Senate trial.“He’s an excellent lawyer with a tremendous reputation who understands the law and politics,” Sekulow said Friday.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham recommended Bowers to Trump and told Fox News he sees him as the “anchor tenant” of Trump’s team. Trump adviser Jason Miller, who also ran Sanford’s gubernatorial and congressional campaigns, said Bowers “will do an excellent job defending President Trump.”Bowers did not respond to a message seeking comment.His strategy for Trump's defense is unclear, though questioning the validity of the trial is a clear option. Many Republicans in the Senate — the jurors he'll need to persuade — have said they harbor doubts about whether an impeachment trial for an ex-official is constitutional, even though it has happened before.The nine House managers prosecuting the case, meanwhile, will almost certainly focus on linking Trump’s remarks to supporters at a rally before the riot — including encouraging them to “fight like hell” — to the chaos that soon followed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday, triggering the first phase of the trial.Opening arguments will begin the week of Feb. 8. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced the schedule Friday evening after reaching an agreement with Republicans, who had pushed to delay the trial to give Trump a chance to organize his legal team and prepare a defense.Though perhaps nothing compares to the legal and political swirl of a Senate impeachment trial, Bowers does have experience both in Washington and in steering elected leaders through the fray.He has served as counsel to Sanford and another former governor, Nikki Haley, guiding her through an investigation into whether she had violated state ethics law.An ethics panel ultimately cleared Haley. Rob Godfrey, a longtime Haley adviser who worked closely with Bowers during his representation of the governor, said the lawyer “works hard, has an eye for detail and knows the law.”Bowers worked for Sanford when state lawmakers mulled impeaching him after revelations Sanford had disappeared from the state, leaving no chain of command for five days, to see his lover in Argentina in 2009. The effort never made it out of committee.Ensuing investigations by The Associated Press into Sanford’s other trips showed he had traveled on commercial airlines in high-priced seats despite the state’s low-cost travel rules and had used state planes for personal and political trips.At the time, Bowers predicted that the governor would be cleared, saying the charges were non-criminal and “limited to minor, technical matters.” Sanford went on to pay the largest ethics fine in state history — $74,000 — as well as nearly $37,000 to cover the costs of the investigation.Joel Sawyer, Sanford’s longtime spokesman, said Bowers’ strengths lie in his calm demeanor and determination to examine legal arguments without concern for pomp and politics.“If Donald Trump lets Butch be Butch and doesn’t try to make him be someone he’s not, in terms of making nutty legal arguments and seeking out television cameras, this will be a great fit for Butch,” Sawyer said. “If Trump wants him to be Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell 2.0, that’s not going to turn out well for anyone.”Bowers represented Gov. Henry McMaster — a close ally of Trump — in a fight over excessive contributions, a 2016 case that ended with the then-lieutenant governor agreeing to pay more than $70,000 in fines and reimbursements. Bowers and McMaster, a longtime fixture in South Carolina’s GOP politics, also at one time shared office space.Bowers was also a lawyer for former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and the South Carolina Election Commission in litigation over voter ID laws, as well as a former South Carolina sheriff who pleaded guilty to embezzlement and misconduct in office. In 2018, he was attorney for University of South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley in her successful defamation suit against Missouri’s athletics director.Bowers served as a special counsel on voting matters at the US Department of Justice under President George W. Bush, was Florida legal counsel for John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign and chaired the South Carolina Election Commission from 2004 to 2007. With degrees from the University of South Carolina and College of Charleston, Bowers graduated from Tulane University School of Law in 1998.State Sen. Dick Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman and longtime friend of President Joe Biden who has several times faced Bowers in court, said he expected the “understated” Bowers — also a colonel in the South Carolina Air National Guard — to make decisions in the case based not on personality, what Harpootlian said was in contrast to Trump’s past lawyers.“Trump won't be able to make Butch someone that he’s not,” Harpootlian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-ahead-trump-turns-to-ethics-lawyer-for-his-defense-101611371842953.html
23-01-2021||World||Biden's early approach to virus: Underpromise, overdeliver||It's a proven political strategy: Underpromise and overdeliver.President Joe Biden, in his first three days in office, has painted a bleak picture of the country's immediate future, warning Americans that it will take months, not weeks, to reorient a nation facing a historic convergence of crises.The dire language is meant as a call to action, but it's also a deliberate effort to temper expectations. In addition, it is an explicit rejection of President Donald Trump’s tack of talking down the coronavirus pandemic and its economic toll.Chris Lu, a longtime Obama administration official, said the grim tone is aimed at “restoring trust in government” that eroded during the Trump administration.“If you’re trying to get people to believe in this whole system of vaccinations, and if you want people to take seriously mask mandates, your leaders have to level with the American people,” he said.Biden said Thursday that “things are going to continue to get worse before they get better” and offered “the brutal truth” that it will take eight months before a majority of Americans will be vaccinated.On Friday, he declared outright: “There’s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months.”It's all part of Biden's pledge that his administration will "always be honest and transparent with you, about both the good news and the bad.”That approach, aides say, explains Biden’s decision to set clear and achievable goals for his new administration. The measured approach is drawing praise in some corners for being realistic -— but criticism from others for its caution.Trump often dismissed the seriousness of the virus and even acknowledged to journalist Bob Woodward that he deliberately played down the threat to the U.S. to prop up the economy. Even as death tolls and infection rates soared, Trump insisted the country was already “rounding the turn.”Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Biden’s pledge for 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office might fall short of what’s needed to turn the tide on the virus.“Maybe they’re picking a number that’s easier to achieve, rather than the number that we need to achieve. I would urge people to be bolder than that,” he said.Adalja argued that the goal they’ve set “should be the bare minimum that we accept.” But he also acknowledged that there’s a major political risk in overpromising.“You don’t want people to be discouraged or feel like the government is incompetent” if they fail to meet a goal, he said.“It’s a disappointingly low bar,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.Biden on Friday acknowledged the criticism, saying he was hopeful for more vaccinations, but he avoided putting down a marker that could potentially fall out of reach.“I found it fascinating that yesterday the press asked the question, ‘Is 100 million enough?'" he said in the State Dining Room. "A week before, they were saying, ‘Biden, are you crazy? You can’t do 100 million in 100 days.’ Well, we’re — God willing — not only going to 100 million. We’re going to do more than that.”In fact, while there was some skepticism when Biden first announced the goal on Dec. 8, it was generally seen as optimistic but within reach.The Biden administration might be taking lessons from the earliest days of the Obama administration, when there was constant pressure to show real progress in turning around the economy during the financial crisis.One former Obama administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak freely about internal conversations, said there was a fevered effort during the first few months of Obama's first term to play down the focus on evaluating the president’s success within his first 100 days because aides knew the financial recovery would take far longer than that.In one notable misstep, Obama’s National Economic Council chair, Christina Romer, predicted that unemployment wouldn’t top 8% if Congress passed the administration’s stimulus package to address the financial crisis. It was signed into law a month into Obama's first term, but by the end of that year, unemployment nevertheless hit 10%.The risk in setting too rosy expectations is that an administration might become defined by its failure to meet them. President George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech in 2003 — at a time when the Iraq War was far from over — became a defining blunder of his presidency.Trump provided an overreach of his own in May 2020, when he said the nation had “prevailed” over the virus. At the time, the country had seen about 80,000 deaths from the virus. This week, the U.S. death toll topped 412,000.Trump’s lax approach and lack of credibility contributed to poor adherence to public safety rules among the American public.Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Trump’s handling of the virus caused so much damage to public perceptions of its severity that it’s important for Biden to set a contrasting tone.“I think it is really important to start telling the American people the truth. And that has not happened in a year, since we found the first case of coronavirus, so he’s got a lot of damage to undo,” she said.“This is a very serious, very contagious, deadly disease, and anything other than that message — delivered over and over again — is, unfortunately, adding to the willingness of lots of people to pay no attention to how to stop the spread of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-early-approach-to-virus-underpromise-overdeliver-101611370991863.html
23-01-2021||World||Biden speaks to leaders of Mexico and Canada on trade, migration||President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of Canada and Mexico on Friday, his first calls with foreign counterparts since his inauguration this week.In a nod to continental cooperation, Biden’s first conversation was with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Biden and Trudeau, according to the Canadian government’s account of their phone call, agreed to meet next month.In a Twitter post and in a statement on Friday night, Lopez Obrador, who is known as AMLO, described his conversation with Biden as cordial, and said they discussed migration and Covid-19.Trudeau and Biden, the Canadian government said, talked chiefly about issues where they see the possibility of mutual cooperation, including climate change, the response to the coronavirus pandemic, the broader trading relationship of their countries and rising tensions with China.They also discussed the detention of two Canadian citizens in China.But Trudeau also raised his disappointment over Biden’s decision to rescind a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a major Canadian project that would’ve brought more than 800,000 barrels of oil from the western province of Alberta to Nebraska and onward to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast.The White House had no immediate comment on the calls.Both Trudeau and Lopez Obrador have had clashes with Donald Trump, who sought a rewrite of North American free trade rules, slapped tariffs on each country and threatened to impose more. The countries ultimately reached a deal on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, a relatively modest rewrite of its predecessor, known as Nafta.Biden has sought to largely reverse Trump’s foreign policy, including by rejoining the Paris agreement on climate change and reversing an exit from the World Health Organization. He has also halted some of Trump’s immigration overhauls and construction of the wall on the Mexican border, and proposed a comprehensive rewrite of immigration policy, though there’s little early appetite in Congress to adopt it.The fate of the Keystone pipeline, however, has complicated the Ottawa-Washington relationship for Trudeau. While Biden has already begun fulfilling a campaign promise to strengthen environmental regulations in the US, the prime minister is now facing pressure domestically to stand up to Canada’s largest trading partner.Biden has also pledged to maintain and even expand so-called “Buy American” measures that have historically triggered trade disputes with Canada and Mexico. Speaking Friday at the White House about changes to federal contracting rules, Biden said he was “going to make sure that they buy American and are made in America.”Biden and Trudeau discussed the “Buy American” plan and the US president promised to work with Canada on the issue, according to a Canadian official.The White House has also hinted that it’s considering seeking changes to the Trans Pacific Partnership, an 11-nation Asia-Pacific trade deal meant as a counterweight to China’s economic clout. Trump pulled the US out of the accord, but it survived and Canada and Mexico remain in it.Biden believes the TPP “wasn’t perfect and believes we need to make it stronger and better,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday, though she added that Biden won’t be focused on that in the “coming months.” If the US seeks changes to the deal in order to join, that could send the countries back to the bargaining table after the raucous USMCA talks with Trump.Mexico is the top trade partner with the US, while Canada is the third-largest, and the largest buyer of US exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-speaks-to-leaders-of-mexico-and-canada-on-trade-migration-101611369489635.html
23-01-2021||World||Texas files first major lawsuit against Biden administration||Texas sued the US government for ordering a temporary halt to most deportations of undocumented immigrants, the first major lawsuit challenging President Joe Biden’s policies just two days into his term and a likely sign of what’s to come from other Republican-led states.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton claims the directive breaches a deal reached between the state and the Department of Homeland Security less than two weeks before the end of the Trump administration, under which DHS agreed to consult with Texas before making any changes to deportation regulations. The changes amounts to “blanket amnesty,” Paxton claims.US District Judge Drew Tipton in Victoria, Texas, heard arguments Friday on the state’s request for a temporary restraining order against the plan while the case proceeds. Tipton, a Donald Trump appointee, said he’d issue a decision later.Paxton, a staunch Trump ally, blasted the federal government’s plan, saying it would harm Texas by preventing the state from deporting undocumented immigrants.“On its first day in office, the Biden Administration cast aside congressionally enacted immigration laws and suspended the removal of illegal aliens whose removal is compelled by those very laws,” Paxton said in the complaint. “In doing so, it ignored basic constitutional principles and violated its written pledge to work cooperatively with the State of Texas to address shared immigration enforcement concerns.”Partisan ClashThe suit highlights the clash between Biden’s pledge to reverse Trump’s efforts to clamp down on people in the US illegally and Republicans who want to continue those policies. Biden plans to eventually offer a path to citizenship to the almost 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, which will likely trigger additional litigation.“Texas is asking to run federal immigration law,” Adam Kirschner, a Justice Department lawyer, told the judge. The lawyer added that Texas is effectively arguing the Biden administration can’t do what it wants “because the last administration -- 12 days before it left office -- gave us the veto.”The lawsuit is the latest sign of the ongoing polarization of state attorneys general, said Douglas Gansler, a Democrat who was attorney general of Maryland from 2007 to 2015 and elected president of the National Association of Attorneys General in 2012.“The Republican attorneys general brought many cases against the Obama Administration, often around the Affordable Care Act, and then the Democratic attorneys general brought many cases against the Trump Administration -- this is unfortunately likely to be the first salvo of cases against the Biden Administration,” said Gansler, now a litigator at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP in Washington.Paxton, who is under federal investigation for bribery and abuse of power allegations made by former aides, led a failed legal challenge by Republican attorneys general that sought to prevent Biden from taking office based on bogus allegations of election fraud. In his new lawsuit, the Texas official claims the current administration is failing to remove immigrants even after they’ve had “full and fair” hearings.“The Constitution, controlling statutes, and prior Executive pledges prevent a seismic change to this country’s immigration laws merely by memorandum,” Paxton said in the suit.The Department of Homeland Security’s press office declined to comment and referred questions to the White House. The White House didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.The case is State of Texas v. US, 6:21-cv-00003, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas (Victoria).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-files-first-major-lawsuit-against-biden-administration-101611366277385.html
23-01-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden respects successful ties with India: White House||The leadership of India and the US have reaffirmed their commitment to continue and strengthen the bilateral partnership, with a White House spokesperson saying President Joe Biden “respects and values” the “long, bipartisan, successful” ties between leaders of the two sides.Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken once since the American leader’s election last November, and could again soon as the president begins calling counterparts in allied and partner countries. Biden will start making these calls on Friday, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau being the first.Biden, who has visited India many times, “respects and values the long, bipartisan, successful relationship between leaders in India and the US” and “looks forward to a continuation of that”, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said at the daily news briefing on Thursday.As proof of Biden’s support for the ties, Psaki brought up vice president Kamala Harris: “Obviously, he selected...the first Indian American to serve as president or vice president, certainly a historic moment for all of us in this country, but further, you know, cementing of the importance of our relationship.”Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, came to the US from Chennai, and her father, Donald Harris, from Jamaica.In New Delhi, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the Indian side will continue to engage the US administration to build on ties and tackle global challenges.Policymakers and experts in the US and India are eager to know its approach to India. Republican senator Mitt Romney asked Antony Blinken, the nominee for secretary of state, about it at a confirmation hearing by the Senate foreign relations committee on Tuesday.Blinken said given all that was done by previous administration, “one area I think that has a lot of promise, and maybe even necessity, is actually climate”. He added, “At the current rate, India is poised... to catch up to China in terms of the emissions.”India using pharma to help others: US bureauThe Joe Biden-led US government has applauded India for sending supplies of Covid-19 vaccine to a host of South Asian nations. “India’s a true friend using its pharma to help the global community,” the US State Department’s account for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs tweeted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-respects-successful-ties-with-india-white-house-101611365409953.html
23-01-2021||World||Pride and caution in Wuhan on lockdown anniversary||Exactly one year after it thrust the word "lockdown" into the global conversation, Wuhan passes the anniversary on Saturday with a mix of pride at recovering from the coronavirus and caution over a possible relapse.A year ago Saturday, Wuhan shocked the world by ordering 11 million anxious citizens be confined at home, beginning a traumatic 76-day lockdown that underscored the growing threat of a then-mysterious pathogen emanating from the city.One by one, adjacent metropolises in hard-hit Hubei province quickly followed suit, as did cities and entire countries worldwide as Covid-19 went global.But while the world's pandemic struggles continue, Wuhan today is nothing like that locked-down ghost town of a year ago, with traffic humming, sidewalks bustling, and citizens packing public transport and parks.Yet anxiety lurks below the surface as localised clusters multiply across China, reviving memories of the city's ordeal.They remain vivid for Huang Genben, 76, who spent 67 days in hospital fighting Covid-19 last year, spitting up blood and expecting to die."When I closed my eyes at night I didn't know if I would open them again," Huang told AFP.Like many Chinese, he expresses pride at the "great efforts" made by the Beijing government and citizens to contain the pandemic, exemplified by hard-hit Wuhan.The virus has killed at least two million people globally and continues to spread, but in China less than 5,000 deaths have been reported by authorities, the vast majority coming in Wuhan at the pandemic's outset.And the city's relaxed scenes -- elderly dancers spinning in parks and crowded bars selling "Wuhan Stay Strong" craft beer -- contrast with the rolling lockdowns, surging death rates and overwhelmed hospitals overseas.'I feel pain'"We can tell from the results that the policy of the government was correct, the cooperation of (Wuhan) citizens was correct. I feel pain seeing the epidemic all over the world," Huang said.The government has pushed an official propaganda narrative -- starring Wuhan -- focusing on a "heroic" Chinese response and recovery.But there are no known lockdown commemorations planned Saturday by Beijing, which remains tight-lipped on the pandemic's early days amid accusations it covered it up or mishandled the outbreak, allowing it to spread.The virus is generally believed to have spread outward from a Wuhan wet market where exotic animals were sold as food.But China has otherwise released little information on its origins, fuelling calls in the west for more transparency.The lockdown anniversary comes with World Health Organization experts just days from completing a two-week quarantine in Wuhan before launching a planned investigation into the coronavirus's origins.The WHO said Friday it was too early to draw any conclusions as to whether the pandemic started in China."All hypotheses are on the table," said WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan.While other nations, notably the United States, have dithered on their coronavirus response, Wuhan shut down completely, plunging its economy into recession.State media reports -- and activity on the streets -- attest to an impressive recovery, but some say it remains incomplete and many residents voice wariness of a viral resurgence.Xu Jiajun, a 58-year-old street vendor of local foods, drinks, and other items, said times remain tough."The situation is not good. I don't have a stable income like I did before. Things have changed," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pride-and-caution-in-wuhan-on-lockdown-anniversary-101611362069308.html
23-01-2021||World||Nuclear powers stay out of first nuke ban treaty||Agencies﻿The first ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons came into force on Friday without the support of the nine countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons - the US, the UK, Russia, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel.The 30-nation Nato alliance is also not backing the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which is now part of international law and seen as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons.Its entry into force culminates a decades-long campaign aimed at preventing a repetition of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. But getting all nations to ratify the treaty requiring them to never own such weapons seems daunting, if not impossible, in the current global climate. When the treaty was approved by the UN General Assembly in July 2017, more than 120 nations approved it.The following summer, India and some other countries explained their decision. India said the TPNW mechanism may not include scope for verification, and that it believed a single multilateral form already exists to discuss disarmament.Japan, the world’s only country to suffer nuclear attacks, also does not support the treaty, even though the aged survivors of the bombings in 1945 strongly push for it to do so.Japan on its own renounces use and possession of nuclear weapons, but the government has said pursuing a treaty ban is not realistic with nuclear and non-nuclear states so sharply divided over it.Nonetheless, Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize-winning coalition whose work helped spearhead the treaty, called it “a really big day for international law, for the United Nations and for survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki”. The treaty received its 50th ratification on October 24 last year, triggering a 90-day period before its entry into force.Fihn told AP that 61 countries ratified the treaty, and “from Friday, nuclear weapons will be banned by international law” in all those countries. The treaty requires ratifying countries to “never under any circumstances... develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices”. The pact also bans any transfer or use of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nuclear-powers-stay-out-of-first-nuke-ban-treaty-101611362107166.html
23-01-2021||World||House to trigger Donald Trump trial process on Monday||The US House of Representatives will deliver to the Senate on Monday the article of impeachment against former president Donald Trump, triggering his trial for “incitement of insurrection”.The trial will take place as the Senate is in the conformation process for President Joe Biden’s cabinet members.On Friday, it confirmed Lloyd Austin as secretary of defence in a 93-2 bipartisan vote, making him the first African-American to head the Pentagon. Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence was first to be confirmed and Antony Blinken, nominee for secretary of state, will be cleared next week.Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, announced on the floor of the Senate that the House of Representatives will transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate on Monday. Under the rules, the trial process must start the day after the formal delivery of the article of impeachment.“There will be a trial. It will be a full trial; it will be a fair trial,” Schumer said.Trump is the first US president to be impeached twice, and the first to be tried after leaving office. He was impeached by the House for inciting supporters to storm the US Capitol to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election win.Republicans had sought to delay the start of the trial to give Trump time to prepare. Mitch McConnell, the top Republican who is now the Senate minority leader, had proposed a timeline that started next week and gave Trump two weeks to put together his defence after that.A two-third super-majority is needed for the 100-member Senate to convict a president. The current chamber is evenly split 50-50. All 50 Democrats are expected to vote to convict Trump, but 17 Republicans will have to vote with the Democrats for a conviction to go through.McConnell and some Republicans have indicated they were open to listening to arguments in favour of convicting Trump, a fellow Republican they had voted to acquit the last time.A conviction would have led to Trump’s removal from office if he was still president. Now, if it happens, it will prevent him from holding any federal office, ruling out another run for the White House, which he and his aides had indicated he might do in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-to-trigger-donald-trump-trial-process-on-monday-101611361947064.html

The Beijing district tests could be a run-up to the testing of the remaining 20mn in the capital as Chinese New Year holidays approach.China also reported its first cluster of Covid-19 cases among workers at a meat processing plant in Harbin in northeast.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-variant-causes-higher-mortality-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson-101611361775550.html
23-01-2021||World||'I want to feel safe again': Americans lament slow pace of US Covid-19 vaccine rollout||Jerry Shapiro, a 78-year-old pharmacist from Los Angeles, is at the top of the list of Californians now eligible for the Covid-19 vaccine, but more than a month after the state began inoculations, he has yet to receive one.Shapiro said he has spent hours calling multiple health agencies and making fruitless computer searches, an experience familiar to many people across the United States, as the days-old administration of President Joe Biden races to bring the country's slow, chaotic vaccine rollout up to speed."Why not make it easy?" asked Shapiro, who is also concerned about his wife because of medical conditions that would make her particularly vulnerable to the virus. "Have it in your neighborhood. Set up an appointment, get your shot and be done."The United States is the nation hardest-hit by Covid-19, with 24.51 million cases and 409,987 deaths by early Friday morning. More than 4,000 Americans died of the disease on Thursday for the second day in a row.Even so, vaccine rollout, which the administration of former President Donald Trump left to the states to carry out without a federal blueprint or sufficient funding, has proven to be choppy.From California, where distribution has varied from county to county, to New York where the largest city in the nation is running low on supply, states and healthcare providers have struggled to acquire, store and distribute vaccines."We’re burning through our supply," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio posted on Twitter on Friday. "We need more doses IMMEDIATELY so we can protect the most vulnerable residents in our city. We need more doses so we can fight back."New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said just 67% of healthcare workers in New York have received a vaccine dose and he warned that if the federal government does not find a way to quickly ramp up production, everyone would suffer."The hospital workers are the people who, if they get sick, the hospital capacity will collapse,” Cuomo said at a news conference. “If the hospital capacity collapses, we have to close the economy.”In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy said the state's vaccination program had managed to get 70% of its vaccine supply into people's arms, but that a federal program within the state to help nursing home residents had distributed only 10% of its supply.The country's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on Friday the federal government had put too much of the responsibility for distributing the vaccine on state governments."States were doing things that clearly were not the right direction - and that's unfortunate," Fauci said on CNN.Instead, he said, the administration should collaborate with the states to help them plan their rollouts and make sure that vaccines got into people's arms.Distribution challengesFewer than half of the nearly 38 million vaccine doses shipped to date by the federal government have actually made it into the arms of Americans, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Thursday.Some individual states have lagged behind with just a third or 40% of their vaccine allotments being administered as of Thursday, which marked the one-year anniversary of the first locally transmitted Covid-19 case documented in the United States.A key problem is organizing the distribution of vaccines to smaller clinics and pharmacies - rather than just to large medical centers and retail pharmaceutical chains.In California, only a handful of independent pharmacies have been able to acquire vaccines for their customers - generally only in rural areas where the big chain stores are not present, said Sonya Frausto, a pharmacist in the state capital of Sacramento.Shapiro, who owns an independent pharmacy in downtown Los Angeles, said customers have been calling daily seeking vaccines, but he has to tell them he has no supply.He and his wife finally made appointments to receive a vaccine on Saturday, after repeated phone calls and hours on hold led them to healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente. The Shapiros are not Kaiser members, but the nonprofit is offering them shots nonetheless, Jerry Shapiro said.In Sacramento, 65-year-old restaurateur Jami Goldstene would feel a lot safer at her public-facing job if she could get a vaccine. She is technically eligible because of her age, but has yet to be offered an appointment - or even find a way to make one - despite hours on the phone and the internet."It's very frustrating," she said. "I want to be over with it. I want to feel safe again."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-want-to-feel-safe-again-americans-lament-slow-pace-of-us-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101611361522717.html
23-01-2021||World||Trump impeachment trial to begin in Senate week of Feb 8: Chuck Schumer||Former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial will begin during the week of Feb. 8, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday, after the House of Representatives formally delivers the impeachment charge to the chamber on Monday.Schumer emphasized the need to move quickly on confirmation of President Joe Biden's Cabinet and other key administration officials. Schumer said House impeachment managers - serving as prosecutors in the Senate trial - and Trump's defense team would have time to prepare between the time the single article of impeachment accusing Trump of inciting an insurrection is delivered on Monday and the start of the trial."During that period, the Senate will continue to do other business for the American people, such as Cabinet nominations and the Covid relief bill which would provide relief for millions of Americans who are suffering during this pandemic" Schumer said on the Senate floor.Schumer became the chamber's leader this week after Democrats won two Georgia US Senate runoff elections earlier in the month.The timeline was a compromise after Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell had asked the Democratic-led House to delay sending the charges until next Thursday, and called on Schumer to postpone the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defense.A McConnell aide said the trial could begin as soon as Feb. 9 - a Tuesday - and that McConnell was pleased Democrats had given Trump's defense more time."This is a win for due process and fairness," said Doug Andres, a McConnell spokesman.Trump's charge stems from his incendiary speech to supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6."This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House," McConnell said on Friday. "The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself."White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the Senate should be able to move forward with both the trial and Biden's agenda, beginning with his call for $1.9 trillion of fresh Covid-19 assistance for Americans and the US economy."What cannot be delayed through this process is his proposal to get relief to the American people at this time of crisis," Psaki told reporters.Senate rules had called for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 p.m. on the day after articles of impeachment are delivered to the upper legislative chamber of Congress, except for Sundays.But Senator Richard Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC that lawmakers would "sit down and map this out as best we can, use every available minute."The moves come as Schumer and McConnell are struggling to assert control in a chamber divided 50-50 in which Democrats hold a majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote."I can't imagine that both McConnell and Schumer don't want to have a little more structure here, and particularly Schumer, leave a little more time to move forward with the early Biden decisions before we get locked into the trial," Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters.Filibuster fightMcConnell has insisted that Democrats provide a guarantee that they will not end the legislative filibuster, which gives the minority Republicans the power to block legislation being pushed by the new Biden administration.Schumer rejected McConnell's demand on Friday, calling it an "unacceptable proposal."McConnell refused to concede, saying that maintaining the filibuster's 60-vote threshold for advancing most legislation was a linchpin for the power-sharing agreement cobbled together in 2001, the last time the Senate was split 50-50.Trump last week became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, and when the Senate convenes for his trial will be the first president tried after leaving office.Ten House Republicans joined Democrats on Jan. 13 in impeaching him. The support of at least 17 Senate Republicans would be needed to convict him; a separate vote would then be needed to ban him from running for office again.Such a vote could signal that senior Republicans were eager to remove Trump as the de facto leader of their party. He has said he may seek to run again in 2024.Trump's fate ultimately could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republican lawmakers. The Kentucky Republican said this week that the mob was "fed lies" and "provoked by the president and other powerful people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-in-senate-week-of-feb-8-chuck-schumer-101611361210202.html
23-01-2021||World||SpaceX plans to drill for natural gas near Texas launchpad||Elon Musk recently moved to Texas, where he launches some of his rockets and is building a battery factory. Now, for good measure, he plans to drill for natural gas in the state.The billionaire’s SpaceX intends to drill wells close to the company’s Boca Chica launchpad, it was revealed during a Friday hearing before the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s energy regulator.Production has yet to start because of a legal dispute between the SpaceX subsidiary Lone Star Mineral Development and another energy company. Tim George, an attorney representing Lone Star, said at the hearing that SpaceX plans to use the methane it extracts from the ground “in connection with their rocket facility operations.”While it’s unclear what exactly the gas would be used for, SpaceX plans to utilize super-chilled liquid methane and liquid oxygen as fuel for its Raptor engines. The company’s Starship and Super Heavy vehicles are tested at Boca Chica, and orbital launches are planned for the site.George declined to answer further questions and hung up when called for comment. SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk said in December he relocated to Texas to focus on SpaceX’s Starship vehicle and Tesla Inc.’s new Gigafactory, which is being built near Austin. On Thursday, the billionaire tweeted that he plans to donate $100 million toward a prize for the best carbon-capture technology. His past comments have suggested that he wants to use the tech to produce synthetic carbon-neutral rocket fuel. Until then, fossil fuels will power SpaceX rockets.Formed in June 2020, Lone Star bought the 806-acre (326-hectare) La Pita oil lease from Houston-based Sanchez Energy, which was later renamed Mesquite Energy Inc. after exiting bankruptcy. Financial terms for the deal weren’t disclosed, but the SpaceX subsidiary’s drilling plans have been called into question amid a dispute with Dallas Petroleum Group, which claims ownership of some inactive wells sitting on the same land.Dallas Petroleum took the dispute to the Railroad Commission in August. Two months later, it sued three companies -- Sanchez Midstream Partners LP, Sanchez Midstream Partners GP LLC and Sanchez Oil & Gas Corp. -- in state court in Brownsville, Texas.That lawsuit prompted SpaceX’s land-acquisition arm Dogleg Park LLC to intervene in November. In a filing to the court, Dogleg said Dallas Petroleum locked SpaceX out of the property and asserted ownership claims for the “sole purpose of extorting money from SpaceX.”Dallas Petroleum Group denies the allegations and maintains it has ownership of both the wells and the 24 surrounding acres.During Friday’s hearing, Dallas Petroleum CEO Matt Williams shared aerial photos that he said showed company equipment near the wells had been disconnected, while drilling and hydraulic-fracturing gear it doesn’t own had been moved onto the property. His company, he added, was also given a trespass warning.“Our signs are all over these tanks and the well head,” he said. “Any operation that went on there, we were very much liable for any problems that could have happened.”The Brownsville court is due to hear the lawsuit on Feb. 9 while Railroad Commission Administrative Law Judge Jennifer Cook is likely to take months to propose a decision that will later be voted on by the agency’s three commissioners in a public hearing. Cook is expected to scrutinize Dallas Petroleum’s claims against property and tax records, which list Sanchez as owner of the disputed land.The area around the SpaceX facility has seen limited oil and gas development. There are almost a nearby dozen wells classified as either abandoned or dry holes, Railroad Commission Records show. Canadian company Enbridge Inc. owns and operates the nearby Valley Crossing Pipeline, which moves 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas to customers in Mexico.The Brownsville may see more energy investment in the years ahead. There are separate plans for three liquefied natural gas export terminals about 5 miles (8 kilometers) west of the launch site. Environmental reports for those projects say they could safely coexist with SpaceX, although some activistsdispute those claims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-plans-to-drill-for-natural-gas-near-texas-launchpad-101611361019091.html

They protected our Capitol when we needed them most," said Representative Brendan Boyle on Twitter.Lawmakers visited the troops and apologized early Friday."What happened was an outrage and it will never happen again," said Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Majority leader, as he walked in a hall in the Capitol with dozens of soldiers sleeping on both sides.Schumer said nobody knew exactly who ordered the part-time soldiers moved to the garage.In the afternoon, first lady Jill Biden also paid a surprise visit to a group of military personnel on duty in Congress, offering them chocolate chip cookies and posing for photos."The National Guard will always hold a special place in the hearts of all the Bidens," she said. President Joe Biden's late son, Beau, was a member of the Delaware National Guard.Echoing the recriminations over responsibility for letting hundreds of violent supporters of then-president Donald Trump crash the Capitol on January 6, National Guard officials said Capitol Police told them to move to the garage, and the Capitol Police denied it.They "did not instruct the National Guard to vacate Capitol building facilities," said Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman in a statement."As of this morning, all Guardsmen and women have been relocated to space within the Capitol complex."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-angered-as-us-troops-guarding-capitol-forced-to-sleep-in-garage-101611359467665.html
23-01-2021||World||Biden warns Covid-19 toll can cross 600,000, urges Congress to pass rescue plan||President Joe Biden warned on Friday that the number of coronavirus deaths in the United States was expected to surpass 600,000 and urged Congress to move fast on his $1.9 trillion plan to battle Covid-19 and provide economic relief to struggling Americans.While Biden called for urgent passage of his "American Rescue Plan," his efforts to get Congress to cooperate on his fast-paced agenda could be complicated by Donald Trump's looming impeachment trial in the Senate.Top Democratic lawmakers said Friday that they planned to send the article of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives to the Senate on Monday, triggering Trump's trial in the body."The virus is surging," Biden told reporters at the White House before signing executive orders boosting food aid and speeding up stimulus payments to Americans."We're at 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000. Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act now... We need to move fast."Biden added that he was looking forward to working with both parties in Congress to "move quickly" on getting people help through his rescue plan."The bottom line is this: We're in a national emergency. We've got to act like we're in a national emergency," he said.Biden is having to push Congress for funding while simultaneously getting his government confirmed -- Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin won Senate approval Friday -- and bracing for turmoil from the impeachment trial.Trump was impeached by the House on January 13 for inciting supporters to storm Congress a week earlier."A trial will be held in the United States Senate and there will be a vote whether to convict the president," Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said.Barrage of executive ordersAlthough Biden's latest executive orders on food aid and stimulus payments were modest in scale, they reinforced the message that Washington needs to step in decisively against the pandemic and related economic fallout.Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan provides more than $400 billion to tackle the pandemic along with additional funding for small businesses and direct relief payments to Americans.But Congress, having already passed two huge economic relief bills, is reluctant. The president's Democratic Party has only a small majority in the House and a razor-thin advantage in the Senate.Biden is also relying on the Senate to hurry up and approve his cabinet nominations.Brian Deese, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Republicans and Democrats in Congress must find ways to manage the clashing issues."We are facing right now a period of multiple crises and what we need right now is to be able to act on multiple fronts," he said.The new administration has brought a calmer style after the stormy Trump era, but Biden's cascade of executive orders since the moment he entered the White House on Wednesday is making plenty of noise of its own.On Inauguration Day, the 78-year-old Democrat signed 17 actions. He signed 10 on Thursday and another two on Friday.The slew of orders has covered top campaign agenda items, including the political hot potato of immigration reform.Biden extended protections from deportation for so-called "Dreamers" -- children of illegal immigrants who have grown up in the country.But the offensive is overwhelmingly targeted against what Biden described on Friday as a "once in a century public health crisis" and the worst "job and economic crisis in modern history.""And the crisis is only deepening," he said. "It's not getting better. It's deepening."'Walk and chew gum'On the appointments front, a first key security figure was confirmed on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. The Senate's confirmation of Austin on Friday makes him the first African American to lead the Pentagon.Tony Blinken for secretary of state and Janet Yellen for treasury secretary appeared to be headed for confirmation either Friday or next week.That already clogged schedule in the legislature will now have to cope with the impeachment drama.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that Biden, who was a senator for decades, remains confident."The Senate, members of both parties, can walk and chew gum at the same time and can move forward with the business of the American people," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-warns-covid-19-toll-can-cross-600-000-urges-congress-to-pass-rescue-plan-101611358748224.html
23-01-2021||World||First Lady Jill Biden thanks National Guard members with chocolate chip cookies||New first lady Jill Biden took an unannounced detour to the U.S. Capitol on Friday to deliver a basket of chocolate chip cookies to National Guard members, thanking them “for keeping me and my family safe” during President Joe Biden's inauguration.“I just want to say thank you from President Biden and the whole, the entire Biden family,” she told a group of Guard members at the Capitol. “The White House baked you some chocolate chip cookies," she said, before joking that she couldn't say she had baked them herself.Joe Biden was sworn into office on Wednesday, exactly two weeks after Donald Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol in a futile attempt to keep Congress from certifying Biden as the winner of November's presidential election. Extensive security measures were then taken for the inauguration, which went off without any major incidents.Jill Biden told the group that her late son, Beau, was a Delaware Army National Guard member who spent a year deployed in Iraq in 2008-09. Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.“So I'm a National Guard mom,” she said, adding that the basket was a “small thank you” for leaving their home states and coming to the nation's capital. President Biden offered his thanks to the chief of the National Guard Bureau in a phone call Friday.“I truly appreciate all that you do,” the first lady said. “The National Guard will always hold a special place in the heart of all the Bidens.”Jill Biden's unannounced troop visit came after her first public outing as first lady.She highlighted services for cancer patients at Whitman-Walker Health, a Washington institution with a history of serving HIV/AIDS patients and the LGBTQ community. The clinic receives federal money to help provide primary care services in underserved areas.Staff told the first lady that cancer screenings had fallen since last March because patients didn't want to come in because of the coronavirus pandemic. More and more patients are taking advantage of options to see a doctor online.When the issue of universal access to broadband internet was raised, Jill Biden, who is a teacher, said she hears from teachers around the country who can't get in touch with their students because of the spotty access in some areas.“We just have to work together and address some of these things," she said. “The first thing we have to do is address this pandemic and get everybody vaccinated and back to work and back to their schools and get things back to the new normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-jill-biden-thanks-national-guard-members-with-chocolate-chip-cookies-101611356546899.html
23-01-2021||World||Donald Trump impeachment headed to Senate, triggering trial||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment against Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, triggering the start of the former president's trial on a charge of “incitement of insurrection” in the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced Pelosi's intentions Friday for the quick trial, rebuffing Republicans' proposal to push the proceedings to mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare his case. Schumer said there will be “a full trial," and "it will be a fair trial."Unlike any in history, Trump's impeachment trial would be the first of a U.S. president no longer in office, an undertaking that his Senate Republican allies argue is pointless, and potentially even unconstitutional. Democrats say they have to hold Trump to account, even as they pursue new President Joe Biden's legislative priorities, because of the gravity of what took place — a violent attack on the U.S. Congress aimed at overturning an election.The trial could start as soon as Tuesday, but timing remains uncertain as leaders negotiate. If Trump is convicted, the Senate could vote to bar him from holding office ever again, potentially upending his chances for a political comeback.The urgency to hold Trump responsible is somewhat complicated by Democrats' simultaneous need to get Biden's government in place and start quick work on his coronavirus aid package. The trial could halt Senate work on those priorities.“The more time we have to get up and running ... the better,” Biden said Friday in brief comments to reporters.A trial delay could appeal to some Democrats, as it would give the Senate more time to confirm the Cabinet and debate the new round of coronavirus relief.The timing and details of the Senate trial eventually rest on negotiations between Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who are also in talks over a power-sharing agreement for the Senate, which is split 50-50 but in Democratic control because Vice President Kamala Harris serves as a tie-breaking vote.Whenever the start, Pelosi said Friday the nine House impeachment managers, or prosecutors, are "ready to begin to make their case” against Trump. Trump’s team will have had the same amount of time since the House impeachment vote to prepare, Pelosi said.Democrats say they can move quickly through the trial, potentially with no witnesses, because lawmakers experienced the insurrection first-hand.One of the managers, California Rep. Ted Lieu, said Friday that Democrats would rather be working on policy right now, but “we can't just ignore" what happened on Jan. 6.“This was an attack on our Capitol by a violent mob,” Lieu said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It was an attack on our nation instigated by our commander in chief. We have to address that and make sure it never happens again.”Trump, who told his supporters to “fight like hell” just before they invaded the Capitol two weeks ago and interrupted the electoral vote count, is still assembling his legal team.White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday deferred to Congress on timing for the trial and would not say whether Biden thinks Trump should be convicted. But she said lawmakers can simultaneously discuss and have hearings on Biden's coronavirus relief package.“We don’t think it can be delayed or it can wait, so they’re going to have to find a path forward,” Psaki said of the virus aid. “He’s confident they can do that.”Democrats would need the support of at least 17 Republicans to convict Trump, a high bar. While most Republican senators condemned Trump's actions that day, far fewer appear to be ready to convict.A handful of Senate Republicans have indicated they are open — but not committed — to conviction. But most have come to Trump's defense as it relates to impeachment, saying they believe a trial will be divisive and questioning the legality of trying a president after he has left office.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who has been helping him find lawyers, said Friday there is “a very compelling constitutional case” on whether Trump can be impeached after his term — an assertion that Democrats reject, saying there is ample legal precedent. Graham also suggested that Republicans will argue Trump's words on Jan. 6 were not legally “incitement.”“On the facts, they’ll be able to mount a defense, so the main thing is to give him a chance to prepare and run the trial orderly, and hopefully the Senate will reject the idea of pursuing presidents after they leave office,” Graham said.Other Republicans had stronger words, suggesting there should be no trial at all. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said Pelosi is sending a message to Biden that “my hatred and vitriol of Donald Trump is so strong that I will stop even you and your Cabinet from getting anything done.” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson suggested Democrats are choosing “vindictiveness” over national security as Biden attempts to set up his government.McConnell, who said this week that Trump “provoked” his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote. He said Senate Republicans "strongly believe we need a full and fair process where the former president can mount a defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal and constitutional questions.”Trump, the first president to be impeached twice, is at a disadvantage compared with his first impeachment trial, in which he had the full resources of the White House counsel’s office to defend him. Graham helped Trump hire South Carolina attorney Butch Bowers after members of his past legal teams indicated they did not plan to join the new effort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-impeachment-headed-to-senate-triggering-trial-101611356325817.html
23-01-2021||World||Spain discarding thousands of Pfizer vaccine doses for lack of right syringes||Spain does not have enough right syringes and needles to extract the sixth dose from a Pfizer anti-coronavirus vaccine vial, resulting in thousands of doses going to waste, doctors have complained.The EU medicines regulator said in a guidance update on January 8 that low dead-volume syringes and needles with more effective space than standards ones must be used to get full six doses. It warned that pooling contents from two vials to make up a full 0.3 ml dose was not permitted.Insufficient supplies of low dead-space equipment have been reported in the capital of Madrid, the southern Andalusia region and Catalonia. The Catalan health officials say a six dose is on average extracted from only two out of three vials.Concerns are that the ambiguous six doses will soon be factored in delivery numbers."The Pfizer company will begin a review process on January 25 after which EU member states will continue receiving the same number of doses but in fewer vials," the Spanish health ministry said.Spain expects to import 4.5 million Pfizer doses in the first quarter of this year. Some 1.3 million Pfizer doses and 35,000 Moderna doses have been delivered to the country of 47 million. Both vaccines require two doses for maximum effectiveness. A total of 1.1 million have received a shot.

The Rafale fleet is ready to undertake any operation. Rafale is not only able to operate in different parts of the county but across the world. It is able to complete all the tasks that any fourth-generation or fifth-generation fighter can do," Kumar told ANI."The Rafales we (IAF) have are the fastest and most advanced as of now," said the Rafale pilot, when asked if Indian Rafales were more advanced than their French counterparts.Kumar further said that the 'Desert Knight-21' was a successful exercise."This has been a really important exercise for the integration of Rafale in the operations of the IAF. The basics of all these exercises were all about cooperation, learning from each other's experiences while operating in different terrains, spectrum and thereafter applying it to enhance our operational capability. So this has been a really successful exercise," he said."We have flown with their (France) pilots in Rafale cockpits. We learned from them what they do in different situations and similarly, they have also learned from us. Both of us learned great lessons," he added.India and France have fielded a number of fighter jets in the exercise which include Rafales of two sides besides Mirages and the Sukhois of the Indian Air Force.The French are participating in the exercise with Rafale, Airbus A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), A-400M Tactical Transport aircraft and approximately 175 personnel.The IAF aircraft participating in the exercise include Mirage 2000, Su-30 MKI, Rafale, IL-78 Flight Refuelling Aircraft, Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS) and an AEW&C aircraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-ready-to-tackle-any-challenge-from-leh-to-kanyakumari-says-rafale-pilot-101611426082068.html
23-01-2021||India||4°C fall in temp from Jan 26, cold wave return likely: IMD||After a brief respite, the capital is likely to return to cold wave conditions starting on Republic Day when the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius -- the fallout of weather factors at play in the Himalayas and in the northern plains, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.The Western Himalayas experienced widespread snowfall and rain on Friday and Saturday, and an induced cyclonic circulation was over Punjab and its neighbourhood in the plains . A western disturbance loomed over north Pakistan and its neighbourhood as a cyclonic circulation.Under the influence of such atmospheric factors, widespread rain or snowfall with moderate thunderstorms, lightning and hail are likely to lash Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh over the weekend, according to the IMD’s Saturday bulletin.Uttarakhand is also expected to experience similar weather. Light rain and thundershowers are likely in isolated places over north Punjab, north Haryana and Chandigarh until Sunday.“There has been widespread snowfall in the hills on Friday and Saturday. Rain is also likely over north Punjab and north Haryana. From January 25 onwards; very cold northwesterly winds are likely to blow over Delhi which will lead to a significant fall in minimum temperatures. On January 26, 27 and 28, minimum temperature is likely to fall to 4 degree C over Delhi,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting centre.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 20.4 degrees C, 1 degree below normal ,and minimum temperature of 8 degree C on Saturday. Delhi recorded “very poor” air quality on Saturday with an air quality index reading of 326.“Wind speed is likely to reduce on Sunday as wind direction will change from southeasterly to northwesterly tomorrow. During transition of wind direction, wind speed is low which affects dispersion of pollutants. Winds are likely to be northwesterly during next three days blowing at 10 to 12 kmph, not enough for adequate dispersal of pollutants so air quality is likely to be in poor to very poor category for the next few days.,” said VK Soni, a scientist at IMD’s air quality division. Dense to very dense fog is likely over pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the next 4-5 days; and over Bihar, north Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Odisha during the next 2-3 days.Cold day or severe cold day conditions are likely over some pockets of Uttar Pradesh during the next 2-3 days and over Haryana during the next 24 hours. Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over north Rajasthan during January 24 to 27 and over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on anuary 26 and 27, according to the bulletin.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degrees C below normal. A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches less than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees C in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4c-fall-in-temp-from-jan-26-cold-wave-return-likely-imd-101611425691831.html
23-01-2021||India||In poll-bound Bengal, politics overshadows Netaji’s birth anniversary||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to celebrate Subhas Chandra Bose’s birthday in Kolkata as Parakram Diwas, or day of valour, ran into a political debate on Saturday with chief minister Mamata Banerjee expressing anger at Bharatiya Janata Party supporters present at the PM’s main event raising the Jai Sri Ram slogan hours after she accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of not showing respect to the iconic freedom fighter.With political tension rising in the state where elections are due in March-April, the tussle between the saffron camp and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) intensified, with the Left and Congress, who are now electoral partners, not missing the opportunity to take potshots at their rivals.Some leaders and political experts even described Modi’s visit as an exercise to woo Bengali voters on whom Bose’s ideology has great influence even after 76 years of his mysterious disappearance.Sparks started flying in the afternoon when Banerjee, after leading a roadshow sans any TMC flag through the heart of Kolkata, said that if the Centre really wanted to show respect to Bose it would not have dissolved the Planning Commission of India that Bose conceived. She even questioned large central spending on aircrafts (she did not specify which one) and a new Parliament building but not on a monument dedicated to Bose.She demanded revival of the Planning Commission and a national holiday on January 23.Without naming the BJP or Modi, whose flight was yet to arrive, Banerjee said, “They want to celebrate the day as Parakram Diwas (day of valour). Kiya hai Parakram? (What is parakram?). They could have consulted us on use of the right word. We are celebrating Desh Nayak Diwas (day of the national hero). Netaji does not need anyone’s favour. We will set up a monument dedicated to the Azad Hind Bahini (Indian National Army that Bose led). We will show proper respect to Netaji.”Banerjee even demanded that India should have four capitals in four corners of the country where Parliament sessions can be held on rotation. “A one party, one government system will not work in this country. States have equal rights. Netaji believed that the nation belongs to Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and people from all religions and class,” she said.A few hours later, Modi’s main event at the Victoria Memorial Hall pushed politics to the fore when Banerjee lost her temper on hearing the Jai Sri Ram slogan while she was about to address the audience.“I feel a government programme must have some dignity. This is not a political programme but a government programme and it is for the public and all political parties. I am grateful to the Prime Minister that this event is being held in Kolkata. But you have no right to invite someone to a government programme and insult that person. In protest, I am not saying anything,” said Banerjee before raising her own slogan Jai Hind, Jai Bangla, which is meant to project Bengal’s identity against her repeated assertion that the BJP is “a party of outsiders.”Speaking after her, Modi said the Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India project, which focuses on indigenous production of all products, would have made Bose proud had he been around.“The nation is following the path Netaji showed. I often think how Netaji would feel seeing India surging ahead, its army getting modern weapons and planes like Rafale guarding the nation. How proud he must have felt seeing India giving vaccines to other nations,” said Modi.All political parties, including the CPI(M), as well as eminent intellectuals of Kolkata condemned the sloganeering. Some BJP leaders tried to play down the incident while others argued that it is a way of greeting people and does not carry any political message.“Modi’s speech made the purpose of his visit before the polls quite apparent. But it misfired. It will have no impact on voters,” TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy told HT while condemning the raising of the slogan.Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay too felt Modi’s visit will not impact voters. “Netaji’s real followers believe in his secular and all-inclusive nationalism. These people will not vote for the BJP. If the BJP wants to reach out to them it has to alter its approach,” Bandopadhyay told HT.“Banerjee’s demand for multiple capitals, however, will not work in India as we have a federal structure,” he added.Former Tripura governor and BJP leader Tathagata Roy was present at the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds when the Jai Sri Ram slogan was heard. “Some people were simply teasing Banerjee since she had chased at people in the past for raising it in her presence. I don’t read any politics into this,” Roy told the media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-poll-bound-bengal-politics-overshadows-netaji-s-birth-anniversary-101611424000448.html

23-01-2021||India||Odisha govt plans to launch employment scheme for urban poor||In a bid tgive a fillip to employment in urban areas ahead of civic polls later this year, the Naveen Patnaik government plans to convert an existing wage employment initiative that it had launched during Covid-19 lockdown into a full-fledged scheme to achieve the objective of sustainable livelihood opportunities for about 4.5 lakh urban poor families.Titled Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan or Mukta, the scheme aims at building on the relative success of the Urban Wage Employment Initiative that was launched in April last year during Covid-19 lockdown to help the informal workforce in the state’s 114 urban local bodies. Under the initiative, around ₹100 crore was allocated for all labour-intensive projects in the urban local bodies in the state for providing temporary employment to the urban poor.As per the urban development department, in the last 9 months, more than 6,000 projects have been completed under the initiative with an expenditure of ₹70 crores spent and generation of 13 lakh person-days generated. At least 3.5 lakh workers, of which 40 per cent were women, participated in the initiative.To build on the success of the initiative, the department now plans to make it a full-fledged scheme called Mukhyamantri Karma Tatpara Abhiyan under which activities like stormwater drainage, rainwater harvesting, green cover increase, sanitation and creation of community centres and peripheral development around water bodies would be undertaken.“The new scheme would be NREGA scheme for urban areas,” said Pratap Jena, minister for urban development. “This would be a state government programme funded from its own budget."Officials of the urban development department said the scheme will build on the existing and robust welfare schemes, legislations and technological interventions (like GIS database) and converge and integrate funds and resources of its own with those of the large on-going welfare schemes."The scheme aims at reduction in livelihood vulnerabilities of the urban poor including migrant labourers and informal workers, economic empowerment of the urban informal workers especially economic empowerment of women informal workers, increased involvements and empowerment of women self-help groups and slum development associations. It would be an urban equivalent of NREGS and wages of workers would be credited to their bank account through Direct Benefit Transfer," said a senior official of the department.As Odisha receives high rainfall over a short period during monsoon, desilting and repair of stormwater drains to prevent local flooding would be a big component of the programme. They create systems to conserve rainwater, prevent flooding and beautify the state’s urban areas, rainwater harvesting structures would be constructed to conserve water and recharge groundwater sources and natural ponds and reservoirs.In addition, there will be development of new water bodies, public parks and playgrounds based on local needs and land availability, all with proper walking tracks, adequate lighting, drinking water, toilets, garbage bins and plenty of greenery. Manual clearing of water hyacinths in existing ponds and plantation drives on public land, roadsides and on river banks are envisaged.The scheme will bolster the resilience in cities by strengthening the capacities of community organisations of the urban poor to execute the scheme activities, by reducing the economic vulnerabilities of the urban poor and by creating climate-resilient assets. The scheme is expected to create community assets worth more than ₹150 crores primarily in the form of Parichaya centres and Mission Shakti Grihas. The scheme will combine resources of the ongoing development schemes with innovative approaches and technology. Further, the projects and institutions created under the Scheme will contribute to building resilience in communities.Officials said by safeguarding the livelihood needs and rights of the urban poor and by using innovative technology, appropriate implementation approaches and community strengthening, the scheme will prove to be unique safe, resilient and sustainable. The scheme is expected to generate more than 35 lakh man-days per year.The new wage employment scheme for the urban poor is the latest among a series of measures by the ruling BJD government to woo the informal workers in cities. Last month, the state government had sanctioned 1.39 lakh dwelling houses for urban homeless persons in 114 towns and cities of Odisha under the Odisha Urban Housing Mission.In April 2019, the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh had launched a similar employment scheme called ‘Mukhyamantri Yuva Swabhiman Yojana’ for young people in urban areas that guaranteed 100 days of employment every year to young people. However, the scheme did not meet with much success as only 3 per cent of the urban youth in Madhya Pradesh who were offered 100 days of employment under a state job guarantee scheme received their stipends over next 6 months.In June 2020, Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand had launched a 100-day employment scheme for urban unskilled workers calling it Mukhyamantri Shramik (Shahri Rozgar Manjuri For Kamgar) Yojna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-plans-to-launch-employment-scheme-for-urban-poor-101611422573713.html

About 20 administrative posts at the Tribunal also need to be filled up.Presently, over 5,000 cases are pending with the Tribunal of which the bulk of matters arise out of proceedings under PMLA. Before filing the petition, Sahni filed a representation before the government in December 2020 for taking adequate steps to fill the pending vacancies. However, no action has been taken on his request till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appoint-chairman-members-for-pmla-appellate-tribunal-lawyer-s-plea-in-sc-101611419691828.html
23-01-2021||India||'People of Tamil Nadu will determine their future, not Nagpur': Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that the people of Tamil Nadu will determine its future and not Nagpur - headquarters of BJP’s ideological parents the RSS. Gandhi promised his party will work with the southern state's people to give them a new government that they deserved.Gandhi kicked off the Congress’ election campaign from Coimbatore district for the ensuing assembly elections by attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP-led central government and the RSS for its ideology and other aspects. “You have a government in Tamil Nadu that is compromised,” Gandhi said in Coimbatore his first stop during his three-day visit to the state.“Modi uses the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate to get what he wants. He thinks just because he controls the government of Tamil Nadu, he can control its people. Nagpur cannot determine the future of Tamil Nadu. People are going to show Modi that only they can determine its future. The prime minister and RSS treat communities with disrespect.”The former Congress chief picked on issues of the centre-state divide where Tamil Nadu has viewed the BJP as a Hindi party trying to impose the language. “Currently, they are trying to bring the idea of one language, one culture which we are fighting,” said Gandhi from an open campaign van. “Modi has no respect for the culture, language and people of Tamil Nadu. He thinks Tamil people, language and culture should be subservient to his idea. We feel all languages - Tamil, Hindi, Bengali, English - have a space in the country."Also read: 'If China gets aggressive, so will India' IAF chief on eve of talks with PLAGandhi’s effort was to emotionally connect with the state by invoking his love for the language and culture and Tamil Nadu’s relationship with former prime ministers and his late grandmother Indira Gandhi and father Rajiv Gandhi.

I’m at your service to protect the interest of Tamil people.”Besides holding two roadshows, Gandhi interacted with MSME representatives during the day and with industrial labourers in the evening. During the interactions, he criticised PM Modi for the implementation of GST and demonetisation and promised that the UPA would simplify the GST by restructuring it to one tax and minimum tax.Gandhi spoke of NYAY with an assurance of minimum income of 72,000 per year. He said that the country was moving in a dictatorial direction given the protests in the country, particularly on farm legislation. “The current dispensation in Delhi is not interested in negotiation, listening, and conversations,” Gandhi said. “Modi’s job is to divide the country and our job is to unite the people.”He met labourers in Tiruppur district after moving from Coimbatore. Gandhi is on a tour of the western belt where he will next visit Erode, Tiruppur, Karur and Dindigul districts to meet farmers, weavers and youngsters. The western region of the state is the bastion of the AIADMK which Congress’ longstanding ally and the principal opposition DMK is trying to breach. “We want to further strengthen our vote base and not just be dependent on alliance partners but we want to help our partners,” said AICC in-charge for Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Dinesh Gundu Rao.Gandhi’s visit comes amidst severe strains in the DMK-Congress relationship in Puducherry. Local DMK leaders in the Union territory want to contest alone where the Congress’ V Narayanaswamy is the chief minister. “Puducherry is a Congress-based state and statements from the local DMK leadership were unwarranted,” said Rao. “DMK president MK Stalin has clarified on that issue. I hope things get sorted out,” he said adding that it will not cast a shadow in Tamil Nadu. In 2019, the DMK-led alliance with Congress in the state won 38 out of 29 Lok Sabha seats.Incidentally, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami was also campaigning in Coimbatore on Saturday. Wearing a skull cap and addressing Muslims at an event, Palaniswami said, “We will never allow differences on religious lines. The AIADMK, which allied with the BJP before 2019 elections, will fight the 2021 polls together. “There is some fear over the centre's laws but minorities need not be afraid. Our government will protect you. We will not compromise on your rights under any circumstances. No one can intimidate anyone born in this soil. Everyone has a right to live,” Palaniswami said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-of-tamil-nadu-will-determine-their-future-not-nagpur-rahul-gandhi-101611419749937.html
23-01-2021||India||'Let's have a duel': Amit Shah slams Covid-19 vaccine critics||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday came down heavily on those criticising the efficacies of Covid-19 vaccines, asserting that there should be no politics on public health.Addressing a function to extend the benefit of the government's healthcare programme to the central armed police forces, he said the vaccines developed by Indian scientists are fully safe."There are some people who are spreading misinformation on the vaccines. Come to another platform and let's have a duel. But why are you creating doubt over people's health and doing politics?" he asked."I appeal to all of you to go for the vaccine when your turn comes. Do not have any doubt over its efficacy. We've already launched the world's biggest vaccination drive," he added.Shah ceremoniously distributed the 'Ayushman CAPF' health cards among some personnel from the seven Central Armed Police Forces here.He said the CAPFs had three prime concerns -- the existing health coverage was not comprehensive, the satisfaction of housing was not there and long duty hours without leaves due to non-timely recruitment."Our government is addressing all the three concerns. For the health issue, we've launched the 'Ayushman CAPF' today. This will give health insurance benefit to around 50 lakh people," Shah said.By May 1, the 'Ayushman CAPF' process will be completed by offering health cards to all the personnel of the seven central police forces, he added.The home minister said the government and the forces are trying to increase the satisfaction ratio to 55 per cent by 2022 from 36 per cent two years ago, and further take it to 65 per cent by 2025."We've completed the examination process for 50,000 recruitments. Now, we'll start the process again to hire another 50,000 persons in the CAPFs. Our target is one hiring against one departure in five years. With this, everyone will be able to stay home for 100 days in a year," he added.An MoU was signed between the National Health Authority (NHA) and Union Home Ministry in presence of Shah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and state Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at the CRPF Group Centre in Guwahati.Under the initiative 'Ayushman CAPF', around 28 lakh personnel from Central Armed Police Force (CAPF), Assam Rifles and NSG and their families will be covered by the 'Ayushman Bharat: Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana'.CRPF Director-General AP Maheshwari expressed his gratitude for bringing the CAPFs under the scheme.The Home Minister also virtually inaugurated Sashastra Seema Bal's (SSB) 168 quarters, a 10-bed hospital and an administrative building located at different places of Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-have-a-duel-amit-shah-slams-covid-19-vaccine-critics-101611419653858.html
23-01-2021||India||Legal education in the country needs urgent reforms: Supreme Court judges||There is an urgent need for reforming legal education in the country as its quality is being affected due to the "mushrooming" of law colleges, two Supreme Court judges said on Saturday."I do believe we are churning out too many lawyers without any analysis of the number of lawyers required," Justice S K Kaul said.He said the quality of legal education has suffered as a result of a large number of "not so great law colleges" and the "crying need of the hour" was to see how legal education can be improved.Similar issues were also raised by senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Referring to the concerns raised by Justice Kaul and Singhvi, Justice N V Ramanna said, "I welcome this thought-provoking discussion and I agree with what they have expressed. It (legal education) requires urgent and immediate reform.""I hope something can be done and we can take up this issue in the coming days," he added.The remarks by the two apex court judges came during an event for the release of the book -- The Law of Emergency Powers -- authored by Singhvi and professor Khagesh Gautam, who teaches law at Jindal Global Law School, on a legal and constitutional study of emergency powers.Speaking at the event, which was conducted virtually, Singhvi lamented upon the "glaring absence of genuine legal research in large parts of India"."Part of this is due to the many factories of legal education we produce with hardly any quality control. The negative impact of the stratification of law colleges must be urgently addressed."Central universities set up by Parliament operate their law faculty as law schools, while state universities act mostly as affiliating universities which are affiliating colleges set up by private trusts and societies," he said.He said that the major problem facing Indian legal education, particularly good legal research, was the affiliated law college system."Many do not have adequate or qualified faculty or libraries or e-resources and they omit regular classes and examinations," he added and demanded that substandard and mediocre law colleges ought to be closed down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/legal-education-in-the-country-needs-urgent-reforms-supreme-court-judges-101611417640650.html
23-01-2021||India||Gujarat state election commission announces local body elections in February||Elections to six municipal corporations in Gujarat will take place on February 21 and to 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on February 28, state election commission said on Saturday.Counting of votes for the six municipal corporations will take place on February 23, and for the 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on March 2.The ruling BJP expressed confidence about winning these polls, while the opposition Congress said it would mount a legal challenge on poll authorities announcing two separate days for counting of votes.The six municipal corporations to go to polls are Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar."Polls in six municipal corporations will be held on February 21 and counting of votes will take place on February 23. Polls will take place in the 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats on February 28 and results will be declared on March 2," Gujarat Election Commissioner Sanjay Prasad said.The last date to file nominations for the municipal corporation elections will be February 6, while it will be February 13 for the other set of polls, he said at a press conference here, adding that the model code of conduct had come into force immediately.These polls were to be held in October-November last year but were pushed back due to the coronavirus outbreak, and Prasad reiterated it would be conducted with strict adherence to all health protocols in place.He said standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the polls will be declared soon, and five meetings on this issue had been held so far with the state health department.EVMs will be used for the polls, of which the SEC has adequate numbers, but the VVPAT mechanism will not be deployed, Prasad informed.A total of 47,695 booths will be set up for the polls, of which over 6,000 have been marked sensitive, and 4.2 crore voters are eligible to vote for 574 corporators in six corporations, 2,720 representatives in 81 municipalities, and 9,049 representatives in district and taluka panchayats, he said.In reply to a query on the counting of votes of the municipal corporations and other local bodies being kept on two separate days, Prasad said the SEC had followed the tradition laid down earlier, and added that the coronavirus outbreak and resultant protocols had made it difficult to hold counting of votes for different polls at the same time.Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi expressed his party's displeasure at the counting of votes of the six municipal corporations being held earlier."We will legally challenge the early declaration of results of six municipal corporations as they will influence later elections," Doshi said.On the other hand, BJP Municipal Board chairperson Dhansukh Bhanderi said his party was confident of a win in these polls due to public support.Apart from the BJP and Congress, mainstays of the state's political theatre for several decades now, parties like the AIMIM and AAP have also said they would fight local bodies' polls this time.

"It's a mild type of influenza, so far there has been no case of the influenza in the commercial poultry in any part of Kashmir." She said officials are keeping a close watch on the situation.Deputy commissioner, Srinagar, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary confirmed that avian influenza cases have been reported in Kashmir."In view of Avian Influenza cases reported in #Kashmir: Human or Poultry contact with Wild/Migratory birds (like feeding sources) needs to be strictly avoided. AHD teams are on job ~ Farms to Wetlands. Let’s be careful about biosecurity," tweeted Shahid Choudhary, deputy commissioner, Srinagar.Deputy commissioner, Anantnag, Anshul Garg also confirmed cases have been reported in crows. "Avian Flu Advisory quite relevant for #Anantnag as well. We need to remain cautious in view of confirmed cases in Crows."Officials said that cases have been reported in crows in four districts - Pulwama, Anantnag, Kulgam and Budgam.Also read: 'If China gets aggressive, so will India' IAF chief on eve of talks with PLAJammu and Kashmir government on Friday had lifted the ban on the import of the poultry and poultry products.In an order issued earlier this week, the UT government said that they have decided to lift the ban on the instructions of the government of India.“In view of stringent surveillance mechanism in place for containment and spread of Bird Flu in the country and the instructions as conveyed by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India, there will be no ban on import of live birds including poultry and unprocessed poultry meat for any purpose into the Union Territory of J&K sourced from non-infected areas and beyond the 10 kilometres radius of Bird flu-infected zone w.e.f 19 January 2021,” said the order issued by Navin K Choudhary, principal secretary to the government on Monday.Bird flu has not been reported in poultry in J&K but the Union territory has been among the twelve states confirmed to have avian influenza in crow/migratory/wild birds, according to a statement by Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying on Friday.On January 7, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had banned the import of poultry after the Centre had issued advisories asking local authorities to keep a close vigil to contain the spread of avian influenza or bird flu.The new order stated that the importers and suppliers must provide a certificate from the district veterinary officer or chief animal husbandry officer of the concerned district of the state stating that the source of poultry is not from any infected or suspected area and also not within 10 kilometres radius of the notified bird flu-infected zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-j-k-govt-lifts-poultry-ban-crow-samples-found-positive-in-4-districts-101611417029871.html
23-01-2021||India||'Stand up to bigoted bulldozing or..': Mahua Moitra on Mamata-Jai Shri Ram row||A debate was triggered off on Saturday after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee left the stage at the Centre's event on Netaji anniversary in a huff, following chants of 'Jai Shri Ram' just before she was about to speak. Terming Mamata's reaction 'allergic', BJP leader and Netaji's grand-nephew Chandra Kumar Bose said CM need not have reacted adversely to the slogan. "This is not the day to do any politics. It is a day to celebrate. Netaji had people from all communities in Azad Hind Fauj. Whether you say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Shri Ram'. I don't find any difference," Bose told ANI.Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra trained her gun on the BJP for what happened at Saturday's event in Victoria memorial. "This government has completely violated all sanctity of a multi-faith democracy. In an official event, you can't have religion chants as long as this is a secular democracy. And it is only lumpen, uneducated people like in the BJP that can defend this kind of nonsense," she told ANI.Taking to Twiter, Moitra also urged people to "either stand up to this bigoted bulldozing where religion is equal to the government or India perishes". She also claimed that Netaji's daughter Anita Bose has said that her father would not have approved of Hindus being intolerant to other religions.Jai Shri Ram at official event to celebrate Netaji’s 125th? Jai Shri Ram in Parliament? Either we stand up to this bigoted bulldozing where religion = government or India perishesNetaji’s daughter Anita Bose tells it like it is to the radical lunatic fringe - that her father would not approve of Hindus being intolerant of other religionsJai Shri ConstitutionAnother MP Derek O'Brien criticised the "heckling" of Mamata Banerjee at the event and said dignity can't be taught to "lumpens".BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya said Mamata's action showed her frustration. "I fail to understand what is the problem in chanting Jai Shri Ram and why Mamata Ji gets annoyed with it. I think the slogan was raised in her honour when she stood up. Leaving the dais because of the slogan shows nothing but her frustration," he said.Political tempers are rising in West Bengal ahead of the assembly elections slated to be held in May this year. With several heavyweight leaders, ministers leaving the Trinamool, cracks inside the party are wide open in public. Celebration of Netaji birth anniversary has also been a clashing point between the BJP and the Trinamool. Given this situation, PM Modi and Mamata Banerjee's joint appearance at the event was surprising, but Mamata refused to speak at the event as she said she felt "insulted".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stand-up-to-bigoted-bulldozing-or-mahua-moitra-on-mamata-jai-shri-ram-row-101611415165385.html

The tunnel was detected between the Border Outposts (BOPs) on Pakistan's side Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-De-Kothe, Sakargarh. The tunnel is about 140-150 metres long. It is 10-12 feet deep, the downside from the entry point and 25-30 feet deep, entered in the Indian territory. The diameter of this tunnel is 2-3 feet so that a man can easily cross by crawling," NS Jamwal, Inspector General (IG) BSF, Jammu told reporters.IG Jamwal also said that Pakistani bags and some old bags were discovered in the tunnel.The tunnel detected today is the fourth one in the last six months in Samba, Hiranagar and Kathua areas and the tenth in total in Jammu region, according to a BSF press release.Talking about the operation, the BSF IG said, "Acting upon specific intelligence inputs for a while that there was the possible existence of a tunnel in the Pansar area. Our unit detected this tunnel under the ongoing anti-tunneling campaign. It is the fourth one in the last six months in Samba, Hiranagar and Kathua areas and the tenth in total in Jammu region," he said."We consider this area a sensitive area because it is surrounded by dense forest. Some notorious incident like in June 2020, the BSF had shot down a Pakistani Hexacopter and terrorist activities are also seen in the area," he said."Ahead of January 26, we are on high alert regarding border security. I want to give credit to the troops and the Intelligence agencies who has been provided inputs (to locate the tunnel)," he said.In November 2019, BSF had foiled an infiltration bid in the same area, wherein some troops had fired upon the party trying to infiltrate into India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-dug-tunnel-in-j-k-s-pansar-from-zero-line-says-bsf-ig-101611415153431.html

The award carries a cash prize of ₹51 lakh and a certificate in case of an institution and ₹five lakh and a certificate in case of an individual.The award is given to recognise and honour the invaluable contribution and selfless service rendered by individuals and organisations in India in the field of disaster management by the central government, the statement said.For the award this year, nominations were solicited from July 1, 2020 onwards. In response to the award scheme, 371 valid nominations were received from institutions and individuals.For the year 2021, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (in the institutional category) and Rajendra Kumar Bhandari (in the individual category) have been selected for the Subhash Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar for their excellent work in disaster management, the statement said.SEEDS has done commendable work in building community resilience to disasters. It has been working towards disaster readiness, response, and rehabilitation, building local capacities and enabling risk reduction at the community level in different states, it said.With a deep understanding of their contexts, local leaders have a unique ability to reach excluded communities, who lack access or fall outside the gambit of large-scale programming, the statement said.Local leaders often possess the capacity to innovate and have a strong understanding of local systems, politics, and culture, it added.Recognising the importance of local leaders, SEEDS actively engages in their capacity building to reduce the vulnerabilities in their communities, the ministry said.SEEDS has worked on school safety in several states by enabling community leaders and teachers in identifying, assessing, and managing risks in their own local communities, the statement said.Bhandari is among the pioneers in India who laid the foundation of scientific studies on geo hazards in general and landslides in particular.He established India's first laboratory on landslide studies at CSIR-Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), and three other centres.He also conducted studies on disasters in India, deployed latest technologies of Ground Penetrating Radar; Geotechnical Digital System; vibrating wire Piezometers; Laser Particle Analyser; Pile Drive Analyser and Acoustic Emission Technology for in-depth investigations, instrumentation, monitoring and risk analysis for early warning against Landslides.Pace-setting examples so created demonstrated organic connection between scientific investigations and engineering interventions for disaster resilient human habitat and highways, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-announces-subhash-bose-aapda-prabandhan-puraskar-2021-101611414939640.html
23-01-2021||India||Lalu Prasad Yadav shifted to AIIMS Delhi as health worsens||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief and fodder scam accused Lalu Prasad was airlifted to New Delhi by an air ambulance on Saturday evening following recommendations of the RIMS medical board.The eight-member medical board suggested shifting the Bihar leader to a higher institute of medical science for better treatment in the afternoon. The process of taking him to Ranchi airport in an ambulance creating a green corridor and the arrangement of an air ambulance was done in a few hours including the approval of the jail authorities.He will be admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as decided by his family members in consultation with the doctors of the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). The AIIMS management was reported to be ready with the necessary arrangements to admit Lalu on his arrival.His son and Bihar opposition leader Tejaswi Yadav said, “He needs specialised treatment and it was a collective decision to shift my father to AIIMS, New Delhi.”Jharkhand ministers Satyanand Bhokta and Badal Patralekh were seen coordinating with the RIMS management and Birsa Munda jail authorities.His wife and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, his daughter Misa Bharati and a doctor from RIMS would accompany Lalu during the transit..Earlier, sharing the eight-member medical board's recommendation with the media Lalu's doctor Dr Umesh Prasad said the board took the decision unanimously to shift the patient to another institute. The decision was taken keeping in view that he needed better treatment, he said.“He is a VIP patient and we don't have adequate back up here to treat him in case of exigencies,” Dr Prasad said adding that Lalu's condition was stable and there would not be any health hazard to transfer him. “His lungs are functioning properly and the kidney condition was similar,” he said.Lalu was reported to be a stage-4 kidney patient and his family was keen to see some expert nephrologists. He had developed sudden breathing trouble on Thursday evening that raised an alarm.The RIMS doctors treating the Bihar leader had confirmed that he had mild pneumonia. His condition was brought under control by late Thursday evening through medication.The rapid antigen and RCPCR tests conducted on Lalu for Covid-19 also returned negative.The former Bihar chief minister and Union minister was admitted to RIMS with critical ailments in December 2018.

"Farmers will take out 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' on January 26. Barricades will be opened and we will enter Delhi. We (farmers and Delhi Police) have reached an agreement on the route, final details are to be worked out tonight," Yogendra Yadav, Swaraj India founder told ANI. "We will take out a historical and peaceful parade and it will have no effect on the Republic Day parade or the security arrangements," Yadav said. Opening border points that have remained shut for two months now, Delhi police will allow farmers to enter Delhi from five entry points. "We have been allowed to cover 100 km distance on each route," farmer leader Darshan Pal told Hindustan Times. The tractor parades will start from the Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri border points of Delhi, but details will be finalised tonight, farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said after attending a meeting between the unions and the police.Farm leaders, representing thousands of agitated farmers who are camping on the borders of Delhi in the bitter cold for nearly two months now, had told the police previously that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The barricades set up at Delhi border points will be removed on January 26 so that farmers can take out their rallies, Pal said. The farmer unions have been adamant about taking out their tractor parade on Delhi's busy Outer Ring Road on January 26, even as the Delhi Police urged them to hold it outside the national capital, a request that was publicly rejected by the unions.The meeting was held between a group of farm leaders and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to discuss alternative routes for the tractor parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-march-will-have-no-effect-on-r-day-parade-says-yogendra-yadav-101611410525486.html
23-01-2021||India||Cavalcades of tractors from Punjab, Haryana set out for R-Day tractor parade||Several batches of farmers from Punjab and Haryana set out on Saturday in their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles to take part in the proposed tractor parade on January 26 in Delhi.Carrying some ration, mattresses and other essentials, cavalcades of tractors left for Delhi to press the Centre to accept their demands.Tractors carried the flags of the unions, some sported the tricolour, and also posters with slogans of 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad', 'No Farmer, No Food' and 'Kaale Kanoon Radd Karo'.Farmer unions protesting the Centre's three farm laws had said they would go ahead with their tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day.Farmer leaders said that the tractor parade would be peaceful."Over 30,000 tractors and trolleys today moved from Khanauri (in Sangrur, Punjab) and Dabwali (in Sirsa district, Haryana) to join the tractor parade in Delhi," said Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan on Saturday.They are expected to reach the Tikri border on Saturday night.Some farmers even mounted tractors on trailers and a few even towed their tractors in order to save diesel, said the farmer leaders."Some loaded their tractors in trailers and some even towed their vehicles in order to save fuel," said Kokrikalan.Similarly, a cavalcade of around 1,000 tractors left from Phagwara area and 150 tractors from Hoshiarpur in Punjab to become part of the parade, said the farmer leaders.A farmer leader in Barnala said they were getting a very good response to the call for joining the tractor parade."Youth and elders are going in their tractors towards Delhi in a peaceful manner," he said.A batch of tractors and other vehicles from Fatehabad in Haryana also left for Delhi to join the parade, they added.Many farmers from Karnal and other districts would leave for the national capital on Sunday.Independent MLA from Dadri in Haryana, Sombir Sangwan, who recently withdrew his support to the Khattar government over farmers' issue, told reporters on Saturday that the Centre will have to agree to farmers' demands.Sangwan, who had gone to meet protesting farmers at the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari, also told reporters that farmers should be freely allowed to take part in tractor parade on January 26. Kirpal Singh Moosapur, Vice-President, Bharati Kisan Union (Doaba) in Phagwara, Punjab, said, "More farmers with tractors will leave tomorrow as well. We expect over 5,000 tractors from Doaba region (in Punjab) alone to reach Delhi for the parade."Moosapur slammed the Centre for not accepting farmers' demands."Farmers have been agitating at Delhi borders for the last several weeks but the Modi government has turned a deaf ear to their demands," he said.Before heading for Delhi, many farmers got their tractors inspected from mechanics for any fault so they can have a hassle-free journey, said the farmer leaders.At many places in Punjab and Haryana, tractor marches were taken out on Saturday to mobilise more people for the tractor parade.Meanwhile, some women in Bathinda said they have asked their male members who are at the Delhi borders not to worry about homes."We are taking care of the farm and other works. We have told our male members to stay put until the demands are met," said an elderly woman in Bathinda.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi's borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops. They claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the Centre says the MSP system will remain and the new laws only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cavalcades-of-tractors-from-punjab-haryana-set-out-for-r-day-tractor-parade-101611411393119.html

The polling for the 13,000-odd gram panchayats is scheduled to be held on February 5,9,13 and 17.He, however, said he would abide by whatever decision the Supreme Court would take on the conduct of local body polls. “I have complete faith in the judiciary,” he said.The Jagan government also decided to defy the SEC directions to remove as many as nine “tainted officials,” including two district collectors and a superintendent of police, who allegedly failed in preventing irregularities in the local body elections in March 2020 and curbing incidents of poll violence.The chief secretary wrote to the SEC that the government won’t take action against them at this stage as they were actively involved in the pandemic situation of Covid-19 and engaged in the implementation of the vaccination programme.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh state government employees’ federation Venkatrami Reddy found fault with the release of notification for the local body elections ignoring the Covid-19 pandemic. There is no question of taking part in the election process unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccination, he said.Reacting to the SEC warning that he would take serious action against those who did not cooperate with the SEC in the conduct of panchayat elections, Reddy said the employees were not worried about disciplinary action.“What can he do? He can, at the most, suspend a few senior officials. Can he suspend thousands of government employees with one stroke? Even if we are suspended, we would be back in our jobs the moment Kumar steps down from his post two months later,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-boycotts-panchayat-election-process-after-poll-panel-s-notification-101611411026542.html

He said the party will take enough measures to attract the youth and fulfill their aspirations. “Our manifesto will reflect people’s aspirations and emotions. It will set the tone for the poll,” Chandy said. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala will begin his state-wide yatra on January 31.This is the first time that the state unit is giving a key responsibility to the three-time MP. A hit among youngsters, the party is all set to use Tharoor’s social media outreach and inspiring lectures and writings to its advantage.The party’s central leadership has given strict instructions to the state unit to field more youngsters and women in the April-May assembly elections. The party pressed the emergency button after the ruling CPI (M) notched an emphatic win in the local body elections last month. In a recent poll survey also, the majority supported Pinarayi Vijayan as the first choice for next CM and it forced many Congress leaders to close their ranks and work for victory.Going by the poll history of the state which never gives the incumbent a chance to continue in power, the Congress was overconfident but local body results dented its expectations and the party high command stepped in.AICC observers-- Gehlot, former Goa CM Luizinho Faleior and former Karnataka deputy CM G Parameswara-- who arrived in the state on Friday held a series of talks with leaders and party legislators and MPs. They also met sulking leader K V Thomas, former Union minister, and got an assurance from him that he won’t leave the party. He will be given a new position, possibly the post of the working president, said a senior leader.Denied a Lok Sabha seat in the last election, Thomas was sulking for some time after the state leadership failed to accommodate him properly. He had approached the party seeking an assembly seat but he was told that there were specific instructions from the party high command to try more young leaders this time. After this, he started charting out his future plans and turned to the Left. Thomas later said party president Sonia Gandhi had called him and he assured her that he will work to strengthen the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-role-for-shashi-tharoor-as-kerala-congress-gets-into-poll-mode-101611408486273.html

Farmers have been allowed to enter Delhi and travel up to 100km distance on each route, farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The tractor march on Republic Day was planned for a long time but it hit a roadblock after the Centre approached the Supreme Court through Delhi Police against the march, claiming that it would dishonour country's pride if protesters attempt to disrupt Republic Day parade. The unions said that they would not disrupt the Republic Day parade.Police proposes route map for tractor rally, farmers to respond todayThe Supreme Court left the decision on whether to allow farmers' tractor march or not on the Delhi Police which held several rounds of discussion with union leaders on the issue of the tractor march.Farmers, as they have been preparing for long, plan to enter the Capital on that day displaying their tableaux of tractors belonging to different states. But Delhi Police initially did not agree to allow them to enter the Capital apprehending disruption in law and order situation. Instead, the farmers were asked to hold their tractor march on the Kundli border, which the union leaders didn't accept and remained stuck to their plan of holding the march on the Outer Ring Road.On Friday, the Delhi Police proposed a route map for the tractor march on which discussions were held on Saturday following which farmers have been allowed to take their march up to 100km inside Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-republic-day-tractor-march-in-delhi-allowed-unions-urge-for-peace-101611409236771.html

It (Ramani's claim of Akbar's sexual misconduct in a hotel) is complete hearsay, fabricated and false,” Luthra saidShe said that Nilofer, Ramani's friend and a key witness in the case, was not an eyewitness.The court will further hear the matter on January 27.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018. He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as "media's biggest predator" that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment he faced from the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metoo-ramani-s-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct-false-akbar-reiterates-before-delhi-court-101611403887763.html

He mentioned Banerjee's name as he mentioned all other dignitaries present at the event, and referred her as 'behen'.Amid the ongoing tussle between the Centre and the West Bengal government on one hand and BJP and Trinamool on the other — ahead of the assembly elections in the state — Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee were seen together as PM Modi took a tour at Victoria Memorial ahead of the event.The celebration of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's 125th birth anniversary has been a flaring point between the Trinamool and the BJP as the Centre on January 19 announced that from this year January 23 will be celebrated as 'Parakram Divas'.Early in the day, Mamata Banerjee led a march in Kolkata — from Shyambazar yo Red Road and attacked the Centre for noticing Netaji's birth anniversary only in the year when the state is scheduled to go to the assembly polls. Banerjee also questioned why Centre called it 'Parakram Divas', why January 23 is not a national holiday, why there is no memorial for Netaji. Banerjee also made it a point to mention that the West Bengal government celebrates the day every year, not only in the election year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-speak-at-this-platform-mamata-feels-insulted-at-centre-s-netaji-event-101611402576235.html

Karnataka is where the maximum amount of adolescent girls enjoyed easy access to digital or mobile devices, with 65 per cent."Boys have easier access. In Haryana, the gender gap is the widest, while Telangana reported the lowest difference between the percentage of boys and girls having digital access (12 per cent)," it said.The survey said family attitudes and biases restrict the time given to girls to access a digital device – 42 per cent of girls are allowed access to a mobile phone for less than an hour in a day.And on top of this, the survey found that 65 per cent of teachers and 60 per cent of community organisations say being a girl is a factor in accessing digital technology. Most parents felt that a mobile phone is "unsafe" and an "unhealthy distraction" for an adolescent girl, the survey said."Even when families and adolescents can afford smartphones, computers or other digital devices, it is always the male family members' usage of such devices that is prioritized," the survey found.Noting that financial affordability is a major cause for lack of access, the survey said 71 per cent of the girls do not own a mobile phone because they cannot afford it."81 per cent of families say they cannot afford one, while 79 per cent do not have a computer at home," it said.Access to digital modes in community facilities like schools, community centres and internet cafes is limited -- 83 per cent of the girls get less than an hour's access in a week, the survey said.The survey found that girls also remain at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to digital literacy as only 32 per cent of adolescent girls know how to "receive calls" on a mobile.About 26 per cent know how to "use features like clock, calculator, torch and other offline apps", it said."A mere 15 per cent know how to use online apps and 16 per cent of parents said their daughters had no knowledge of computers," the survey said.Releasing the findings of the survey to mark National Girl Child Day, Dr Aparajita Gogoi, Executive Director, C3 said the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the inequalities girls in India face."The aim of our survey has been to suggest a framework to address the everyday challenges adolescent girls experience in owning, accessing, understanding and using digital technology," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/42-pc-girls-allowed-access-to-mobile-phone-for-less-than-an-hour-a-day-survey-101611396826507.html

It took many hours for forest officials to remove the calf to a nearby elephant rehabilitation centre after firing sedation shots. Many forest officials were in tears after watching the baby jumbo’s plight.“It seems to be a 40-year-old milking elephant and the baby is healthy. No external injuries were found on the body of the mother. We are not suspecting poisoning now because if it was so, the baby should also have tasted the same food,” said divisional forest office of Thiruvananthapuram, Pradeep Kumar. He said the carcass will be sent for an autopsy and the exact reason of the death can be ascertained after examining the internal organs.Rubber tappers of the estate first noticed the carcass of the wild elephant and trumpeting baby in the morning and alerted forest officials. They were not allowed to come near the carcass by the angry baby. And it took nearly five hours for officials to remove the baby elephant from the site.Officials said they waited for some time for the jumbo herd to come back to take care of the baby elephant but their efforts were in vain and they decided to shift the calf to Kotoor, the country’s first elephant rehabilitation centre in Thiruvananthapuram district, home to 15 elephants including seven abandoned and injured calves. Local people said jumbo incursion into human settlements was regular in the area.The latest incident surfaced when the state was yet to recover from the shocking tale of ‘leopard curry.’ Forest officials had arrested five villagers in Idukki district who killed a six-year-old leopard after laying a snare and trapping it and later feasted on its meat on Friday. During the raid, officials recovered cooked leopard meat curry, uncooked meat, teeth, nails and skin of the killed cat.Shocked forest officials said it was the first time they came across a ‘leopard curry’. Initially they thought that the cat might have been trapped in the snare accidentally put up to net wild boars. But later the accused told officials they did it deliberately to trap the big cat that strayed into their habitat and often killed their pets and cattle.“The animal had recently killed a goat of Vinod P K, one of the accused and he and his friends laid a snare using brake cable, net and other materials. The animal was netted on Wednesday and they killed it and later distributed its meat,” said Mankulam forest range officer V B Udayasooryan. He said the animal weighed around 50 kg. The incident came to light two days later after one of the informers alerted forest officials.Later, officials recovered 10 kg of uncooked meat and other remains of the animal from the houses of the accused. They said the accused were planning to sell the skin, teeth and nails of the big cat.“It is a shocking incident. Killing of wild animals occurs but this is the first time we are hearing that its meat was consumed. A special investigation team will be constituted soon,” said another senior forest official. During the investigation, officials found they killed many such wild animals including boars, deer and flying squirrels like this earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wild-elephant-found-dead-in-kerala-s-kallar-calf-s-plight-moves-forest-staff-101611400096116.html

We would appreciate your kind consideration of half of the supply and, if necessary, we would be willing to purchase the other 100,000 doses should it meet your favorable consideration," PM Mottley wrote in her letter adding that the situation in her country has been exceptionally challenging as it has been affected by two waves of the virus.Watch: India sends vaccines to Nepal & BangladeshPM Mottley also underlined how India and Barbados have enjoyed a long history of good relations. She also said that Barbados’ economy is highly dependent on travel and tourism and the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a fall of 90 per cent in tourists' arrival in 2020. This caused a significant fall in government revenue and economic activity, she wrote.According to the letter, all medical and national security installations of Barbados have been heavily strained by the pandemic. “Persons who are on the front-line of our response to COVID-19 across the medical, protective services and border agencies will need to get immediate access to vaccines. Similarly, we need it for other critical people on the frontline,” she wrote.Under the Vaccine Maitri commitment, India has already been shipping consignments of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured in India - Covishield, and Covaxin by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech - to its neighbours. Countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and friendly nations such as Maldives, Seychelles, Brazil and Morocco have already received the first shipments.Also read: Will India send vaccines to Pak if there is a request?Earlier in the week, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit of Dominica, Barbados’s neighbour in the Caribbean, also had written a letter to PM Modi seeking for Covishield vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barbados-pm-writes-to-pm-modi-seeking-2-lakh-doses-of-covishield-101611399366063.html
23-01-2021||India||Mask mandate, immunity, climate helped India lower Covid-19 cases: Report||From a Covid-19 hotspot nation with over 90,000 cases in a day four months ago to recording its lowest daily infection tally, India is seeing a steady decline in cases, showing a grasp over handling of the coronavirus disease outbreak.The decline in rising cases can be attributed to India's stringent mask mandate enforced by the government, the country's demography, robust inherent immunity among people who have battled diseases like Malaria, Typhoid and Dengue, and a comparatively warmer climate, according to experts as quoted by the npr.org.Also read: Where India stands in global Covid-19 spreadThe report quoted health policy expert Genevie Fernandes who said mask mandates are one of the things that may have helped bring down India's Covid-19 caseload. The worst-affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Delhi among several displayed stringency in asking people to wear masks whenever they step outside. Non-compliance with the instruction carried a hefty fine."...In this particular case, the police, the monitoring, enforcement, that was ramped up. Every time they fine a person 200 rupees, they also give them a mask to wear," Fernandes told NPR.The number of new cases India reported in August and September was more than any other country (the US, with half the number of new cases, was in the second position). In terms of deaths as well, India was the country with the highest number of reported Covid-19-related deaths in September.Another factor that may be helping India is the widespread heat and humidity. "There is some evidence they may reduce the virus' spread," Dr Daksha Shah, a government epidemiologist, told NPR."The temperature, of course, is in the favor. We do not have too much cold climate over here. So many of the viruses, they are known to multiply more in the colder regions," Shah said.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageRobust immunity has also been backed as a reason that may have helped India fight the global disease outbreak better.India's population exhibits inherent immunity to so many infections, the government epidemiologist said.She adds: "Malaria, typhoid, dengue fever are all endemic in India. People with robust immune systems are more likely to survive here in the first place, Shah says. Plus, more than half of the population is under age 25. They're less likely to die of Covid-19 and more likely to get it asymptomatically. But India's climate and demographics have not changed during the pandemic, and the drop in cases here has been recent."Without ruling out virus' mutant behaviour, health economist Jishnu Das told NPR that akin to the deadly virus which was first found in the UK, a less infectious variant may have mutated in India.All this remains under consideration as even scientists don't know the clear picture."Three options. One is it's gone because of the way people behaved. So we need to continue that behavior, right? It's gone because it's gone and it's never going to come back - great. Or it's gone - we don't know why it's gone and it may come back," NPR quoted Das as saying.An average of nearly 22,000 new cases was recorded in India every day in the week ending December 27, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. This is less than a quarter of the nearly 92,000 daily new cases reported on average in mid-September. This drop in new cases is not a reflection of a global trend.This is in sharp contrast to countries like the US and Russia where the cases continue to grow.India imposed a stringent lockdown to curb the spread of the viral contagion in late March while its daily new cases peaked in the middle of September.India’s share of new confirmed infections in the world kept increasing every month in this period. Less than 1% of the new cases in March were reported from India while its share in new cases in September was an overwhelming 31%, which means nearly every third positive case in the world was reported in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-mandate-immunity-climate-helped-india-lower-covid-19-cases-report-101611394444383.html

Kolkata has to be made the second capital of India,” Banerjee said while addressing a public rally in Kolkata to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.The Bengal CM made the remark a few hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to arrive in Kolkata for six-hours to celebrate Netaji’s birth anniversary.“Why should there be only one capital. India should have four capitals in four corners of the country. Parliament sessions should be held in all the four capitals,” she said while directing TMC MPs to raise the demand in Parliament.The chief minister said that one capital should be set up in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka or Kerala. Another capital should be made in states like Uttar Pradesh, Punjab or Rajasthan. Another capital should be there to cater to states like Bihar, Odisha or Kolkata in Bengal. The fourth one could be set up in the north east.“One leader, one nation, one ration card, one political party – this point of view needs to change,” she added.Earlier in the day the West Bengal chief minister attacked the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre over dismantling the Planning Commission.“National Planning Commission was Netaji's brain-child. But that has been dissolved. I would like to put this question today. If we love Netaji, why was the commission dissolved?” Banerjee said.“Why should parliament session be held in Delhi alone? What is there is Delhi? In Delhi most people are outsiders,” she said while quickly adding that people in Delhi are nice and they welcome everyone. She also said that she shares a cordial rapport with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-rotating-capitals-in-4-corners-of-india-demands-cm-mamata-ahead-of-pm-s-visit-101611395344121.html

We have to come out of the colonial mindset," he asserted.Observing that different leaders approached the freedom movement in different ways, the vice president said the ultimate goal was to achieve the country's freedom from colonial rule.Noting that Netaji wanted abolition of the caste system in the country, Naidu said as far back as in the 1940s, soldiers of all castes, creeds and religions lived together, ate together in common kitchens and fought as Indians first and last.Bose always used to stress that the progress of India would be possible only with the uplift of the downtrodden and marginalised sections of the society, he said.The vice president recalled that Bose believed in giving an equal pedestal to women in every sphere of life -- be it social, economic, or political."The progressiveness of Netaji's ideas can be gauged from his decision to form a women's corps in the INA named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment," he said and appreciated the government's decision to provide permanent commission to women in the armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youngsters-should-take-inspiration-from-netaji-s-life-venkaiah-naidu-101611394290348.html

23-01-2021||India||On Parakram Diwas, a look at Bose’s Indian National Army||The Indian National Army (INA), also known as the Azad Hind Fauj, was an armed force formed by Indian nationalists, through the patronage of the Imperial Japanese Army, to secure India's independence. First formed in 1942 by Mohan Singh with Indian prisoners of war of the British Indian army captured by Japan in the Malayan campaign and in Singapore, INA was revived by Subhas Chandra Bose in 1943.Here’s everything you need to know about the Indian National Army:1. After the outbreak of World War II, Japan invaded Southeast Asia and conducted a lightning campaign which culminated in the fall of the Malayan peninsula and Singapore in 1942. From the prisoners of war who were captured, the Japanese created an auxiliary army to fight against the British which led to the formation of the first INA under Mohan Singh. Singh was a former officer of the British Indian army. But disagreements between Mohan Singh and Japanese army command regarding the autonomy of the Indian National Army led to the disbandment of the first INA in December 1942.2. After this Mohan Singh recommended Subhas Chandra Bose as the leader of the second INA. The Japanese were ready to support him and invited him to Singapore in July 1943 to take command of the second Indian National Army.3. Under Bose's leadership, there was a swell of volunteers in the INA. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose named the brigades/regiments of INA after Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Azad, and himself. There was also an all-women regiment named after Rani of Jhansi, Lakshmibai.4. The INA participated in operation U-Go, the 1944 Japanese campaign towards British India. Following Japan’s defeat in World War 2, most of the members of the INA were captured by the British. Subash Chandra Bose himself eluded capture and was reported to have died in a plane crash near Taiwan in September 1945.5. The surviving members of the INA were to be tried by the British colonial government for treason. As the trials were to take place at the Red Fort, they led to a new wave of nationalism in the country as the Indian population saw the members as patriots fighting for independence.6. The trial also led to a mutiny within the British Indian army, with most notable being that of the Royal Indian Navy. This made the British realise that they were effectively losing the support of the army and their exit from India therefore became inevitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-parakram-diwas-a-look-at-bose-s-indian-national-army-101611393163491.html

This tunnel is also the 10th to be found in the Jammu region.“The BSF has detected a 150 meters to 175 meters-long trans-border tunnel along the Indo-Pak international border in Kathua district. It is 30 feet deep and has a diameter of two to three feet,” said BSF inspector general NS Jamwal.“The tunnel appears to be six to eight years old and it has been found at the same place where BSF had shot down a Pakistani drone last year on June 20,” Jamwal added.The BSF IG said that the tunnel has been detected near the Pansar post of the BSF.“Across the international border, it originated from Shakargarh. Just opposite to the tunnel, Pakistan has its Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre De Kothe posts,” said the IG.Jamwal said that such tunnels cannot be built without the involvement of the Pakistani establishment.“A proper engineering effort has gone into this tunnel as well, he said, and added that possibilities of it having been used by Pakistani terrorists cannot be ruled out.The tunnel was detected between border pillar number 14 and 15, said the IG.The BSF troops had also foiled an infiltration bid in the same area in November 2019. On June 20 last year, BSF had shot down a Pakistani drone in Rathua area around 5.10 am. The drone fell into a field. The BSF had recovered a M-4 US-made semi-automatic rifle, 60 rounds in two magazines and seven M67 grenades among other items.The hexa copter drone itself weighed around 17.5 kilograms and the consignment weighed around five to six kilograms.There has been a spike in the incidents of Pakistani drones dropping arms, ammunition, drugs along the international border and line of control in Jammu and Kashmir.Pakistan has been digging trans-border tunnels along the international border, especially in Kathua and Samba sectors.On January 13, BSF detected another trans-border tunnel along the 198km long Indo-Pak international border in Bobbyian village of Hiranagar sector in Kathua district.Also Read: India calls out Pakistan on religious freedomThe tunnel was 150 meters to 160 meters long with a diameter of two feet to three feet.

But that has been disbanded. I would like to put this question today. If we love Netaji, why was the commission dissolved?” Banerjee asked.The Narendra Modi government disbanded the Planning commission in 2014 and formed Niti Aayog. The Planning Commission, set up in 1950, was a government institution which formulated India’s Five-Year Plans besides performing other functions.The Centre has announced that it would celebrate Bose's birth anniversary as Parakram Diwas (day of valour). The Mamata Banerjee-administration in West Bengal has declared that the state would celebrate the day as Deshnayak Divas. The chief minister launched the celebration in the state by blowing a conch shell“I don’t know whether Parakram is a Bengali word, English word or a Sanskrit word. All I understand is that he [Bose] was a Desh Nayak. We would be celebrating this day as Desh Nayak Day because Rabindranath Tagore first described Netaji as Desh Nayak.”She was addressing a gathering organised at Netaji Bhawan, the ancestral house of Bose in south Kolkata.Benerjee changed her plans at the last minute and headed to Netaji Bhawan where Modi is also expected to visit later in the day during his six-hour stay to Kolkata. She later visited Shyambazar in North Kolkata to pay tribute to Netaji to start the day’s celebrations. A huge statue of Netaji, riding a horse, is located at the five-point crossing at Shaymbazar crossing.“A grand padyatra will be held today. This year's Republic Day parade in Kolkata will also be dedicated to Netaji. A siren will be sounded today at 12.15 pm. We urge everyone to blow shankhs at home. The Centre must also declare January 23 as a National Holiday. A monument, named after Azad Hind Fauj, will be built at Rajarhat. A university named after Netaji is also being set up which shall be funded entirely by the state, and will have tie-ups with foreign universities. #DeshNayakDibas,” Banerjee tweeted earlier in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-attack-centre-over-disbanding-netaji-s-brainchild-101611391679822.html

"But the said appointment was thereafter not notified and the post of chairman is lying vacant since then."The plea, filed on January 20, also referred to a response received under the Right to Information Act and said there has been acute shortage of secretarial and other staffers in the tribunal, adversely impacting the functioning of the tribunal.It said the court in numerous cases has held that "justice delayed is justice denied" but the ATPMLA, New Delhi, is "struggling to dispense justice particularly in absence of its Chairman and three members out of sanctioned strength of four and acute shortage of administrative staff”.The plea added that the ATPMLA deals with "sensitive and crucial matters" pertaining to Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA), the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Prohibition Of Benami Property Transactions Act (PBPT).The plea, filed through lawyer Preeti Singh, said the Finance Ministry has failed to take appropriate steps in filling up vacancies in the tribunal on a priority basis and in an expeditious manner."The tribunal is mandated to consist of a Chairman, who has to be a retired Judge of this Court or High Court and Four Members, who can be from the fields of Law, Finance and Management. But the Tribunal is constrained to function with its sole member and therefore sufficient number of matters cannot be taken up in absence of Presiding Officers," it said.The very object for constituting tribunals is to supplement the functions of the High Courts and the other courts and to ensure that consumer of justice gets speedy redressal to his grievances, it said.The plea said the CPIO of the tribunal informed that "there are 2822 cases of PMLA, 66 cases of SAFEMA, 270 cases of NDPS, 1077 cases of FEMA and 1134 cases of PBPT are pending before the Tribunal and there were 23 vacancies in the tribunal".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-seeking-direction-to-govt-to-fill-vacant-atpmla-posts-filed-in-sc-101611389051969.html

In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week.Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Since then, rates have gone up by ₹1.99 a litre on petrol and ₹2.01 in case of diesel.This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India.Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018.At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence.Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-diesel-prices-touch-all-time-highs-101611387326175.html
23-01-2021||India||Pak’s secret tunnel to push terrorists for 8 years in Jammu detected by BSF||The Border Security Force on Saturday found a 150-metre long underground tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir that had been used by Pakistani intelligence to infiltrate terrorists into India. This is the second tunnel to be spotted in 10 days by the border guarding force that last year went on campaign mode to detect and destroy a web of tunnels believed to have been built by Pakistan’s deep state, a senior BSF official said on Saturday.The 30-feet deep tunnel has been detected between Border Post number 14 and 15 near BSF’s outpost at Pansar, Kathua district. On the other side of the fence are Pakistani border outposts of Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-de-Kothe in Shakargarh district.Pakistan’s Shakargarh, the area across the fence, is home to a terror training facility overseen by one of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s operational commander Kasim Jan who, Indian intelligence believes, was involved in the November 19 Nagrota encounter in Jammu and is the principal accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack. Jan is also one of the main launch commanders of Jaish terrorists into India.“This is huge,” a senior BSF official said. Because the tunnel appears to be at least 6 to 8 years old and would have been used for infiltration for a long time. Also, it is located in a place that has seen action in the past, right from 2012 when Pakistan had mounted a heavy fire assault on the forward duty point and constructed a new bunker on the zero line in the vicinity.Not far from where the tunnel was found, a BSF assistant commandant Vinay Prasad who was leading a border domination patrol was killed by sniper fire from across the border in January 2019. Ten months later, a group of terrorists was noticed in the same area in November 2019.Also Read: Tunnels, drones part of Pakistan’s strategy to keep Jammu sector activeIt is very important to detect all the tunnels built by the Pakistani military and its terrorists because the infiltration of terrorists through them practically nullifies the utility of deployment of soldiers along the Line of Control. When it becomes too difficult to cross the LoC, Pakistani terrorists use these tunnels, a senior counterterror official said in Delhi.Watch: BSF officer enters tunnel used by Jaish terrorists in Nov, nails Pakistan roleBorder Security Force director general Rakesh Asthana had ordered the force to step up efforts to detect tunnels after the Nagrota encounter in November when security forces were able to trace the route taken by the terrorists who had crossed over using one of the many tunnels that the Pakistani military have built for the terrorists to sneak into India.Security officials underscore that proper engineering effort had gone into the construction of the tunnels that had been detected in recent times, pointing to the involvement of the Pakistani military along the heavily-guarded border.BSF seizes weaponsMeanwhile, the BSF carried out an intelligence-backed raid in Poonch district that led to the seizure of one AK-47 rifle, three China-made pistols, an under-barrel grenade launder and a radio set.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paks-secret-tunnel-to-push-terrorists-for-8-years-in-jammu-detected-by-bsf-101611386495290.html

23-01-2021||India||PM Modi gives 106,000 land certificates in 1st visit ahead of Assam polls||In his first visit to Assam, where assembly election is scheduled in April-May, Prime Minister Narendra Modi distributed land allotment certificates to 106,000 landless indigenous families on Saturday. He personally handed over certificates to 10 recipients.“When our party came to power in Assam there were nearly 600,000 families who were landless and had no land documents. Earlier governments didn’t care for these families. But our government started working on it earnestly to give them land certificates,” he said.The PM said allotment of these certificates would ensure benefit of several central and state government schemes to these families and they would even be able to take bank loans based on land ownership.As part of the initiative, landless families in rural areas will get seven ‘bighas’ of agricultural land and another one ‘bigha’ to construct houses. One ‘bigha’ is equal to 14,400 sq. ft. In urban areas, allotment would be 1.10 ‘katha’ and in Guwahati, it would be 1.50 ‘katha’. One ‘katha’ in Assam is equal to 2,880 sq. ft.Modi addressed a large gathering estimated to be over 200,000 at Jerenga Pathar, a historic site where Joymoti, an Ahom princess, sacrificed her life in 17th century to protect the life of her husband Prince Godapani, who went on to become a king of the Ahom dynasty.“Jerenga Pathar is the ‘balidan-bhoomi’ (sacrifice land) of Joymati. I salute her indomitable courage and this land. Considering the importance of this place, we are taking steps to include it in a list of five iconic archaeological sites in the country,” said the PM.Jerenga Pathar is located in Sivasagar district in upper Assam, which was earlier called Rangpur and was one of the capitals of the Ahom dynasty for nearly six centuries.Giving land rights to indigenous landless families was an important promise made in 2016 by the BJP, which came to power in Assam with the slogan of protecting ‘jaati’, ‘maati’ and ‘bheti’ (community, land and hearth).According to government data, the state had around 575,000 landless families in 2016. Since coming to power five years ago, the government has given land allotment certificates to nearly 228,000 such families. Saturday’s event was a continuation of that initiative.Also Read: PM Narendra Modi to visit Kolkata to celebrate Netaji’s 125th birth anniversaryIn his speech, Modi listed the central and state schemes that have benefited people in the state in the past few years. He also highlighted the schemes for the tea-tribe community, which is influential in many assembly constituencies in upper Assam.“The steps taken by our government in the past four and half years have ensured protection of rights of the state’s indigenous people and ensured peace and development,” said chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in his address.Modi’s visit was preceded by torch rallies across the state on Friday evening against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), carried out by the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and several indigenous organizations.AASU, which spearheaded the anti-CAA protests in the state in December 2019, launched a three-day protest against the legislation beginning Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-gives-106-000-land-certificates-in-1st-visit-ahead-of-assam-polls-101611386524596.html

We are questioning him, but nothing has so far been found that points to any kind of conspiracy, as is being alleged," the official said, adding that further investigations are underway.At the Singhu border press conference late on Friday night, the farmer leaders presented the man who claimed that his accomplices were asked to pose as policemen and baton-charge the crowd during the proposed tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.The farmer leaders claimed that they caught the man from the protest site at the Singhu border. He was subsequently handed over to the Haryana police.Farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu alleged that attempts are being made to disrupt the ongoing agitation against three farm laws.The man, who had his face covered with a scarf, claimed at the press conference that a plan was hatched to shoot four farmer leaders, who are known faces in the media, at the stage on Saturday."On January 26, there was a plan to create disturbance during the tractor parade by opening fire on Delhi Police personnel, which would prompt them to retaliate against the protesting farmers in a strong manner," he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-handed-over-to-haryana-police-by-farmer-leaders-being-quizzed-101611384607780.html

23-01-2021||India||Don’t destroy your kids’ childhood in your ego clashes: SC to warring couples||The Supreme Court has cautioned warring couples against destroying the childhood of their kids and the bond between siblings while they exasperate each other through endless litigation. “In this endeavour to destroy each other, such couples destroy the childhood of their kids. Torn between their parents, children are left confused, and they lose the bond they should have with their siblings. We always say that these are not the cases for a court to adjudicate. When a couple has a fallout and they come to a court, everything is hit below the belt,” said a bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul. The bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, regretted that the top court has to deal with several such cases where “children have to suffer because of the ego of their parents.” The comments came while the bench spoke to a woman in tears and her estranged husband during a hearing through videoconferencing on Monday. The court lamented that the couple, which had a love marriage around two decades ago, is “now hell-bent on destroying each other even at the cost of their children’s well-being and their future.” During the proceeding, Justice Kaul also counselled the couple: “You were once in love. You had three children together. And look at yourself now. In your attempt to exasperate each other, you care about nothing else, not your children and not even your own happiness.” The judge said that despite having a good education and financial background, both of them are focussed only on pulling each other down instead of making out something better of their lives. “Just think about your children and if not them, for yourself. Why can’t you two think of a time in future when you can meet sometime, have a cup of coffee with each other. Why can’t you two move on? If not for anyone else, for your own self...” Kaul told the couple. The couple was before the court on the contention where their children should study. The three children have the dual citizenship of the USA and Thailand, but the parents would not agree with each other on their school or college. In a previous order, the bench had sent one of the three sons for higher studies to the USA even though the mother opposed it. The question of where the youngest son will go for his schooling had remained pending, as the mother favoured he should go to Thailand whereas the father wanted him to stay in Mumbai. The bench ordered that the youngest child will go to a school in Thailand and thereafter to the USA for higher studies just like his elder siblings. “It is better for your children to stay away from both of you until you give up this animosity. Also, you both agreed that your children will take the citizenship of Thailand and the USA. But now you want a court in this country to spend its judicial time on all this. We take strong exception to this.” The bench concluded in its order: “Insofar as the parties are concerned, they seem to be on an endless journey of battling each other and we wish them good luck in their endeavour!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-destroy-your-kids-childhood-in-your-ego-clashes-sc-to-warring-couples-101611383569725.html

The corps commander-level talks will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the officials said.Senior commanders had last met on November 6. The situation in the Ladakh sector remains tense and the ongoing military dialogue has not led to any breakthrough.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said that the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China are prolonged.During the eighth round of talks on November 6, the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Experts said talks are deadlocked because of serious differences between the two sides on the conditions of disengagement.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months.The PLA recently moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged, as previously reported by the Hindustan Times.Earlier, Naravane said India should not read too much into the withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no cut in troop strength by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector, where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.He said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-ninth-round-of-corps-commander-level-talks-tomorrow-101611383025729.html

Our tableau will showcase the ancient heritage of the town, revered by countless people across the country," an official of the Uttar Pradesh government, accompanying the state team, said.A group of artistes, including two women dancers will be part of the tableau and one person will be dressed up as Lord Ram.A media preview of the various tableaux, including a total of 17 states and union territories, was held at the Republic Day's cultural camp at Delhi Cantonment on Friday.Ajay Kumar, who wore a yellow silk dhoti and rudraksh garland around his neck and held a bow in his hand, said, "I am very excited and happy that Ayodhya and its heritage will be showcased in our tableau and I have been chosen to play our beloved Lord Ram"."We have been waiting to see Ayodhya's heritage being showcased on Rajpath," said Kumar, a resident of Laxmangarh in Chandauli district, as he posed for photographers.Ayodhya's Deepotsav celebrations with earthen lamps is depicted on one side of the tableau, while other murals show embracing of Nishadraj by Lord Ram and eating of Shabri's berry by him, salvation of Ahilya, bringing of Sanjeevani by Lord Hanuman, Jatayu-Ram samvad, Ashok Vatika and other scenes.On November 9, 2019, the Supreme Court had settled the fractious Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue going back more than a century and backed the construction of a Ram temple by a trust at the disputed site. It also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for a mosque in the Hindu holy town.Prime Minister Narendra Modi last August had performed the 'bhoomi pujan' of a Supreme Court-mandated Ram temple in Ayodhya, bringing to fruition the BJP's mandir movement that defined its politics for three decades and took it to the heights of power.The Ram temple is scheduled for completion in 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/replica-of-ram-temple-ayodhya-s-heritage-to-be-showcased-in-up-s-r-day-tableau-101611379967677.html

23-01-2021||India||Survey estimates 73 snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh||A survey to assess the population of snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh has found that there are an estimated 73 big cats in the Himalayan state, Forest minister Rakesh Pathania said.Snow leopards live in several Himalayan states of India but a scientific estimate of their population has never been made before anywhere in the country because the animal lives in remote, high-altitude regions and is elusive by nature.In Himachal Pradesh, the survey to assess the population of snow leopards was held by the state wildlife wing in collaboration with the Nature Conservation Foundation Mysore following the Snow Leopard Population Assessment in India protocols set by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change.A similar assessment is underway in several other states and UTs, including Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, with Himachal Pradesh now becoming the first state to complete it.Pathania said that the first of its kind assessment revealed that snow leopard density in the state ranges from 0.08 to 0.37 individuals per 100 square kilometres, with the trans-Himalayan regions of Spiti, Pin valley and upper Kinnaur recording the highest densities of both the predator and its prey (mainly ibex and blue sheep).The minister said the study covered the entire potential snow leopard habitat of Himachal Pradesh -- an area of 26,112 square kilometers -- utilising a stratified sampling design.Camera trapping surveys were conducted at 10 sites to representatively sample all the strata i.e. high, low and unknown, Pathania said.The camera trap deployment over the mountainous terrains was led by a team of eight young persons from Kibber village, he added.More than 70 frontline staff of the forest department was trained in this technique as part of the project, Pathania further said.Snow leopards were detected at all the 10 sites -- Bhaga, Chandra, Bharmour, Kullu, Miyar, Pin, Baspa, Tabo, Hangrang and Spiti -- suggesting that the animal was found in the entire snow leopard habitat in Himachal Pradesh either as resident individuals of a population or as dispersing individuals navigating through these connecting habitats, he said.The minister said it is the first scientifically robust estimate of snow leopard and its prey for the state.“Another revelation from the study is that a bulk of snow leopard occurrence is outside the protected areas, reiterating the fact that local communities are the strongest allies for conservation in snow leopard landscapes,” he said.“The assessment will serve as a robust baseline for the wildlife wing for long-term monitoring of the snow leopard landscape,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survey-estimates-73-snow-leopards-in-himachal-pradesh-101611373154718.html
23-01-2021||India||Parakram Diwas: Remembering Subhas Chandra Bose on his birth anniversary||Popularly known as 'Netaji', Subhas Chandra Bose is one of the many freedom fighters who laid their lives for the nation. This year, the central government has decided to observe Bose's birth anniversary as 'Parakram Diwas'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will participate in the first Parakram Diwas event in Kolkata and inaugurate an exhibition on the grounds of the National Library to mark the occasion.Here’s everything you need to know about Netaji and Parakram Diwas:1. 'Netaji' was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack in Odisha. He graduated from Kolkata and proved his mettle by becoming an Indian Civil Services (ICS) officer. But he left the comfort and amenities that came with his job and decided to be part of the freedom struggle. With the slogan “Give me blood and I will give you freedom”, he awakened the country towards fighting against the British.Read more: 'Great freedom fighter, true son of Mother India: PM Modi pays tribute to Subhas Chandra Bose2. Netaji built a force known as the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) giving the slogan of “Dilli Chalo”. Thousands of soldiers of his 60,000-strong army sacrificed their lives for the country.3. At the time of India’s Independence, Clement Attlee the British Prime Minister said that the loyalty of the Indian army and navy to the British state was declining due to the increasing military activities of Bose’s Azad Hind Fauj and this was one of the major reasons that nudged Britishers into leaving India.4. The Centre has also planned to celebrate Bose’s 125th birth anniversary in 2022. A panel headed by Union home minister Amit Shah has been made for the same. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, her predecessor, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the BJP’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh, among others, are part of the panel.5. The announcement by the Centre over Parakram Diwas was mired in controversies. West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Forward Bloc, which was formed by Bose in 1939, have alleged that they were not consulted in the decision-making process for Parakram Diwas. The TMC also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of performing a “stunt” ahead of the assembly elections in Bengal, where Bose is an icon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parakram-diwas-remembering-subhas-chandra-bose-on-his-birth-anniversary-101611372389660.html

The Home Office has previously said that the delay in signing off was due to a technicality.There has been speculation that Mallya has sought asylum in the UK, which can be requested on a number of grounds, from a human rights perspective to political asylum.At the High Court on Friday, Mallya's lawyer Philip Marshall said: "The extradition was upheld but he (Vijay Mallya) is still here because as you know there is another route for him to apply to the Secretary of State for the status," said Vijay Mallya's barrister Philip Marshall.The submission was made during Mallya's case at the Companies and Solvency Division of the High Court where he is appealing for substantial funds to be released to him to cover his living expenses as well as the vast legal fees that he has accrued and continues to do so.Mallya has specifically asked for funds from the sale of a luxury property he owned, located on an island off the French Riviera and amounting to nearly £3 million to be released to him.The money is held in the UK's Court Funds Office (CFO) as part of bankruptcy proceedings brought by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) in lieu of loans that went unpaid by Mallya and Kingfisher Airlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-appeals-to-uk-home-secy-for-another-route-to-stay-in-the-uk-101611370276364.html

23-01-2021||India||Five held in Kerala for killing leopard and eating its meat||Five villagers from Kerala’s Idukki, who ensnared a six-year-old leopard and feasted on its meat after killing it, were arrested by forest officials on Friday after a tip-off. During the raid, officials recovered cooked leopard meat, uncooked meat, teeth, nails and skin of the killed cat.Shocked forest officials said it was the first time they came across such an incident. Initially, they thought that the cat might have been trapped accidentally in the snare, put up to net wild boars. But later, the accused told officials they did it deliberately to trap the big cat that strayed into their habitat and often killed their pets and cattle.“The animal had recently killed a goat owned by Vinod P K, one of the accused and he and his friends laid a snare using auto brake cable, net and other materials. The animal was netted on Wednesday before it was killed by its captors and its meat distributed,” said Mankulam forest range officer V B Udayasooryan. He said the animal weighed around 50 kg. The incident came to light two days later after one of the informers alerted forest officials.Officials recovered 10 kg of uncooked meat and other remains of the animal from the houses of the accused. They said the accused were planning to sell the skin, teeth and nail of the big cat. “It is a shocking incident. Killing of wild animals do occur but this is the first time we are hearing that its meat was consumed. A special investigation team will be constituted soon,” said another senior forest officer.Leopard was listed in the schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and the accused will get a maximum punishment of seven-year jail and a heavy fine, said the forest official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-held-in-kerala-for-killing-leopard-and-eating-its-meat-101611368530401.html

23-01-2021||India||Local Body elections: Andhra govt, state poll panel at loggerheads||The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government of Andhra Pradesh and state election commissioner (SEC) Ramesh Kumar on Friday headed for a showdown over the conduct of elections to village councils in the state in February.As Kumar prepared to issue a notification on Saturday for the first phase of the gram panchayat elections, the state government sent a note to the SEC asking for a deferment of the election process pending a Supreme Court directive on the matter.Meanwhile, state government employees, including those from revenue, panchayat raj and the police departments, announced that they would boycott the election process, stating that they cannot risk their lives amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In the morning, the Supreme Court rejected a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government challenging the Thursday’s state high court order giving a green signal to the SEC to go ahead with the local body elections.The apex court said there were flaws in the SLP and asked the government to file a fresh petition by Monday. The elections to as many as 13,371 gram panchayats will be held in four phases – February 5, 9, 13 and 17.Kumar rejected the state government’s appeal and announced that he would go ahead with initiating the election process.He also issued orders suspending two district collectors, a superintendent of police, two DSPs and five circle inspectors. The SEC charged them with failure to prevent irregularities and curb poll violence during the initial phase of elections to block parishad and zilla parishad elections in March 2020, before they were postponed due to the imposition of a lockdown in the country on account of Covid-19.In the afternoon, representatives of several employees’ unions met chief secretary Adityanath Das and submitted a nine-page memorandum, stating that they would not be able to participate in the gram panchayat elections until the Covid-19 vaccination programme was completed.The employees’ joint action committee leader Boppa Raju found fault with the SEC for deciding to hold elections during the vaccination period. “How can vaccination and elections be held simultaneously? We can’t take part in the election process, unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccine,” he said.With the employees refusing to cooperate, Kumar met governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and explained the situation. He asked the Governor to issue directions to the state government to cooperate with the SEC in smooth conduct of the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-body-elections-andhra-govt-state-poll-panel-at-loggerheads-101611366805139.html

The workers were digging a hole but suddenly their mechanical structure got snapped and broke the digging tool carrier due to which they fell into the pit and died,” he said.Five of the six deceased have been identified, the official said, adding that most of them are from neighbouring Assam.The bodies have been taken to the hospital for post-mortem examination, he said.Kharmalki said it was yet to ascertained if the deceased were engaged in coal or stone mining as “no coal was found in the hole they were digging”.Police have lodged a case against the employer and investigation is under way.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned coal mining in the state in 2014 over environmental concerns.At least 15 labourers were trapped after water from Lytein river inundated an illegal mine in Lumthari village, also in the same district, in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-killed-in-illegal-meghalaya-coal-mine-case-filed-against-employer-101611366312488.html
23-01-2021||India||New Congress president’s term could end in 2022||The electoral college for the election of both the Congress president and the Congress Working Committee, in this case, is the All India Congress Committee, said party functionaries. They pointed out that the election to the post of the president will be a by-election because the president will just be seen to be completing the term of the Congress president who took over in 2017 for a five-year term. This was Rahul Gandhi; he resigned in 2019, and Sonia Gandhi has been interim president since. This means there is no need as per the party constitution to convene the AICC plenary, which is made up of Pradesh Congress Committee delegates.The electorate for Congress president in the by-election are AICC delegates, pointed out two leaders who asked not to be named. “So in June, when the elections are now scheduled, the president will be elected by AICC meeting with the participation of 1500-2000 members.”“For the Congress Working Committee election, the AICC, in either case, forms the electoral college. So it remains to be seen whether the AICC, which elects the new president for a truncated term that will last till December 22 (counting five years from when Rahul Gandhi took over) decides on electing CWC or authorising the president to constitute the body. “When Rahul Gandhi was elected the president, Ghulam Nabi Azad moved a resolution to nominate the 24-member CWC (besides the president),” said a third leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-congress-president-s-term-could-end-in-2022-101611366106192.html
23-01-2021||India||PLA soldier handed over to China recently hadn’t strayed into India, says intel||Communication intercepts by Indian intelligence agencies from across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh reveal heightened activity of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) own intelligence all along the undefined border with India in an attempt to get information on Indian Army movements and the on-going border infrastructure upgrade being carried out by India.While the South Block is tight-lipped about the issue, intelligence agencies have been able to spot movement of entities in the Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO) sector near Karakoram, the contested points on banks of Pangong Tso and across the LAC in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. The movement of these entities identified on the basis of communication intercepts has been conveyed to Indian Army brass and the national security establishment at the apex level.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in an impasse all along the LAC in East Ladakh for the past eight months. The two sides have held eight rounds of talks, but not been able to arrive at a workable mechanism for de-escalation and disengagement.The arrest of an unidentified Chinese solider in the early hours of January 8 in the area south of Pangong Tso in East Ladakh came after he was tracked through technical means; intelligence officials say this was not a benign incident of a PLA trooper simply straying across the undefined border.China military online, an official website of PLA claimed: “Due to darkness and complicated geography, a solider of the Chinese PLA defence force went astray on the China-India border early Friday (January 8) morning.” The trooper was handed over by Indian Army to the Chinese side on January 11 at the Chushul Moldo point.Similarly, PLA Corporal Wang Ya Long was picked up by the Indian Army in the Demchok sector of East Ladakh on October 19 and handed back to PLA on October 21. The apprehended corporal claimed that he was trying to help local herders locate a lost yak.While PLA has tried to dismiss these incidents and claims to be committed to disengagement and de-escalation from contested points in East Ladakh, Indian intelligence agencies are worried about movement of Chinese individuals (entities or resources in intelligence lingo) in sensitive East Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal sector, with communication intercepts showing that they cross over to Indian territory and remain there for days.For example, in East Ladakh, entities have been located across DBO sector, Pangong Tso, Khurnak Fort in occupied Aksai Chin as well as in Chumbi Valley and just across the Arunachal LAC. Communication intercepts show strong Chinese activity across LAC with the construction of new roads, temporary shelters and sometime permanent settlements.Since PLA has only exchanged maps of its positions in the Central sector, the entities are using the non-demarcated border to their advantage. Given the experience with Pakistani intruders in Kargil in 1999, Indian intelligence officials said they are taking no chances.In response to the furious military infrastructure activity by PLA across LAC, the Indian Army has put the reserve troop division also called strike division attached to Eastern Command on stand-by in north Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-intel-spots-chinese-spies-along-lac-cautions-army-to-stay-alert-101611361159099.html
23-01-2021||India||Congress wants JPC to probe Arnab Goswami's WhatsApp chat transcripts||The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest executive body, on Friday stepped up its attack on the chat transcripts between journalist Arnab Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into what it called a breach of national security.The transcripts between the editor-in-chief of Republic TV and the ex-CEO of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) were a part of a Mumbai Police probe into an alleged television ratings scam. The portions of the chat referred by the Congress pertain to the 2019 Pulwama attack and India’s retaliation.“The CWC demands a timebound investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the breach of national security, violations of the Official Secrets Act and the role of the persons involved. Ultimately, those who are guilty of treasonous behaviour must be brought before the law and punished,” the CWC resolution said.CWC met on Friday to discuss dates for organisational polls, the farm protests and the chat leak. Its resolution, read out to the media by general secretaries Randeep Surjewala and KC Venugopal, said that CWC expresses its “grave concern at recent revelations “ exposing the “sordid conversations that have undoubtedly compromised national security”.The Congress maintained that people in the “highest echelons of government” were involved in the breach, raising secrecy concerns of “vital and sensitive military operations”.“The revelations also point to inexcusable and deliberate subversion of government structures, scandalous and extraneous influence over Government policies, and a vicious attack on the independence of the judiciary. The shameful compromise of the Modi Government with non-government players has been exposed,” it said.In her opening speech, too, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said, “the silence from the government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed”.Reacting to the CWC’s demand, the Republic TV management reiterated their statement on the matter issued on January 19. The statement by Goswami had said, “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime...It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. There are thousands of articles from that time suggesting a hard and tough response from the India Forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-wants-jpc-to-probe-arnab-goswami-s-whatsapp-chat-transcripts-101611365004172.html
23-01-2021||India||Follow my father’s ideology... he’d never, ever give up on idea of India: Mufti||Mehbooba Mufti, 61, was the last chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir before the momentous events of August 5, 2019, when the Centre scrapped the special status and converted the state into two Union territories. A former ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mufti, who heads the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), also spent the maximum time under detention before being freed in October 2020. She spoke to the Hindustan Times on a range of issues. Edited excerpts:How has August 5, 2019, changed you? Are you disturbed, or has it made you more determined?August 5 was a black day in the history of our country. It destroyed the trust that people of Jammu & Kashmir had placed while choosing to be a part of this country. People like me who believed in the Constitution of this country too felt cheated. It was disturbing, and quite humiliating to see our special status robbed.Do you still see yourself as an Indian or only as a Kashmiri -- a sentiment many expressed after the special status was changed?Well, it has been a very difficult and traumatic experience, swinging from one extreme to another. But my politics has revolved around my father’s ideology, and I am sure he would never ever have given up on idea of India. He believed that J&K had to be resolved to restore peace with dignity, without compromising on sovereignty of the country. It has to become a bridge of friendship rather than a battlefield between India and Pakistan. So that vision is more relevant today, and needs to be fulfilled for lasting peace in the region.Have you ever thought of quitting politics or would you be willing to be the chief minister of the UT of J&K?Yes I did think about it but then the thought of giving up on everything that my father held so dear to his heart would be a betrayal of sorts. But my politics is going to be much more than just fighting for power. I will continue my struggle for peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue.After your release, you said you don’t recognise the Indian national flag. Many called it sedition.Unfortunately, a majority of the embedded media chose to distort my statement deliberately. Because J&K’s constitution and flag was snatched unconstitutionally, I said I will wait for it to be restored, and hold both the flags together. Let’s not forget both the Indian and J&K flag derived their legitimacy from the Indian Constitution. If that amounts to sedition, then so be it. Students are called anti-nationals, activists and NGOs as urban Naxalites; Shaheen Bagh protestors as Pakistani; farmers are Khalistani; and we Kashmiri as terrorists. So in any case, dissent or criticism of the ruling party has become anti-national and sedition in today’s India.What message do you derive from the local DDC polls as far as you and your party’s political future is concerned?The message was quite clear that PDP’s strength is its vision and party worker. Despite Delhi engineering a split in our party, our workers continue to work tirelessly to fulfill the party’s vision of peace with dignity. Their hard work paid off, and even though we fought fewer seats, our strike rate was good. So that’s very encouraging.The people of Kashmir are angry with mainstream parties such as the NC and the PDP, and feel that since both have allied with the Centre, particularly the BJP, you are responsible for Aug 5. How much blame are you willing to take?We placed our faith in the Prime Minister of this country and assumed he would carry forward the peace process initiated by (former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee). Assuming that the resolution of larger J&K issue has to come from Delhi, we tried to engage the BJP by aligning with them. Sadly, the BJP views everything through the prism of petty electoral gains, and lacks the vision and resolve to take decisions that will heal and build the country. Instead, it has chosen to take India down a dark and regressive path steeped in division, bigotry, and hatred for minorities. Unfortunately, J&K became a political experimental laboratory.Let’s be candid and honest: did you ally with the BJP because of your father Mufti Saeed, or did you see some political merit in it too?My father had a political vision not only for J&K but also for the country. He put everything at stake, including his credibility, while aligning with the BJP, only with the intention to secure what we already had -- our special status – and to find a peaceful and dignified solution to the Kashmir problem. He was of the firm opinion that the resolution of Kashmir issue would not only end the bloodshed in the state but would also be in the interest of the country nationally as well as internationally. So even though I have never been a great fan of the BJP, I could not walk away from his decision.Will you ever ally with the BJP again? It was my father’s decision for a larger cause, and I honoured it. That’s that and doesn’t go beyond it.Will the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) fight elections collectively going forward?The PAGD was formed for a larger cause and fighting assembly elections separately or together is going to be a collective decision. There are bound to be teething problems as we have been political rivals traditionally. The spirit and larger purpose of this alliance will take time to reach to our grass root workers. Sajjad Lone’s leaving has been a loss too.You had said that there would be no one to hold the Tricolour if Article 370 was touched. How do you explain the lack of protests?Well the way BJP has vandalised the Constitution and are running the country on their party agenda, they themselves have sidelined everything that this country stood for. They used the Tricolor to protest in support of rapists in Kathua. Mainstream parties in J&K held the Tricolor for the last 70 years not out of fear of being called anti-nationals, but out of their conviction. But when you destroy the faith and trust that Kashmiris put in the country, how does holding or not holding the flag matter? They have terrorised and stunned people into silence. All the central agencies such as NIA, ED, CBI etc. are used to threaten people here. Such draconian measures have led to an uneasy and forced sense of calm.Are you in touch, or in occasional conversations with the current government, either directly or through the L-G and the NSA? What do you discuss with them?There hasn’t been much conversation but whenever there is, I tell them to let democracy prevail and allow people to express themselves. You can jail a person, not his ideas or thoughts.When you think of your political future -- what do you envisage?I can’t separate my destiny from that of the people of J&K anymore. We are all in it together, so we either sink or swim. For me, resolution of Kashmir is the most important issue, and it was also my father’s desire to see it resolved in a peaceful and dignified way.Do you fear being arrested again?The Enforcement Directorate has been burrowing through my bank accounts and that of my family. Since they couldn’t find any financial impropriety, they started auditing the expenditure on my father’s mausoleum. Three senior PDP leaders have been arrested for a month now without being served any order for the detention. Our youth president Waheed Parra, too, has been jailed under UAPA on flimsy charges. All this is being done to blackmail me into silence. And frankly, they are capable of anything if they can send NIA summons to an organisation such as the Khalsa Aid which has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-my-father-s-ideology-he-d-never-ever-give-up-on-idea-of-india-mufti-101611364480646.html
23-01-2021||India||‘Our only goal was to ensure that India became free’||By Sadia AkhtarOn a sunny afternoon, as one walks through the quiet lanes of Fazilpur Badli village in Farrukhnagar, a faint yet powerful lilting sound wafts through the air as one approaches the house of freedom fighter Parmanand. Dressed in a pale white kurta-pyjama, the 100-year-old lies on a charpoy in the courtyard of his house reciting fragments of poems from memory.“Gandhi, Nehru aur Subhas, Azad jo brigade they/ Singapur ke junglomein mein hum roz karte parade they,” recites Parmanand, one of the last surviving members of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army or INA). He was among the four INA veterans who took part in the Republic Day parade in 2019, and is among the few surviving freedom fighters who took part in the national struggle for independence.In April 1940, Parmanand, then 20, joined the First Regiment Army in Gurugram. He was sent to Ambala and further to Karachi for training, and then through the ship, the regiment left for Singapore to fight against Japan in the ongoing World War II. In December 1941, the Japanese aircraft attacked the British Army base in Singapore, after which Parmanand and others were taken into captivity.“We could hear the planes hovering in the air. I quickly went and informed my senior. Following the escalation of the attacks, Japan took British soldiers under captivity,” recalled Parmanand. He and other Prisoners of War (PoW) were told that Japan would help them in fighting against the British for India’s independence. It’s here when Parmanand’s life turned turtle, and from being a loyal solider in the British army, he eventually joined the INA to fight for India’s independence.Subhas Chandra Bose, who had staged a daring escape from house arrest in Calcutta in 1941 had one aim as the world war raged across the globe, between the Axis powers on one side (Italy, Nazi Germany, Japan) and the Allied powers (Britain and its colonies, later, United States of America) on the other. Rather than support Britain, Bose wanted to use the war to establish a provisional Indian government and a military presence that would fight against the colonial power. Not everyone supported his decision to take help from fascist states like Italy and Germany. However, it was only in 1943 that Bose, who had left Berlin for Tokyo, Japan, proclaimed the establishment of a provisional independent Indian government, and the INA, which comprised several thousand troops trained with Japan’s help.Parmanand recalled meeting Bose for the first time in 1943. To welcome Bose, he penned a special song that exhorted Churchill to leave India. Over the years, the memory of the lines in the song has dulled, but a little nudge from his family members gives him the incentive to recite it with full gusto. “Paapi Churchill se kehdo, bhaag jaye Hind se [Tell the sinner Churchill to leave India with haste], ” he said.The trials and tribulations of the INA are recurring themes in his poetry.“I used to recite poems to motivate my friends and fellow soldiers. Sometimes, they would request for particular poems. I always obliged. Our job was tough and we needed to keep our spirits high among the difficult conditions,” said Parmanand, pausing intermittently to recite another stanza.“Netaji used to love me a lot. He used to call me affectionately with love, like one reaches out to children. ‘Parmanand, come here!’ he would say and ask me to do chores. ‘Haan ji,’ I would say. He used to give me attention. I, on the other hand, was from a village and not very well-read,” Parmanand said.“Azad Hind Fauj had four brigades: Nehru, Gandhi, Subhas and Azad. The Bahadur brigade was a microcosm of all the four brigades. It included people from different brigades. I was a havildar in this unit,” Parmanand recalled.“Our work was very difficult. Even narrating the ordeal of those days sends shivers down my spine. We soldiers were ready to die. Many of us did. We never gave up. We vanquished the Britishers,” he said.After Singapore, the INA’s next base was Myanmar (then called Burma). For three months, INA fought with British and American armies in Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and entered Assam. “In Kohima, a major battle took place in 1944. In retaliation, the British Army damaged the bridges through which we used to get food grains,” Parmanand said.The siege of Imphal, or the Battle of Kohima as this confrontation came to be called ended badly for the Axis powers (Japanese forces, and the supportive INA), but Bose’s liberation army succeeded in establishing itself as a scrappy force to reckon with.During this time, Parmanand was asked to spy on the British base. But he, along with two other soldiers, got arrested. “From the headquarters in Assam, we were sent to some forest area where there were already six prisoners,” said Parmanand, who faced physical torture while imprisoned in Jhikargachha Jail (in present-day Bangladesh).Six months later, Parmanand was sent to Multan jail. “I was court-martialed for deceiving British government. I was asked about the consequences of cheating British government. I only said, shoot me,” he said.On February 11, 1946, several months after the Second World War ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and the reported death of Subhas Chandra Bose, Parmanand travelled back home to his village in Farrukhnagar where he told people about the INA and his days of struggle. “When I came back to the village, people asked me questions. They were curious. I told them about the war and our stories. I told them whatever I remembered, stories of our valour and sacrifices,” he said. On returning, he eventually took to farming.In August 2021, Parmanand will turn 101. In all these years, his commitment to the country has not waned. “Every time, someone asks about my time in the INA, I recall the painful memories that linger for many hours. Azad Hind Fauj sacrificed for the freedom of the country. Our only goal was to ensure that India became a free country. We got imprisoned. If we weren’t caught, we would have killed more and more would have died but we would not have given up,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-only-goal-was-to-ensure-that-the-country-was-free-101611364173305.html
23-01-2021||India||India calls out Pakistan on religious freedom||India and Pakistan squared off at the United Nations over a resolution on safeguarding religious sites around the world, with the Indian side criticising Pakistan for co-sponsoring the move weeks after the demolition of a Hindu temple.The resolution on “promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites” was sponsored by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and several other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.It was passed unanimously on Thursday after Saudi Arabia and Morocco piloted delicate negotiations on a consensus text.The resolution condemned all acts of violence and destruction directed against religious sites around the world and denounced “any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites”, while strongly deploring violence against people on the basis of their religion or beliefs.It also expressed concern about an increase in instances of racial and religious intolerance and stereotyping, and condemned any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and urged states to take effective measures to combat such incidents. The resolution also called on the UN secretary general to convene a global conference to advance the UN Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites.The Indian representative at the world body, TS Tirumurti, while explaining the country’s position on the resolution, called for objectivity and impartiality in discussions at the UN, without nations taking sides.“It is a matter of great irony that the country where the most recent attack and demolition of a Hindu temple took place in a series of such attacks and where the rights of minorities are being emasculated is one of the co-sponsors of the resolution under the agenda item ‘Culture of Peace’,” he said.“The resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,” he added. Religious and cultural sites remain vulnerable to attacks by violent extremists, as was seen when a Hindu temple was set ablaze and razed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan last December, while the authorities stood idly by, the Indian representative said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-out-pakistan-on-religious-freedom-101611362287802.html
23-01-2021||India||PM Modi talks to health workers to dispel fears over vaccines||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought to set at rest fears and misconceptions over the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines, and sought to dispel the “vaccine hesitancy” that has kept the turnouts low at inoculation centres.In an interaction with health workers in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency, Modi said the vaccines had been launched after completing all scientific processes of trial and testing. It was only when scientists gave the green signal that the vaccination drive, billed as the world’s biggest, started on January 16, he added.“When doctors and health workers give a clean chit to the vaccine, it sends a very strong message among people about the efficacy of the shots,” he said through a video conference with the health workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemicUnion health ministry data showed that till 6pm on Friday, there were close to 230,000 more vaccinations were done across the country -- a total comparable to what was seen the day before. But there were also significantly more vaccination sessions on Friday, 6,230 compared to 4,043, implying that turnout had dropped again after a brief increase on Thursday.During each session, 100 people are selected and invited -- on Thursday, almost 57% showed up, but on Friday, this proportion fell to 36%.Modi’s interaction came a day after the government launched a mass awareness campaign to drive home its message that the made-in-India vaccines -- Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India; and Covaxin, developed locally by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International -- were completely safe.The two vaccines received emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator on January 3, clearing the ground for the start of the vaccination drive.Health practitioners who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus or have administered the shots to others took part in Modi’s interaction with Varanasi’s health workers, sharing their first-hand experience.“Really, corona warriors have done a wonderful job,” Modi said in the 30-minute interaction during which he spoke to a government doctor, a lab technician and three nurses deployed at three vaccination centres —the District Women’s Hospital, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay District Hospital and the Haathi community health centre -- in Varanasi.“Our preparation has been such that the vaccine is fast reaching every corner of the country,” Modi said. “And on the world’s biggest need today, we are completely self-reliant. Not just that, India is also helping out many countries with vaccines.”He appealed to doctors, hospitals and vaccinators to accelerate the inoculation of all health workers in Varanasi so that the next phase of the vaccination drive can get underway soon.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-talks-to-health-workers-to-dispel-fears-over-vaccines-101611358753514.html
23-01-2021||India||Talks break down, govt tells unions it won’t accept demand to repeal laws||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday told farm unions that the government would not repeal three contentious agricultural laws, and a proposal to suspend the legislation for 18 months was the best it could offer, leading to the collapse of a long series of negotiations just two days after an agreement appeared in sight.No dates were announced for any further discussions.Tomar said the dialogue process could only restart if the farmers reconsidered the government’s most far-reaching proposal so far, and asked the farm unions to inform the latter by January 23 if they were ready to change their minds.The farmers, who have rigidly called for either a repeal of the laws or nothing, on Friday vowed to intensify their agitation — the biggest the Modi government has faced so far, and one that has seen tens of thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana camping on the Capital’s borders for 57 days.The farm unions stressed that they would be going ahead with a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26, but said they would do it after India’s Republic Day celebrations and not disrupt the official function.“I am not an astrologer. I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” Tomar told reporters after the 11th round of negotiations with representatives of a common platform for multiple farm unions. “This is the best we could have offered to the farmers.”The agriculture minister blamed unnamed “forces” for failure of the talks and criticised “people with vested interests who wanted the talks to be unsuccessful”.“When an agitation is named after farmers, is related to farmers’ issue, and the government tries so hard to resolve it with one proposal after the other, then there is some force which wants to the agitation to continue so that farmers’ welfare cannot happen,” the agriculture minister said. “If there are other interests at play, then farmers’ interests can’t be secured. If farm unions have people who are interested in farmers’ welfare, then our proposal would have got considered.”Tomar said he told the farm unions the government’s proposal (to put the laws on hold and form a committee to look into the farmers’ demands) was the “best we could have done”. The minister added that he urged farm unions to reconsider their decision because the offer of the government was in the “best interest of farmers and nation”.On the question of whether the government would ever consider a repeal, Tomar said: “The government has always said farmers can ask for anything other than repeal.”In the negotiations on Friday, there was hardly any issue left to discuss when farm unions told the government at the outset that they wanted nothing short of a full repeal of the laws as well as a new legislation guaranteeing assured prices for farm produce.Leaders representing the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a collective of farm unions on strike since November, told the government that the farm unions had collectively decided against accepting the government’s proposal to put the laws on hold.Late on Friday night, farmers gathered at the Singhu border alleged that attempts had been made to engineer violence at their protest site or during their upcoming tractor rally. Union leaders said they had detained a man who was moving suspiciously among them.The Modi government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.In the previous round of negotiations with a 41-member delegation representing farm unions on Wednesday, the Union government offered to suspend the three pieces of legislation. It also proposed a committee with representatives from the government as well as farmers to look into “all issues related to the farmers’ agitation”.The farmers, however, hardened their stand to reject both the proposals instead of agreeing to meet the government midway. They said they would not budge from their demand for a complete repeal of the laws.“There is no new date for further talks. We will see what to do after January 26, when we will bring out a farmers’ Republic Day parade in Delhi. We appeal to the Delhi Police to allow it,” said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a senior leader of the agitation.“In the talks with the (Delhi) police, the officers proposed a roadmap in front of the farmer leaders (on farmers’ Republic Day parade). Leaders will give their reply on this proposal after holding a farm unions’ meeting tomorrow (Saturday),” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the agitation.A senior farm leader, Balbir Singh Rajewal, said farmers were preparing full steam for a peaceful and colourful farmers’ parade on Republic Day. He said farmers would now focus on the future course of the agitation.Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan said it would be wrong to say the talks were inconclusive. “The government has broken off the discussions. What is the logic of suspending the laws for one-and-a-half years? The government hasn’t said anything meaningful yet on a law for minimum support prices,” he said, adding the main reason for not accepting the government’s proposal was that “the suspension is a limited-period offer and not a solution to the demand for a repeal of the laws.”Experts said the farmers’ position now appeared untenable.“The issue is no longer about reformist policies and a perceived threat to livelihoods. We haven’t so far heard about any specific fallout of the reforms from the unions. The issue is one of a status quoist demand by farmers and a lack of trust between the two sides,” said Abhinav Saikia, an agronomist with the farm startup IndAgro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-break-down-govt-tells-unions-it-won-t-accept-demand-to-repeal-laws-101611358402431.html
23-01-2021||India||Congress to elect new president by June||The Congress party will hold its internal polls to elect a new president this June, after the upcoming round of assembly elections, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) announced on Friday after brainstorming for at least three hours on internal polls as well as issues such as the farmers’ agitation and the alleged breach of national security as evident in the WhatsApp chat transcripts of journalist Arnab Goswami.The Congress Election Authority (CEA), the party’s panel in charge of the elections, proposed a timeline between May 15 and 30 to hold organisational elections, although some leaders, particularly those in charge of poll-bound states, said this could clash with the assembly elections. CEA also proposed a schedule for the election of 12 members of the new CWC. At the end, the schedule for both the polls were left for the party president to decide.If the CWC is eventually formed through an election, it will fulfil a key demand of the 23 signatories to an August letter to the Congress leadership, seeking sweeping changes in the party hierarchy. The last such election took place in 1997. CEA will meet again to decide if the new president will have a full term, or will serve the remainder of the current term that runs till December 2022.The meeting saw some exchanges between Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, and Anand Sharma and Ghulam Nabi Azad, two of the signatories to the letter, over the need for an election. Sharma and Azad also wanted the schedule for the election to be decided at the meeting itself. “The Central Election Authority has already given a schedule for conducting election in May , but all CWC members unanimously requested the Congress president that it (party polls) should not affect the election prospects of the Congress party in assembly elections,” said party general secretary Randeep Surjewala, adding that “a little rescheduling will be needed” for the internal polls. Four states -- Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, and Assam -- go to the polls in the first half of the year.While Sharma and Azad stressed on the importance of internal polls, Gehlot said that the need of the hour is to fight against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and not internally. Gehlot said he had been in the party since 1973-74 but did not remember a time when there was a poll in CWC. Pointing out that BJP president JP Nadda or its former president Amit Shah were not elected, he said that for years people in the Congress had held party posts through nominations.Elections to CWC were held in Tirupati and Kolkata in 1993 and 1997 under the presidentship of PV Narsimha Rao and Sitaram Kesari respectively.Sharma, who spoke much after Gehlot, complained that he was being targeted by Rajasthan CM, at which point Ambika Soni reminded him that no names had been taken. She said that the party president has been entrusted to decide the dates, and that the party constitution should be seen to determine how CWC is to be elected. According to a senior leader, Sharma agreed that the Congress president should finalise the schedule of the elections.KC Venugopal, general secretary, organisation, later told the media, “As per our constitution, little clarities are needed for whether the elections for Congress president and working committee can be held together or working committee election should be held after the Congress president election.”Rahul Gandhi spoke towards the end of the meeting. He tried to pacify both sides and said both Gehlot and Sharma had raised important points. Rahul Gandhi maintained that the party elections should be held soon but that the need of the hours is to focus on farmers issues and fight against the BJP-RSS.According to a senior leader who asked not to be named: “Rahul also said, ‘let’s go through with the elections’, and that comment puts to rest any doubt about the party holding polls.” Several Congress leaders are hopeful that the former party chief Rahul Gandhi will return to the top post in the party polls. In the CWC meeting, Gandhi trained his guns at the RSS, terming it as “poisonous” and spoke on farmer issues.In her opening speech, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that the government has shown “shocking insensitivity and arrogance going through the charade of consultation” with the farmers. She maintained that the new farm laws will destroy the foundations of food security that are based on the three pillars of the minimum support price (MSP) , public procurement and PDS (public distribution system). She also reacted to the WhatsApp transcripts of Goswami’s conversations that seemed to suggest he had prior knowledge of a strike against Pakistan and said “national security [has been] thoroughly compromised” . “Yet the silence from the Government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed.”The Congress president hailed the vaccination drive but slammed the government for its handling of Covid. “The government has inflicted untold suffering on the people of our country by the manner in which it has managed the Covid-19 pandemic. It will take years for the scars to heal,” she said. Gandhi also touched upon the “grim economic situation” and said that “large parts of the economy like MSME and the informal sector have been decimated with the Government refusing to extend a lifeline.” “When public expenditure has to be carefully prioritised, it is very painful to find huge amounts of money being allocated and spent on initiatives that can only be described as ‘personal vanity projects’,” she said, in an apparent reference to the Central Vista project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-elect-new-president-by-june-101611358162620.html
23-01-2021||India||CBI books Cambridge Analytica over Facebook data theft||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against Alexander Nix of British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) and Aleksandr Kogan of Global Science Research Limited, UK, for allegedly harvesting personal data of up to 562,000 Indians from Facebook for commercial purposes, officials said on Friday.The move comes after a two-year-long investigation.The CBI enquiry revealed that Kogan, founder and director of Global Science Research, created a Facebook app, “thisisyourdigitallife”; the app was authorised to collect certain specific data of the users for academic and research purposes.The agency said that the app illegally collected additional unauthorised data of users as well as their friends’ network on Facebook; in all, data of 335 users and their network of 562,000 of their friends were compromised. Globally, it is believed that the app compromised the data of 87 million Facebook users.Kogan has been named as accused in the CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered on January 19 and has been charged under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Information Technology Act.Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny sometime around March 2018 when several international media platforms, citing former CA employees, associates and documents, claimed that the company had harvested private information without their consent from the Facebook profiles of 87 million Facebook accounts.The reports said the data may have been used to shape the outcomes of the 2016 US presidential election as well as the 2016 Brexit referendum. Last year, the UK Information Commissioner said CA was not involved in the Brexit vote.Union law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Rajya Sabha in 2018 that the probe will be handed over to the CBI.The anti-corruption agency launched a preliminary enquiry (PE), a precursor to an FIR, against CA in July 2018 on a complaint by the ministry of electronics and information technology.During the enquiry, CBI contacted 335 app users out of which six responded to the agency and were examined during the course of enquiry. “They unanimously stated that they were misled by the app and were not aware of the fact that their personal (data) and (their) friends’ data was harvested. They also said that they would not have used the app if they knew that it would do so,” the CBI FIR added. HT has reviewed a copy of the FIR.Global Science Research, CBI said, entered into a criminal conspiracy with CA in 2014 .“Facebook had collected written certificates from Kogan (Global Science Research) and CA during 2016-17 declaring that all such data obtained by them through the app, thisisyourdigitallife, was accounted for and destroyed. This facts confirms that Global Science harvested data sets and provided the same to CA for commercial purposes,” the CBI FIR stated.The FIR also adds that the agency could not ascertain the veracity of claims by Global Science and CA that they had destroyed the data sets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-cambridge-analytica-over-facebook-data-theft-101611357394409.html
23-01-2021||India||The patriot who will never die||By Ronojoy SenThere are few Indian icons around whom there is such a vivid mythology and “life-after-life” as one biographer put it, as Netaji Subhas Bose. Leonard Gordon, who has written one of the standard biographies of Bose, noted in 1990 that Netaji’s story had “begun to resemble that of an Indian deity”. Not much has changed in 2021, the 125th birth anniversary of Bose.As West Bengal heads to elections this year, Netaji’s legacy is once again up for grabs. The central government has announced that Netaji’s birth anniversary will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas. It has also set up a committee to plan year-long anniversary programmes. The Trinamool Congress has countered this by saying that the day should be remembered as Desh Prem Diwas. It has also pointed out that West Bengal celebrates Bose’s birthday every year as Subhas Diwas and that their plea that his birthday be declared a national holiday has found no takers.Thus, Netaji is well and truly alive in Bengal politics and the people’s minds. While the current claims and counter claims over Bose is geared toward electoral gains, his memory endures because of the many what-ifs associated with him. That is why Gopalkrishna Gandhi suggests that Bose continues to be popular since he serves as an “alter ego to the nation’s power structure”.Part of the continuing fascination with Bose is the attraction of the rebel. His dramatic escape from house arrest in Calcutta in 1941 and arrival in Berlin is the stuff of myth. Bose’s subsequent setting up of the Indian National Army and his alliance with the Japanese is also well known. What is less known is that Netaji was a maverick since his early days. He was not only expelled from the elite Presidency College, he also spurned, in 1921, the dream job of any self-respecting Bengali — a chance to become part of the Indian Civil Service. This non-conformism would surface at different phases of Netaji’s tumultuous political career.A strong reason for Bose’s appeal is that, as historian Sugata Bose puts it, Netaji’s legend “cuts across religious, linguistic, and national boundaries.” Yet another cause for Bose’s popularity is the belief he was a strongman, who could have steered the nationalist movement and independent India in a different direction from Jawaharlal Nehru.Netaji’s mysterious death in an air crash in Taiwan in August 1945 and the clutch of conspiracy theories around it have also fuelled the myths around Bose. Everybody loves a good conspiracy, especially those surrounding a sudden or violent death. In the case of Netaji, his antagonism to mainstream nationalist politics and his links with fascists made him a particularly apposite candidate for conspiracy theories.Sugata Bose, who is also a grandnephew of Netaji, notes that an overwhelming majority of Netaji’s closest associates believed that he had died in the crash. However, since 1946, there began ‘’sightings’’ of Netaji in different locations. Perhaps the first such ‘’sighting’’ was recorded in 1946 when a certain KSM Swamy claimed to have met Netaji in a third-class compartment of the Bombay Express. Since then Netaji spotting became a cottage industry. One of the better known of these theories was the discovery that Netaji had resurfaced as a Hindu ascetic — Gumnami Baba — in Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh. Indeed, there were several Hindu sadhus who had been linked to Netaji at various times.An organisation called the Subhasbadi Janata kept these stories in circulation through pamphlets, newspapers and weekly meetings. At the same time, there were rumours of Netaji having shown up in Russia or China. The Netaji sightings peaked in the 1960s when there was a general disillusionment with politics of the day.These rumours might have died down had not the Indian State stepped in and set up a commission to investigate the death of Bose. This had the effect of legitimising, in a sense, the conspiracy theories. The first was the Netaji Inquiry Committee, set up in 1956, consisting of a former comrade of Netaji, Shah Nawaz Khan, an elder brother of Netaji, Suresh Bose, and a government officer. The committee went through the evidence, including interviewing the Japanese doctor who treated Netaji after the crash, and found that Netaji had died in 1945. Its findings were, however, undermined by the dissent of Suresh Bose who stated that Netaji was still alive.In 1970, another inquiry commission headed by Justice G.D. Khosla was instituted. There was some remarkable testimony before the panel: A bank official from Sholapur claimed that he received direct messages from Netaji by tuning his body like a radio. The Khosla report, like the earlier commission, concluded that Netaji had indeed died in the crash.A one-man commission, headed by a retired high court judge, Manoj Mukherjee, was the third such body to look into the Netaji mystery. After six years of hearings, Mukherjee concluded in 2006 that the air crash that killed Bose had not happened. It did so on the flimsy basis that the government of Taiwan did not have records of the crash. Sugata Bose has a simple explanation for this, pointing out that Taiwan had then been under Japanese occupation. He adds that the Mukherjee Commission “made no distinction between the highly probable and the utterly impossible.” However, the Mukherjee Commission, as well another one headed by Justice Vishnu Sahay, found no credible evidence that Gumnami Baba was Bose.But this too has not stopped the conspiracy theories. In 2019, a Bengali feature film titled, Gumnaami, directed by Srijit Mukherjee lent credence to the theory that Gumnami Baba might indeed have been Netaji in disguise. The same year, a book titled Conundrum peddled the same theory. While several descendants of Bose publicly voiced their disapproval of the film, Mukherjee stated he was merely putting before the pubic different theories about Netaji’s “disappearance” in 1945.Ronojoy Sen is Senior Research Fellow, ISAS & SASP, National University of Singapore.

23-01-2021||India||Record 3 billion days of work generated but women’s share shrinks||For the first time since it was expanded to cover the entire country by April 2008, India’s flagship rural jobs programme has generated more than three billion days of work in less than a year, but as more people scrambled for work, the share of female workers and the average days of employment for families shrank for the first time in five years, according to government data.The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Jobs Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has this financial year generated 3.11 billion days of work, 460 million days more than last year, according to data by the ministry of rural development. The surge in the year that began in April is attributed to the pandemic and the lockdown enforced at end-March that forced millions of workers to return to the countryside from the citiesBut as more people demanded work, employment opportunities for women have shrunk. In the current year, 52.7% of work (share in persondays) has been done by women, the lowest in five years. Between 2016-17 and 2019-20 , women’s share of work allotted under MGNREGS was 54.77%, 54.59%, 53.53% and 56.16%.MGNREGS, a rural jobs guarantee programme, stipulates that half the employment generated by the scheme be earmarked for women. Under the scheme, at least one member of each poor rural household is assured 100 days of work in a year.More people seeking such work meant fewer average days of employment for households. In this financial year, rural households have found an average of just 44.8 days of employment. Only 3.1 million families have completed the full quota of 100 days of work per year.The scheme, widely seen as the last resort for rural households, received the highest annual funding this year of more than R1 lakh crore. MGNREGS work was also included in the special package to offer employment to labourers who returned home during the initial months of the pandemic.This year, 105 million people have participated in MGNREGS, the highest in five years, indicating the surge in demand for jobs even as the Indian economy contracted by a record 23.9% in the quarter ended June, followed by a decline of 7.5% in the three months ended September.Former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra said: “Usually, the men go to cities or take up other work and women engage in MGNREGS for extra family income. But this year, it might be that the health concerns have seen a section of woman workers reluctant to come out and work.” He added, “The fall in average days of employment is likely to improve as young men have returned to the cities and now less families are likely to see work in the remaining months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-3-billion-days-of-work-generated-but-women-s-share-shrinks-101611355631915.html
23-01-2021||India||Sole BSP MLA Md Jama Khan set to join JD(U) in Bihar||Within a week, soon when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) projected Shahnawaz Hussain as a nominee, the Janata Dal–United (JD-U) too is all set to welcome the lone Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Md Jama Khan to the party fold.Khan won from the Chainpur Assembly seat on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket in the 2020 assembly elections and is all set to join JD-U soon.“Yes, I am going to meet Bihar CM Nitish Kumarji this evening,” the BSP MLA said adding, “I do feel I can fulfill promises made to people during elections by joining the government.”Talking to HT over the phone, Khan said, “You can translate your words into action fully if you are in the ruling party and I see nothing wrong in joining the ruling party for the sake of the people.” He is likely to get a ministerial berth in Nitish Kumar’s cabinet.Khan surprised everyone by defeating veteran BJP leader and minister Brij Kishor Bind by a margin of over 24,000 votes in the last assembly polls. He had unsuccessfully contested the seat on a Congress ticket in 2010 and lost to BJP leader Brij Kishor Bind by a small margin of 674 votes in 2015.An alumni of BHU, the BSP leader is known for his deep insight into UP politics and JD-U is all set to enter into the political arena in UP in the next assembly elections.Just before the 2020 assembly polls BSP’s Bihar president Bharat Bind had switched over to RJD and later won the Bhabua seat on a RJD ticket.“This is the second blow to BSP in Bihar in quick succession and now BSP has to reconsider its strategy in Bihar,” political observer Amitesh Tiwari said.He added, “JD-U can’t miss the opportunity as the party wants to take revenge for Arunachal Pradesh where JD-U MLAs had switched over to BJP,” a political observer said.Both of NDA’s allies—the BJP and JD-U have wooed Muslim leaders in Bihar politics to show their interest in minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sole-bsp-mla-md-jama-khan-set-to-join-jd-u-in-bihar-101611346810755.html

Now, the government has offered 4.38 hectares of land to them for this near Ganga," said Kaushik.The Akhada Parishad in a meeting with the CM last year had demanded a land space adjacent to Ganga ghat in Haridwar.Informing about another major decision, Kaushik informed that the cabinet also decided to pay 155 teachers of the Sanskrit department according to their teaching experience."Under the move, a teacher who has been teaching Sanskrit for about five years, would be paid ₹15,000/month. Similarly, a teacher with experience between five to 10 years would be paid ₹25,000 per month and a teacher teaching the subject for over 10 years would be paid ₹30,000 a month. Apart from this, a Sanskrit teacher having a UGC approved M Phil or PhD will get a ₹5000 bonus," said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-accepts-saints-request-for-burial-land-to-check-jal-samadhi-101611343155052.html

Officials didn’t give any specific reason for the change.AASU, which spearheaded the anti-CAA protests in the state in December 2019, launched a 3-day protest against the legislation beginning Friday.Police resorted to baton-charge at a torch rally organised in Tezpur and in Guwahati a large rally was blocked by the police on Friday evening. Tension was also reported from Sivasagar and Dhekiajuli during similar rallies.“Modi is coming to make false promises to Assamese people again before the assembly polls. We oppose the visit and Centre’s forcible enactment of CAA. We were carrying our peaceful protests, but the police restricted us from exercising our democratic right,” AASU general secretary Sankar Jyoti Baruah told journalists.AASU and several other organizations have decided to greet PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah (who is scheduled to address rallies on Sunday) with black flags.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-pm-modi-s-assam-visit-aasu-takes-out-torch-rallies-against-caa-101611342381696.html
23-01-2021||India||Short of attendance while pregnant, DU law student gets relief from top court||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Delhi University to issue a certificate and marksheet to a law student who was detained for falling short of attendance in 2018 following her pregnancy.Noting that the order was being passed in the peculiar circumstances of this case, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We direct the University to declare the 5th semester supplementary examination results of the petitioner and issue the provisional degree along with necessary certificates, if she had passed the examinations, subject to the petitioner clearing the other formalities. The order is passed in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case.”The petitioner, Ankita Madan had joined the three-year law course at Law Centre-II of the Faculty of Law, Delhi University in August 2016. She was a married woman who attended the evening law course and successfully cleared three semesters. In the fourth semester, she became pregnant and could not attend classes. She was unable to join classes till March 2018. During that same time, a teachers’ strike beginning March 16, 2018 hampered conduct of classes due to which she fell short of the 65 per cent attendance criteria required under Rule 10 of the Bar Council of India Rules.The University issued notice on May 9, 2018 detaining her and preventing her from appearing for the fourth semester examinations. She approached the Delhi High Court for relief. A single judge bench dismissed her plea. In appeal, a division bench in September 2018 found the University’s decision to be correct.She brought her cause before the Supreme Court seeking an indulgence to attend classes. In October 2018, the apex court allowed Madan to attend classes at her own risk. Over the years, she secured interim orders of the Court to appear in subsequent examinations. Her result was made subject to the final outcome of her petition.Justice Ramasubramanian, writing the judgment for the bench, noted that the petitioner had already taken the fourth, fifth and final semester examinations. The University declared all but one result of her fifth semester supplementary examinations. It even held back the provisional certificates to be granted at the end of the course awaiting the Court’s final order. Last year, Madan moved an application through her lawyers Ashish Virmani and Himanshu Dhuper for grant of degree, marksheet and character certificate by the University.The bench observed, “Once the petitioner has completed the course and also written her fifth and sixth semester examinations and even got the results of all the semester examinations except the fifth semester supplementary examinations published, the adjudication of dispute in the petition will only be a matter of academic interest.”Continuing with the string of interim reliefs extended to the petitioner from time to time, the Court finally let the University declare the pending result and clear all formalities by way of documents to be issued on successful completion of course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/short-of-attendance-while-pregnant-du-law-student-gets-relief-from-top-court-101611341516615.html

This will help in spreading a feeling that the police is there to help the people and not to scare them,” Rawat said.During the event, chairperson of the child rights body Usha Negi and state director general of police Ashok Kumar were also present.Usha Negi while addressing the gathering said, “This move by the commission and police will help in providing special counselling for street children and missing minors so that they do not step into the world of crime but become good citizens by pursuing their dreams.”“The members of the commission who will be present at the police station to counsel them, will help them get a good education and keep them away from any wrong doing,” said Negi adding, “Similar police stations will soon be set up in 12 other districts for which a fund of ₹1 lakh has been granted to each district.”Mani Bhushan Srivastava, station house officer of Dalanwala revealing further details of the child-friendly police station said, “It has been prepared with interiors comprising of cartoons and other paintings to make a child comfortable in it.”“Under the initiative, the police will bring orphaned or unclaimed children living in the streets to the child-friendly police station. They would be made comfortable in it which has beds, books and toys for them. The children would be then offered counselling by the members of the state commission for protection of child rights,” Srivastava said.The police officer said that that after counselling the children would be handed over to the commission which would then shift them to proper shelter homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-announces-rs-1-crore-fund-for-welfare-of-orphans-street-kids-101611339122375.html
23-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu: Elephant dies of burn injuries; two arrested||A horrific video emerged on Friday of two men throwing a flaming cloth onto an elephant in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district and the animal trumpeting and running away in pain. The 40-year-old elephant died on January 19 of the injuries it suffered in the attack earlier this month .The two men, identified as Prasath, 36, and Raymond, 28, were arrested for animal cruelty. Officials also sealed a homestay that the men were running; the elephant had intruded into the facility and the men tried to scare it away.“This is heartbreaking and cruel. The action we take against them should serve as a deterrent,” said Nilgiris district collector J Innocent Divya. “They have been booked for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.”Forest officials had been following the elephant since November. “It (the elephant) had an injury on its back and it was roaming around in human habitation without going to the forest,” said LCS Srikanth, deputy director of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in Masinagudi.The department tranquilized the pachyderm in December. “But it was still weak and moving around very slowly,” said Srikanth. “This video {of the attack} is from January 3rd midnight.”Forest officials noticed serious injuries to its ear in the first week of January. On the morning of January 19, they tranquilized the elephant again to take it for treatment to a nearby camp. “It suddenly died when we were nearing the camp,” Srikanth said.Animal rights activists said such cruelty was a part of the larger man-animal conflict.“Outsiders like {people who run} resorts, factories, brick kilns have encroached on forest and tribal lands and they don’t understand animals,” said S Muralidharan, founder of the Chennai-based Indian Centre for Animal Rights and Education (INCARE). “This is a criminal act and punishments under the Wild Life Act aren’t severe. The court should take suo motu cognisance of this; go out of the law books and pronounce stringent imprisonment so it serves as an example.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-dies-of-burn-injuries-two-arrested-101611338926107.html

Among the various programmes being organised across the nation, one special programme is being held at Haripura in Gujarat. Do join the programme, which begins at 1 PM," the PM tweeted."Haripura has a special relation with Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. It was at the historic Haripura Session of 1938 that Netaji Bose took up the Presidentship of the Congress Party. Tomorrow’s programme at Haripura will be a tribute to Netaji Bose’s contribution to our nation," he further tweeted.Ahead of Bose's birth anniversary, the PM remembered the affection people showed on the day the e-Gram Vishwagram Project was launched from Haripura. "On the eve of Netaji Bose’s Jayanti, my mind goes back to 23rd January 2009- the day we launched e-Gram Vishwagram Project from Haripura. This initiative revolutionised Gujarat’s IT infrastructure and took the fruits of technology to the poor, in the remotest parts of the state," he said."I can never forget the affection of the people of Haripura, who took me through an elaborate procession on the same road as Netaji Bose was taken, in 1938. His procession included a decorated chariot drawn by 51 bullocks. I also visited the place where Netaji stayed in Haripura," he added.The ideals of Bose inspired us to work towards making India a strong and self-reliant nation, he said, adding that this vision of the country is what the freedom fighter would have been proud of. "May the thoughts and ideals of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose keep inspiring us to work towards building an India that he would be proud of…a strong, confident and self-reliant India, whose human-centric approach contributes to a better planet in the years to come,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parakram-diwas-pm-modi-pays-tribute-of-netaji-on-eve-of-his-jayanti-101611337213317.html
23-01-2021||India||Strategically important Ujh hydroelectric project in J&K gets forest panel nod||The Ujh Multipurpose Hydro Electric Project in Jammu and Kashmir, a project of strategic importance, has got the green nod from the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) according to the minutes of FAC meeting published earlier in the week.The project will involve the loss of about 680ha of forest land with a large share—609.1ha—in Billawar Forest Division, and over 200,000 trees according to project documents on environment ministry’s Parivesh website.The Ujh multipurpose project in Kathua district has been envisaged to utilise water from Ujh, a tributary of Ravi, which is one of the three eastern rivers of Indus Basin system. The project will involve the construction of a 116m-high concrete face rock-fill dam (CFRD) and power generation of about 186MW. The irrigation benefits will comprise annual irrigation to area of 31,380ha, besides providing 18.92 million cubic metres (MCM) of drinking water supply to the region.Also Read: Kashmir braces for fresh spell of snowfall; traffic to be disrupted“This project is of national importance, providing geo-political strategic advantage in form of much more effective use of water of Ujh river. This project will ameliorate the agricultural and power sectors in the otherwise barren Kandi area. It will also be a boon in the dry Kandi belt which is reeling under the peril of impending water crisis during dry season and also reduce the miseries of floods in the monsoons,” FAC stated in its minutes.The project will involve the displacement of around 8,648 persons and the gross area under submergence is likely to be 34.50sqkm. Documents on Parivesh website dated suggest that the FAC had noted that there was marked difference in the number of trees enumerated for felling which was 296,000 in the online proposal and 338,000 as confirmed by the field officers during the site visit.“Large number of trees are proposed to be felled due to the project. Every effort shall be made to ensure that trees are felled only when felling is unavoidable, and it shall be done in a phased manner. The Union Territory administration shall therefore also ensure that compensatory afforestation is taken up in the first year of the construction of the project, and adequate post-planting measures are taken to ensure healthy growth of regenerated forest,” the FAC noted in the minutes.The minutes also state that the resettlement and rehabilitation plan shall ensure that no rehabilitation is proposed over forest land. A copy of the resettlement plan shall be submitted by the user agency to the UT administration who will monitor to ensure that no project affected person occupies forest land, FAC said."Any rehabilitation and resettlement exercise should be preceded by determining whether the land acquisition in question will serve public purpose. This cannot be determined by a government agency or an expert committee. The FAC’s observations don’t indicate whether this has been discussed with the 9000 people who will be directly affected by the project," said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research."It is critical that the forest diversion process be planned carefully and slowly for J&K as the central laws have been made applicable only recently, and there needs to be a much more considered view of prevailing rights. Else, large scale land use change and acquisition can result in social and environmental injustices," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strategically-important-ujh-hydroelectric-project-in-j-k-gets-forest-panel-nod-101611311984941.html

23-01-2021||Today's||Firebrand who shaped Bengal’s politics, culture||His life and death continue to intrigue generations, but 125 years after Subhas Chandra Bose was born, his legacy still shapes not just the politics of Bengal but also the region’s society, culture and literature — a testament to the abiding attraction of his firebrand patriotism and his grassroots connect.Born in Cuttack in 1897 in a prominent Bengali family, Bose went to college in erstwhile Calcutta and chose the city as his political arena.He started a newspaper, rose steadily through the Congress, organised ground movements with his rousing addresses, and eventually became mayor in 1930. His rise to the top of the Congress, bitter fall-out with Mahatma Gandhi, and dramatic escape from house arrest in 1941 not only established his stature as the tallest politician from Bengal but also made the public believe that he was a magician who could achieve anything. His subsequent travels to Europe and south-east Asia, brushes with fascism and Nazi Germany, leading the Indian National Army and epic battles with British troops only burnished his colossal stature in the freedom movement.“Culturally and socially, people of Bengal are highly emotional. They regard Netaji as the greatest patriot India has ever seen. Netaji has attained immortality in their hearts. The mystery surrounding Netaji’s death gives them some kind of self-satisfaction,” said Amal Kumar Mukherjee, former principal of Presidency College where Bose was a student before he was expelled after assaulting a professor for anti-India comments.Since independence, ordinary people, media and governments have focused on the controversy surrounding his death, and the numerous theories abound over the claim that he survived an air crash in Taiwan in August 18, 1945. Even before independence people claimed that they had met Bose in a railway carriage. But the sightings gained more attention in the 1950s with links drawn to at least six different monks — the first being Saradananda who lived at Shaulmari in Bengal’s Cooch Behar district to Gumnami Baba, who died at Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh in September 1985.To be sure, at least four separate commissions have found no conclusive evidence that any of these people were actually Bose, even though the Justice Mukherjee Commission controversially concluded in 2006 that Netaji didn’t die in the crash. Amal Kumar Mukherjee felt the confusion around the multiple findings helped fuel even more conspiracy theories.“The Mukherjee Commission said after a thorough investigation that Netaji did not die in Taihoku but for reasons unknown the UPA government rejected its findings. For obvious reasons, the debates, which never really subsided, continue to this day,” he said.Chandra Kumar Bose, Bose’s grandnephew and a Bharatiya Janata Party leader in Bengal, agreed. “Netaji lives in the hearts of millions as a deathless hero mainly because of the role played by of the government. The official version was that he died in the plane crash. Why in that case was the Mukherjee Commission formed when the Shah Nawaz Committee set up in 1956 and the Khosla Commission set up in 1970 clearly said that Netaji died in Taihoku?...People are confused,” said Bose.“Last week I wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a DNA test of the last remains of Netaji. His daughter Anita Bose Pfaff made the same request three months ago. In reply to a letter from former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj in 2016, the Japan government said that out of five files it has on Netaji, three are yet to be made public. Our government should find out what’s in those three files. I have urged the Centre to form a team, find some conclusive evidence and make it public. As long as it is not done, the absurd theories will continue,” said Bose.In Kolkata today, Bose is everywhere — from small neighbourhood clubs and roadside shops to arterial roads and the city’s airport. Books written on his life, thought, legacy and death continue to be sold in the thousands, and he is indispensable part of any political debate — be it in an adda or the Prime Minister’s rally.For National Award-winning director Srijit Mukherji, the success of his 2019 film, Gumnaami that was based on theories about Bose’s death, showed the power of Netaji in Bengal. “Every political party has its own agenda,” he said. “The Left wants to dismiss the death in Russia theory. The Congress obviously has its own reason to stand by the plane crash theory and the fact that it has been handed down for generations in history books and adopted as the state narrative despite a lot of inconsistencies. The Right support the Gumnami Baba theory that, in a way, supports their narrative well, especially in terms of the spiritual angle and the monk’s disenchantment with the Congress,” said the director.Chandra Kumar Bose felt that the Centre should also make public every record it has on Gumnami Baba. “The Sahai Commission report says he was a follower of Netaji. But it is claimed that important politicians, including a former prime minister and union minister, visited him. If a monk was so important, people have the right to know his real background. If he had such high-profile visitors the intelligence bureau must be having a file on him. Even if he was an imposter, people have the right to know it,” said Bose.For many other experts, the enduring relevance of Netaji is due to his ideology, not the controversy around his death. Shouvik Mukhopadhyay, a professor of history at Calcutta University, sees Bose as the architect of a nationalist thought process based on pluralism and secularism. He feels that to understand Bose’s legacy, one had to follow freedom fighter Chittaranjan Das, who was a mentor to Bose. “Bose left the civil service and entered political life under the guidance of the great freedom fighter Chittaranjan Das who was a follower of Bipin Chandra Pal. One cannot understand Bose without understanding Das, whose biggest contribution was revival of Bengal’s role in national politics. Bengal took a backseat after India’s capital was shifted from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911. Das not only restored Bengal’s regional identity on the national scene by forming the Swaraj Party with Motilal Nehru (Jawaharlal Nehru’s father) but also gave equal projection to people from every region of the country,” said Mukhopadhyay.“Another cardinal point of the agenda Das had was to bridge the chasm between Hindus and Muslims at the state and national level. Bose took this job one step forward. Hence, he has become all the more relevant in today’s scenario. Whether it is the songs of the Indian National Army that Bose led or the differences he had with Syama Prasad Mookerjee (founder of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh) and the Hindu Mahasabha, one finds inclusiveness in his approach to nation building,” he added.Chandra Kumar Bose shares the same thought. “Netaji believed in the unity of all religions and all races. Unless we can live his philosophy there is no point in celebrating his birthday. Unless that is done the nation will disintegrate. Just look around you,” he said.Mukherji said he felt that the mystery around Bose’s disappearance did not amount to a lot anymore. “Bengalis have either forgotten him or are oblivious of the various theories surrounding his disappearance…it seems that if the truth comes out it might put a lot of parties in a lot of discomfort. People of India might start asking uncomfortable questions to the powers that governed us for 73 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/firebrand-who-shaped-bengal-s-politics-culture-101611364006091.html
23-01-2021||Today's||Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: Champion of freedom who inspired the world||By Prahlad Singh PatelNetaji Subhas Chandra Bose ’s life is a story of struggle. It is the story of a young dreamer that tells the saga of consciousness, struggle and success in every eye; one who has the power to rip the ground with his arms; one who talks about making a hole in the sky; one who is anxious to achieve his goals; one who does not accept anything for free; and if he wants freedom, he is ready to spill his blood. Thousands of people sacrificed their lives on Netaji’s call. He created an army against the British in no time.Netaji was born in Cuttack in Odisha in 1897, graduated from Kolkata, and proved his mettle by becoming an Indian Civil Services (ICS) officer. But he was not accustomed to a life of comfort and amenities that came with his job. He was a warrior, who had to wage the freedom struggle. Not only did he embrace the freedom movement wholeheartedly, but also became an inspiration for freedom. With the slogan “Give me blood and I will give you freedom”, he started preparing to awaken the country. Such was the charisma of his philosophy and personality that whoever listened to him was attracted to him. His popularity skyrocketed and he became “Netaji” to the general public.He was so fond of Bharat Mata that his country tied to the chains of slavery did not let him live peacefully. People beyond India’s borders also developed a fascination for him. Heads of states of important countries stood by him and Netaji lit the fire of the freedom struggle beyond India’s shores. He built a force and presented that force before the enemies of the country as the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army). He gave the slogan of “Dilli Chalo” with a new spirit. Thousands of soldiers of his 60,000-strong army sacrificed their lives for the country.“Success always stands on the pillar of failure.” Bose lived with this philosophy and also inspired others. Netaji encountered failures several times, but he converted those failures to triumph with his struggle. Whether it is municipal politics, the journey from a common Congressman to the Congress president’s position, the formation of the Forward Bloc or the struggle of the Indian National Army, he passed every test with distinction.Bose accepted the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, but ironically, Gandhiji himself became the cause of him leaving the Congress. But the two leaders always had respect for each other.At the time of India’s independence, Clement Attlee was the British Prime Minister. He came to Kolkata in 1956. At that time, his host, governor and former Calcutta high court chief justice PB Chakravartti, tried to find out from him the reason behind the British decision to grant freedom to India. In response, Attlee said that the loyalty of the Indian army and navy to the British state was declining due to the increasing military activities of Bose’s Azad Hind Fauj. This was one of the major reasons. This acknowledgement proves the great contribution of Bose to India’s independence. It finds a mention in a letter written to the publisher by Justice Chakravartti in the book “A History of Bengal” by RC Majumdar.Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh had a major contribution in the life of Netaji. The banks of the Narmada transformed his life. The Tripuri Congress session was held from March 4-11, 1939 in Jabalpur. Despite poor health, Netaji had arrived on a stretcher to participate in it. Thereafter, he came again to Jabalpur on July 4, 1939 to form the Forward Bloc. The people of Madhya Pradesh have a deep relationship with Netaji. In every town of the state, there’s a ward in his name. Subhas Chandra Bose’s message to his colleagues was: “Success may be distant, but it is imperative”. Bose used to say, “If a person is not obsessed, he can never become great. But he should also have something else inside him.” Bose is credited with giving global identity to the Indian leadership. Earlier, Swami Vivekananda had enlightened the world about India’s spiritual and cultural superiority and identity.Netaji was also fluent in many Indian languages. Bose’s struggle for freedom proved to be an inspiration not just for India, but also for all Third World countries. The Indian freedom struggle and the war of independence led by Bose had a profound impact on those countries. Netaji’s status establishes him as the “hero of freedom” globally.The writer is minister of state (Independent Charge), ministry of Culture and Tourism||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/netaji-subhas-chandra-bose-champion-of-freedom-who-inspired-the-world-101611363711511.html
